A branch of ISIS called Islamic State-Khorasan or ISIS-K claimed responsibility. Russian authorities have said suspects directly involved in the rampage were arrested near the border of Ukraine.So what can we make of all of this? And is Putin laying the groundwork to blame Ukraine? I want to bring in Daniel Byman. Daniel is the director of Georgetown's Security Studies Program and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Dan, welcome. I want to ask you first why Russia or why is ISIS hitting Russia? Is this payback for Russia's consistent and fairly brutal support for the Syrian regime during that civil war between Assad and ISIS in some sense? DANIEL BYMAN, DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN'S SECURITY STUDIES PROGRAM: Russia has been at the top or near the top of the list of ISIS for many years. You want to go way back in history, whether it's the anti- Soviet struggle in the '80s or the Chechen civil war in the '90s and early 2000s. The jihadist movement has been very focused on Russia. ISIS itself saw Russia as one of its top enemies because it really was a game changer in the Syrian civil war, backing the Syrian government against ISIS and like-minded groups. And ISIS-K itself has also emphasized Russia as a threat, using that to criticize the Taliban, its enemy, by saying that the Taliban have been too close to Russia. And finally, ISIS-K has a lot of Central Asians and people from the Caucasus in its ranks. And that gives it a lot of potential to attack Russia.",

Despite that, at least some Russians are likely to believe it. They're inundated with regime propaganda. Their ability to access other information is limited or at times even twisted.

This is the latest in an increasingly public rift between the two allies, which came to the fore last week when the senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said Netanyahu had lost his way and urged Israelis to replace him.Meanwhile, in Gaza, the humanitarian situation worsens by the day, with the U.N. warning that famine in the north is imminent. So what is the best way forward? Bret Stephens is a columnist at \"The New York Times\" and a former editor-in-chief of the \"Jerusalem Post.\" Daniel Kurtzer is a former U.S. ambassador to both Israel and Egypt. He's now a professor of Middle East Policy Studies at Princeton. Welcome both. Ambassador, let me start with you by asking how serious is this rift? The U.S. is now sponsoring a resolution far from vetoing resolutions, calling for ceasefire. It is now sponsoring them. Peter Beinart in \"The New York Times\" says this is a kind of existential moment of watershed for the gap between Zionism and liberalism developing. How do you see it? DANIEL KURTZER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: I think we're heading towards a much more serious crisis, but there's still time to avert it. Netanyahu and Biden have agreed that a delegation of Israeli senior officials will visit Washington this week to try to narrow those differences. The real issue is how much of an offensive Israel conducts in Rafah. I think we're of one mind that Israel needs to defeat Hamas. We're of one mind on the return of hostages. But we're quite concerned that a major offensive in Rafah will have severe humanitarian consequences.",

So, for instance, David Miliband was on some Christiana Amanpour's show and was describing how truck after truck get stopped from entering Rafah because humanitarian supplies might include surgical, scissors or needles and things like -- you need to cut umbilical cords and things like that. And if there's one such thing found the entire truck is turned back.You know, the U.N. says that something like a million people are close to famine conditions. Surely, you know, that stuff that the United States has been pressing the Israelis to change policy on but they are not. STEPHENS: Well, there are two points. The humanitarian crisis was caused and it continues to be caused by Hamas, and the way in which it fights behind between and beneath civilians. They bear responsibility for the crisis. About 150 trucks as far as I know, maybe more are going in every day because the Gaza Strip is really a very small territory. Relieving the crisis isn't the main issue. The biggest issue is achieving security for the trucks that do go in because you have a situation -- and this I do think falls on Israeli shoulders. You have a situation in which they haven't taken real control of the territory in which they are operating. So now armed gangs are looting those trucks. So, you know, David Petraeus has talked about the need for a kind of a hold and build strategy for the Israelis. The problem for Israel is they have largely demobilized the army so they do not have the numbers of troops they need in order to assure the security of those convoys.",

And I'm just wondering, on the two things with the thing we've been discussing and your solution related, which is given the scale of the Israeli invasion, given the devastation in Gaza, given the extraordinary opposition that has released in the Arab world, if you look at surveys, is it going to be easy to get Arabs to agree to, you know, kind of rolling on Israeli tanks or on the back of Israeli victories and govern the territory?

Something closer to Dubai than say two places like Yemen. The Israelis also have an interest because in the long term, Israel cannot afford to occupy Gaza indefinitely, can afford it in terms of the manpower it would require or the cost or the diplomatic pressure that would be brought on.So a future for Palestinian state may end up looking a lot like the United Arab Emirates, which is progressive, federated and living in peace with its neighbors.

What matters really is the character of the Palestinian state.Will it look like something like the UAE, a progressive, modern, forward-looking society, or is it going to be another outpost of Iranian power and look like Lebanon?

What is necessary however, is that the two sides see a long-term horizon in which they can live next door to each other in peace and security perhaps with a large wall and peacekeeping and all kinds of other interventionist security mechanisms.But the reality is by process of elimination, the only possible outcome of this conflict is two states. Frankly, over the past 25 years, we haven't made as much progress as we have wanted to, but we actually have made a lot of progress. The negotiations in 2008 with Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas actually came quite close on a number of issues. President Obama put forward a proposal in 2014, which was quite ambitious. So the reality is that if they ever can get back to negotiations, which won't happen immediately, they may find that they're closer to agreement than it seems that the current time. I agree with you, Fareed. The public mood in Israel is raw as we would understand quite well, trauma is still quite evident. The mood among the Palestinians, especially in Gaza, is quite raw. But given some time and the efforts of outside parties, the United States, Europe, the Arabs and others, we can start this pathway towards resuming a process leading to two states.",

And then in the '80s and '90s, China, India, all of Latin America, most of Africa, something like two and a half billion people suddenly joined the world economy.And the data shows this. You know, trade as a percent of GDP in 1913, just before World War I, which was considered the height of the borderless world, was 30 percent. It's now 60 percent, it's doubled. Or take the identity revolution that has taken place. Just take women's lib. You know, throughout human history, some group has been up, some group has been down, and, you know, the one has persecuted the other. But for all of recorded history, women were second-class citizens. And in the last 40 years, that has changed. That identity revolution is causing, you know, a backlash.
