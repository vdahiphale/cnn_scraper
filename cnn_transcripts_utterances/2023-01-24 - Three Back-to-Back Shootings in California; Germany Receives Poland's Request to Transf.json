Seven people were killed in Half Moon Bay south of San Francisco. The gunman attacking two plant nurseries. And in a wild twist, the arrest of the suspect all played out before TV cameras. Police apprehended the 67-year-old suspect within hours of the killing. He is believed to work at one of the locations that he attacked. Let's begin with Veronica Miracle in Half Moon Bay with the latest on this investigation.",

Deputies receiving a call of a shooting with multiple victims. And when they arrived at the first scene, they found four bodies and a fifth person critically injured, who is still in the hospital. Then a short distance away they found another three bodies, bringing the victim total to seven people killed by gunshot injuries. About two hours after that initial 9-1-1 call, a deputy discovered 67-year-old Chunli Zhao, in the parking lot where he was turning himself at a police substation. He was arrested and taken into custody relatively without incident. All of it happened right in front of news cameras because it happened at the police station. Police say they do not have a motive. They don't know why this happened. But they believe he worked at one of the locations where these shootings took place. They believe he acted alone and that there was no longer a threat to this community. Of course, people here are reeling and here is what the vice mayor had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.S. has now seen more mass shootings in 2023 than at this point in any year on record. According to the Gun Violence Archive, nearly 70 people have been killed and the number of victims is climbing nearly every day from the mass shootings that we're tracking. Joining me now for more on all of this is CNN senior law enforcement analyst Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI. Thanks for being here. So this is California's third mass shooting in just 48 hours. And in Half Moon Bay they have the suspect in custody. There is that wild video of him being apprehended before cameras. The sheriff's office has said that he is cooperating with investigators. How does that change things, when you're looking at these mass shootings in quick succession? What are they likely doing now since they do have this one suspect in custody?",

      "sentences": "Sure. So these two cases, as similar as they seem, close in time, kind of the descriptions of the perpetrators, there are some key differences here. And the principle one being, at Half Moon Bay, you have a live perpetrator suspect, who will be a defendant in a criminal action.Which means you need to be able to stage a successful prosecution of that individual. So the investigators are very carefully collecting evidence that will be used in a homicide trial likely that he will face in the future. So they have to be very careful about how they interact with him. It is great that he's cooperating. But he, of course, needs to be given advice of rights and see an attorney and be presented in court and officially charged. They're going to go and look through all of his residence, through anything that might contain a writing or evidence of planning, evidence of malice aforethought, which is what you need to prove in a murder case. So they'll be looking at his social media accounts, if he has any. They'll look at his electronics devices and any that might preserve evidence of this man's intent. We know what he did. We have the forensics at the scene. He's in custody. But we still need to prove a case in court. Very different, obviously in Monterey Park, where your subject is deceased.",

Or, you know, somebody who he's modeling his behavior after, another shooter. It is certainly possible. Excuse me. But until you get solid evidence like that, it is really just speculation and, quite frankly, not very helpful for us to speculate.

I should say that the charges are very serious. FBI agents are not allowed to travel overseas without reporting it. They're not allowed to meet with foreign officials without reporting it. They certainly are not allowed to take income from any source, other than the FBI, unless they've been approved for that. And the reasons are all of those things could raise this question of divided loyalty. And that is incredibly serious when your job is protecting the United States of America and our national security. So we need to get to the bottom of this.

So there is a lot to unpack.Patrick Crusius is accused of killing nearly 2 dozen people and injuring nearly 2 dozen others at a El Paso Walmart in 2019. This is considered to be one of the deadliest attacks against Latinos and specifically Mexican Americans in modern U.S. history. According to the federal indictment, he faces around 90 counts. And these are for hate crime and also for the use of a firearm to commit murder. Now he had pleaded not guilty to these charges. And here is where the timing becomes interesting because, last week, federal prosecutors made it known that they would not be seeking the death penalty. Now prosecutors are not explaining the reason why they made this decision. Well now, this week, what we're learning today from federal documents, court documents, is that Crusius now plans to plead guilty to the federal charges and that he will be back in court on February 8th. And the court has made it known that his motion will be accepted. Now this is on the federal charges. Now there is a separate state charge, separate case, separate charges. And on those charges, Kate, it is important to note that the district attorney from El Paso has already made it known that the death penalty will be sought. Kate.",

There are several issues to discuss. But first and foremost, what got Ticketmaster and Live Nation in the spotlight in before Congress right now is the Taylor Swift meltdown, the ticket meltdown. Customers waiting for hours, the site crashing, presale codes not working, fans upon fans not able to get tickets or left empty handed after they thought they had purchased tickets.

      "sentences": "Well, I might have a slightly different perspective. There were 3.5 billion attempts to get into the system. Ticketmaster sold $500 million worth of tickets in one day.What no one is paying attention to is that, when you have a run, you can't have a run on banks and the New York Stock Exchange has circuit breakers. If I was still there, I think there should be a mechanism when you get that kind of demand. The system has to shut off so that you could have a orderly distribution of tickets. And I think part of the problem is that, because of the emotion that is connected and the concert sale, no one wants to deal with the logic of this. You cannot satisfy -- first of all, there were fewer tickets to satisfy the demand. So that starts with problem one. Problem two is there is no system on the face of the Earth that is going to deal with 3.5 billion attempts in the first half hour or 45 minutes. Systems are going to blow up. But when you don't have the ability to shut them down and create an orderly market, that is a problem. And you have to look at this from the fact that she had not toured for a long time. Should all of the tickets have been put on sale at the same time? Which I don't think they should have done but it's my understanding that is what the actor (ph) wanted and Ticketmaster has to do what the acts and the promoters want and Ticketmaster becomes the fall guy for all of this.

They don't have the power.One of the things that gets lost in all of this, because of all the noise -- and I created the company so I'm pretty sure I understand the dynamic -- we created ourselves, to a certain extent, to be the fall guy. But the numbers of tickets that go on sale, when things go on sale, how many shows go on sale, when shows happen, those are all determined by the promoter and the artist and the venue.

Now one of the statements going into this hearing from Seat Geek on taking on Ticketmaster and Live Nation, let me read this to you, Fred. He said, \"Ticketmaster's outage, recovery time and continued lack of solution are the results of a monopoly's complacency.

And the truth of the matter is, when Ticketmaster was created, and as I said before, I'm aware of it because I did it. The fact of the matter is we created it to take the heat for everybody. And so you become what I call the scheduled whipping boy. But the truth underneath all of this is, when the perspective that you have to deal with in terms of how you do this is, anybody who is not sitting in Ticketmaster's position is, of course, they're going to complain.

You said it's a fiasco. Well, how many companies could take in $500 million in one day? The stock exchange companies can and the banks can and maybe Amazon can but most people can't process $500 million in one day. So what is unfortunate is this. It is the emotion that is attached in this process. And the emotion makes everything crazy. And think of this, why do people sit in the last 10 rows of an arena?
