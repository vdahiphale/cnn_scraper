And you're seeing behind me, that is Hamilton Hall, where police stormed in from many different vantage points, jumping through windows, with - in really a shock and awe to try to get to the protesters who had broken in and occupied the building.They occupied the building, throwing out sort of banners that read things like \"intifada\" and \"free Palestine.\" They have been on campus for the pro-Palestinian movement for two weeks now. Two weeks would be today. But they were removed. Dozens of people arrested. We are hearing now that they have - some of them have already been released from jail. But you're listening there to Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, and he says that he - that the - that this was a protest that had been, and this is his words, co-opted by outside influences. And he says that they were going to - they've been sounding the alarm that these protests were supposed to be peaceful, he said, but that they had been co-opted by outside influences and that he was going to show evidence that there were people who were not affiliated with Columbia University, who were part of this protests on campus. You will remember, this has been going on for a couple of weeks. You had an encampment that was outside, but on Columbia University campus, that had tents that were there. The university had wanted those tents to disperse. There had been discussions between the university and the student protests leaders that broke down at 2:00 on a Monday. And since then, then you had this incident overnight where you had people breaking in to the Hamilton Hall and police coming in the evening to get them. We also have protests that are happening across the country. And one of them got extremely violent last night. All of it captured on video. I want to go now to the UCLA campus in Los Angeles where our Stephanie Elam is, because now there is a large police presence who have shown up after the violence overnight. Stephanie, what can you tell us at this hour.",

You can even just tell by looking at the police officers that it's a different energy now. Things are much calmer here. They're quieter. There was chanting overnight.If you look at that video that was happening late last night, early into the early hours of this morning, you could see that there were skirmishes happening in different parts of this green area here on UCLA, on this area were, in front of us, you can see the pro-Israeli supporters have been, and then there's a barricade. Then there's a walkway where there was some hired security. And then on the other side of that is the Palestinian encampment. And what we saw in some of this video, we saw some change here where there was people who were going at the Palestinian encampment, pulling away the barricades. The security in the middle was trying to keep those barricades in place. We also know from some of the student reporters for \"The Daily Buren\" here, the student newspaper, saying that some of the reporters were actually assaulted and gassed during what was happening here last night. They're calling it, quote, dangerous and that they needed to get out of here. We do know that the mayor, Karen Bass, put out a statement last night than what she was seeing on the campus was abhorrent. The chancellor saying that what was happening here on campus was now unlawful. All of this setting the scene for somewhere around after 1:00 a.m. is when we started to see this big police presence arrive here on campus. When I got here, this barricade wasn't even here. We saw the law enforcement officers who were from different agencies locally, but from different agencies, coming up and making a line here and then pushing some of protesters out along that path over there, pushing them out, pushing them out, and then they slowly started to erect this barricade and then they pulled back. So, things are a lot calmer here. We saw some of the people out here for a while who were still playing music very loudly, still chanting, yelling, yelling at some people. And there were some people trying to keep people apart. Last night, as well as today. And now they've cleared out as we're getting closer to the sun coming up here. But it's still not clear at this point, Sara, what exactly transpired that forced these sides to clash overnight as they did here on the campus of UCLA. Very different than what we saw during the day yesterday for sure.",

But there have been no announcements. We heard some more chanting start up again from the encampment, but that's it. We haven't actually heard any loudspeaker announcements from law enforcement out here. They definitely made their presence known, but at the same time they seem to just use their physical presence to push people out. We didn't actually see them going after anyone from where we are standing here. We didn't see that happening. It was all more of a physical presence together, creating getting that wall and pushing people out.So, not the aggressive stance that we've seen in other times and other instances here on the campus of UCLA. So, still a lot of questions about when the decision for them to come on campus happened and how they decided to tactically interact with the people that are here.",

We heard that from a student as well, that they said that they were not getting help from the police once they were under attack.We will be watching this. I know you will be on campus. Thank you so much to you and your crew out there watching that for us. I do want to go to some pictures right now of the University of Wisconsin. There is a student protest there that is happening at this hour. And police have moved in. Police have moved in to clear out protesters on that university. You hear the chanting there and there is police activity going on, on that campus as we speak. So, at least two campuses where police have moved in to try and move out the protesters. And then, of course, overnight here at Columbia, that is exactly what happened on this campus. This would have been two weeks of the protests today that began with an encampment with tents outside that turned into two different places where students were occupying space. One was in the encampment with the tents and the other here at Hamilton Hall. Hamilton Hall with a long history of being occupied by students during protests. So, I think we are still looking at those pictures there in Wisconsin where you're seeing police and protesters come up against one another as police are trying to move protesters who were there for Palestinians and who are there to ask for a ceasefire and for their universities to divest from Israel, they are being moved out as we speak. So, that is the scene on university campuses. We are going to listen in here to what is going on there in Wisconsin as police activity is happening there right now. Let's listen.

And, you know, we should mention that, you know, here at Columbia and in some of these universities, Columbia told students that broke into Hamilton Hall that they would be expelled as opposed to suspended, which they suspended some of the protesters when the first police action happened here a couple of weeks ago.And you were seeing this all over campus. So another reason for some of the protesters using - trying to sort of obscure their faces is not wanting to face the consequences from the universities. That is a possibility as well. But we are seeing this across the United States and really here in Columbia because it's sort of the epicenter, which pushed this to the fore. And then you see students, you know, at UCLA, at USC. You saw students at UT Austin. You see students at Tulane. Now, this morning, we're seeing, you know, the havoc that is going on because SWAT teams, for example, at Tulane went in to remove student protesters there. Here, at Columbia University, we saw an incredible scene of shock and awe with dozens of police officers going into all different vantage points from the second story window, to the - to the door, and pulling out protesters who had broken into that hall as well. So, there is a lot of police activity going on, on college campuses right now. And this is all due to the war in Gaza. Basically the war has come home in the minds of these students and they want to see some action on the university. Now they are seeing police action instead. John, Kate.",

That was the most important thing so that the pool of people that may be - that you would have to arrest gets limited. So, we saw students first leave and then - and then the - the more limited arrest than we would have officially thought, and then the protection of the space. This has been a consistent theme of mine over the last two weeks. Protest is a natural part of college and university activity. They needed to provide outlets for students to protest this difficult issue. The ratcheting up that you've seen that I'm talking over right now -",

This is different than two weeks ago when you saw sort of at some of these schools that sort of automatic armed law enforcement approach with only one solution available, which was conflict. Police have been known and are trained, as we certainly know, for a de-escalation techniques. I hope and I think that's what you're seeing now. They - that not that they're casual. They are just trying to isolate and secure certain areas, make sure they don't bleed over to other areas. So that's the kind of use of law enforcement, basically time and manner enforcements, to ensure that two things. One, of course, that the community is protected. But, secondly, also we - you know, that the protesters are protected. It is - that is - that is part of what we need to do as well so that they're not harmed.And I think what I'm seeing now on air is basically just isolation of a limited area of protesters who seem to be willing to be arrested. If you break the law, you're - and you're willing to be arrested, that is the part of what the students perceive as civil disobedience. They're - they're not allowed to do unlawful things and then not face consequences. And most of them still, even though we've now still had these numerous hot spots, most of this still, at colleges and universities throughout the country, is still peaceful protest. And the goal is, I know this sounds counterintuitive, but the deployment of safety and security personnel actually can de-escalate these situations. It's the vulnerabilities that we are - and the openness that we have often seen that causes these kinds of conflicts. And so I - hopefully we can, you know, I've been saying this for two weeks, de-escalate, de-escalate, de-escalate. We know how to do this and we've seen it. I - we always talk about the bad examples, but I'm also looking at north - you know, Northwestern and Brown and Wesleyan and other schools that are engaging students, allowing them to protest, making sure that other students are safe and secure, having appropriate time and place restrictions, protecting graduation, which is key for all of us, and where that's not occurring to utilize law enforcement in a manner that is - that is tiered.

That operation did take place without incident, seemingly without injury as well.

As many as 8,000 last year. An increasing numbers since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Now, the closest states where people will be able to access abortion are North Carolina, where there's a 12 week limit, or even further north to Virginia beyond that.
