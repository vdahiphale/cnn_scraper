Somehow, though, 29 people, including 2 children survived that fiery crash. The Russian-bound flight was attempting to make an emergency landing in Kazakhstan when it went down, all of it caught on camera.In its preliminary report, Russia claimed a bird strike may have forced the emergency landing, but Ukrainian officials and others are pushing back on that this morning. CNN's Nada Bashir is joining us now from London. What are you hearing about the possible cause of this crash and the contention over whether it was a bird strike or something more sinister?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, Sara, the investigations into this crash are still very much ongoing. We know that the black box has been recovered. That will be, of course, crucial into piecing this puzzle together. But the Kazakh government has said that it has set up now a commission to carry out an investigation to examine the moments ahead of this crash and what may have led to this fatal crash. And, of course, as you mentioned, there have been some contending speculations around what may have led to the crash. We know, of course, that early on yesterday, Russian aviation authorities said that they believe that the pilot had been forced to attempt an emergency landing about two miles from the Kazakh city of Aktau in response to a bird strike.However, there has also been some speculation around nearby drone activity. We understand that the crash took place shortly after drone strikes in parts of Southern Russia. And we have also been hearing from one Ukrainian official, a member of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, Lieutenant Andriy Kovalenko, who has alleged that this may have been caused by Russian air defense systems. Now, of course, crucial to underscore here that this is one allegation from a Ukrainian official, this is not the confirmation of investigators. And we haven't had any response from Kazakh investigators just yet with regards to these allegations. We are still waiting for more clarification and firmer details. But, of course, we have seen that dramatic video emerging showing the plane, first of all, circling the airfield ahead of the crash, and then of course, crashing into the ground and bursting into flames. And it is Remarkable that 29 of the 67 people on board that flight actually survived. We've seen that video emerging showing some of those passengers emerging from the wreckage, many of them, of course, injured. Among those survivors were 2 children and authorities say that at least 11 of those survivors are still in a critical condition, all, of course, receiving medical attention in a hospital there. So, clearly still a moment of pause for family members in terms of the status of those survivors. This is, of course, a tragic Christmas Day incident for many of those, the dozens who were killed in this plane crash. But, again, that investigation into what exactly led to this fatal crash is still ongoing.",

They can tell exactly how much hydraulic fluid was in. And that's what we would look for in this type of -- if it were a missile attack. That's what you would look for is these small pieces of shrapnel that go through the control systems.And judging by the flight characteristics of the aircraft after this period of time that it tried to fly for 20 minutes, you can see it wasn't just an up and down thing, which you would see with a bird strike. If the power had come off the aircraft, it might be able to climb and fall in a straight pattern. But in this case, it went left, it went right, which would indicate to me that there was loss of flight control systems, which would indicate that whatever it was that caused this would have affected the hydraulics and the controllability of the aircraft.",

And, again, we stay with the idea that when an aircraft impacts in the angle that it did, which was nose down, that all of the energy, most of that energy is absorbed and like a crumple zone on a vehicle, it absorbs that energy and then the tail section broke loose and that tail section as it flew through.And you can see in some of the videos just how far that tail section is from the initial impact zone. And that is the reason that they were able to survive. The impact wasn't felt the same at that point because it had all been absorbed forward at the wings. And so that tail section continued to tumble. They were secured into it. And some just walked away with minor cuts and bruises. So, it truly is a miracle.",

They have to be very careful about what they listen to and what they hear on these, because it can -- the witnesses that I've interviewed that have survived accidents are not very accurate. They're very different between what happened. And so it can be helpful, but it can also hurt an investigation because you think you hear something about whatever, and they say this event happened before that event, before this event, and it's rarely very accurate.But there are occasions when it's helpful. But for the most part, they were through a very traumatic event that they'll carry with them the rest of their lives. And to try to remember it in proper sequence is almost impossible for a human being to try to conceive of that and then tell back what happened to it. So, those are very difficult interviews to have but they do have to be looked at and listened to in a critical view.",

These are the things that are verifiable. And there can be thousands of them. To get into the, the facts. data and where it comes from, each piece of data that we have has to be validated and verified. And especially in these situations, we talked about how the witnesses that were on the aircraft can be unreliable, well, so can information from outside the critical source.So, that's what investigators have to do is stay focused on that. Don't let the outside world tell you what they think happened. And their opinion, their opinion, they weren't there. Who was there? What happened to the aircraft?

We've got rain and snow from Seattle down towards Portland. You could see some lightning strikes too, even getting on shore northern California and Oregon, as we have an atmospheric river taking shape, series of storms will roll through as we go through the week.Here's a look at all the winter alerts. We've got warnings in effect because we can get up to a foot or more of snow in some of those highest elevations. That will also come with some wind gusts up to 60 miles per hour. So, blowing snow a concern again in the highest mountain peaks. You can see the rain and snow as we go through the day today, another round going into tonight and tomorrow morning as we just keep this active pattern pumping multiple storms on the West Coast. We're looking at some two to four inches of rain. And, again, the snow totals you could see in some of the highest peaks here could top a foot, adding to that snow depth that we've had so far this year. So, this is where we've got problem spots today. You can see some delays likely in Seattle, Portland and even some San Francisco. Then we also have this storm that will blow up in the south as well as we go through the day today. We're looking at a line of strong and severe storms possible, some delays likely from Dallas to Houston, and then even some airports in Louisiana. We have a level two out of five severe risk for some damaging winds, large hail and a couple of tornadoes as we get moisture to pump into this storm and could create some thunderstorms that could grow tall and again even spin. So, look at the travel delays across the south from that storm today could be moderate to major. Again, the Pacific Northwest are problem spot today. As we go into tomorrow, all of these storms starts to shift their weight east. And then as we go into the weekend, we're looking at some problems across the southeast and then eventually all the way up the East Coast because these storms will just continue like train cars to keep moving across the country, looking at some minor delays possible on Sunday from Atlanta up through D.C., New York and Boston. Notice, again, the Pacific Northwest problems pretty much every day through the rest of the holiday week. So, we'll have some problems possible across the south, Dallas, New Orleans, there's all those problem spots from Seattle down towards Portland. Things start to shift east going into Friday. Nashville could have some problems with some rain going into Friday and then it works its way to some of these major airports up and down the East Coast, Nashville, Atlanta by Saturday and then stretching up towards D.C., New York and Boston as we start to bring some of that rain up the East Coast as we go through the rest of the weekend. Rain totals could be locally heavy at times, some two to four inches possible up and down the eastern seaboard. Sara?",

Well, Kate, President Biden is going to be capping off a career in political service of more than five decades with a heavy dose of travel and a series of legacy-capping speeches, continuing what he's already put in the works with a major speech on the economy just a few weeks ago.As you mentioned, he is departing for the Virgin Islands today for a final family vacation, as the Bidens have done for many years. He'll be spending New Year's in Wilmington, Delaware, and then he will be doing much travel in the final weeks in office to try to cement his legacy and his policy achievements. He will also be taking one more international trip that was just announced. He will be traveling to Rome for a second visit with Pope Francis. It's a consequential visit, considering the fact that Biden's policy positions have often put him at odds with the church. In 2021, ahead of a G20 meeting in Rome, President Biden met with the pope back then and accepted communion from the pope, which was seen as a big deal, because previously there had been questions about whether Biden's position on abortion in particular would disqualify him. So, there's going to be a lot of focus on that visit, which is seen as sort of a capstone for Biden himself. And then when it comes to policy, there's a recognition here at the White House that anything they try to do on policy in these final days is likely to be overturned by the incoming administration, which is already crafting plans to do much of that. So, on the policy front, we are not expecting much in the way of new news, more of an effort to try to highlight what Biden has already done up until this point. Traditionally, Kate, as you know, presidents often hold press conferences to field questions from the press on what they see as their achievements, what they see as some of their pitfalls. But as of right now, there is no indication that Biden plans to hold one. Kate?",
