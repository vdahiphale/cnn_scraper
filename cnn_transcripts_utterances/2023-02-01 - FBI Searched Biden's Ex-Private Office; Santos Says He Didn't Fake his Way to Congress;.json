Because, Poppy, here's what we've learned about this, quote, search from our reporting. It was less of a search and more of a visit to an empty office. It was a standard step that you would take anytime classified materials are uncovered. This happened a few days after the Justice Department first learned about these documents. They went with the permission of Biden attorneys to this office. But we've learned that all the documents by that point had been handed over to The Archives. So it was a largely empty office with just some furniture.But, again, we are told by former Justice Department officials, this is a standard thing that you do to just assess the location and make sure there aren't any other documents or any other problems that would complicate this. And we know, a few days later, the attorney general asked a U.S. attorney to conduct a review and decide if a special counsel should be appointed, and he said, yes, absolutely they need a special counsel.

The problem is, they're really low in nutritional value. Many of them are loaded with additives, fat, salt, and sugar. And we -- they make up a huge part of the American diet. Almost 50 percent of our calories come from ultra-processed foods. So, it's everywhere.And there is an association with them and things like type II diabetes and obesity. But where there wasn't a definitive link necessarily was with cancer. We know that cancer is responsible for one in six deaths worldwide. And 50 percent of cancers are preventable. So, diet could really be a modifiable risk factor. So, ultra-processed foods in this study, researchers wanted to see the association with 34 different types of cancers. So they took 200,000 individuals in England. They were average age 58. They gave them food questionnaires over several years. And then they followed them for ten years. And what they found was that there -- for every 10 percent increase in the amount of ultra-processed food in their diet, they did see a 2 percent increase in overall cancer incidents, a 19 percent increase in ovarian cancer incidents. And then when they looked at mortality or dying from cancer, there was also a 6 percent increase overall in dying, a 30 percent increase in dying from ovarian cancer, and a 16 percent increase in dying from breast cancer.",
