This is nothing of the sort. It's a natural replacement that comes because of an ill nominee. So to me, this is ridiculous. It's illogical. If you remove one of the two full-time jobs that Joe Biden has, the second one being running for president, he can spend his remaining energy and time and focus on fulfilling his duties as president for the last six months, which is exactly what he's said he wants to do. So this is an attempt to blow blue smoke and adjust the mirrors so that they can get back to being on the offensive. But I think to most people, it almost seems cruel.

We saw that with an I-95 infrastructure collapse, the way that he handled that crisis was majestic. It was just done so well. He had a live stream going and it became a national model for how to deal with crises like that.I think he's the frontrunner right now. I think he would be a superb choice given the fact that Pennsylvania is so important. The blue wall consists of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And so we need to do everything we can to make sure that the path to the White House continues to be blue, continues to run through the rust belt. And Josh Shapiro is key to that.",

So this is someone who's a sexual predator. He appointed a third of the Supreme Court. We're not just electing a president. We're choosing what the makeup of the Supreme Court is going to look like. And I think Vice President Harris is going to continue to make that case. Now this is no joke. It's not just reproductive rights, though. It's everything that's been laid out in Project 2025. The fact that he's going to punish critics, that he's going to imprison his enemies. This is just not okay. It completely undermines everything that we hold dear.",

I was able to raise a million dollars in the past five hours for the Harris campaign. This is remarkable. It's never happened to me before. I am stunned. I've been raising money for candidates for years, but it's always been a pulling teeth kind of situation. I've always had to convince people to invest in the campaign, but people were just forking it over. They so much believe in her vision. They so much don't want to have another Trump term. And they're finally relieved and they're overjoyed to have someone who can effectively prosecute the case against an eminently weak candidate. Trump is a weak candidate. What happened last weekend was heinous and unforgivable. His assassination attempt was unconscionable. Full stop, end of story, but it doesn't erase the fact that he faced 88 criminal charges, four indictments, two impeachments, and a guilty verdict.",

Now, day two, I think that there are signs of progress that world leaders will cling to, including her ability to raise millions of dollars in just the first few hours, her ability to secure the delegates and able to secure the ticket as well. But this is definitely a moment of wait-and-see for many world leaders who've just seen this rollercoaster of an election play out. Nobody's counting their eggs until they hatch. But you know the key issues, Rosemary. You have, of course, the Israel-Gaza conflict that was key for President Biden. He will continue to work on that. We know, of course, Prime Minister Netanyahu is in Washington this week. I know you had an update on that earlier, but also Kamala Harris will be meeting with Netanyahu herself later this week. That's very crucial to begin to build that relationship, to begin to build her negotiating position. She's not going to attend Netanyahu's speech, so that is significant to see that that's where she stands for now. But there's a huge foreign agenda as well from Ukraine. There will be considerations as to how she will speak on that issue as well. Many, including President Zelenskyy, were concerned that Trump's America First policy essentially meant pulling back support from Ukraine. There may be some hope, some optimism that if Harris wins, that continued support could pour in for President Zelenskyy. But she is, Rosemary, by and large an unknown commodity on the international stage. So there's a lot of question marks as to how she will handle issues, but she is that steady pair of hands that many hope will continue Biden policies. I'll leave you with a comment from German Chancellor Olaf Schultz, who called her experienced and competent. Rosemary.",
