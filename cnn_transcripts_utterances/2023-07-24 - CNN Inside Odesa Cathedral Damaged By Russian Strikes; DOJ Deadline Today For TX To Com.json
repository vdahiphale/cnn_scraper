Also this morning, Ukraine says that it is behind a drone attack in Moscow that blew out the windows on the top of a skyscraper. Those attacks come after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed retaliation for a weekend of relentless strikes by Russian forces. Those are the pictures that you have been looking at the ones in Odesa including damage to an historic cathedral there. CNN's Alex Marquardt reports from the scene.",

And now Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Directorate claiming responsibility for that overnight drone strike in Moscow, which did do less damage, far less damage than we've seen here in Odesa for the past few days.We are in the Transfiguration Cathedral. Church officials have asked us to put these helmets on because of all the work that's going on, all the debris that is falling from the roof. I want to show you this corner of the church. This is where there is the most destruction. This is where we are told that the missile or rocket came plunging through the roof going down at least two stories that daylight, that sun coming through the roof, and really brightening up this otherwise dark cathedral. Over here is the altar. You can see up there those pillars now off to the side, that altar just leaning over. And it really only staying upright because it's leaning up against the wall. And then farther up is the beautiful dome of this cathedral. All of its windows have been blown out. Below that the frescoes have also been knocked down. We've seen large sections of the roof also coming down as these workers seek to clear it. They say that will take several weeks, but it could be months or years before this cathedral is fully repaired. The nave goes all the way back there. And in the corner, there was a fire. We're told that a shockwave started an electrical fire. Now this church was destroyed in 1936 when Stalin was in power. It was rebuilt when Ukraine got independence and now of course in a significant state of disrepair. It is attacks like these on civilian infrastructure on buildings that frankly have nothing to do with this conflict that now has President Zelenskyy calling for more air defense support from Western allies for what he calls a full-fledged air shield for Ukraine.

And so, St. Petersburg is a place where Putin brought his absolutely closest ally, Lukashenko, the only leader who has absolutely supported Putin every stretch of the way except for sending his own troops into Ukraine.And so the two of them went to this place called Kronstadt, which is a naval base that has this really important history. And every Russian is taught about this history in school. And in 1921, sorry to take you back into history, but Putin is really into history. In 1921, right after the Russian Revolution, sailors revolted there, challenged the Bolshevik regime, even though they supported the revolution, and they were crushed by none other than Leon Trotsky. So, Putin and Lukashenko had a nice walk around this now museum area. And we're celebrating the crushing of this rebellion. And I think it's really part of what Putin is doing to show he is in charge, Prigozhin even though he's in Belarus is under the thumb of both of them and he's trying to, you know, reduce the threat that Prigozhin and his idea of challenging central authority started.

He's countering the threats made by the Justice Department that they would file legal action against the state. And he goes on to say in the meantime, Texas will fully utilize its constitutional authority to deal with the crisis you have caused referring to President Biden, Texas will see you in court, Mr. President.This a quote from this letter that was sent to President Biden, we're getting this right now. Now, because of this response, it is now up to the Justice Department. The ball is in their court. And the President, I'm sorry, the Justice Department has said in their letter on Thursday, that if Texas did not remove the floating barriers, they too were ready to go to court. So just based on this letter to President Biden based off what we know of the stance by the Justice Department, it does appear that the two will be going to court over this matter. Of course, at the center of the matter is those floating barriers in the Rio Grande, the Justice Department telling Texas, they did not have the authorization to set those up and saying that they cause humanitarian concern, safety concern for migrants, for agents and also may interfere with the federal government response along the border. Now the White House has also condemned these actions saying in a statement just last week, quote Governor Abbott's dangerous and unlawful actions are undermining our effective border enforcement plan and making it hard for CBP to do their jobs of securing the border. Going on to say, the governor's actions are cruel, and putting both migrants and border agents in danger. John, big picture here, this is an escalation of the ongoing feud between President Joe Biden and Texas Governor Greg Abbott over a very delicate political issue, that being the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border, will now see both sides potentially fight this out in court over who has what authority and how the Texas wants the administration to enforce its federal immigration law and the Justice Department countering that saying it is up to them to enforce immigration law.",

Again, that's the reason why there's so much criticism about the humanity of this and the humanitarian concerns because imagine you're walking in the water sometimes in the dark, and you're walking on concertina wire.

To remind you, this legislation what it does is it would strip the Supreme Court's ability of stopping government actions that they deem unreasonable. There's no constitution in Israel. So a lot of things are based off of law and previous decisions by the Supreme Court. But the Supreme Court is also the only check on power on government power, because of the way the parliamentary and the executive system is set up here. So for many of these protesters, they really fear what this means. They fear this means better government power for the government to do whatever it pleases. They fear what this means for, like, for rights here, for freedom of speech, for freedom of religion and the like.But these protesters here, they're angry, they're disappointed but they also say that they're not going home. One of their chances we will not give up. We will not give up until it gets better. We've heard the speakers behind me on the stage. We are just right outside Supreme Court, where protesters have been milling about now for hours. They're calling on people to stay in the streets to continue protesting. We are seeing protesters taking to the highway around Jerusalem. We know that Israeli police have used what's called skunk water, this is foul smelling water, and I can tell you that I am getting walks away right now. It does not smell very good. We also know that protests are taking to the streets of Tel Aviv and they say that they will continue to be coming out. Now that vote was 64 to zero. And the reason it was zero is that with all the opposition lawmakers walked off the floor. We are seeing now the results of this. And the stock market is falling a bit. The major -- the biggest labor unit here is threatening to strike. And now there's a question of all those Israeli military reservists who said that they will not serve if this legislation passes. Now the question will be will they be arrested for refusing to serve and also what will happen if another major conflict breaks out and they don't get into those fighter jets or get into those tanks.
