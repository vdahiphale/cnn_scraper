Two witnesses say Aysenur Eygi was shot in the head by Israeli forces responding to a protest on Friday. The governor of Nablus tells CNN that an autopsy confirms that Eygi was killed by an Israeli sniper's bullet. Now, CNN can't independently verify the autopsy results.

They've called for an independent investigation, saying that the investigation that Israel says it's carrying out, and which the United States has asked Israel to carry out, would not be sufficient.As you noted, the governor of Nablus has said that an autopsy found that killing of Eygi occurred due to a sniper's bullet to the head. And as you say, we can't independently confirm that. There's also been comment from the Turkish president, President Erdogan, Eygi, although a U.S. citizen is of Turkish descent. So, Erdogan, whoever the last few weeks has been likening Israel's actions in Gaza to the Nazis, has decried and accused Israel of carrying out what he described as heinously murdering Eygi. Now, the IDF perhaps mindful of the debacle surrounding the killing of Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh just over two years ago, has taken a somewhat cautious approach in its response. It has said that the IDF responded with fire towards a main instigator of violent activity who hurled rocks at the forces and posed a threat to them. I should note that the International Solidarity organization that that Eygi was volunteering for has denied that any of their activists were hurling stones or rocks at forces. The IDF adding that it is looking into reports that a foreign national was killed as a result of shots fired in the area. So, for now, Israel, neither accepting responsibility nor denying that it was responsible for Eygi's death, as I say, perhaps mindful of what happened in May 2022 when initially it denied that it was responsible for the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh before eventually backtracking and accepting responsibility. Initially, blamed Palestinian militants for her death. So, for now, the IDF being cautious. And we would expect that position to be clarified over the coming days. Kim.",

The program, of course, came to a sudden halt during the pandemic and never really recovered even after COVID. But still, this marks a major change to a policy that has seen more than 160,000 Chinese children being adopted all over the world since the early 1990s. About half of them going to the United States.But remember, this program began when China was dealing with an overpopulation problem. The government very much enforcing its draconian one child policy that basically limited most couples in cities to one child, forcing many families to abandon children, especially girls and disabled kids. Now, fast forward to today, they're dealing with the opposite problem, a shrinking labor force in a rapidly aging society. That's why, within the last decade, the authorities here have twice relaxed its one strict family planning policies, now allowing most couples to have up to three children. But none of that seems to have worked against this backdrop of a slowing economy and young people's changing attitudes towards marriage and parenthood. Now, the Chinese reaction to this policy change seemed to be mixed on social media, but those applauding this decision seem to be expressing a nationalistic sentiment, saying China is now rich and powerful enough to take care of its own abandoned children, and often citing rising tensions between China and the United States and other western nations as well. But none of this economic, social, and political realities, of course, offer any real comfort to the hundreds of international families in the middle of adopting children from China, because the government here has reportedly indicated this ban goes into effect immediately, with very limited exceptions, leaving hundreds of Americans in limbo and potentially heartbroken.
