This hour, the combative cross examination of Michael Cohen as Donald Trump's legal team picks apart his testimony in the New York City hush money cover up case. Who will the defense call, if anyone, will Trump himself take the stand? The former president has evolved on that question.Plus, Israel's deadly strikes in Gaza. Local hospitals reporting at least 40 people killed. Israel says they were targeting a Hamas war room embedded in Gaza. Hear what witnesses told CNN about the attack. And a reversal from President Biden announcing new tariffs on Chinese goods. But didn't he knock Trump for that when he was candidate Biden? We'll roll the tape. Let's start the hour with the hush money cover up case, though. CNN's Paula Reid is at the court in Manhattan. Paula, today the defense got its first crack at questioning Michael Cohen and they came out swinging.",

Under this intense questioning from Todd Blanche, Cohen was painted as someone who was, quote, \"obsessed with Trump.\" The defense attorneys brought up the fact that prosecutors have asked Cohen multiple times to stop talking about this case and he would not. They also laid out how he has profited from his relentless attacks on the defendant, including millions of dollars that he has received for his book deals.Now for his part, Cohen copped too much of this appeared pretty steady on the stand, though, as I'm sure you saw, Todd Blanche was really jumping around a lot to a lot of different lines of questioning. I'm told this was tactical. His, Cohen's year long preparation with prosecutors was for a linear, chronological direct examination. He appeared quite comfortable there. But here, defense attorneys trying to knock him off his game. Now, tomorrow there's no court. And, Jake, the last time the Trump defense team had a break between their cross examination, it was Stormy Daniels. And they came back on Thursday with a lot of new material after working long hours to continue to prepare and also after getting some feedback from their clients. So Thursday should be wild.",

Also give him a bonus and pay him back for some other money that Trump owed him.Now, he also testified to a meeting between Trump, Allen Weisselberg, the former Trump Organization CFO, is currently in Rikers and himself where they agreed to this alleged conspiracy.

And at one point saying that he was even upset that Michael Cohen was entertaining, trying to go to another attorney.What's clear from that testimony to me is that you can argue consciousness of guilt on the part of Donald Trump, that you're pushing this attorney as a joint defense agreement to be able to cover yourself and make sure that this attorney is looking out for the best interest of Donald Trump and not that of Michael Cohen. I have to say this. I think because Michael Coleman was a former attorney, was an attorney at the time, that he was able to see through the BS and see that he was being used. And part of this is what hurt his feelings and actually woke him up to see that he's no longer part of that cult and that he needs to be looking out for his own best interests.",

The EU has its own investigation into tariffs on electric vehicles with a July deadline, and they really want Europe to join them in this fight. But today, two of the leaders from the more auto heavy countries cast some doubt on that.In a joint appearance, Sweden's prime minister said this when asked if Sweden and Germany would be putting tariffs on EV's, he said, \"It is fundamentally a bad idea to dismantle global trade. A wider trade war where we block each other's products is not the way to go for industrial nations such as Germany and Sweden.\" But of course here at home, it also helps set the political agenda going into the election and helps Biden keep pace with Trump politically. Trump, you may remember, has proposed increasing tariffs on all goods from China to 60 percent.

Look, the fact of the matter is voters have been telling us inflation is their top issue and what the numbers that came out today back it up. And instead the administration leads today with tariffs. But the headline of it is quadrupling tariffs on electric vehicles.And while at the same time the president's going to have to go into Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And by the way, where he's probably going to have to run the table looking at the sunbelt numbers of late. And instead his EPA has regulated and demanded that they're going to phase out gas powered vehicles over the next several years and mandate electric vehicles in its place. That's a real tough sell in those states. And leaving today on tariffs in support of electric vehicles is only another needle in their eyes.",

A study finds last summer was the hottest summer in at least 2,000 years for planet Earth, going back to the year 246, when the Roman Empire ruled Europe and the Mayans controlled Central America. This warming is obviously creating dangerous extremes.In Canada, wildfires are scorching tens of thousands of acres, creating air quality warnings once again. In the U.S., where we are apparently downwind, elsewhere in the U.S., more than 200 tornadoes so far in just the month of May, many leaving paths of death and destruction. There are also floods, destroying hundreds of lives all over the world, from Afghanistan to Indonesia, where there's also an active volcano, by the way, to Brazil and Argentina. All this week, just this week, CNN's Bill Weir is here to explain what is going on. So, Bill, what is going on? Let's start with the fires in Canada. There are a number of new ones burning, but also zombie fires still smoldering from 2023?",

These are zombie or holdover fires, Jake, where they are not fully extinguished over the winter, not enough snowpack to snuff them out, or they sort of smolder there underground in these boreal forests. And then comes summer, then comes warm winds, then comes dry fuel. Then you can see those fires rekindle again over 100 going right now, three really big ones.Yesterday, the air quality index in Minneapolis, St. Paul was among the worst, 10 worst cities in the world. A little bit better today. But this is something we may have to think about all summer, Jake, because as you've seen last year from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, you had folks breathing this stuff. And if -- as a reminder, the air quality index is a number from zero to 300, anything over 100 is dangerous for the elderly, for the young, for people with lung problems. Anything over 150 is dangerous for everybody. That's going to be the watchword this summer.",

As Ukraine waits for the billions of dollars' worth of American military aid that it took Congress six months to pass, Russia is pushing closer to the key Kharkiv region, using new positions and Ukraine's diminished defenses to strike residential apartment buildings.Earlier this year, Ukrainians in Kharkiv were relatively safe. In just the past few days, Ukrainian officials say more than 7,000 people have been forced to flee. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh just arrived in the region. He's on the ground in central Ukraine.

But it does look like weeks until they really start feeling the benefit of that long delayed $61 billion held up by a dysfunctional Republican Congress. That is the reason why the Russians are seeing success to the north of the second city in Ukraine, Kharkiv. This is essentially, you might call it a third invasion, a completely new prong of attack back into areas that Russia was kicked out of in the end of 2022.They're moving fast. They clearly have better resources, better ammunition, and clearly, too, the Ukrainians failed to build defenses there, but also don't have the artillery you'd normally rely upon to stop an invading force like this Russian movement here. They claim to have taken nine villages off the Ukrainians, and they're pushing towards an important one called Lyptsi, where if they got into that, well, they might be able to shell the second largest city, Kharkiv, intensely, taking the people there back to the dark days of 2022, where their daily life was interrupted by often random Russian shelling. So it is a definitely a stark moment here where, despite the very positive noises from Secretary Blinken in Kyiv. It's like playing guitar, they're almost sounding like he hadn't necessarily felt the severity of exactly what's happening north of Kharkiv. It's really a reflection on the ground of quite how slow that aid is being. We've seen morale deteriorate here over the past five or six months because that money was held up. Well, now we're seeing the Russians move over land because of that delay. Jake?",

What we're seeing actually in the north in Kharkiv is a bid to try and draw Ukraine's limited resources away from the Donetsk front lines and enable Russia to get gains in that Donetsk area where it's been moving pretty fast forward over the past months or so. Now they took Avdiivka, a key town there back in February, and they've since been edging forwards. And they've got some key parts of Ukraine's military infrastructure in that region in their sights, towns like Kramatorsk, Sloviansk, Pokrovsk. These are all essential to Ukraine's military operations there.And now the unthinkable is happening where the Russians are taking field after field, small, tiny villages you wouldn't know of, frankly, where maybe hundreds of people live before the war broke out. They're taking one after another after another. Ukrainians are struggling to hold their lines there. And that's really leaving this significant eastern front, fought over since 2014, deeply vulnerable to Russian strategic advances. The summer is ahead of them, yes, western weapons will start coming in the next month or so, but the Russians have momentum here and they spot a window of acute Ukrainian weakness and they're exploiting that.

Others remain trapped under slabs of concrete after an Israeli airstrike hit this residential building in the early hours of Tuesday while people were sleeping. This mother finds her son being carried away by rescue crews. She throws herself at his lifeless body. More than 100 displaced people were believed to be sheltering here in Nuseirat in central Gaza, entire families now entombed beneath the concrete debris. This man says, my children, girls and boys are under the rubble. My wife, my father, we were targeted while we slept. He continues his desperate search for his family. Another man calls out his brother's name. He says he was sheltering here with his wife and four children displaced for a fourth time, this time from Rafah. This woman says, my brother arrived from Rafah three days ago after being forcibly displaced. We don't know where he is. His wife, his five children, they didn't have any connections to anyone. This is how Gazans are forced to search for their loved ones, little equipment using their bare hands, against the constant backdrop of Israeli drones overhead. Another Israeli strike at a nearby unrest school caused a fire which engulfed the buildings. There, too, the displaced became the victims. U.N. staff collect human remains from the schoolyard. The daily search for a safety that does not exist continues as hundreds of thousands leave, Rafah moved on yet again by the Israeli military, some setting up tents in cleared areas, others returning to what's left of their homes. We are returning to our destroyed homes in Khan Yunis, this man says, where there's no shelter or basic necessities, no water or electricity or even a house to shelter in. For the residents of Gaza, it is a constant battle to find the next meal, clean water and a place to sleep, and a desperate hope to survive the night. Paula Hancocks, CNN, Abu Dhabi.
