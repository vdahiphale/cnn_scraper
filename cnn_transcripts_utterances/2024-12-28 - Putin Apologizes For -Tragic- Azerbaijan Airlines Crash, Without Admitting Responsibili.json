Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin is apologizing for what he calls a tragic incident following the crash of that Azerbaijani airliner that killed 38 people on Christmas Day. But the Kremlin leader is also stopping short of admitting responsibility for the disaster. This comes as the U.S. official tells CNN that Russian air defenses may have mistaken the commercial jet that crashed on Wednesday with the Ukrainian drone. Today, Putin admitted that Russia's air defense systems were active when that flight attempted to land in Chechnya on Wednesday. That's what the CNN's Nada Bashir who is covering this for us. Nada, what's the latest here? What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "That's right. Well this continues to be a key line of inquiry whether or not the plane was targeted by Russian anti-aircraft systems operating in the area. Now we've been hearing of course from Azerbaijani officials who confirmed yesterday that they believed that the plane had faced external, physical and technical interference. That was something that they were and investigators were looking at.But of course as you mentioned, we have today heard from the Russian President Vladimir Putin who spoke with his Azerbaijani counterpart and also expressed apologies and condolences for the fact that the plane had crashed and impacted and was facing troubles as it entered Russian airspace. Of course the plane was intended to travel to Grozny in the Russian region of Chechnya before it was diverted. It crashed in the Kazakh city of Aktau. And now, of course, as you mentioned, Putin stopped short of admitting any sort of responsibility for that but did acknowledge that Russian air defense systems were operating at the time. And of course we've been hearing from U.S. officials as well as weapons and aviation experts who have suggested that the holes and perforations that can be seen in the wreckage of the plane in the fuselage would suggest potentially shrapnel damage as a result of an explosion. So that would be something that investigators are looking at. Now the Kazakh government has set up a commission essentially tasked with carrying out this investigation. They will be looking at all the evidence at hand. We know of course that two black boxes have been recovered which will provide investigators with information regarding the flight data as well as potentially internal recordings from within the cockpit. And remarkably of course we do have first-hand accounts video recordings from some of those passengers who survived. At least 29 people survived that crash out of 67 people on board. Some are still said to be in a serious but stable condition. But we've been hearing from some of those survivors some of whom recorded those final moments, describing hearing a loud bang that the plane had been behaving unusually in the moments ahead of the crash. That passengers were sent up and down in their seats. So truly terrifying final moments for those passengers and for those who survived. The Kazakh government now issuing compensation both for survivors and the family members of the victims of this crash. But again, still a lot of questions as to what exactly led to that crash. There have been no final conclusions just yet. And authorities say it could take around two weeks to fully assess the data recorded in those black boxes. Rahel?",

A narrative that somewhat worked with incoming Trump officials that if NATO hadn't been encroaching, then Russia never would have had to invade Ukraine. But you've got another part of the Trump administration that thinks that Russia has been trying to put out this kind of disinformation for a while and that its aggression needs to be checked.

So Dr. Safiya is among those in the suspected line. He's still being questioned inside the Gaza Strip. But as I say this operation has now ended.

Millions under the threat for that severe weather and we have an ongoing tornado, observed tornado here just to the northwest of Houston.This is a tornado warned that is -- tornado warned storm that's moving to the northeast very rapidly and it's heading towards the woodlands. Now, we have millions of others across the south that are under the threat for severe weather. In fact, a level four out of five threat. There is the chance that we could see large destructive tornadoes here across the southeast. As we go later into tonight, that threat pushes to the east and eventually we see a more just severe thunderstorm threat across portions of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina as well. You can see the timing here. We continue to see very strong to severe thunderstorms again the potential for large hail as well as tornadoes that's going on through the lower Mississippi Valley through later this evening and then it turns into more of a linear fashion going into Alabama and Georgia. That's overnight. So we do have a prolonged period of strong to severe thunderstorms already seeing power outages beginning to mount. We've seen thousands of power outages here in the state of Texas. We're surely going to see more of that as we go through time. Now, you may be thinking to yourself, oh wow, why are we dealing with severe weather and tornadoes right now in the month of December? Well even though we typically deal with tornadoes in springtime, you also deal with them during the beginning of winter as well as fall. So we are kind of in the secondary peak of tornado season. In terms of delays -- in terms of your travel delays because many of you are heading home from Christmas, here's what we're dealing with. We do have the potential for seeing moderate -- minor to moderate delays here across the southeast. In fact, a major delay right now in Memphis. This is going to be where most of the delays will be confined today. But notice that we do have the threat for some travel delays across the northwest as well. Why is that? It's because we have a series of weather systems coming ashore across the Pacific Northwest leading to heavy rain, strong wind and yes, also snow. So a lot to track right now in terms of your weather and your travel delays. We'll continue to keep to -- keep you up to date as we go through the afternoon. Back to you.",
