      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. Good evening.We begin the hour with the Supreme Court declining for now to decide if Donald Trump is immune from federal prosecution for alleged crimes he committed in office. In a one-sentence unanimous order, the Supreme Court denied special counsel Jack Smith's request to fast track the ruling which will ultimately return the matter to the nine justices. The former president wasted no time looking to profit off the short- term delay asking for money from supporters in a fundraising e-mail. The Supreme Court decision punts the ruling back to the D.C. Circuit Court, which will hear oral arguments on January 9th. That might make the current March trial date for Trump's criminal election subversion case untenable, putting his entire 2024 legal calendar in question. So voters may not have a ruling on whether Donald Trump plotted to overturn the 2020 election until after they cast their ballots in 2024. We should note, if Trump wins a second term in the White House, he could and likely would try to pardon himself and then all federal criminal charges might not -- not ever see the light of day in a court of law. Let's discuss with Shan Wu, defense attorney and former federal prosecutor. Shan, great to see you. Happy holidays. Extra points for coming in on a holiday weekend, so we appreciate that. I guess, to some extent, that might be a little bit of a doomsday scenario to say, well, this election subversion case may not happen at all in 2024. But what do you think? What are the consequences of this Supreme Court decision that we heard? Is it just going to end up back in their laps in a couple months from now anyway? What do you think?",

      "sentences": "The scenario you painted isn't necessarily a doomsday scenario in terms of realism. I mean, that could easily happen if the D.C. rules. Trump asked to go en banc for the whole circuit to hear. And then he'll have something like 90 days to petition again the Supreme Court.So if he plays that right, obviously, it's a big problem in terms of that start date for the trial. From the Supreme Court's standpoint, though, Jim, I think it's kind of a win-win for them, which is they don't have to weight into this yet. And there could be legitimate reasons they would like to have the D.C. Circuit's analysis and ruling before they weigh in. So it is not really something you can ascribe a bad motive to. I mean, it makes sense from a jurisprudence standpoint for them to do that. It unquestionably causes timing problems. But honestly, Jack Smith was in that box right from the get go.",

I'm wondering how much -- I guess there is the Bush versus Gore 2000 election sort of hanging all over this.This current Supreme Court I suppose does not want to be perceived as meddling or getting involved in the election cycle.

Whichever way it comes out, they want to wait on that. From a policy standpoint, they like policy issues. Something that's a real policy issue to them, they will be aggressive and reach out for -- particularly this conservative majority.

I would add, Jim, on the federal cases he wouldn't have to venture into those waters. That could be a safety that he could order his Justice Department with a wink and a nod to just dismiss the federal cases and that would be a much easier solution to it, assuming they hadn't gone to trial. I mean, if he had gone to trial in something and got convicted, then he would pardon himself. These state cases are going on, but there certainly would be arguments, some sort of supremacy clause argument that they can't do this to him while he's the president. So, that's why it's so important for him to put everything in one basket of getting re-elected, because that could solve a lot of his problems.",

And he may just keep defaming them to get judgment after judgment. And the bankruptcy law theoretically doesn't shield him because it won't protect him from intentional or malicious acts. And this certainly seemed to fall squarely into that. Even if he can't protect himself with bankruptcy, though, there is still a simple question of how to extract the money from him. You have to make him disclose his accounts, and there could be consequences for refusing to do so. But when they find the money, then they'll try to get added. And there is a question of how much he has. It does raise the fascinating question of why he originally refused in discovery to disclose his accounts. This will be speculation.

But some people at the U.N. are saying there is no safe place in Gaza right now. In fact, 18 people were killed earlier in the day on Saturday in central Gaza, which is one of the areas that Israel will now be concentrating its military efforts. So, people, they need to relocate, can they go to the south? Is it safe there? And will there be military activity happening there as well? And, of course, the north where the IDF says it has essentially operational control at this stage, a huge portion of northern Gaza is now uninhabitable. Buildings are destroyed, some of them completely leveled by those hundreds of massive 2,000-pound bombs made in the United States that Israel deployed according to CNN analysis of satellite imagery using A.I. and the assistance of a think tank basically concluding that these bombs created such a massive area of destruction that it is going to take literally decades for these communities to recover. People, even when they are allowed to technically go home, they just want to have a home to go home to. I'd like to read for you a quote from Thomas White at the United Nations talking about this criticism of the Israeli Defense Forces for the fact that, yes, they do give advance notice when they're going to start engaging in these air strikes that killed upwards of 20,000 people now according to two different health ministries in Ramallah and Gaza. The Hamas controlled health ministry saying it surpassed 20,000 quite a bit. But this quote from Thomas White says essentially this: People in Gaza are people. They're not pieces on a checker board. Many have already been displaced several times. The Israeli army just orders people to move into areas where there are ongoing airstrikes. No place is safe, nowhere to go. But the IDF, Jim, would counter that argument and say that it is actually Hamas that is choosing to conceal itself beneath places where civilians are sheltering, knowing that there will be collateral damage, human shields is where Israel accused Hamas of doing, and they say the only way they can target the Hamas leadership, it does come at the cost of civilian lives. But the big question, Jim, how many civilians will it take? Thousands of children, thousands of innocent people, when will the killing of civilians stop and when will Israel be able to achieve its objective of taking out Hamas leader -- Jim. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This is the kind of policy that President Biden when he was on the campaign trail in 2020, was very critical of, and we're hearing now from lawmakers, some lawmakers and from immigrant rights groups that if he goes down this road, he could stand to lose support from some key allies in 2024 because they frankly are outraged that as they see it, the president would even consider basically trading away the rights of vulnerable asylum seekers to seek asylum in the United States in order to secure more funding and aid for Ukraine.",
