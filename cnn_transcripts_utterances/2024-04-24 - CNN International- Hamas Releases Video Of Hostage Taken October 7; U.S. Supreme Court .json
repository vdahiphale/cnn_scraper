I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York. We have been listening to U.S. President Joe Biden speaking, as he signs this nearly $95 billion foreign aid package to U.S. allies, including Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan. A few things he said after that bill received bipartisan support in the Senate yesterday, Tuesday night, a few things the President just said. He said when our allies are stronger, we are stronger. The path to my desk was a difficult one. Now, we need to move fast, and we are. He spoke about Ukraine. He spoke about Israel. And we're going to continue to follow this in just a moment. But, in the meantime, I want to turn to some breaking news just into CNN. Hamas has released a video of a hostage who was taken from Israel on October 7. It's the first proof that Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American, survived after being badly wounded that day. Video shows an injury to his left arm. There is no indication though of when it was recorded. I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who joins us now. Jeremy, bring us up to speed. As I said, this is breaking news just coming into us. What can you tell us about this video?",

I was told by an Israeli official that Hamas' last counterproposal was to offer less than half of the number of hostages that they were originally offering in these talks. For weeks, we have seen the basis of these negotiations, for months even, has been six weeks of a ceasefire in exchange for the release of 40 hostages being held by Hamas. They have that to less than 20 hostages in their latest counterproposal, according to my sources.And so, we've seen while these talks haven't broken down altogether, there certainly has been much less cause for optimism in recent weeks. And instead, what we have heard from Israeli officials is a movement towards increasing the military pressure on Hamas in order to secure the release of those hostages with a coming ground defensive in Rafah expected soon. Although we do not have a date, Israeli officials hope that that will help to ramp up the pressure on Hamas, and if not, will be a way for them, they hope, to be able to secure the release of hostages on the ground, although we've seen so far that very few of these military operations have actually been successful in securing the release of those hostages.",

And in fact, you mentioned the fact that Odessa, where I am right now, we're actually targeted last night by Russian drones and missiles. Well, right now, as we speak, we are actually once again under an air raid alert. So, that's going on right now. Obviously, the folks here fearing that something like that could happen again, and Odessa is one of those cities, Rahel, that gets targeted quite frequently.And I thought one of the other interesting things that President Biden said there in his speech is that Russia was now increasing the strikes on Ukrainian cities, and of course, also on Ukrainian energy infrastructure. That's certainly something that the folks here on the ground have felt very painfully over the past couple of weeks. And one of the things that Ukrainians have been saying is that they simply don't have enough air defense weapons, not only air defense systems, but also the missiles that they need to replenish in order to take Russian missiles down, and Russian drones as well. So, certainly for them, any help can't come soon enough. But, you're also right to say that President Biden did say that within the next couple of hours, some of this aid would get moving. I just looked at what the Pentagon put out at some of the aides that is going to be delivered to the Ukrainians, most of it is ammunition, and that certainly is something that will be music to the ears of the Ukrainians. You have HIMARS, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, munitions, which is key for the Ukrainians to strike Russians behind their lines. And then, of course, also artillery ammunition. That's something that we've been speaking about quite a lot, as we've been reporting here from Ukraine is that the Ukrainians have been suffering from what they essentially call artillery starvation, where they've seen Russian troops advance. They could target them, but they're not able to do so because they simply don't have enough ammo in their hands. So, it looks as though the Biden administration is going to send ammunition. We'll have to see how fast that's going to go, and how much of it there is going to be. But, the Ukrainians, for their part, have been saying that when it crosses the border, they are going to get it to the frontlines as fast as possible. That could happen within a day, really, to reach the frontline. So, the Ukrainians certainly will be quite happy to hear what President Biden said, of course, also a lot of rhetoric coming from the U.S. President, saying that the U.S. will continue to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Rahel.",

If we zoom in on this crucial area of the Eastern Front, things start to gradually change. The Russian advance begins. And then by the middle of February, Ukraine had had to withdraw from the town of Avdiivka, a town that had resisted for the best part of a decade. And the Russian advance didn't stop there.(VIDEO PLAYING) Well, if the red shaded area is Russian-occupied territory, you can see that by the end of March, Russia had taken a few more villages down here, tiny amounts of territory, but signaling an unstable frontline, and now the advance continues towards Ocheretyne up here and Novokalynove. Again, just villages, but critical higher ground, and more potential Russian progress. And it's not just there that Russia is attacking. Down in the south, it's fighting to regain villages like Robotyne that Ukraine took back last year. And Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv is under relentless attacks.

And here are some of the international headlines we're watching for you today.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in China. He is arriving in Shanghai for meetings with local officials and business leaders. Blinken then travels to Beijing with a message from the White House. The Secretary is expected to deliver a warning to Chinese officials about China's support for Russian weapons production in the war against Ukraine. A senior architect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine appeared in court Wednesday. Russia's state news agency said that Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov is detained on suspicion of bribery. He said that he is innocent, and he could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted in this high-profile alleged corruption case. People in Athens, Greece, have been dealing with a yellow-orange haze of dust, leading some meteorologists to say that it makes Athens look like a Mars colony. The dust flew in from the Sahara desert in Africa. And as we can see here, really blanketed parts of Greece. Authorities say that this can be risky for people with health problems. They say the dust will gradually decrease today. All right. We're turning now to one of our top stories. At the U.S. Supreme Court, justices are hearing arguments in a high-stakes abortion rights case that could affect women across the U.S. The court is considering whether hospitals have an obligation under federal law to provide abortions to women who are in medical emergencies. The Biden administration is challenging the state of Idaho's near-total abortion ban. The state does not allow an exception to protect the health of pregnant patients unless they could die if an abortion is not performed. For more now on the legal aspects of this case, I want to welcome in David Weinstein. He is a former State and Federal Prosecutor. David, good to see you. We were talking with our correspondent Jessica Schneider a little bit earlier, who follows the Supreme Court pretty closely, and she was saying that the arguments thus far have really been dominated by some of the more liberal-leaning justices, the questions thus far. Obviously, it's a conservative-leaning court. So, I'm curious what you have heard, and if you've gotten any sense based on the questions where this may go. I mean, what do you hear here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, it's not so much unexpected that the liberal-leaning side of the court would be propounding a majority of the questions today. Look, they're certainly trying to step back the decision that was made in Dobbs, and they're trying to focus the questioning here, and ultimately the decision on not what the procedure is that is being performed, but the health of the patient who is coming in for the procedure. That's the only way they're going to get around the prior rulings of the courts.And so, they're trying to question both sides regarding the health of the patient, and again, not necessarily the procedure. That's where their focus is going to have to be. Now, whether or not that's going to carry the day with the conservatives who will view this the same way they viewed all the other cases that it's not about the health. It's about the procedure. So, it's interesting to hear the questioning back and forth, and in some ways that's going to shape the decision. [11:35:00] SOLOMON: How we understood, typically, federal law trumps state law on a specific issue, but the issue is a little bit more, a lot more nuanced in this situation. Help us understand the nuances of this and why this is a case that is perfect for the Supreme Court to help interpret and provide some clarity for medical providers and people across the country.",

But, we've recently had a decision about federal law that says, no, now this decision is left to the states. So, they handed the ball back to the states on this one, which is why again they're focusing on what the procedure is. And so, here, the state is saying, look, we have a decision in Dobbs that says we're entitled to regulate this specific procedure.On the other hand, the government is now saying, that's fine. But, we have a policy in place and we have laws in place that govern how your emergency rooms operate, and what kind of medical treatment you have to provide to everyone who comes in, regardless of what the procedure is. And you have to take into account the health of the patient and you have to provide treatment, and that would include the argument that's being made, what the treatment could be if it's not necessarily life-threatening. So, that's why this is all sort of swirling around together, and why it's not going to be an easy decision for this court to make about which side is going to trump the other. We've had a lower court that agreed with the federal government already. But, that decision was put aside. And so, now, they're going to weigh in on this intersection, and it's not one that's plain and simple. It's rather complicated.",

If they uphold the Idaho law, then the arguments the government is making about, well, then funding will have to be withheld, that you cannot proceed forward with this procedure because of the restrictions of the state. It's going to cause people in that particular state and other states who have similar laws to now think twice about going to the emergency room, because the end result here is not necessarily that the procedure won't be performed. That's up to the doctor. But then, whether or not that doctor or emergency room people are going to then be prosecuted under a state law, which criminalizes the particular procedure they're performing.So, this is going to have implications, not only on individuals who are coming in for this procedure, but for people who are thinking about going to an emergency room and then the funding that's being tied to it. So, a lot of complicated matters being decided today in one simple case. SOLOMON: Any sense based on some of the past decisions, certainly Dobbs, obviously, we have another case in front of the court, the -- with sort of abortion medication, the pill, any sense of where you see this going?

On the pill itself, that one may be more difficult, especially in light of Dobbs.

But, for those of us who don't work in this industry, who are not as close to solving the problem, or the problem in and of itself, how can we deepen our conversations with one another about the issue? Because you talk about pluralistic ignorance, and that we misunderstand how much other people are genuinely concerned about climate change. WEIRfolks who just don't care or don't get the story. If the opposite is true, you're surrounded by allies you didn't know you have. And if you care about a planet in balance, most people just don't talk about it because of the way it has been sort of politicized. It's just this third rail thing that people don't want to talk about a drop off with their kids. But, there is a way to bring it up a drop off. When you say, you know, I just was reading about these electric school buses that are really cool, no fumes, and you can plug the classroom into them after dark, have we thought about our water supply? Do you read the headlines about what's happening in Detroit? Is our water safe? What's in our air locally? Is there a way for us to maybe run for the utility commission and have an influence locally about energy streams? It's just connecting with neighbors across the fence line about shared values and love for the hiking trail or the fishing hole or the cultural treasure you all know you want to protect. We're so isolated these days. We have the golden age of distraction and addiction and depression with our devices because we're disconnected from each other. And traveling the world, I get to meet some of the most amazing communities, and the ones that are strongest and healthiest and happiest are the most connected to each other and the nature around them.",

But, let me ask you, I know some authors, and certainly I watch a lot of authors as they promote their books, it's always -- it sounds like it's always such a laborious process. One author, a friend of mine, said it's like birthing a baby. One thing I've noticed about you when you're talking about the book, is you completely light up. I mean, talk to me about the experience of writing the book, and did it give you a deeper sense of hope and a deeper sense that, you know what, the planet will OK? Talk to me about that.",

But, it's just a whole different muscle set than when you write for television on a daily basis to write a long book. But, I'm glad it took longer, because enough happened in the world, enough happened in policies that I suddenly was talking to excited scientists and entrepreneurs, instead of people who are just depressed by the complete lack of public action around the topic.And it's both. You have to hold sort of hope and dread at the same time. It's like two sides of the same coin, like, oh, it's going to be tough, but we can do this. And good thing, you're tough, I'm telling my kids, and I'm going to give you the tools, all the tools I can find around the world to help you get through this. But, ultimately, we're just the stories. We are the product of the stories we tell each other, the ones we get excited about, the ones who we rally around. And our stories are always under revision. And my hope is that solving a climate crisis starts with a better story and how we communicate with each other about it. SOLOMON: Yeah. Well, it's obviously a story that is still unfolding. Bill Weir, it was -- it's such a joy to read the book. I'll tell you, I have certainly become smarter about the environment from reading it. And one takeaway I will tell you that I had, I told my fiance after reading this. I need to do some more adventures because I am living to safe life. Bill Weir is living his best life out here, and I need to be more adventurous.",
