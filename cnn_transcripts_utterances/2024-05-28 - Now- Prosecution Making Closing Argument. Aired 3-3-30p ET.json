And I am told by people close to Ivanka Trump that she is focusing on her kids. The part of the issue is that her kids are now of an age where they understand what's going on, that they maybe didn't understand what was going on when she was in the White House that what she got as vitriolic response to her time in the White House was much worse than she and Jared ever imagined, including ...",

This clearly was something that could play in the public and so now he's trying to undermine that and say, no, no, this was of enough concern as to incentivize the payment of funds to Stormy Daniels that were then later reimbursed and then falsified business records to cover up the campaign contribution.

It was not fully kept in the ordinary course of business maintained by a custodian of the actual organization, but instead personal in nature.And number two that he had every incentive and the motivation was for - to cover up to get an eye towards the campaign, but it had to be false. This is where it comes in about that - remember that compartmentalized categories, three or four categories were mentioned. One was legal services. Was it indeed for legal services more generally? Was that something that was done in a false sense? Or was it simply a matter of how you categorize expenses?

They therefore became political expenditures, campaign expenditures or campaign contributions way beyond the limit and then falsified them and there's the crime. Rather than calling them - I don't know exactly what they should have called them. I mean, you're not going to call them hush money payments. But the prosecution's theory is that by labeling them as attorneys fees, as retainers, that's the falsification and that's the actual crime charged here. And what the DA is doing now is they're taking us through - they're taking the jury through the chronology. They have this August 2015 meeting with David Pecker, Michael Cohen, Donald Trump, hey, guys we're going to watch out for damaging stories. We're going to try to have Donald Trump's back here. Now, they're going through this series of catch-and-kill schemes. It's going to go the doorman, which they were just talking about.

You and I as human beings cannot doubt that a presidential candidate would have been mindful that this might have had an impact on the campaign.And, you know, the defense muddied that a little bit.

And we were talking about that the defense team is trying to make that standard operating procedure, nothing to see here, this is what everyone does. This wasn't specific to the Trump campaign or even about a campaign. It's what celebrities do and what have you. They are rebutting that or Steinglass is in his summation here as much as he possibly can, including talking about that original sin meeting.

But it's basically a three-step here for the prosecution, which is not great but they can still do it.First of all, falsifying a business record under New York State law, that in itself is a misdemeanor. If it's done to commit some other crime, it jumps up to a felony. These some other crime here is New York state election law which says you cannot try to influence an election by unlawful means. Now, you're thinking, well, what are those unlawful means. That takes us to step three where the prosecution has offered up three unlawful means as Laura and Elliot were just saying, that would be a federal campaign finance law, stay with me. A tax fraud which I don't understand. I'm interested to see where - how they explain the tax crime and then get this, falsification of business records.

But I am curious about, you know, your view of how things are going now, because you had weeks of a case and then you have a week off and now you are here in these closing arguments which are crucial. I understand they're not going to be able to get the jury that is transcripts of everything else that happened before.So do you think that there is even more weight on today, this closing statements, after this week break than there might ordinarily be in a case like this? Yes, I actually do think that. Because having had a week off, you tend to forget the details certainly on the various documents that prove the case. And so this is the last thing they hear before the charge. And the point of doing it is to make them focus on what you think is the most important thing. Now both sides have spent a lot of time talking about Michael Cohen obviously defense summation went on and on about, you know, how can you convict somebody on the word of a liar, and that's what they had to do. But the people in turn in their summation are saying, yes, he lied because he lied for Trump. And Trump liked him as a lawyer because he lied and so you need to connect the two, and they're also going to stress every document that makes this case. Almost regardless of Cohen there are so many incriminating documents here. And so, they're going to point out to the jury which documents really are the key documents and they should look at them and they should think about them.",
