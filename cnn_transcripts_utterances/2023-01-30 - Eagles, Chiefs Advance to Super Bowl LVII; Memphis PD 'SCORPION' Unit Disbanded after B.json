Medics arrive, but it is not until 25 minutes after Nichols is subdued that an ambulance arrives on the scene. This is certainly not the first time that videos and evidence contradict initial police accounts that favor the officers involved. In the case of George Floyd, the Minneapolis Police said Floyd appeared to be suffering medical distress, when in reality, video evidence showed Officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck. In the case of Breonna Taylor, the initial statement from Louisville Police said she had no injuries, even though six shots struck her when police entered her home using a battery round to execute a search report.
