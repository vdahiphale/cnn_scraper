We'll have more on that in just a moment, but we're going to go first to a damning new report released in the last hour from a U.N. commission. The inquiry finds Israeli authorities and Palestinian militant groups, including Hamas, are responsible for war crimes and other violations of international law. The commission has also found that Israel is responsible for crimes against humanity during its military operations in Gaza following the October 7th Hamas attack. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh joins us now with major allegations.",

And they've said that they will not cooperate with any investigations with this body. And they say that they have decided to release this on a Jewish holiday, reflecting what they describe as this anti-Semitic behavior by this body.

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, this does seem to be the largest in one period. Just this morning, the largest number of rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel. Many of the rockets landed in the eastern part of that border area, but some of them actually landed along the shores of Lake Tiberias, in addition to several landing just east of Haifa as well.Now, these rockets, according to Hezbollah's telegram channel, were in response to the killing of four Hezbollah militants, one of them a senior commander overnight in the town of Sderot, which is about 14 kilometers north of the border. So this definitely is a major escalation, but it comes after about a week of an intensification of the back-and-forth between Hezbollah and Israel along the border area. And what we've seen significantly in the last week is that Hezbollah seems to be using weapons it hasn't used before. It, for instance, was able to take out an Iron Dome battery. The Iron Dome, of course, that anti-missile system, which really is the backbone of Israel's defense against missiles coming from South Lebanon as well as from Gaza. To the best of my knowledge, that is the first time Hezbollah has been able to take out one of those Hezbollah batteries. It's also taken down recently a Hermes 900 drone. That's a drone that flies at altitudes of below 10,000 feet, but still that's fairly high, and clearly Hezbollah is using more sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry than it hasn't used to date -- Max.",

Just taking a step back, we're in uncharted territory here, where the same Department of Justice that indicted Donald Trump in the Mar-a-Lago documents case and in the January 6th case also just convicted the sitting president's son of a crime through a jury. This, if anything, underscores that our justice system works without fear or favor, despite the imperfections of it. It is something that works to be objective.And I think it dramatically undermines this claim that it's a weaponized system. If you're an undecided voter who wasn't really sure what to make of the Trump conviction, you know, you heard on the one side on the right that this was a weaponization and on the left that no, a jury of his peers found him guilty. You're seeing this and I think you're saying, oh, wait, the system does seem to work regardless of who the name is of the person that is on trial. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sources tell CNN the Tajik authorities were arrested, or nationals, rather, were arrested on immigration charges. They had reportedly entered the U.S. via the southern border and were screened by American officials who found no red flags at the time.But sources say possible links to ISIS members were later discovered, which led to a federal investigation. Senior U.S. officials then decided to expel the individuals, a process underway right now. Those arrests come amid calls for immigration reform in the U.S., with the White House enacting sweeping asylum restrictions.
