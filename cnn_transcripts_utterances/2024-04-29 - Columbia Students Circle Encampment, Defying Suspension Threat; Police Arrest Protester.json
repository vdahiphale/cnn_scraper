Faculty have actually come over here and locked arms at the entrance of the encampment here.We spoke to one of the professors earlier and he told us that they did not think that the students here should be suspended merely for protest. In fact, to use his words, he believed the university was criminalizing protest after, of course, referencing when the NYPD was sent in, in the initial phases of this. I also want to bring in, because obviously students have been negotiating with the university throughout all of it, I want to bring in Mahmoud Khalil. Thank you so much for taking the time. I know you have been speaking to the university, trying to negotiate on behalf of the encampment. Are you guys going to listen to the university and leave the encampment here?",

They're treating this matter as a disciplinary matter. They're not treating this as an anti-war movement.

We talked a little bit about the anti-Semitism that some Jewish students have faced here on campus. It's something that the university has pushed and said that it is a situation that they've dealt with.The president of the university has even called that dynamic very tragic. But as you heard from him and as we have seen as well, there also have been Jewish students who have taken part in some of these protests. As you can see, we've showed some of the faculty that have linked arms at the encampment as well. You see the circling of these protesters, many of whom were actually inside the encampment prior to this. So, obviously, this is a situation that is continuing to develop this afternoon.

Let's go now - well, we're watching these pictures at the University of Texas at Austin, where you see protesters who are trying to encircle an encampment there and resist as police are trying to stop them from establishing an encampment. They're being arrested by law enforcement there.We have Chief Ramsey with us to talk a little bit about what we're seeing here. This is - according to a state senator, Chief, the university had said that they really wanted to avoid there being some permanent encampment. And what we have seen here, and it's hard to see because there are so many people, is that there was a very small encampment that was being set up. This is in the area where commencement is going to take place. But tell us about what you see happening here, especially in light of what happened last week where there were dozens of arrests and yet all charges were dropped and the university actually backpedaled and ended up allowing all of the students who were arrested back on campus.",

And so the sooner you disassemble the encampments, the better off you are because it becomes more difficult over time. You're already seeing in Austin some of the problems they're having in trying to arrest some of the demonstrators that are resisting.So I think it's really wise to try not to let the encampments get started to begin with, so that's what you're basically seeing now in Austin. Of course, Columbia, you have a very large encampment there now. I don't know what's going to take place, but I'm sure that at some point in time, the university will request police to come in and clear that as well.",

What is different today is that the protesters and in a way that kind of I think perhaps caught a lot of people off guard.They were in this area of the campus on the South Mall kind of doing very quiet poetry readings. There was some artwork sessions that were going on, people making protest signs and that sort of thing. So it had the air of just being a very peaceful kind of calm situation. And about 100 yards away, there was a group of professors that were holding a silent vigil. And then as soon as that silent vigil broke up, these protesters appeared to quickly scramble and set up this round barricade using the folding tables that have been brought out here for what had been described as an educational time or an educational protest, if you will, and also the number of the tents that you see inside the circle there. So this situation is different from last week, Brianna, in the sense that this is one focused and one fixed area where the protest is taking place. What we saw last week was a situation where there were people kind of moving. It was much, much larger in terms of the numbers of people who were here on this campus. This is an area that is very small compared to what we saw last week and also compared just to the university as a whole. And then the state troopers that have encircled this encampment. This is the only area where we're seeing any kind of - this kind of activity taking place right now.",

Some facing inwards towards the protesters, some facing outwards to keep others like the journalists and other spectators that we've seen away.Ed Lavandera, I want you to stay with us as we bring in CNN's Josh Campbell, who is not only our in-house security expert, but also, I believe, an alum of UT. Josh, when you look at this scene, where you have multiple law enforcement agencies, we now have a better sense of the size of this encampment. We've seen a handful of arrests, Ed Lavandera put it at around half a dozen, he believes. What do you make of what we're looking at and what we might be able to expect in the coming moments?",

I believe you're one of a number of Jewish students who have decided to leave because of threats over the past - threats and fears of violence over the past few weeks. And I want to talk about that because we just heard moments ago from some of the students representing that encampment. They gave a press conference in which they said, protesters have been entirely peaceful.
