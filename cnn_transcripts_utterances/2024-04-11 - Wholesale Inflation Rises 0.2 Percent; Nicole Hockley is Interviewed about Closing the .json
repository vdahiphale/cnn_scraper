JONATHAN GREENBLATT, CEO AND NATIONAL DIRECTOR, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE (ADL): Oh, it's quite easy. I mean, let's be clear, there's nothing anti-Semitic about protesting Israel policies, there's nothing anti- Semitic about questioning the government of Israel. But there is something highly toxic and absolutely bigoted when your idea of prejudice is to harass Jewish students at a Hillel, when your idea of protest is again to interrupt students learning in a classroom, or to defile a religious observance, or to tear the mezuzah off the doorposts of Jewish students. So, right, we are looking here, John, at things like administrative actions taken to deal with students who do these things. We're looking at how Jewish students are protected and Jewish life on campus. So, this is much more dimensional than any single thing. But your politics can never be a pretext for again intimidation, harassment, and hate. And, unfortunately, as you pointed out, John, at Ivy League schools, at top research institutions, like Stanford, MIT, Cal Tech, that's exactly what we're seeing, and it's got to stop.",

And it's a reminder that your views on Israel, or your views on Gaza, don't somehow exempt you from anti- Semitism.

The one stickling fact though, the one thorn in our side, obviously, is inflation, which has been very hard to vanquish. It's come down quite a lot since its peak. But getting it all the way back down to the Fed's preferred target has proven quite difficult. And after those sizzling numbers yesterday from the Consumer Price Index, market participants started to discount the idea that the Fed would cut rates quite as much as had been expected, because usually the Fed cuts rates when the economy needs a little bit more shushing, needs a little more stimulus when there is less of a risk of the economy overheating and inflation sticking around given that we've had higher than expected inflation numbers, at least by some metrics, again not today's numbers, that looks a little bit less likely.

So, the fact that this is now happening, it's - it's not the full, expanded background check, but it's certainly closing a significant loophole that's going to save lives.

So, that could be a felon. That could be a domestic abuser. That could be a child, such as we saw 25 years ago with Columbine and how they acquired their guns. Now, if you are in the business of selling firearms, whether that's at gun shows, in your backyard, at a car boot sale or online, and you are not a federally licensed dealer, you will have to become a licensed dealer and conduct background checks or face the penalty. So, what that means is, trafficking is going to be reduced. That is the number one way of guns getting into the trafficking circle is through unlicensed dealers. So, it's going to really close that down. It's not going to stop every illegal sale, but it will curb thousands and make a difference.",

Teachers have the responsibility for ensuring community within a school, supporting our students, their academic and their - and their social skills. That's critical. Not arming them, especially the idea of having a gun in a classroom terrifies me as a parent because what if someone else accesses that gun? What if the teacher is not adequately trained? What if the teacher, in a moment of when they should be looking after the students, they have to have the responsibility of potentially shooting their own student or accidentally shooting their own student. It's just not a great idea. Security, armed SROs who are properly trained, that is a different story. Arming teachers is not something I can support.",
