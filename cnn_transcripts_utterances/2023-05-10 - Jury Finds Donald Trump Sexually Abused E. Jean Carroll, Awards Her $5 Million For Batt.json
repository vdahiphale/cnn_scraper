(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A Manhattan federal jury found former President Donald Trump sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and subsequently defamed her. Carroll alleged Trump sexually assaulted her in the Bergdorf Goodman in the spring of 1996 and later defamed her when he denied her claims. The jury found his conduct was sexual abuse, sufficient to hold him liable for her civil battery claim even though the jury found she did not prove his assault met the rape threshold. E. JEAN CARROLL, SUED DONALD TRUMP: The minute he went like this, I proceeded into the dressing room. The minute he closed that door I was banged up against the wall. I hit my head really hard. Boom.",

Is it an appealable issue? It is, because a judge will have to evaluate was it so overwhelmingly damning and harmful that the jury didn't see the facts, but just based their conclusion of a verdict upon this tape. One can argue, perhaps they did, perhaps they didn't.

Khan's political party shared this footage of protesters breaking through in apparently unguarded gates at the headquarters of the military in Rawalpindi. And CNN filmed demonstrators overrunning the residents of the top military commander in Lahore. Khan has been leading a public campaign against the current government and its military allies ever since a no-confidence vote in parliament last year forced him out of the prime minister's office. In March, he resisted an attempt by police to arrest him for missing a court appearance, leading to clashes between police and his supporters around his home in Lahore.

And this is really why you saw that very fast response when he called for people to come out onto the street. That is exactly what they did.

There was a video given to us by Imran Khan's party itself that shows some of those supporters breaking through a gate at the army headquarters in Rawalpindi. And certainly, this is what we would expect could happen going forward. Now, of course, from the official point of view, what they're trying to do is to break the communication between this fairly organized level of protesters.

But Hamas has been sitting on the sidelines. They've sat on the sidelines in the past when Israel specifically targeted just Islamic Jihad and sent a message to Hamas, we're not looking for you to get involved. That's why none of your people were targeted in the strike. So, it'll be interesting to see what Hamas does. But the fact that there has been no response yet, not a single rocket, is very interesting and telling. And it raises questions, what is Islamic Jihad waiting for? It could be that maybe they're taking a page out of Israel's playbook, right? Israel got hit by those hundred rockets last week. It didn't retaliate right away. Prime Minister Netanyahu did come under some pressure from the public and the media and within his own coalition that his response was weak. But what we saw was it was actually building up to what happened 24 hours ago with the targeting of these three Islamic Jihad guys.
