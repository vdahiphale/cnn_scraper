This is the community, as you said, where -- the area where the suspect left his car. We're -- about the way the officers are facing, they're looking towards the woods there. These are just two officers that are on this side, who are establishing a perimeter, keeping a look out towards the woods. They told us to stay back where we are. They told us were safe. And they said Just stay out of the woods. There are several, at least, a dozen other officers with long guns and seem -- you know, looking similar to these officers. On the other side, they went in deeper into the greenhouse into this farm area clearly searching for something. We don't know what led them to here, but they are responding in force here. There are -- we can see at least almost two dozen police vehicles here. And now you see one of the officers moving around here. But it seems like these two officers are on the outside, watching the perimeter, while at least a dozen other officers are more deeper inside. And I don't know if this officer is coming over probably to talk to us or what but he's coming over this way. They're asking us to move back now, John, so we're going to move back. They're going to ask us to move back. OK, we're moving back here, John. They just came out and asked us.",

So, any noise, any suspicious activity, certainly they're going to call it in, it's certainly going to prompt a police response. So, now we know why the police are here.

Today is the first day that we're hearing, you know, in that press conference earlier about law enforcement setting up a perimeter or doing the diving, doing more searches, more organized, searching for the first time today. But there is no perimeter. It's kind of been very open. You know, the media that's been here since yesterday, we've been able to get around freely, see things, we've seen other searches going on. And it's been pretty open. So, to answer your question, there's not really been a perimeter. What's been happening often here is that the local police department, the Lisbon Police Department has been responding to 911 calls. People seeing things, hearing things, and that's usually what prompts a response. Here someone as we've been saying, someone who works on the farm says that he thinks he heard a gunshot.

Kate Bolduan is in New York.And just to update you on something we all saw a few minutes ago, our Shimon Prokupecz was in Lisbon, Maine, which is about 15 minutes from here. And we saw a law enforcement presence at an organic lettuce farm less than one mile from the site where the suspect, Robert Card, where his car was last found at a boat launch in the Androscoggin River. You can see some video of what we were just looking at moments ago. Shimon now tells us they were investigating a tip, some of the more than 530 tips that have come into law enforcement over the last 40- plus hours now. They got a tip. Someone at the farm reported they heard something that sounded like a gunshot. Law enforcement went there and is checking it out right now. It goes to show you where this investigation is at this moment. Mainly, that there is still a manhunt underway for Robert Card who is still believed to be armed and dangerous. There is still this shelter- in-place situation, Kate, for some 700 square miles, including tens of thousands of people. And the only update that we have from law enforcement is what they will be doing today which involves more searches like the one you're seeing on the screen right now as tips come in. But also focusing on some specific areas including primarily, Kate, today, the river where that car was found. They're going to have divers searching the river for evidence but also presumably for the possibility of found -- finding the body of Robert Card to rule in -- really to rule out --",
