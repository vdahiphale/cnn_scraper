And the battleground state of Georgia once again taking center stage, posing a new challenge potentially for Donald Trump after the shakeup on the Democratic ticket. Any minute now, the former president is set to take the stage at a rally in Atlanta. You see Senator J.D. Vance, his running mate there talking to the crowd. This is the same venue where Vice President Kamala Harris held a raucous rally with nearly 10,000 supporters just four days ago. CNN's Alayna Treene, is there for as we await, the former president. And Alayna, the Trump campaign has been working on its messaging strategy as it shifts to take on Kamala Harris, not Joe Biden. What are you seeing so far and how has that developed in the last several days?",

      "sentences": "Well, the messaging has been changing. I think we know that just two weeks ago, Donald Trump was in an entirely different place in his campaign. It was just after the Republican National Convention.His team as well as the party overall was calling for unity. He was trying to stick to policy. That's what his team was encouraging him to do at least. And now, he's really reverted back to that 2016 playbook. It's very reminiscent of his attacks on Hillary Clinton what we're hearing him do with Kamala Harris right now. And I can tell you, Jessica, that even today, I've been looking around the room. They've had the jumbotrons filled with headlines promoting some of the false claims that Trump himself made this week about Harris' heritage. We heard some of Donald Trump's surrogates tonight, including this woman named Mikayla Montgomery Republican black activist who essentially repeated some of the lies about Kamala Harris that got Donald Trump had made this week. So they're not running away from that. They are leaning in to those harsh comments. Now, you can hear it's very loud behind me. I apologize. But I do want to point out that J.D. Vance has also been really leaning to into his attacks on Harris as well. Also arguing that she does not deserve what he calls a promotion. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.D. VANCE (R), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: But anybody who is sue blind to see Bidens incompetence or, let's be honest, too dishonest to admit it doesn't deserve to be commander in chief. Kamala Harris is not getting a promotion to the presidency of the United States. The Democrat Party bosses would like to install her as their new nominee and is the next president. But remember, she has not received a single vote for president. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She does not deserve to be the one running.So I think you're going to continue to hear some of that from Donald Trump himself tonight. I'm told you can also expect him to lean in to those very controversial comments from that National Association of Black Journalists panel this week where he argued that Harris had turned black in the last few years. I'm told he's going to repeat some of those claims on stage and try to label as a phony. And again, all of those claims are very false, Jessica.",

That it's either that debate or he doesn't want to go up against her.Harris on the other hand, is arguing the opposite. She's arguing that both the Trump campaign and the then-Biden campaign had agreed to a September 10th ABC debate and that she's going to show up there no matter what. And so look, when I talk to Trump's advisors, they say that they no longer have to abide by that agreement, that commitment to debate with ABC later in September because it's no longer Joe Biden, who was the one who would be as part of that agreement. And I really think what they're trying to do here is to take more control of this debate. It's very clear in my conversations that they're of course more concerned about debating Harris than Biden, particularly after Biden's incredibly poor performance at that CNN debate in June. So that's where a lot of this is coming from, but I do know as well that they think the country deserves to have the debate. Trump himself has said he thinks it's his obligation. But right now, they are very stuck in the mud on the details and using it as a way to attack one another. So it's unclear how this will get resolved, Jessica.",

And I don't know that it's a great look for him. I do think at the end of the day, he may feel he has to debate. He also may feel like I'm ahead right now. Do I want to take that risk?

So I think there's a -- you know, there's a justifiable sense of concern in his camp that this thing could get away from him.

I mean, one is -- the one you very appropriately suggest, which is this is the first presidential decision you make.And so people will take a lot from it, especially for Kamala Harris is stepping up to the lead role in this drama. The first thing you want to make sure is the person is qualified and can plausibly be president if the need arises. Nine presidents have risen to the presidency. And so you always have to be aware of that. The second is you want someone who's not going to embarrass you and I would suggest that this is a problem for Trump because he kind of -- there is question on both fronts relative to his VP choice. So this is an opportunity to create a comparison with J.D. Vance, with relatively scant experience and hasn't done a heck of a lot in public. He's only been in the Senate for 18 months. That's the only office he's ever held. He's never really run anything. So here you have an assortment of governors. You have a Senator in Mark Kelly, who was an astronaut, who was a fighter pilot, who is strong on the border, guy from a battleground state and who is an expert on national security. And you have an array of governors. But ultimately this may come down to a math problem, Jessica. The state that she has to win I believe and most people do to win the presidency is the state of Pennsylvania. So that's put a lot of focus on Josh Shapiro, the governor, the very popular governor of Pennsylvania, and the question of whether he on the ticket might provide a little bit extra in what promises to be a marginal race. And that's why there's a lot of focus of attention on him right now. But every single person on this list would pass the tests that I suggested in the first place that there is sort of table stakes test of qualifications and of unlikely to embarrass you. So she's got a good array of candidates to choose from and there are a lot of opinions in the Democratic Party about the way she should go.",

But those numbers loom large to me. They really do. But you know, Pete Buttigieg, great -- one of maybe the best communicator in the Democratic Party. J.B. Pritzker, the governor of my state has been fantastic and surprising because he was new to politics leader of the state, very strong Trump critic. A lot of energy behind Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota who has really gone after this. I mean, he's been on everything but the home and garden network in the last few days. So, you know that he's going after it. And then Andy Beshear, who I think a lot of Americans remember from some of the travails that have -- natural disasters that have hit his state and how he's handled himself then.

I think it's pretty much a given now that there will be a response. The big questions which we don't have answers to is when that response will come and from where it will come.In terms of the when, you'll recall back in April when Iran held an unprecedented barrage of missiles and drones towards Israel that on that occasion it was well telegraphed what Iran was going to do, and Israel was waiting several hours for this kind of slow-motion flotilla of Missiles and drones to arrive. This time around they don't seem to be telegraphing what their intentions are. And as I say, the other big question that remains to be answered is where any response from Iran would come from. Will it be from Iran itself? Will it be from its main proxy, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon which has been firing on Israel since the 8 October in support of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks and which has been exchanging daily fire with Israel. Will it come from the Houthis in Yemen or perhaps other proxies, other militia inside of Iraq, which are backed by Iran. There's also of course, the possibility that the response could happen outside of Israel perhaps something on the lines of what we saw in the 90s in Argentina when Hezbollah was widely blamed for attacks on the Israeli embassy and a Jewish cultural center there. So those are the two big questions. And of course, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is warning Israelis in his words of challenging days ahead and one supermarket has told that a spike in sales of basic goods, Israelis as a whole, Jessica, I think are just getting on with their lives as normal for now.",

Great to have both of you here. Norman, let's start first with you. Eliott just laid out what is the big question which is, what might this retaliation look like? You have to think that Israel did factor in there would be retaliation if they were going and they haven't taken of course responsibility for this. But there was a strike in the middle of Tehran and that there might be some retaliation for that. What do you think it might look like? NORMAN ROULE, FORMER U.S. NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE MANAGER FOR IRAN: Good evening to you and to Aaron. The Iranian retaliation needs to resolve a number of challenges. First, they need to prevent this from turning into a regional war which would seriously damage Iran's national economic and political objectives at a very sensitive time in the regime. At the same time, they need to reset deterrence. They need to demonstrate to regime hardliners that the regime knows what it's doing. They need to stand with Lebanese Hezbollah that recently suffered the loss of its senior, most military official to the Israelis. They need to stand with the Houthis who recently were attacked by the Israelis following a Houthi attack on Tel Aviv. This is the sort of response that takes some time to work out. It will involve a number of different tools beginning perhaps with cyber, ending perhaps with some sort of saturation event. But again, they're going to try to calibrate this and that takes time.",

So we may -- we may have a little more time here. But I think the situation -- we're in for a bad patch and the situation is going to get worse before it gets worse (ph). I think the key is going to be what is the nature of the Iranian response? How much damage so they do? Will civilian casualties be involved? because then of course you get to the issue of the Israeli response. And I think it's not -- I think it's impossible to say. I think we still can avoid a major regional war, something the Middle East has never experienced before but I think there are too many uncertainties right now in order to make that sort of prediction.

There are unconfirmed reports we've even sent B2 bombers with the massive ordinance penetrators that can destroy any facility in Iran.

But again, I think, right now, the diplomats are not -- not front and center. This is a kinetic exercise and a serious one at that. The implications, I think, for the hostages and the ceasefire negotiations, they're also quite dire. The Israeli prime minister has now made returning the hostages a priority. And (INAUDIBLE) saying, why are the key Palestinian decision-makers not (INAUDIBLE) He's determined to keep the hostages. So even before the escalation, Jessica, I think the odds of a deal were fading. The real question is, when the dust settles, if it settles, what, in fact, will be the situation on the ground and will there be any hope of de-escalating war in Gaza? Unless you do that, we're going to be left with the several wars of attrition that are just going to grind down.

This is Tropical Storm Debby, just named as of a couple of minutes ago. You can see the center of it is sitting just offshore of Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico. And that's why it's starting to get its act together and intensifying, organizing a little bit better. This ocean waters are just so warm. We now have new hurricane warnings in effect for parts of the big bend of Florida. That's where we could be getting pretty close to a category one landfall as we go into Monday as this this thing intensifies. That's because on its path, there's really no wind energy in its way that would kill the hurricane. So we don't have any of that. And we have crazy warm ocean temperatures. You need ocean temperatures below 80 degrees to weaken a storm system. We've got some ocean temperatures nearing the low 90s. So just incredibly near record warm. And that is food and fuel for these hurricanes. Because we are looking at it possibly intensifying, we are finding the numbers in the forecast increasing. Increasing storm surge, four to seven feet in that big bend of Florida there around Cedar Key. As you get towards Tampa Bay, looking at two to four feet of storm surge. One to three feet down near Marco Island. Again, with that at turn into Florida expected going into Monday, we could find some tropical-storm-force conditions as soon as Sunday night. Then as we go into the work week, look at what happens. It just sits and meanders and just continues to spin. These spaghetti plots are almost laughable because look at the loop-to-loop they do. And it's not really because we don't know where it's going. It's because it has nowhere to go. Look at these two different areas of high pressure. You have a stationary front to the north. Really, Debby just kind of gets squeezed and has nowhere to turn because that front is in its way. The reason why this is so important is because when you have a slow, stalled tropical system that could give you prolific amounts the rain. We're talking about possibly measuring rain in feet. A widespread swath of maybe six-to-12-inch totals from Florida up the Georgia and Carolina coastline. But I am increasingly worried about a pocket somewhere in the low country of Georgia and South Carolina that we could be looking at maybe even upwards of two feet of rain. So something that we need to watch incredibly closely. Multiple days already slated for a moderate risk of heavy rainfall through Monday, Tuesday, and even into Wednesday -- Jessica?",

And what he said was that there was radio traffic, there were text messages and there were phone calls, but it was -- it was pretty scattered among the different agencies.And what we know is that that's a very critical breakdown because local law enforcement had been tracking that shooter for quite some time. It was only until about 30 seconds before the shooting started that they realized he had a firearm. And they, the local law enforcement agencies, put that information out over the radio. But the problem was, there were two command posts. What Director Rowe described was a unified command post where local law enforcement agencies were stationed so they could hear one another's radios there. But there was another area where the Secret Service was located and that was their security room where they were with a Pennsylvania state trooper. That information, that radio traffic did not get to the Secret Service. And so the Secret Service agents and counter-snipers did not know that gunman had a firearm until he started shooting. Here's what Director Rowe said about how these two command centers -- how these two command centers were working, and why that radio traffic became so hampered.",

Three little girls we're killed, several others we're wounded. A 17-year-old was arrested at the scene. Then false information about the suspect's identity spread online, fueling the protests. Ahead of his 100th birthday, former President Jimmy Carter told his family he's hanging on so he can vote in the presidential election.
