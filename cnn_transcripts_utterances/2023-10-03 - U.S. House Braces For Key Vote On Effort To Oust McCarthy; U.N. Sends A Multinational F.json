Tonight, any moment now, the U.S. House ofRepresentatives will take a key vote on the fate of Kevin McCarthy's speakership. We'll bring you the details as they get underway. Then, the EU approves more budget for Ukraine aid and reaffirm their support. I will be speaking to the Portuguese foreign minister who's just returned from those meetings in Kyiv. Plus, the U.N. is sending a multinational force to Haiti to combat spiraling gang violence and stabilize -- to stabilize the nation. We'll have the very latest for you. But we start tonight with a historic day on Capitol Hill where the U.S. house is set  to hold a key procedural vote on the effort to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Let me show you those live images as the voting is expected to get underway. This of course, just days after the top house Republican worked with rival Democrats to avert -- if you remember, a government shutdown. His reward -- well, a coup by hard-line pro-Trump Republicans led by Florida's Matt Gaetz. Democrats could have worked with McCarthy to keep him in power. And here's what the chamber's top Democrat said about that earlier. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We  encourage our Republican colleagues who claim to be more traditional to break from the extremists, end the chaos, end the dysfunction, end the extremism. We are ready, willing and able to work together with our Republican colleagues. But it is on them to join us, to move the Congress and the country forward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A house speaker has never successfully been removed bytheir own party in one of these motions to vacate. Donald Trump was one of the leading Republicans calling for the shutdown McCarthy avoided, and if Trump is following today's events in Washington, well, he's doing yet as you can see there, in court. He's been in New York for day two of his civil fraud trial, railing against the trial as a conspiracy to Democrats. Meanwhile, a frequent Trump target has also been in court. Hunter Biden was formally arrested and released in Delaware as he faces federal charges over a gun purchase. Buying a gun is legal in U.S., buying it while  addicted to crack, is not. And the allegations against Hunter Biden are going to trial after a plea deal collapsed. He says he's not guilty. It is the first time a child of a sitting U.S. president has faced criminal charges. A lot for you to wrap your head around. Let's break this all down for you. I'm joined by CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings, he was a special assistant to former President George W. Bush, he's also a columnist for \"USA Today\", and Stephen Collinson, a CNN politics senior reporter. Gentlemen, thank you very much for being on the show. I just want to make sure that we bring our viewers the view from Capitol Hill from the U.S. where we're waiting for this vote to start, because Scott, there's a lot of drama been playing out today as we wait for this vote. Drama, chaos, I don't know what you want to call it. Speaker McCarthy as we wait for that vote to start, Speaker McCarthy, Scott, today sounded defiant, but not willing, it seems from what I heard today, not willing to have any sort of power-sharing agreement with the Democrats. The Democrats for their part, won't save him without some sort of quid pro quo. So, how does McCarthy thread this needle, can he survive here?",

Talk first, the trial here, Stephen. And how much is at stake for Trump and his brand and his identity?

It's not really -- I don't think the face the Republicans want to show to the voters next year. This case is very fundamental to Trump. It's easy to forget, but back in 2016, this idea that Trump was a consummate businessman, a billionaire tycoon, was actually very important to his lot - - a lot of his voters, who believe that would help him get things done.

You know, while all this is going on, there havebeen a number of surveys, polls that have come out in the United States that have shown what a weak position Joe Biden is in. His job approval is very low, people have very low opinion of how he's handled the economy. You've got more than half of Democrats in most surveys saying they wish he wouldn't even run again. And so, Biden is in a particularly weak position. So, you might think, well, we should get out of our own way and just let the Democratic incumbent you know, suffer. But by having chaos in the house, by having Donald Trump in court, what you're doing is telling the voters that even though they may not like the democratic incumbent on a number of fronts, you're calling into question your own judgment and your own ability to earn their votes and begin governing the country. So, that's really the dilemma for the Republican Party. Can you take advantage of a weak Joe Biden if you nominate someone like Donald Trump who may well be convicted of a felony by the time the Republican National Convention or certainly the next election rolls around.",

All of this is discounted by Trump's voters who have bought into the -- can seethat Trump has advanced for years that they should listen to him and not listen to what the mainstream media talks about. All of these trials are seen by a lot of those voters as evidence of political persecution. These voters have been with Trump ever since 2016. He has an emotional connection with them, he is seen as someone that is standing up against elites, and attempts by what he calls a deep state to unseat him. I don't think it's very helpful, any of this, for the voters in swing states and in suburban districts who turned against Trump in 2020 and heard the Republicans in 2022. I mean, I'm thinking of -- for example, one of the congressman that's been very to the fore in the house recently is Mike Lawler, who is a freshman congressman from a New York district, which is always won by Democrats in presidential elections. He won that state in the 2022 midterm election. He's exactly the kind of moderate Republican, the Republicans need to keep the house. Potentially, someone like him could win a presidential election, but he's being in danger now, being swept out of office by a Democratic comeback, just because of all this extremism in the Republican Party that many voters really disdain.",

The second message is also very significant. Which is that we are really a geopolitical Europe now. We have a clear notion of our strategic interest and we have the availability to work jointly towards fulfilling those interests.

We're waiting for the U.S. House of Representatives, which is set to hold the key procedural vote on the effort to oust Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. That vote could come any minute. The effort to oust Kevin McCarthy isn't coming from Democrats but from Republicans. They were angry over the deal McCarthy struck to avoid a shutdown. I'm just being told by my team that the vote is underway this very moment. It just started. And of course, this is all about McCarthy, whether he can hang by a thread here. And it is being led by one man in particular that we saw on the screen briefly. That was Matt Gaetz of Florida, who has been pushing for his ouster, for McCarthy's ouster. We do not know to be completely honest how this will play out. But it's offering a motion to vacate the chair, very rare procedural maneuver that can be used to force a vote to remove the Speaker. If the procedural vote fails, they'll be a vote directly on whether to remove him as a speaker. Stephen Collinson joins me now. The vote is now underway, Stephen, I don't how long this will take. But from our earlier conversation you and I had 50 minutes or so, it doesn't look like Kevin McCarthy has the votes here, at least it didn't seem like it earlier on. And it didn't seem like he was willing to do any sort of deal with the Democrats. What are you expecting here?",

Sountil we get to the end of this, it is very difficult to be sure exactly what's happening. So if McCarthy survives this vote, it would go to the motion to vacate. If he does not win that vote, then we could be into this whole new period of trying to choose a new speaker. There doesn't seem to be any real standout candidate. It's very possible McCarthy could choose to run again as speaker. In January, he had to go through 15 rounds of votes over multiple days in his own coalition to try and get enough votes, a simple majority of the House, to be speaker. So this is basically a Republican civil war that's unfolding. One of the reasons why McCarthy is in such a difficult spot today and is so weak and vulnerable is that he gave up so many coalitions to the Right back then. He set up this kind of new period of uncertainty for himself today. So it's going to be very interesting to see how this unfolds. Of course, the Democrats have decided they're not going to try to help McCarthy, to get conditions from him, to get concessions from him to carry on. I don't think it's a huge surprise just because he is deeply unpopular among Democrats. They don't trust him. He, after all, went down to Mar-a-Lago and resurrected Donald Trump's career after the Capitol insurrection. He has helped Donald Trump deny the result of the 2020 election. And he's opened impeachment inquiries into President Biden. So there's very little incentive for the Democrats to help him. I think there is quite a lot of incentive for Democrats just to sit there and watch these votes and see the Republican Party damage itself.",

So this Republican conference is riven by divisions; there are many pro- Trump congress men and women who basically are there, their whole modus operandi is not governing but it is creating chaos and getting attention.

I voted for that. However, when that vote failed, the Speaker, this past Friday, in the Republican conference meeting, made it abundantly clear that he was willing to do anything to avoid the temporary discomfort and the pressure of a pause and the 15 percent of the nonessential federal government operations, which would guarantee that we would lose to the Senate Democrats and the White House. If you're not willing to say no, then you're guaranteed to lose. And that was confirmed with the passage of the unconditional 45-day CR this past Saturday. Once again, with 209 Democrat votes, the Republican bill, 209-1, Democrats 51-0 in the Senate side. The Speaker fought through 15 votes in January to become speaker but was only willing to fight through one failed CR before surrendering to the Democrats on Saturday. We need a Speaker who will fight for something, anything, besides just staying or becoming speaker. If there was ever a time to fight with $33 trillion in national debt, a $2 trillion deficit this year, 40-year high inflation. 20-year high interest rates, a downgraded credit rating and, for the first time in modern history, the polls showing, despite all the help of the media blaming Republicans in the House, the polls showed that the public was blaming Biden and the Democrats for an imminent shutdown. If not fight now, when would we fight? Now is and was the time. With the Democrats driving the fiscal bus off the cliff at 100 miles an hour, we cannot simply be content to be the party that slows it down to 95 just so we can sit in the front seat and wear the captain's hat. Our current debt and our spending trajectory is unsustainable. We need a speaker, ideally someone who does not want to be speaker and hasn't pursued that at all costs for his entire adult life, who will make the moment and do everything possible to fight for the country.
