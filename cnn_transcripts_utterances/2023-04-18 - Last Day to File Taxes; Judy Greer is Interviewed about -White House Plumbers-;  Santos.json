And this is regarding reports of federal prosecutors looking into whether or not you used your role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees aid to Egypt, to help a meat company in your state in New Jersey secure a contract with the government of Egypt. You've denied wrongdoing, but you recently set up a defense fund for this. And in 2015, you were indicted on bribery charges, mistrial declared. You were later acquitted. But to any New Jersey voters watching right now who may have concerns that again you're facing scrutiny over corruption, what is your response to them?",

Not only did the jurors not believe the government's case at the time, but the judge kicked out the most significant elements of their charges, saying there was no there there. And that's unfortunate that our system of justice worked in a way that ended in nothing. But nonetheless, that's what it was.And if anyone looks at my history on Egypt, they would know that by both denying aid to Egypt, denying arms sales to Egypt, criticizing its human rights record, I'm not in a position to be helpful to anyone as it relates to Egypt.",

And it's about 10 percent less than it was last year. Here's why. A lot of those complicated but very lucrative tax breaks during Covid have expired. So, you're going to get a little bit less here.But what might be the good news today is that it's not as hard to talk to the actual IRS. This has been a real problem. The IRS has been underfunded for more than a decade. Now they have 5,000 new workers already working on this tax season. They've received more than two million -- 6.5 million calls. That's two million more than last year. Actually talking to a human person, something I haven't been able to do with the IRS in a few years. And the wait time is under two minutes here. So, you're seeing some of your hard taxpayer dollars at work, folks, trying to make the tax season a little bit better. If you live in one of these areas that's had a disaster declaration, your deadlines have been moved forward for your tax deadlines. So, that gives you some more time to figure out your finances here. And if you need to request a six-month extension, if you're not ready today to finally get it done, you could use the IRS Free File. It's form 4868. And then you can just punt this until -- until October 16th. If you have to pay a lot, if you've gone through, you know, the software and you have to pay a lot, you might want to think about having more money deducted every paycheck so that you don't get stuck with a big bill next year.",
