So this gun is something that he created putting it together from parts and from 3-D printing -- the base of it. Put it together and then use it in the commission of this crime. And this gun does not exist as far as traceability goes. He thought he was so much smarter than everyone else, but why didn't he get rid of this gun? Why did he still have the gun, the magazine, the ammo there, which all link him directly to the crime? He also had his ID -- the ID he used at the hostel there. Why didn't he get rid of that ID?

One of the key things that you have to look at is when there is a power vacuum that's the perfect breeding ground for terrorist groups such as ISIS to develop and to, in essence, flourish. So we have to be very careful. Of course, protection is going to be the number one issue for U.S. troops that are in Syria. There are about 900 of them there at the moment and those troops are going to have to be extra vigilant because of that.
