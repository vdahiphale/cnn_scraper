The defense minister saying Hamas fighters are coming out of underground tunnels.And this as the first Americans have been allowed to leave Gaza, which includes the American pediatrician Barbara Zind. Her husband who's eagerly awaiting her return will be OUTFRONT. And Donald Trump Jr. testifying in the case that could spill the end of the Trump Org. We'll tell you what he said under oath today and what happened inside that courtroom with the sketch artist. Plus, our own KFILE digging into the new House speaker's past -- his work with a group that promoted conversion therapy, and a long record of anti-gay comments. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news inside Gaza City. The Israeli defense minister tonight saying that there is intense fighting inside Gaza City, one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Gaza City, of course, is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip. The defense minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant, says soldiers in Gaza City have described Hamas fighters as coming out of underground tunnels, from underground buildings -- from underground buildings, hospitals, and schools. So they're saying they're basically coming out of those tunnels and engaging in street fighting. Of course, a battle in Gaza City, bloody and deadly. Israel also already announcing today that it is burying the dead from one of the deadliest days in the history of its ground operations in Gaza on the Israeli side, a total of 15 soldiers were killed there on Tuesday, according to Israeli Defense Forces. But this all comes in the context of the loss of life in Gaza itself. Worldwide outrage is hitting a boiling point after Israel admitted its airstrikes caused a second explosion in just 24 hours in the Jabalia refugee camp. These are before and after pictures. You can see the densely populated area decimated. The director of the New York high office of the high commissioner for human rights resigning over the U.N.'s response to the situation in Gaza, which he described as, quote, a textbook case of genocide. We have a special report of the strikes on that refugee camp. And IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus is also here to respond. But amidst the losses and the incredible suffering, a glimmer of hope for some today. Some innocent civilians finally being allowed to leave the 25-mile long Gaza Strip. An Egyptian official telling CNN that 361 foreign nationals have now left Gaza, entering Egypt through that Rafah border crossing. That includes the American pediatrician Barbara Zind, who we've been following on this program. Here are images of Dr. Zind making her way out of Gaza, where she'd been sleeping in a car with other people, witnessed violence and fights over scarce food, and witnessed a toilet shared by 800 people. We've been speaking to her over these past weeks, and her husband. We're told she's now in Cairo. In a minute, I'm going to be speaking with her husband, who will be with us. But despite this welcome news for 361 people, the context here is that more than 2 million are still stuck in Gaza and 240 of them are hostages still being held captive by Hamas from the October 7th terror attack. Earlier, I spoke to Rotem Cooper. His parents, his mother and father, both kidnapped back on October 7th. After 27 days in captivity, his 79-year-old mother Nurit Cooper is free. He told me more about what she experienced while being held captive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, though, many innocent civilians also appeared to have been killed. Nada Bashir is OUTFRONT in Jerusalem, and I want to warn you that some of the images in her report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): Chaos and horror at Gaza's Jabalia refugee camp. Wounded children rushed to nearby ambulances, the latest casualties of Israel's relentless aerial bombardment. This densely populated neighborhood gripped by panic and sheer disbelief -- a second Israeli airstrike in less than 24 hours. I lost my whole family, Abu Tarim (ph) says, holding a list of those killed just today. My sister's house was struck with her children inside. My brother's house, too, with all of his children. There is no one left except for me and my younger brother. They were innocent. What did they do to deserve this? Israel's Defense Force says it was targeting a Hamas command and control complex in Jabalia. Hamas fighters are said to be among those killed. But Jabalia is home to more than 100,000 civilians, according to the U.N. And while the full extent of the civilian death toll remains unclear at this stage, Gaza City defense authority has described this latest disaster as a massacre, with more casualties and more fatalities added to the list of hundreds said to have been killed or wounded in Tuesday's airstrike. The situation is beyond belief. Many have been killed. Bodies have been left burned and charred by the airstrike, this doctor says. There isn't a hospital in the world that can cope with this kind of situation. We're having to treat patients on the floor and in corridors. The scale of the description at Jabalia is difficult to we grasp. Many residents are still buried beneath the blackened rubble. Rescue workers and civilians dig side by side, desperate to find survivors. This house had 15 people in it, but we still haven't been able to find any of them, Hassan Ahmad (ph) says. We have no equipment. We are digging alone. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on camera): And look, Erin, we've seen these airstrikes continuing to bombard parts of northern Gaza. This is an area where the IDF has warned civilians and residents to evacuate southwards, warning that those airstrikes will intensify. But as we have seen over the course of the last three weeks, more than three weeks now, these airstrikes are continuing across the Gaza Strip, not just in the north, but in central and southern Gaza, too, in so-called safe zones, including areas where many are sheltering, including U.N. schools. And for many inside Gaza right now, the fear for them is that there is simply nowhere safe to turn -- Erin.",

We continue to listen and see what they're doing.We issue information, not claims, but we issued names, faces, and positions of dead Hamas commanders and key operatives. We do that because we do still have excellent intelligence, very granular intelligence, of what they are doing, of their whereabouts. Granted, I cannot argue with what you said in the first part. Yes, we failed on October 7th. Clearly. That needs to be investigated. But definitely, that does not imply that our intelligence is wrong. On the contrary, we continue working based on that intelligence, and we generate more intelligence. Our ground troops are there in friction with the enemy, every encounter, when we meet the enemy, we defeat them, even if we have casualties, and then we generate more and more targeting intelligence.",
