      "sentences": "Welcome to The Lead. I'm Jake Tapper.And we start this hour with breaking news and a brand new forecast for Hurricane Milton, which is just hours away from landfall. Officials warn that Hurricane Milton could be one of the most destructive storms on record, with a life threatening storm surge, destructive winds, dangerous winds and tornadoes. Now some of those effects are already being seen and felt up and down the Florida Gulf Coast. Our reporters are stationed, excuse me, up and down the coast, and our meteorologists are warned -- working around the clock in CNN's hurricane headquarters. Let's start with that brand new forecast just in to CNN and CNN's Elisa Raffa. Elisa, what's the latest track for Hurricane Milton?",

      "sentences": "So, we still have a Category 3 hurricane on our hands right now. The track still, again, focusing on the west coast there of Florida. What we've been watching so closely with this is that center line, right, where -- oh, here it is. Here is Category 3 hurricane, right? Still, 100 to 20 mile per hour winds, the warnings with the track.This was the graphic that I wanted to get you to where we're looking at the center line of this where we were worried about some storm surge coming into Tampa Bay, right, that eight to 12 feet of storm surge. With this center line of that core of the eye going just to the south there of Tampa Bay, there would be more offshore winds in Tampa Bay, more of those receding winds, and the worst that storm surge would be Sarasota and areas to the south. So it does look like that. We have updated that storm surge forecast here from the hurricane center. You can see we didn't get a chance to update the boxes, because this literally is coming in as I'm speaking to you. But you see the orange here, that's telling us that that storm surge around the Tampa Bay area looks like it was taken nudged down a little bit, because this track is nudging towards the south of Tampa Bay for the exact eye of the storm. So if it's up to nine feet, that storm surge would be a little bit more similar to what they had in Helene which, of course, we know caused a lot of damage, right? We're not talking about like, oh, there's not going to be any storm surge and no more hurricane here in Tampa Bay, but it puts the greater risk of some of that storm surge more than 12 feet from Sarasota to Venice. So this is the adjustment that we've been watching for as we've had these wobbles from Milton coming back and forth a little bit, and we've been watching this jog to the south. And again, because of the shape of Tampa Bay, it really impacts the amount of storm surge that they would see in the Tampa Bay area. Again, up to nine feet of storm surge is nothing to really, you know, kind of sneeze at that is still dangerous, that is still unsurvivable, right, that is still a whole lot of storm surge that we have seen can do damage. But that is the latest update that I'm gleaning here. Also want to emphasize too, that the storm has doubled in size, right? It is now 300 miles wide, which is double the size from what it was yesterday. So that's what we're concerned about, too. You find more of these impacts across the peninsula, and we'll find that -- we found it all day. Jake.",

Over the weekend, we were talking about a tropical storm, and then it zoomed within almost 24 hours to a Category 5. That is not something that, even as a Floridian, I've been used to growing up watching storms hit Florida ever since I was a kid, beyond that you have the frequency of the storm.So you had Hurricane Helene last week, Category 4, bashing into this coast. There's still debris. Actually, not far from where I'm standing, there's a pier that was badly damaged. There are pieces of wood, there are scrap, pieces of metal. So aside from those two factors, the strength of this storm, the frequency where it's headed, you also have the human response. And I've heard people talk about this storm in ways that I never have before, not only a doubt in the ability of the federal government to respond to it, but also even the nature of this storm. And speaking to at least one resident, this elderly woman, who told me that she believed that this was geoengineered for political reasons. She believes that somehow her political enemies are controlling the weather. That's not something that I'm used to hearing as a logical disinformation that is out there about this storm, something that several officials on both sides of the political aisle have tried to tap down.

You have changes in wind speed and direction with height, with the circulation of the hurricane and the heating of the day. We had some clear skies over portions of central and southern Florida that allowed that instability to build up, allows the thunderstorms to form. And that wind shear, the change in wind speed, direction with height, allows us thunderstorms to start rotating and produce tornadoes.And you're right, we have a tornado watch that's in effect for everywhere you see here in this dark pink until 9pm likely to be extended through the overnight and into the early morning hours. Some tornado warnings ongoing here in portions of Eastern and Central Florida, but it's been a very prolific day for tornadoes, and we've seen reports of damage, lots of images of those tornadoes, and some of them have been quite long lasting as well, which is not typical for tornadoes associated with hurricanes are usually a little more short lived.",

And in one case, we had a electric wheelchair, lithium ion battery powered that caught fire.So it's not just golf carts or E scooters, but all those different technologies that leverage this fantastic lithium ion battery, you know technology to be in everyday lives. It's in our pockets right now. But if you're in a storm surge area and you don't heed the warnings that we've been issuing, you have cases where the house survives, but because of the salt water that entered into the house through flooding, the car ignites, then the house burns down.

It sounds as though this storm is going to make landfall somewhere between 8:00 and 8:30 p.m. near Sarasota. That is just a -- a short ways down from where we are. That's where we were expecting the worst storm surge of about 15 feet. Again, it is a dangerous time for folks in this area.
