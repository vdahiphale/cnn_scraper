I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan and this is CNN News Central. And the breaking news, Hurricane Beryl is tearing through Texas. We are getting fresh reports from the ground as already nearly 400,000 people are without power. That's a brand new number. Beryl made landfall as a category one storm just south of Galveston. Those are live pictures right now. You can see the wind whipping through that parking lot. This is the earliest hurricane to hit Texas in nearly 40 years. This morning, there are fears that storm surge could reach seven feet. That is easily life threatening. There are also concerns for flashfloods and tornadoes. Let's get right to Meteorologist Derek Van Dam, who's in Port Lavaca, Texas, with the latest. Derek, what are you seeing?",

      "sentences": "We're still Yes, John, we are on the ground and the central Texas coastline feeling the effects of the first U.S. landfall hurricane of the 2024 season, which promises to be a very active season, and we're getting our first taste of it already. Over 90-mile-per-hour winds reported along the coastline near Matagorda. We have also seen two to five feet of storm surge above normal high tide levels. And the power has flickered on and off at our location, but now getting some of the new numbers from power outages, showing that over 400,000 customers now without power, the majority of them along the coastline.The storm has been on our radar for nearly two weeks. It's made three landfalls now here in the continental United States. And it has been a significant storm of note. Hurricane Beryl, 80 miles per hour, that's a Category 1 hurricane. But there have been so many threats associated with this system. Currently right now, Harris County, including Metropolitan Houston under a flash flood warning until 8:00 A.M. This encompasses over 150,000 people, but also several other people all the way to the coastline as well. This is because rain has been incessant. We've reported over a half a foot in some locations, Houston over three inches, 1.5 at the moment. But there are other locations around the metro that have reported three inches with more to come. This storm could dump over a foot of rain. So, that is why there is this flashflood warning, some of the heaviest precipitation moving through the area. The right quadrant of a hurricane, that's the most dangerous part, John. You've been in these storms enough to know that they spin up tornadoes quickly. About a half hour ago, there was a tornado warning in Houston Metropolitan and that watch for a tornado lasts until 10:00 A.M. this morning. Continuing, we've got the storm surge component to this as well. And Galveston Bay has already reported four feet and rising above normal high tide values, the wind threat, of course, ongoing with gusts in excess of 50 to 60 miles per hour, knocking down the power and blowing some of the transformers around us and behind us as well. This storm is not another Harvey. It is going to move quickly out of the region and that means it will limit the extreme rainfall potential for this storm, but nonetheless, flash flooding is still a concern. This is a different storm, but it only takes one to cause the problems, right? John?",

We just went through the eye of the hurricane and had a little bit of a lull one. Now, I'm listening outside and that backside is coming.Our biggest fear is that our citizens want to get out and curious about what it looks like and try to drive around and see the damage. That is not what we need. I'm urging everybody if they don't mind, stay home. We've got several more hours of the extremely high winds, maybe even higher winds than we've seen and certainly a lot more rain.",

Water is covering the roadways now.The good news is our power crews are on standby. They pre-staged, ready to come in and take care of the power outages. But once it's safe, we don't want anybody to get out in the middle of this storm. Our first responders are ready to go. Our county crews are ready to clear the roads, but we don't want to do anything right now. We've still got a couple of hours of this storm. It is a fairly slow- moving storm, about ten miles an hour. We still have a lot of wind and a lot of rain event to come up. I'm urging everybody to please stay in, stay off the roads, give our teams an opportunity to do their assessments once it becomes safe. So, we're still hours into this. We probably need another three and a half to four hours just to get through the storm and then do our assessments.",

I was down there a couple of days ago and just about all of the recreational vehicles. The R.V.s had been pulled out.People were already boarding up their houses down along our coast in the Sargent, Matagorda, and the waterfront of Palacios, these houses are designed. They're built with understanding that high tides can, it can move water over the roads. So that wasn't unexpected. We did expect to have significant flooding. We were hearing a feet-foot storm surge on top of the wave action. So, our folks down there responded, as they always do. We just got off a holiday weekend. We have beautiful beaches along Matagorda. And we just got off a holiday week in a weekend. And so we were really worried about our visitors, but they were able to get out early enough now. So, that's happening just as we expected, significant flooding, road closures all along the Gulf Coast. Bay City is about 17 to 20 miles inland and we're experiencing significant rain, street flooding, a lot of debris on the ground and, again, power outages.",
