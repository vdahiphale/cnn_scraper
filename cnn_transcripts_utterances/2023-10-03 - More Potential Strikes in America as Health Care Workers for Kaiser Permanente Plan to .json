The race is now on to exterminate the bugs with less than a year to go until the Olympics. From metros to high-speed trains, videos have shown them taking over some cinemas and even Charles de Gaulle airport, which is making for an itchy situation as France prepares to host the rest of the world next summer. French officials were preparing to take measures to contain the scourge with transport operators gathering this week to try to find ways of getting rid of the pests. But that`s not enough for some who say the thought of sitting on a bus or a train next to the uninvited seatmates makes their skin crawl. LAURA MMADI, TRAIN PASSENGER (through translator): That really traumatized me. I`ll keep my luggage closed to prevent them from getting to my home. Also, I`m not from here, so once I get home, I`ll have to wash all my clothes.",

A recent governmentreport estimated that about 1 in 10 French households had had bedbug infestations between 2017 and last year. There`s some fumigation companies say business is higher than usual and more urgent. SACHA KRIEF, PEST CONTROL STORE MANAGER (through translator): We`ve had customers calling us up crying, desperate for a solution. And it`s very, very costly when you have to throw away all of your bedding, when you have to undergo works in your apartment. And so you get into a sort of paranoia.",

But aspart of our champions for change series, CNN anchor and correspondent, Sara Sidner recently gave us a unique perspective when she sat down to describe the emotional impact of reporting on conflict from around the world. We`ll hear from her now to get a perspective on what it can be like covering some of the toughest, most impactful stories. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA SIDNER, CNN ANCHOR, SENIOR &amp; INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: For me, fear feels like a poison is being injected into my body. Indeed, let`s pull back a little bit. Let`s pull back just a little bit. Let`s just pull back. Cause we`re -- I`m getting hit by some of the shots. I`m not fearless, but I work past it. I push past it and that actually makes me feel more powerful. This is me. Like I`m not -- I don`t have it all together. Like I don`t want anyone to ever think that I have it all together. Although sometimes it looks like that on TV. I cover a lot of conflict, Libya, The Arab spring, Afghanistan, the Mumbai Attacks. (On camera): -- dealing with, OK. All right. Um -- (Voice-over): In the middle of it, when it looks the scariest to the outsider, those are not the times that bring out that anxiety and that fear. (On camera): We`re out in the open. We have to run. It is literally weeks after I get home. Stop it. Those are the times when it creeps in, there are definitely plenty of us that experience PTSD after some of the things that we see that never leave by the way, every now and then I`ll get a flash of something. I`ve never seen that. You`re what cohort? It looks like. I have some of the most thoughtful kind colleagues, that I could ever ask for. People who literally will write me saying, hey, sis, are you okay? Do you want to talk afterwards? Those are really important outreach. Why am I tearing up? The -- that outreach is really impactful. Sorry. Get it together. OK. I`ve had a lot of colleagues who have reached out and said, are you OK? And sometimes I`m not. And I can actually admit that to them. They have been there. They have done it. And so that`s been really, really, really, really important. If you find someone that understands it is a real special relationship, find your people as I like to say. Anything that can keep you out of that loop at what I like to call the doom loop, I usually just take a deep breath in, and then I take one last sip of air. So like just, that it works for me. Like it, it makes me concentrate on my breath, because that last breath is hard. What`s at your core. What you love, what you love about yourself. Those are the things that bring you back to reality. Literally time changes everything. It is a cycle and we have to go through it. That is tear gas. Let`s shut. That`s part of being human. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
