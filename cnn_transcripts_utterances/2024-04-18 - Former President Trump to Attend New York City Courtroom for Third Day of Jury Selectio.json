Donald Trump will be there to see if he can stay awake, which has been an issue according to people who have watched him in the courtroom.Also, an issue potentially, social media posts that Donald Trump pushed about jury selection. One of our legal analysts says, quote, I think the judge is going to go rip split, but she did not say \"split\" exactly here. So we are standing by to see the judge's reaction. Trump normally speaks before going into court. We will see if he addresses the jury issue then. Also, we will see if he weighs in on what could be the biggest story of the day. House Speaker Mike Johnson putting his job on the line for a vote on Ukraine aid. Will Donald Trump cut him loose? CNN's Kristen Holmes is outside court. Seven jurors so far, we will see where we end up in the next few hours, Kristen. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's right. So let's talk about what we're going to actually see today. And as you mentioned, Donald Trump is likely to leave in the next hour, and he is expected to stop and speak to the cameras. Remember, he is still running a presidential campaign. He is going to use every opportunity he can to paint this trial as unfair, as election interference, as we have seen him do for the last several months. So today, we are talking about another 96 jurors being brought into the courtroom. That means the judge is going to first talk to them. Is there anyone who feels like they can't be impartial? That's going to dismiss several people. Last time, it was more than half of the pool that had come in. Then there's going to be conversations about anyone else who feels for some reason they are to fit to serve in this jury. That will dismiss another handful of people. Then we get to that questionnaire, the questionnaire we have been talking about that asks the basic questions, what your name is, where you're from, how old you are, what you do for a living, but also those questions that are directly related to this case. Have you ever attended a Trump rally? Have you ever attended any kind of anti-Trump even? Again, more people will get weeded out. Now, at the very end of this, we know that Donald Trump and his team as well as the prosecutors only have four strikes left. Those are those strikes that they get to just dismiss a juror for any reason. That is something thing that Donald Trump has complained about. He says he should get unlimited strikes. He also continues to say he can't get a fair trial here in New York. But one post was particularly striking that he put on Truth Social last night. We're going to pull it up for you here. He was quoting a FOX News anchor, but he said, \"They are catching undercover liberal activists lying to the judge in order to get on the Trump jury.\" There is absolutely no evidence of that right now, but that is a line that Donald Trump has said time and time again, this idea that people are sneaking onto the jury. And I will tell you, John, speaking to both sides, the prosecution and the defense, there is a concern about that. But again, no one is being caught in this moment. That is not a factual statement. I do want to say one thing about the Johnson comments that you mentioned, because I think this flew under the radar on Friday when there was so much news. Donald Trump, I actually asked him when I was at Mar-a-Lago what he would do if Johnson moved forward with a Ukraine aid package. He essentially said that they were talking about it, that there might be a way to do it as a loan, but I'm pointing that out because this was really the first time that he didn't adamantly say no foreign aid to Ukraine. He said they were trying to work through that. And as we reported over the weekend, we have heard from multiple sources that Johnson was advised that he should be briefing Trump on anything he does about Ukraine. So that's another aspect of the story that we should keep in mind when we're talking about Trump and Johnson.",

And since it doesn't sound to me like the post is about an actual, specific, real juror, right. It's sort of purporting to describe somebody who might exist, but who according to Kristen's reporting doesn't actually exist, it's not actually about a juror.It does fall into a broader category of sort of talking about the jurors. And so I look, I think Sara, this is the extraordinarily difficult line that the judge is going to navigate in this case, because the former president is going to always push the envelope in terms of his public statements. He does have first amendment rights. The judge does need to make sure that he stays in accordance with the gag or and doesn't threaten court personnel, doesn't threaten jurors, doesn't talk about them specifically. But it's going to be very, very difficult. Monetary fines, in my judgement, would have to be of extraordinary amounts to actually matter and be a deterrent to the former president.",

Another as an oncology nurse. There's a corporate lawyer who lives in Chelsea.

This is the highest profile trial going on in the country. All of their associates and family members and coworkers and so forth are going to probably know. And so you're relying not actually just on the jurors themselves, but on a wider network of individuals to try to protect them.And so we will see that the jurors will be seated. There also will be alternatives who are seated, so that if a juror at some point becomes unable to serve for whatever reason, including public identification, then there will be alternates.

They're saying that their service has been restored. Same thing with South Dakota, so Sioux Falls and also Rapid City are concerned, but we also heard about outages in Del Rio, Texas as well as in Chase County, Nebraska. They have not indicated that their services are back online at this point. We had learned about these outages because a lot of these areas put it out on their Facebook feeds that they weren't working. But how you were able to get in touch with 911 varies depending on where you are. In South Dakota, they are saying texting 911 worked in most locations while in Texas, they're saying that the outage was because of that major cellular carrier slightly different if you look at Nebraska where they said the outage was for all carriers except for T-Mobile. And it is also interesting too that they would say in Texas that they are saying, use a different carrier. I don't know if people have multiple phones that they could do that if they are on two different carriers, but also to look at landline and text worked.  Alternately, if you take a look at Vegas, they were saying texting from a landline was not working or calling from a landline was not working, but if you called or texted, if you call from a 911 number from your cell phone, they would see that you called and directly call you right back. What is unclear though is why this happened, if any of it is connected, and also how long it might take for those two states to get their areas back online, but obviously very scary if people had any emergencies late last night, John.",
