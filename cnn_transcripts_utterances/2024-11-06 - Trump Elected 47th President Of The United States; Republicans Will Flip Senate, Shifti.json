There are some Black voters who might live in some of the urban areas there.I want you to take a look in North Carolina among Black voters. Look, Kamala Harris easily won among Black voters in North Carolina. But I want you to take a note of that Trump 12 percent. Do you know four years ago what percentage Donald Trump got in North Carolina among Black voters? It was just seven percent. It was just seven percent. Nearly a doubling of his support among Black voters. Let's look specifically at Black men -- Black men. This, to me, says it all in my humble opinion. If we look among Black men, what do we see among Black men? We see that -- if we pull it up here -- maybe we'll get it, maybe we won't get it. There we go, Black men. There we go. Look at this. Donald Trump getting 21 percent among Black men. Four years ago he was south of 10 percent. He was in the single digits. Black women basically stayed the same from four years ago, but Black men moved in big numbers to Donald Trump in North Carolina -- something that, of course, the Donald Trump campaign believed that they could do throughout the country. Definitely seen in North Carolina. And then finally, Black Independents. Democrats basically held. They held their support among Independents -- Black Independents. But look at this. Donald Trump, 28 percent among Black Independents. Four years ago, Donald Trump got just 15 percent. Again, doubling. This is what we're seeing. Democrats were still winning among Black voters, still winning among Black men, still winning among Black Independents. But Donald Trump was able to shrink the margin just like he did with Latino voters nationwide. Donald Trump going into communities of color and winning large chunks of support that simply put, John Berman, we really never see.",

So a pretty significant shift -- a pretty significant gain from the former president. Where did he gain? This is the most fascinating element of this for me. Which county? So there's 62 counties, John, in the state of New York. I counted them myself just to prove it to myself that was the case. Thirty-six of them represent places where Donald Trump is overperforming his 2020 results by three percent or better. Not overperformed by a vote -- not by one percent -- by three percent or better. That includes, of course, Nassau County. This was a county that in 2020, Joe Biden won it by 9 1/2 points. Donald Trump flipped it into his favor, leading it with 95 percent reporting, by almost five points. So again, didn't flip the state. He said he might be able to -- didn't. But not unlike New Jersey, not unlike Massachusetts, and not unlike some of the other areas around here, he did much better than he had before.

Republicans are going to take the Senate. They have done that. They have 52. That includes three pickups. That's where they flipped those Democratic seats. Now, Democrats with 42 and that includes on Independent. There are six seats remaining. A lot of those are within battleground states, so we're going to continue to monitor those. But we do know for sure Republicans will control the House. So let's -- I'm sorry, the Senate. Let's now look at the House. The question there is who will be in control? This is where Democrats hope maybe they can hold the line, John. That maybe this is where they can be a check on President Trump. And, of course, Republicans would very much like to maintain their majority because that would mean they would have all the levers of government. So again, the magic number in the House, 218. Right now, Republicans at 204 with five pickups. Democrats at 182 with two pickups. That means we have 49 seats remaining. And John, as you alluded to, those are kind of spread out all across the country. A lot of those are in California, which we know take a while to count. So we are keeping our eyes on those.
