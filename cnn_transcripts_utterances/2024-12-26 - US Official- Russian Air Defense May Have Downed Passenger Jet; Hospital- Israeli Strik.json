You are watching CNN NEWSROOM.Families are searching for answers after the deadly Christmas crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines plane in Kazakhstan. The US is now weighing in, telling CNN early indications suggest that the plane may have been downed by a Russian anti-aircraft system. At least 38 people on board were killed in the disaster, and remarkably, there are 29 survivors. CNN's Nada Bashir reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over): This is the moment an Azerbaijani plane attempted an emergency landing, bursting into flames upon impact. Rescuers rushed to the scene, extinguishing the fire that engulfed the front of the plane and pulling out dazed survivors from the wreckage. Out of 67 people on board, including crew, at least 38 died. Remarkably, 29 people, including two children, survived and were taken to hospitals. Questions swirled on why the plane, which took off from the Azerbaijani capital Baku en route to Grozny in Russia, diverted to Kazakhstan. Flightradar24 shows the plane flying across the Caspian Sea and circling in the Kazakh city of Aktau before the crash, in a pattern, an aviation expert says indicates loss of flight control systems. The crash came shortly after drone strikes hit Southern Russia, and while investigators say they are exploring all scenarios, multiple Azerbaijani sources have told Reuters that the plane was hit by Russian air defenses. Video verified by Reuters reveals a rare glimpse into the last moments on board the flight. Oxygen masks down as the camera tilts to the window, showing damage to the wing. Then, in another geolocated social media video, the plane appears to nosedive. In the resulting explosion, the plane fuselage is broken into parts, with its rear half miraculously landing almost intact, but upturned. Parts of the plane scattered across a wide radius. Bodies seen covered in blue blankets. Russia and Azerbaijan evacuated their injured citizens as families in Baku waited to see if their loved ones had survived. For Azerbaijan, it is a time of mourning. Nada Bashir, CNN, London. Atpe2",

So in trying to determine what caused this or what it was, I looked into why these holes would be different now than they were with the MH370, excuse me, with the MH17 and it makes sense now because they've been upgraded, these missiles now, the Pantsir-S is a missile that has smaller projectiles that come out with it. They are more designed for drones and that sort of thing. So it is more likely in my mind now, after analyzing these photographs and some of the information about how the aircraft flew and how it hit the ground, it makes a lot more sense to me now that it was indeed some type of missile or attack from the side of the aircraft, not from the front.",

So there is pretty convincing evidence at that point. But the black boxes will be able to verify what happened to the control systems whether the pumps were still working, whether or not the pressure inside of those hydraulic control systems were working. So there is a lot of information we can still get from the black boxes, and I am sure that we will get that pretty quickly, because those are already in the hands of the authorities now.

The head of pediatrics at Nasser Hospital says it is \"one of the disastrous results\" of what he calls Israel's \"criminal war.\"Authorities at another hospital say an Israeli strike killed five journalists overnight. You can see the back of their vehicle was marked press when it was hit. Now, Israel confirmed the strike, saying that it targeted Islamic jihad militants posing as journalists. This, as Israel also carried out strikes in Yemen today, hitting the international airport in Sanaa, as well as military facilities. Houthi run media says at least four people were killed. The World Health Organization chief says he and his team were just meters away from the blast at the airport. The strikes come after a series of Houthi attacks against Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is determined to root out what he calls a branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil. So let's bring in Elliott Gotkine from Jerusalem with more on this. And, Elliott, we are starting to get initial images from the aftermath of these strikes in Sanaa. How extensive are they? And can we expect to see more?",

      "sentences": "Bianna, well, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has certainly said that there will be more strikes, whether or not they would be on the airport or not is another matter. But what Israel says it was trying to do with the strikes on the airport and also on a couple of power stations, is really to take out some of the infrastructure that the Houthis have been using to lob ballistic missiles towards Israel. There have been four over the last seven nights.On four of those nights over the past week, millions of Israelis have been forced to scramble towards the nearest safe room or bomb shelter, including myself, along with my 11-year-old daughter on Saturday night, as the sirens have sounded across the country. And indeed the one on Saturday night actually got through, landing in a sandpit in a park, somehow missing the surrounding buildings in the southern part of Tel Aviv. And as you said in your introduction, what Israel is now doing with these strikes is hitting what really seems to be one of the last standing legs of Iranian proxies in the area. Israel, taking the view that, look, they've decimated Hamas in Gaza. They have battered Hezbollah into agreeing to go back to the Litani River, somewhat 30 kilometers or so north of the border between Israel and Lebanon, as agreed when they ended the 2006 War. And so really, it is just the Houthis that seem capable or willing to keep firing these missiles towards Israel. So Prime Minister Netanyahu saying that Israel will not stop until the Houthis, in his words, have learned that they can't get away with firing these ballistic missiles towards Israel without consequences. So, as you say, the main airport in Sanaa, the first time Israel has hit Yemen's main airport, and also a couple of power stations and as you say, the director general of the World Health Organization, having a rather narrow miss, by all accounts, and one of the crew members of the plane that he was due to board being among those who were injured in the strikes carried out by Israel aimed at the Houthis in Yemen -- Bianna.",

But Israel has shown that it is capable of doing so. This is what -- the fourth time that Israel has carried out strikes aimed at Houthis. And of course, when it comes to Yemen, it is not acting alone.We've seen strikes from the United States also aimed at Houthi positions and Houthi munitions and missiles as well, because the Houthis haven't just been striking at Israel, they've also been menacing one of the most important shipping lanes in the world, causing a lot of disruption to global shipping. Many ships now having to avoid the Suez Canal and take the long way round the southern part of Africa instead. So Israel, not completely alone in this one, but as you say, much more complicated and much harder for Israel to deal a devastating blow to the Houthis than it was with Hezbollah, which, of course, is just over the border.",

Joining me now from London is Michelle Wiese Bockmann. She is a principal analyst at Lloyd's List Intelligence and a markets editor at Lloyd's List. Michelle, thank you so much for joining us. First and foremost, what do we know about this Eagle S tanker? MICHELLE WIESE BOCKMANN, PRINCIPAL ANALYST AT LLOYD'S LIST INTELLIGENCE AND MARKETS EDITOR AT LLOYD'S LIST: Good evening. Well, this ship is one of about 26 ships that belong to a cluster of dark fleet tankers that are being used by Russia to evade western sanctions. It is one of linked to three related companies, two of which have been sanctioned by the UK government 12 months ago for being part of Putin's fleet and we also know that the ship is in terrible condition. It has recently been found to have a number of safety deficiencies and that it is an environmental risk and it is a danger, a safety danger to the crew.

It has tripled in size since Russia invaded Ukraine as Russia seeks ways to evade western sanctions and the G7 price cap on oil and a rising danger to the waters through which they sail, including the Danish Strait in this case, and they also come down through the English Channel.",

Singh was known as the Reluctant King when he became prime minister in 2004, because he never aspired to such a lofty government position. He started his career as an economist and was widely praised for modernizing the Indian economy and lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLODRYGA (voice over): Manmohan Singh became India's 14th prime minister almost by accident. In 2004, after unexpectedly winning national elections, Congress Party leader Sonia Gandhi decided she didn't want the country's top job after all. Instead, she turned to her friend Singh, until then, known for his role in unleashing a bold wave of economic reforms in the early 90s when he was finance minister. His policies saved India from almost certain bankruptcy. They also helped transform it into one of the world's top emerging economies, and he promised to do more when he became India's leader. MANMOHAN SINGH, INDIA'S FORMER PRIME MINISTER: We've always said economic reforms with emphasis on the human element will continue. GOLODRYGA (voice over): But critics say that pace of reforms slowed on his watch and ties with archrival, Pakistan soured after this. The 2008 attacks on Mumbai, blamed by New Delhi on Pakistan, shattered an ongoing peace process. Singh's government was also accused of failing to protect the country. Ties with the US strengthened. Singh signed a landmark nuclear deal with president George W. Bush in 2005, and in 2009 he was guest of honor at US President Barack Obama's first White House State Dinner.",
