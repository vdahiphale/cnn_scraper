ONE WORLD starts right now. Secretary Austin in the last hour telling reporters that he apologized to President Biden for not immediately telling him about his cancer diagnosis. He says his first instinct was to keep it private. Also ahead, details you have to see to believe. New evidence in the case against the mother of a mass shooter. And later, a story resilience. I'll speak with a mother who survived the harrowing attack on October 7th. Now, she's turning her trauma into an act of service. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today, you are watching ONE WORLD. The U.S. Defense Secretary says that he apologized to the President for not disclosing his hospitalization. Of course, we're talking about Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin. Last year, he was treated for prostate cancer, then hospitalized for complications. Austin's condition was not disclosed to the media, President Biden, or the administration. That raised concerns about transparency and communication within the administration. In his first news conference since the beginning in hospital, Austin told reporters that he should have done things differently. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  But I want to be crystal clear. We did not handle this right. I did not handle this right. I should have told the President about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, that review itself is due in just a few days here, about a week or so from now, and I asked Austin, is he going to make that public? He said he would commit to making as much of it public as he could, knowing that some of it relates to what are essentially the classified procedures for how the transfer responsibility is done. So, not a firm, committal answer there, but at least committing to revealing or shedding light on some part of this, because that's been one of the key questions. How did this whole process fall apart so much over the course of the past month or so? And it was exactly one month ago that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin went to the hospital for complications from the surgery to treat prostate cancer. It's worth noting, and we saw this right at the top of the show, that as he entered the Pentagon briefing room, he was moving slowly, he was limping, he seemed to speak just a little bit quieter. He apologized. He said he apologized directly to President Joe Biden in a phone call. When he was asked, has he ever considered resigning, was there any talk of his resignation, he said there has not been. He also said that there was no order ever given by him or his staff to keep this quiet or keep it hidden in any way. There are questions about discussions amongst his staff. He deflected there again to that 30-day review saying that the review would essentially reveal more of that. So, we'll certainly wait to see what we can learn about it. It's also worth noting that he spoke about public notification here and how that will play out in the future. He then pivoted to Iran. There were quite a few questions about that and the deadly strike the killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan a few days ago. He said, they, referring to the militias there, have a lot of capabilities, I have a lot more. So, Bianna, being very clear there, as has the President, there will be a U.S. response coming.",

Welcome both of you. General Hertling, let me start with you because as we have reported, U.S. intelligence suggesting that Iran did not anticipate the strike over the weekend that killed three U.S. service members. That having been said, just on Tuesday, the Houthis launched a cruise missile that was shot down just as it came within one mile of a U.S. destroyer. Typically, they're shot down at about an eight-mile range. So, the brazenness of some of these axes of, and proxies of Iran continues to grow.

      "sentences": "Well, I'm not going to go into that, Bianna, to be honest with you, because there are all kinds of scenariosthat might have different contingencies and different courses of actions. Having been involved in sessions in the past when key leaders are trying to determine exactly what they should do, there are things that we don't know right now in terms of the political action. But the first thing I'd like to say is, you know, to comment on Congressman Crenshaw's comments a minute ago, you know, what's been interesting over the last couple of decades in the United States, the military element of power has been the first one relied upon by the politicians. And I think what the current administration is doing is attempting to ensure we don't get into another war by using the other elements of national power, which are diplomacy, information, and the use of the economy. I think we're tracking very closely what Iran is thinking, what their intelligence or what we're gathering from intelligence in the area. They have had conversations with Iraq. They've had those kinds of conversations in the past. They also know that many of their popular military forces, the PMFs, are somewhat free-floating electrons. They do what they want to do with the support of Iran. But those elements sometimes get Iran into a lot of trouble in terms of diplomacy. So, I think the Biden administration is attempting to measure the right kind of strike against the various PMS and the Houthi rebels and the other factors that are trying to attack U.S. soldiers in the region. And they're considering how you balance the very fine edge between making sure people are deterred -- organizations are deterred from attacking the United States versus starting a World War III as Congressman Crenshaw sort of pooh-pooh. He is not a national security intellect in my view. And for him to say something like that just shows how little he knows about the diplomatic arm of national power.",

General, I want you to talk to our viewers about something you touched on last night with Kaitlan Collins, and that is your take on the IDF raid of a hospital in the West Bank. We had IDF troops coming in under the guise of patients and staff, doctors, nurses, what have you -- and killed three members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Both terror groups have claimed that they do work for them or were part of their group. That having been said, you see problems on both sides here. Explain why.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I do, Bianna. First of all, when you're talking about the laws of land warfare or the application of various principles or protocolsof the Geneva Convention, there are certain things that you don't do. First of all, you don't use public facilities like a hospital or a church or a school as your basis of operation. That is what Hamas is doing specifically as part of their strategy to pull Israeli forces into those locations. But the other thing you don't do, and this gets to the Israeli actions, you don't use disguises or the appearance of being a doctor or a rabbi or an imam or any kind of religious figure when you're carrying weapons. That's not allowed on the battlefield. It violates the laws of land warfare in the Geneva Convention protocols. So, what you're seeing in this particular case is Israeli soldiers using disguises to go into a prohibited facility. So, both sides are at fault in this particular -- at fault in violating the laws of armed warfare. But one thing that you always have to come back to, and that's the right of self-defense. What Israel is doing, even though they're doing it improperly in my view, is saying, hey, there's the potential for future terrorist attacks to be launched from this hospital inside of the West Bank, so we want to prevent it. The way they did it is questionable. But again, the lawyers will have to determine what's right and what's wrong. The problem is when you're dealing with terrorist groups like Hamas, like the IJU -- the Islamic Jihad Union, and other organizations like those, sometimes you have to beat them at their own game. And I think that's what Israel was trying to do, right or wrong.",

Two sources tell CNN, the Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has fired Army Chief Valery Zaluzhny. A rift between the two reportedly began after last year's major counteroffensive failed. And then in a magazine interview last fall with \"The Economist\", Zaluzhny described the war with Russia as a stalemate. The official word of his firing is expected later this week.

Now, that operation was apparently conducted by Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency and the head of that agency, Kyrylo Budanov, he's one of those who's being talked about as a possible successor to the current commanding general, Valerii Zaluzhny. I was able to sit down with Kyrylo Budanov and asked him what exactly the Ukrainians need in the short term to bring the fight to the Russians. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYRYLO BUDANOV, HEAD OF UKRAINIAN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE (through translator):  We're confident that the United States will fulfill the commitment it has made to our society. We really need this aid. Shells are one of the most decisive factors in this war. It's about quantity, not so much the quality as the quantity. Next there are assault aircraft. These are aircraft of the type that the United States has, like the A-10 Thunderbolt II and so on. This is what can really help inflict a military defeat.

One of the things that he did say is, obviously, they will need a lot of shells, a lot of help to do that. Certainly today's decision by the European Union to give Ukraine more military aid and give them military aid over several years is definitely something that's going to be a big help to the Ukrainians.

At least, 150 million euros that will be unblocked in tax subsidies, help with taxes, and other social benefits to try and get them through these difficult times. And it appears to have worked, certainly insofar as the two main farmers unions here in France are concerned. They've told farmers that it's now time to keep up the movement, keep up the pressure on the governments, try and get more, but to leave those roadblocks that we'd seen progressively move closer and closer to the French capital, getting so close yesterday that they got to the line that had been fixed by Paris police, who'd vowed that no tractors would enter the French capital. And so, we wait to see if the farmers will heed that call and leave the barrages, the roadblocks that they'd set up around the country. But certainly this is a movement, as you say, that has grown, that has spread so much so that what we saw today was not just the farmers make themselves heard in Brussels, they even managed to force the issue onto the European leaders agenda. They've been meeting to talk about Ukraine, as you were discussing a moment ago. In the end, they're having to talk also about what relief they can bring at a European level to farmers, partly Bianna, because a lot of the anger that we're seeing from Poland through Germany, the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Spain -- is aimed at the E.U. What European farmers are saying is that they are not only suffering from efforts made by national governments to help fight against food inflation that we've seen over the last couple of years, but also from European red tape, environmental laws, that make it hard for them to function and impossible, they say, for them to compete, especially when the E.U. allows cheap imports, for instance, of Ukrainian grain, as it has been since the beginning of the Russian invasion. So, they feel they're constrained by rules that don't apply to others, but their products are made to compete. That's essentially what their beef is. And it appears that European leaders are beginning to hear them. Remember that there are European elections coming up in just a few months, and everyone's going to be keeping a close eye to see what this important constituency of voters is going to do. Will that protest continue to grow? Or on the contrary, will these concessions will begin, will they finally begin to take some of the wind out of the sails of the farmers movement? Bianna.",

But this case really begins with that mass shooting at Oxford High School right after Thanksgiving in 2021. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
