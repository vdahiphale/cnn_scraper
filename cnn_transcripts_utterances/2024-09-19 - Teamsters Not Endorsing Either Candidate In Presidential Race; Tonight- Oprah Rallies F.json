      "sentences": "In a big blow for Kamala Harris, the Teamsters announced yesterday that they will not endorse her this year. They aren't endorsing Donald Trump either. This is the first time since 1996 that the union is withholding its endorsement.Joining me now is the president of the Teamsters, Sean O'Brien. Thank you so much for being here. I want to go back to the announcement. You said neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before big business. You met with Vice President Harris this week on Tuesday. What commitments were you looking for from her that she did not provide? SEAN O'BRIEN, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS: Well, one biggest commitment is we want our members a commitment that the government will not interfere or try and impede our right to strike in any collective bargaining situations we're in. In 2022, our rail railroad workers were forced into a contract and they were not happy about it. So under the Railway Labor Act, we want to make certain moving forward that those commitments are met. We asked about people that are currently in the administration that have been good working with us. We couldn't get commitments on that either. So, Donald Trump, when he came in, he couldn't commit to vetoing national right to work. So there are a lot of issues that are important to our members, that are important to our organization as an international, that we couldn't get commitments on. You know, we got -- couldn't get commitments on the PRO Act from President Trump and then couldn't -- you know, so those are the important issues that are important to us.",

Maybe this is hard to answer, but if Joe Biden were still at the top of the ticket, do you think the non-endorsement would still be the case, I mean, if you would have endorsed him? O'BRIENSo it's a problem that we create, they created, and they finally fixed, and we're grateful for it. But, you know, Joe Biden wasn't polling all well either. Remember, Joe Biden was in the race, and we polled, and he was polling about 34 percent with our members.",

      "sentences": "So just building on that, you mentioned a little bit of this, but I'll just give you -- give even more details to our viewers. No Republicans in the Senate supported the bill that bailed out approximately 600,000 pensions for the Teamsters.Kamala Harris cast the tiebreaking vote. No Republicans currently support the PRO Act. If Democrats are the ones that consistently not to support your legislative priorities, but pass them into law, why are you refusing to endorse and give her the really key boots on the ground grassroots in a 50-50 race? O'BRIEN: Well, I just may want to clean up a couple of things that are inconsistent with the Congresswoman stated that the President of the United States, along with the former Secretary of Labor, was calling the Teamsters for help to try and settle it because they were afraid that if a rail strike happened that it would throw the country into a recession. We were not calling on the administration. We were calling on the administration to stay out of it. And I've quoted this many times, that my neighborhood that I grew up in, which you're familiar with in Boston, if two people are having a disagreement, you have nothing to do with it, you keep on walking. So that statement's inconsistent. Now, she has to remember that, you know, there is a clear divide, especially in Teamster members, between the Democrats and the Republicans. And instead of trying to pick a fight with labor leaders who listen to their members and embrace their members opinions, she should maybe get into her district, where it voted, far Republican, far-right Republican, and maybe find out what the problem is. When I have a problem in a worksite, and there is criticism, I get right in there and find out what that problem is --",

      "sentences": "I want to ask a little bit more about that polling, if it is accurate, it would mean that almost 60 percent of your members do prefer former President Trump over Vice President Harris. But I just want to give a small sample of Donald Trump's record on union issues.He appointed Supreme Court justices that were part of major decisions going against unions. He appoints the -- to the NLRB, people who consistently rule against labor. He visited a non-union auto plant while the UAW was striking and encouraged union members to boycott their dues. And you, of course, remember last month when he was on with Elon Musk praising Musk for firing striking workers, you called him -- you called that economic terrorism. And, you know, you do have, I understand that there is some split, but you do have people like James Curbeam who is the head of the Teamsters Black Caucus saying that what you have done is chosen not to stand up to a bully and an anti-union candidate and not endorsing Kamala Harris. O'BRIEN: Yes, James Curbeam, you know, he's -- he represents a certain group that's not affiliated directly with the Teamsters Union. And, you know, look, I criticize President Trump, I'll criticize anybody that attacks labor, crosses picket lines, or whatever else, and this was not an endorsement for the Republican Party. This is a wakeup call that the system is broken, if far -- it's far too long that the Democratic Party, and I'm a Democrat, has, just got their way. We need to hold them accountable. But this is an opportunity as well for both parties to take a hard look. The Democrats refocus and say, something's wrong. We've got to recapture American workers. What do we need to do? And this is an opportunity for publics who claim they want to be the working party for American workers to prove that they can do that by supporting the PRO Act and passing the PRO Act and help develop a PRO Act. Our goal in this whole thing is to work bipartisan and get things done for working people. And look, as far as schoolyard bullies go, my record's proven. We've had 227 strikes since my administration. We've won a historic contract, largest collective bargaining agreement because of our members. And we're going to continue to do that. People can call names. That's what's wrong with this whole process. People get so personal instead of trying to fix a problem and find some collaboration to effectuate some change that's needed in this country.",
