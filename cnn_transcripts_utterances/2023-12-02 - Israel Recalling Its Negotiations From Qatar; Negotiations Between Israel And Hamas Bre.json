There are a couple unmanned drones flying along with him and artificial intelligence in his visor gives him four options for what to do next when he's being attacked.It doesn't tell him what to do, right? Because they often talk about how you will keep a human involved, but you have A.I. kind of whispering in your ears, so to speak, what you might do next. Of course, You also have circumstances where you have to know what the standards are then. Who's actually making the firing decision? How do you control so no one else that's not a human being can make those firing decisions? These are all things that are being developed as we speak.

There is a small population, particularly among Republicans in the House, who are standing in the way. The leadership won't even bring this to the floor.So, negotiations are underway to get over that. They've been focused in the Senate where you would have a combination of things, Ukraine, Israel, but also new measures for border security. And that appears to be the price that Democrats, the administration are going to have to pay in order to get both Ukraine and Israel aid together over the finish line. And we discussed this earlier, Jessica. There's not necessarily broad democratic opposition to that. A lot of democratic -- border state Democrats, they are for some changes, some increase in standards, restrictions at the border, particularly for asylum seekers, but those negotiations are still underway, and it's happening with enormous urgency on the ground, certainly in Gaza and around Israel, but also in Ukraine as well, because the prospects right now for major progress for Ukrainian forces they don't look very rosy at this point.",

A short time ago, Israel's defense minister blamed Hamas for \"explicitly violating their truce agreement to return all women and children,\" saying there are still 15 women and two children being held by that terror group. With the truce now broken, Israel has stepped up its attacks on Gaza, saying it's launched more than 400 strikes on the enclave in the first 24 hours since the truce expired. And Israel is expanding its strikes as well, hitting targets in Southern Gaza. We're going to take you there in just a moment. But first, we're going to stay here domestically, we will go back out to the Middle East in a moment. But we're going to turn first to the historic expulsion of the indicted Congressman George Santos. The New York Republican was ousted in a 311 to 114 vote yesterday, and it's leaving some people wondering what happens to Santos now, he's still facing criminal indictment, which includes allegations of defrauding his constituents, using campaign funds for Botox, designer clothes and luxury trips. Now, Democratic New York Governor Kathy Hochul says she's prepared to name someone to fill that vacancy for the rest of the term. Joining me now is \"New York Times\" reporter Grace Ashford and CNN senior political analyst and senior editor of \"The Atlantic, Ron Brownstein. Ron -- it's great to have both of you. Ron, let's start first with you. Long Island has evolved toward the Republican Party in the Trump era. It's become a bit more red. Can the Democrats reverse that trend with the Santos replacement and help people understand why the Republican leadership was very nervous about this? Because it makes their small majority even smaller?",

He is due in court next -- in a couple of weeks. But his -- and his trial date is set for September of 2024. That's obviously sometime off. You know, if we could see a sooner resolution if he makes some sort of a deal with prosecutors, but thus far, he seemed somewhat uninterested in doing that. Beyond his criminal case though, he's suggested that we have not seen the last of him. You know, he said that he wants to write a book. He has not ruled out some sort of political future, although he said definitely not in the State of New York. And, you know, he's sort of -- he didn't even really rule out reality TV, at one point, sort of in a joking exchange with reporters, sort of said, you know, maybe not now, but maybe in the future \"Dancing with the Stars.\"",

I mean, you know, what we've seen, as you know, is this incredible deference to Trump among Republicans really up and down the ballot. And that is both because they feel that they need his constituency, his ability to mobilize those irregular voters, but also because they also fear what he can do to them if he stands up against him. And Santos, I think, also has to be seen as part of what is a worrying trend of more members, particularly on the Republican side, viewing a seat in the House less as an opportunity to make law or to represent their constituents and more to kind of establish a critical -- a political brand, almost a showmanship brand and treating it like a reality show, even while they are in office. And, you know, he's not the only one I think you could apply that characterization to, but he's certainly the one who combined that with the most overt lawbreaking.",

You can hear there's some police going past now as well.But, yes. So, I'm not quite sure what you're seeing, because I -- there you are. Right. There you are. You can see that that's the kind of sort of nightly occurrence that's happening now. That's the sort of thing that's happening every night now in Tel Aviv as the military operation by Israel inside the Gaza Strip continues. Militants there, Hamas, other militant groups as well, are still -- they still have the resources, it seems, to fire rockets out of the Gaza Strip into Israeli territory. And that's what that was a response to there. As I say, Jessica, I was here at a vigil for the hostages inside the Gaza Strip that are still there's some 130 or so Israelis and other nationalities that are still held by Hamas and other militant groups inside the Gaza Strip. This was a vigil to -- you know, to sort of make sure that, you know, everybody was doing whatever they could to get them out. And of course, it's the priority of the families and many people in Israel to get those hostages out as soon as possible. There's a bit of a difference of opinion in to how best to do that. There are those that believe that negotiations and everything should be done as soon as possible to make sure those people come out and come out alive if possible. And there are others that think, well, maybe the course of the current phase of negotiations has run out and it may be better, and this is what the Israeli government is doing, to put more military pressure on Hamas, hopefully -- to hopefully get that to bear fruit and forget -- to get Hamas to release more hostages. But a difference of opinion about how to get there, but underlying a great deal of unity across Israel that the country needs to do everything it can to get those hostages back alive if possible.",

Now, senior advisers still say that Iowa could be a wild card. But we are expecting to hear Donald Trump really taking that confidence and pivoting to a general election today. We are told by a senior Trump adviser he's going to be focused on attacking President Joe Biden. And this really is just the latest signal of a pivot to the general election. Trump's team just launched a six-figure ad buy here in Iowa, it's a television ad buy, and one of the ads focuses almost exclusively on attacks on the president. Now, Donald Trump's criticisms come at the same time that President Biden seems to be ramping up his criticisms of Donald Trump, both of them looking at these poll numbers clearly and looking towards a general election. Last week, Trump started this renewed interest in overturning Obamacare, something that Democrats seized on Biden campaign, even releasing an ad on that, using that opportunity as ammunition as the Affordable Care Act has grown increasingly more popular. But one thing to note here is that even though Donald Trump is looking at the general election, even though he is planning on attacking President Biden, I just listened to him speak across the state, and that speech was focused on mostly Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, who he has still clearly not gotten over that he endorsed -- that she endorsed Ron DeSantis over him in Iowa.",

This is something that they have been embarking on for months now, trying to blanket the state with appearances, hoping to generate some momentum for this candidate. But his support in this state has not really moved very much since this 99-county tour began. He's still well behind Former President Donald Trump in this state. He's now also facing competing pressure from Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. So, it's additional competition for him in this state that is just going to complicate the math for him. But his campaign tells me they have not only done a lot of appearances here, but they are doing the work of building out a large ground campaign. Here are some of the stats that they have been pushing out in the last couple of days. They have 41 endorsements from state lawmakers. They have 120 county level chairs. He has the support of 100 faith leaders and 26 Iowa sheriffs, and 30,000 Iowans have already committed to caucus for him.

But this is obviously a very unusual thing to do, and it was trying to serve multiple purposes. And, you know, they kind of collided at various points, certainly between the moderator, Sean Hannity and Ron DeSantis.You got a strong preview of some of the general election arguments that Republicans are going to make against President Biden. In many ways, that was kind of the weakest moments, I thought, for Newsom in responding to some of those. And it gives you an idea of the challenge that Democrats are going to have and to developing arguments about his record about crime and immigration and prices. But to me, the two big takeaways was we're -- first, just the enormous gulf that we are living through in the way red states and blue states are separating on virtually every issue. I mean, there were -- there have been times in our history, obviously, Jim Crow segregation and before the Civil War, between slavery and free states, where there was a single issue that divided the states maybe more profoundly than what we're seeing now. But what you saw last Thursday was the breath of the separation that we are living through on economic, health care and social issues between red states and blue states, and just a fundamental centrifugal force that of modern American politics. And the other thing I think was just how hard it is for Democrats to penetrate that red state bubble. I mean, I interviewed Newsom before the debate and, you know, he said his principal goal was not so much to rebut or counter DeSantis, it was to make the case for Biden and for Democratic governance to the Fox red state audience. He really never got a chance to do that because Sean Hannity cherry- picked over and over again data points that make California look as bad as possible while ignoring all of the comparisons that make California look better than Florida. So, in many ways, it was kind of a tag team two on one in which Hannity was trying to present this in a very familiar and comfortable frame for his audience that red states are thriving and blue states are chaotic hell holes.",

My lesson from cancer is this, you could fight cancer in the old days with chemotherapy. What that does, it obliterates everything in sight, healthy, unhealthy, and it destroys the cancer as well as healthy cells.We've now come up with better treatment called immunotherapy, which fortunately I'm on. What that does is it targets the cancer so that it spares healthy cells. What's going on in Gaza now is kind of like chemotherapy, where Israel is obliterating everything in sight. Do they have the right to do it? Yes. Is it the right way to do it? I don't think so. I think what we should do is seek out those forces for peace within Palestinian society and declare tomorrow the existence of a Palestinian State on the West Bank once they respect and acknowledge Israel's right to exist and then take out Hamas surgically, not wantonly. And I think if we do that, we can spare the suffering and we can let the people of Gaza see that there's hope. There's a way. Make peace with Israel and your future will be bright. Elect a terrorist to represent you and it'll be more death and destruction.",

It follows the 1976 kidnapping of a school bus full of children and their driver, who were buried underground for more than 12 hours before they orchestrated their own dramatic escape.The incident captivated the nation at the time and really became a turning point in our understanding and treatment of childhood trauma. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has more. And we do want to warn, you may find some of the following images disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

DR. LENOR TERR, CHILD PSYCHIATRIST:  The kids were not OK. Somebody got a psychiatrist to come to town and he made a prediction. He said, one kid in this 26 is going to have a problem. But what happened was that no parent wanted to admit that his kid was the one in 26. By the time I got out here, 100 percent of those kids were having problems. DR. SPENCER ETH, CHIEF OF MEDICAL HEALTH, MIAMI VA HEALTHCARE SYSTEM: Well, there was no diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder in 1976. It not only didn't exist for children. It didn't exist for adults either. There was no protocol. There was no way that we knew how to respond after this event at that time. GUPTA (voiceover):  They did what they thought was best, send the kids on a trip to Disneyland, never speak about it again, and just allow those children to move on with their lives.
