What ultimately do you think we will learn from missions like this?O'BRIEN: Well, I think a lot of the things are kind of a repeat of what we learned 60 years ago with NASA. But, what happened was NASA moved in another direction with the space shuttle. It was not necessarily pushing beyond low Earth orbits. This is which we first began exploring. Need further development with new technology, is kind of where we at. So, 60 years ago, Ed White became the first U.S. astronaut to do his space walk outside of the Gemini mission. He was the second human to do it. Alexei Leonov did it for the Soviet Union, nearly got killed doing so. But, obviously, technology has marched on, and it's time maybe to reimagine some of these challenges with new technology. One of the things they'll be doing between now and landing, for example, is they'll be testing the Starlink system for communication, which is a space-based system, another Elon Musk company, and try to communicate back to Earth using that bandwidth, using lasers. So, it is kind a back to the future kind of moment, or future forward, whatever you want to say, but revisiting some ideas that were initially explored but not fully developed 60 years ago.",

How important is that moving forward, especially given what we saw at NASA over the last couple of decades?O'BRIEN: Yeah. Well, it's kind of -- you got to give Elon Musk credit as a business person. His commander wrote about a nine-figure check in order to be the commander of this mission. I'd say that's kind of an interesting business model that he has got there.",

He is happy to be in history, and Elon Musk gets to push things forward. So, it's a whole new way of doing business in space, quite literally. NASA, of course, seeded this a couple of decades ago with SpaceX, and at first, sending cargo to the International Space Station, now people, and you can't argue with the success it's been. This is the 14th Crew Dragon mission, and poor old Boeing still can't figure out how to fly Starliner to the space station. So, this idea appears to be a good formula.",

Thanks.U.S. lawmakers are renewing pressure on President Joe Biden to lift weapons restrictions currently in place for Ukraine. Kyiv, of course, has been asking the White House to allow Ukraine to use U.S.-provided long-range weapons to strike deep inside Russia. In other bipartisan efforts to lift those restrictions, one U.S. Senator, Democrat Ben Cardin, saying Washington needs to act swiftly. Pressed this morning in Warsaw, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken would only say that American policy will adapt as the war changes, and that he will be briefing President Biden on the discussions that he had earlier in Ukraine. CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt joining me now from Washington, D.C. So, look, the pressure is certainly building on the Biden administration.

So, this is a question not just for the Americans, but for the Brits as well. There is a British missile called the Storm Shadow that the Ukrainians would also like to use to fire deeper inside of Russia. Remember, the Ukrainians have taken over this vast swath of territory in the Kursk region of Russia. So, they really have changed the battlefield there.But, Erica, in terms of the reservations here in Washington, D.C., the Biden administration continues to be afraid of the potential for escalation by the Russians. The Russians seeing these U.S. missiles being launched deeper inside of Russia and really escalating the fight. There is also the question of supply. There is not a large number of these missiles. They're called ATACMS. They fly around 200 miles or 300 kilometers. There just aren't that many of them. And so, the U.S. believes that Ukraine could be using the supply that they have more effectively in eastern Ukraine, in places like Crimea. No doubt, Erica, if the U.S. were to make this decision to allow Ukraine to use those missiles inside Russia to target hundreds of miles deeper inside of Russia, it would be a significant political victory for the Ukrainians. There are questions about how effective it would be militarily, but it would send a very strong message to the Russians and to the world about the level of U.S. support, continued U.S. support for Ukraine.

I don't think we can change the mind of President Putin, but we can change his calculus. So, we need to make sure that he understands that he cannot win on the battlefield. He will pay a high price. It will be a lot of suffering if he continues to fight this war, and then he may be willing to sit down and accept a solution where Ukraine prevails as a sovereign and independent nation in Europe.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump, he is in Arizona.Joining me now for a closer look at both campaigns, Priscilla Alvarez joining me from North Carolina who is covering the Harris campaign, and Alayna Treene in Washington with more on the Trump campaign.

Of course, the campaign felt that that was a strong moment in the course of the presidential debate this week, but also in a state like North Carolina, one where they can really make inroads with voters. Of course, this is a state where they think that, given the state of play in the gubernatorial race, they can try to appeal to voters that, as one campaign official put it, aren't diehard Democrats, but are also uninterested in Donald Trump and the GOP gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson, who has been tied to Trump as well.Now, of course, the message too from the Vice President over the last several days has been that they are the underdogs in the race. So, while they're coming out of the debate feeling quite confident and feeling like momentum is still in their favor, they also feel like they cannot guarantee a win just based on that, that this is going to be a close race, and that is how they are going to proceed over the next few weeks. And so, the message we'll be hearing from the Vice President today, again, especially in a state like North Carolina, where President Joe Biden narrowly lost in 2020, is going to be that this is -- that they are the underdogs, and there is still a lot of work to do. Now, after this, they'll go back to Pennsylvania, where the Vice President will also have a rally there, again, indicating just how important a state like that will be for her to notch a victory in November. But, clearly, this is a campaign that is pleased with the performance on Tuesday night, but they're also not taking anything for granted. All aides I've spoken to tell me that they do anticipate this is going to come down to the wire. So, trying to appeal to those undecided voters and continue to put her out there and introduce herself in what has been a very condensed campaign for her is front and center, which leads to the stops today here in North Carolina too, and then tomorrow in Pennsylvania.

But, what he said is very much in line with what I am hearing from people privately. They think that Harris, at a minimum, won on style points, on her delivery, that perhaps Donald Trump had the better message, but it wasn't articulated on Tuesday night. So, I think you're going to see a lot of that trying to be reconciled when Donald Trump hits these different battlegrounds and try to talk about.

Bush. Nice to see both of you this morning, as we continue and we see the candidates back out there on the trail in these states, which, if people have not figured this out already, we will be talking a lot about over the next few weeks, as we know. Pete, picking up where Alayna just left off, in terms of this cleanup effort and trying to get the former President to focus more on the substance, how effective do you think that is going to be in these final weeks? PETE SEAT, FMR. WHITE HOUSE SPOKESPERSON UNDER PRES. GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, Donald Trump is on the talking points, his talking points, not necessarily the talking points that his advisors want him to use. And for anyone who has paid attention to him for these nearly 10 years, that debate performance was to be expected. That is Donald Trump. He actually is disciplined, disciplined in talking about Hannibal Lecter and all the other things that he does at these rallies. Where he is not disciplined is in talking about the issues that matter to the American people. And look, I don't truly believe that there are swing voters. Sure, there is anecdote out there, but I think swing voters, as they used to be, are as prehistoric as the dinosaurs right now. But, for those who do exist, they're not trying to decide on what Donald Trump says and his rhetoric. He has attacked everything short of apple pie and the flag at this point. What they're trying to decide on is the issues, and if he focuses on the issues, he'll get them on his side.",

There are some of my former colleagues who are coming out in support of Kamala Harris, and they have their reasons for doing so. But, I think people who are voting for Donald Trump are voting with their pocketbook. They're voting on the fact that they were better off financially four years ago than they are today. They're seeing rising prices in their day-to-day life. They're worried about immigration. They're seeing more and more stories, where I'm from, originally in Northwest Indiana, a 14-year-old girl was stabbed by an immigrant who got into this country illegally not that long ago.These stories are happening in communities across the country, and that is driving fear, and that's driving the vote towards Donald Trump. So, Alberto Gonzalez, absolutely respect him in his service to this country, but I don't think that really moves the needle on anyone reading the piece. HILL: OK.
