She addressed about 900 Democrats in Raleigh, North Carolina on Saturday night at the state party's biggest fundraiser, long dubbed the unity dinner. Even though the intra party has been anything, but when we're talking about the presidential race, Pelosi's keynote address ticked off plenty of accomplishments for the Biden-Harris administration.Sources tell CNN that Biden himself is seething at Pelosi after sources did tell CNN that she was closely linked to a fresh round of statements from lawmakers on Friday that encouraged President Biden to step aside from his campaign. But instead, when addressing this room, she focused on party unity and democratic values while referring to former U.S. President Donald Trump as, what's his name throughout her speech. She compared the Democratic and Republican platforms and values, and she focused on how Democrats can not only, she says, win North Carolina, a key battleground state that the Biden campaign has invested not only money, but staffing and already, but also the entire country in the election in 2024.

And, in fact, his schedule is supposed to be more robust when he comes back. They said, they put out a statement saying that they are going to host more than 20 press events and thousands of grassroots organizing events across key battleground states. And this is very critical, just considering that Biden is expected to hit the campaign trail amid all this outreach and all this concerns that Democratic officials have really put out there publicly, just calling on him to step down.

One of which is that if Joe Biden continues on as a party's nominee, of course, what does that mean for his chances in November? Could he take down Congress with him? But if he decides to step aside -- and there's a little bit of time before the Democratic National Committee formally begins that roll call vote process to make him the nominee in this interim party or period, if he decides to step aside in which would be really an unprecedented move, there would be a such a scramble to figure out who would be the nominee. Would be Kamala Harris? How do they get the party behind them? How do they decide to move forward? So many big questions, which is why there's so much unease within the Democratic Party as they wait for Joe Biden, ultimately to make it clear, even more so, I suppose that he's running and for the Democratic leadership to fall in line.

Why did they allow him on the stage? And that was one of the questions that a number of Republican senators tried to post to Kimberly Cheatle, the U.S. Secret Service director. At the Republican Convention last week, you'll recall that several of them confronted her at the convention and then chased her up an escalator.

Pressure campaigns against companies DEI efforts have picked up since the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling ending affirmative action in college admissions. Joining me now to discuss is CNN's Global Economic Analyst Rana Foroohar. Rana, good morning to you. So, let me read here from the new commitment as John Deere tweeted out, we will no longer participate in or support external social or cultural awareness parades, festivals, or events.

      "sentences": "Yes, great question, Victor. So, this movement against diversity, equity inclusion measures has been building for some time. It's not just limited to companies. Really, I would say that the serious activism has grown since the Supreme Court overturned equity inclusion measures, affirmative action. This happened many months ago. We've seen, since then, universities under pressure. You're now seeing companies under pressure.And there are a couple reasons for it. One, companies are actually worried that these activists are going to bring legal suits against them and that thanks to the Supreme Court's actions, they're actually going to have a case to do that now. So, some of the companies are backing away from equity inclusion measures in advance of what they feel may be a legal battle, similar to what you've seen on the part of conservative activists around universities. Now, there's another part to this though. I think that companies quite rightfully have given equity inclusion a lot of airtime in recent years, but there's also been on the part of some companies, I would say, a kind of a lack of deep awareness about why they're doing these programs, how they're measuring things, what ends they're really trying for, and that there has been, I think, a little bit of corporate performatism, I would say, around equity inclusion. I think companies are aware and that certainly the statistics show that more diversity actually helps the bottom line. You see that, you know, there's a lot of studies showing that Fortune 500 companies that have more diversity, racially, ethnically in terms of gender do much better. But they're not great at measuring it and they're not great at thinking about it. So, all of this is part of a big reset that I expect will be going on for some time.",

There are companies that don't publicize what they're doing, that are doing really great things and are thinking deeply about diversity inclusion. There are others, frankly, that do a lot of publicizing of say, you know, we're supporting this or that event. But maybe they don't actually have that much diversity within their companies. I think to the extent that this conversation pushes people to think more deeply about, hey, there is a business case for this. This isn't really about a cultural or social practice, this is about, frankly, getting closer to your customer. No, I mean, we have a country here in the U.S. that is going to be majority minority by estimated 2045. Smart business people are looking around and saying, hey, if our customers are diverse, if our workers are diverse, maybe we should be thinking about diversity and just embracing that as something that is part of our business paradigm. That said, I do think and I see in a lot of companies that there is a kind of a performative, hey, let's have another, you know, ice cream day for this or that. You know, diversity inclusion effort, rather than saying, hey, here are our metrics. Here are our goals. And here are how we're going to implement them.

We do finally start to see things cool down in the north by the middle of the week. It takes a few more days before we start to see some relief on the southern end of the western half of the country. Another growing concern is also wildfires. Do we have those extremely hot temperatures? But you've also got very gusty winds and the potential for some dry thunderstorms, which could lead to lightning and igniting some additional wildfires, specifically in that area. We already have 58 active wildfires in the west coast. We don't want to see that number tick up anymore in the coming days. Also, some thunderstorms, but of a different variety across much of the southwest. We've got that monsoon flow here across New Mexico in Arizona. But the concern here is in especially in the areas of burn scars could have some potential flooding. Also flooding potential across the southeastern tier of the U.S. But for a different reason, a lot of these areas have had so much rain the last few days, that ground is saturated. So, even adding an extra one or two inches on top of what they've already had likely just going to uptick some of that flooding potential. But you can see flooding is a concern stretching from Arizona all the way over to the Carolinas. And this is just for the day today.
