Many people went out in the streets and they asked for a ceasefire not because they want Hamas but because they want to save the lives of the children in Gaza. I think this war is not against Israel and Hamas; it's a war between Israel and the people in Gaza.If you look at the numbers there are about 21,000 people who have been killed -- half of them children. And there is one thing that is missing in this discourse. Half of the population in Gaza that are more than two million people -- half of them are children. So after each airstrike, after each artillery shelling, half of the people who are killed are children, not to mention the mothers, et cetera. So they need to stop this war to protect the children, and then to find a just solution to the Palestinian case. It's not only about October 7. I was wounded when I was 16 in 2009 and no one ever talked about that. And there are -- I lost a lot of friends in my childhood --",

There is the Palestinian local rift between Hamas and (INAUDIBLE) itself. And Israel is benefitting from this political rift.I mean, what people in Gaza really want -- they want to have peace. They want to have their own airport, their own seaport. They need to travel when they want wherever they want. They need to be respected outside of Gaza. We are not respected inside Gaza because we are being killed every time from the sea, from the -- from the sky, from the land. But we are not even respected outside of Gaza. When you are trying to go to an embassy -- for example, I tried to go to the American embassy in Jerusalem multiple times and the Israelis denied my permit. And they want -- they don't want us to live in Gaza and they don't want us to leave Gaza to study or to learn about other people outside. So people -- I mean, people in Gaza are asking for jobs. They are asking for a decent life. They are asking to have their own border crossing to control the border crossing in Gaza. They need to -- I mean, this is -- this has been one of my dreams as a child. I still have dreams of seeing Gaza from a plane window and see -- and I have -- I still have dreams of seeing Gaza from a distant ship. I need to see all these things. But you are -- I mean, Israel continues to kill us not during this war but even before that. So why people were concerned because Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians without Hamas invading Palestinian neighboring towns and cities. But now with the scene that we have seen on October 7, I thought that Israel would have an excuse -- an excuse to kill more and more people, and mostly children. So children and civilians have been the victims for a long time.",

This morning, she writes for The New York Times, quote, \"Haley's latest remarks were in keeping with the way she and most of her Republican rivals have toed the line on race and racism on the 2024 presidential trail, downplaying the nation's sordid racial history and portraying structural racism and prejudice as challenges of the past.\"She also notes in her report, quote, \"Haley, who governed a state at the heart of the Confederacy, has a particularly complicated record on issues of race.\" Joining us now is Jazmine Ulloa, national politics reporter for The New York Times. What a -- what a perfect piece and report and person to talk to given these latest comments. I really appreciate you coming in. I was asking earlier if this is symbolic, Jazmine, of Nikki Haley often, critics point out, trying to have it all ways with all people. JAZMINE ULLOA, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Yes. This is actually a very good example of what -- of the very thing that has taken Nikki Haley this far. What has allowed her to climb but what could also become -- could very well become her liability. On the trail, she often -- she's trying to speak to a very broad coalition of Republicans. People who support the former president, people who don't. She's also trying to appeal to moderates and Independents. And so, at times on the trial she sounds like a traditional conservative with a message tightly focused on national spending and national security. But at other times, she also echoes former President Trump in how she talks about, for example, anti-immigrant rhetoric and on the issue of race and racism. These are issues she's struggled with in the past.",

Actually, a story like the one last night is rare for her. She rarely talks to reporters. She plays it safe on the trail. She plays it safe when talking about the former president. So this is actually a rare moment for her.So, in some ways, she actually stuck to her message, which has been reducing the size of the federal government. Granting -- you know, leaving it up to states to decide these really difficult issues like abortion. So -- and so that's in keeping with how she's campaigned. But at the same time, it shows how she isn't really tackling these hard issues and how voters are saying well, when it comes to these difficult issues where do her convictions really lie.",

And that's why, again, last night was a little bit out of -- out of step for her because when she has faced difficult questions about divisiveness there have been times where she has stepped up and talked about this moment as way -- as an example of how she's been able to bridge divides in the past.",

Now, whether she's convincing minds, that's a different question. But from what I've heard from people is that people usually like what she has to say. People leave satisfied.I spoke with one man who was a Trump supporter at the -- at the beginning of the -- of her town hall. She -- he said, \"You know, I'm only here because of my wife and I'm 100 percent with Trump.\" And then afterward, he actually tracked me down and said, \"She said some things tonight that really changed my mind. I thought she was a warmonger and now I know she's -- I heard about her husband. She's a military spouse. I actually like what she had to say. I'm going to seriously consider her. I now know she's not against war.\" But at the same time, I think there is a little bit of disappointment. I do pick up on disappointment from other voters who would like her to go more aggressively. To hit former President Trump more aggressively, particularly on questions -- you know, she's gotten questions about whether he poses a danger to the nation's democracy or why she raised her hand at that first debate and saying that she would support him regardless of whether he is convicted in his criminal cases.
