And so to see it have such a successful mission, and then a successful splashdown today, NASA officials absolutely thrilled by what we are seeing.And so right now, you're seeing, of course, a replay of the parachutes slowing that spacecraft down to an acceptable speed and hitting the Pacific Ocean. But now, they've got to actually get this spacecraft out of the Pacific Ocean, and so what they are doing, this is a massive recovery operation. It involves the Navy, Kennedy Space Center teams, and basically you have people on -- you have sailors on boats, Navy sailors that get right up close to this spacecraft. They are going to do some visual inspections, and then they actually hook some cables on to it, and the USS Portland will literally pull it out of the water. They bring it back to the Navy base in San Diego, and then back to the Kennedy Space Center where they do some more intensive tests. But big picture here, this is exactly what NASA needed in order to move forward with its Artemis Program. This was the uncrewed test flight. And now, they are going to be able to start thinking about who they're going to put on the crew of Artemis 2, which is going to be circling, orbiting the moon, so to speak. And then Artemis 3, which is going to be when they are going to return American astronauts to the moon for the first time since the Apollo Program. Some of the images that you're seeing there, that is of the Orion spacecraft as it was making its descent through the Earth's atmosphere, and this was, Jim, one of the most critical tests today. It was testing that heat shield, making sure that it could withstand 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit and protect those future astronauts that may be on board in future missions. But the other thing that just really stood out to me today, this happened on almost the 50th anniversary of the last time that humans walked on the moon, Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt during Apollo 17. And so there you can see some of the incredible images that the Orion spacecraft is able to capture as it made its close approach to the moon, and now humanity, just one step closer to going back.",

You have to have cooperation among agencies to ensure that when the CIA acquires information, they pass it the FBI. I'd tell you one thing the FBI was better at in the CIA, I served at both organizations, is number one acquisition of data, of data points over decades. The CIA is not great at that, the FBI is and second is pursuit of a case over 34 years. CIA, okay; FBI really good.

This is the latest, if we can attribute it to the Ukrainians, I think we probably can, latest strike that they've conducted with some precision.There have been attacks that they carried out in the Donetsk Province and earlier on in Melitopol. Those are the pictures you're looking at there with the burning. But these are all very significant developments for two reasons. The first is that Wagner Group had been essentially leading the attacks on Bakhmut, that eastern town that has been the focus of Russia's military efforts for the last several weeks really, Jim, firstly. And then secondly, in Melitopol, this strike against a barracks could be seen potentially as a softening up process, ahead of an anticipated effort by the Ukrainians to open up that Southern front to try to take the pressure off the East, firstly; and secondly, to try to push perhaps, towards the Crimea after their successes elsewhere in the south, notably in Kherson Province. But these are also signs, I think, Jim that the Ukrainians are getting more confident with their targeting and perhaps some diplomats in the United States have hinted that they are developing their own missile systems or drone systems that can strike with greater accuracy against Russian targets, but hitting what they claim is the Wagner Group's headquarters in Luhansk there, a very significant blow being dealt at what has been, I'll have to say a very difficult time for Ukrainian forces fighting in the east -- Jim.",

I think now the possibility -- look, it's going to take a prisoner exchange, a big one, I think, where we're going to have to negotiate again. But I think the Biden administration has done a good job on this Brittney release, the negotiation. But now we've got to get Paul Whelan out. I feel a little guilty. I started on my own -- with our own contacts with the Russians, separate from the administration, although we coordinate most of the time, although they like to take all the credit, which is fine. I think the President did good. But I'm optimistic. I was optimistic about Brittney, about Trevor Reed, despite the horrendous relationship that we have with Russia over Ukraine, you can still do these humanitarian initiatives. So, let's be positive. That's my only message here.",

ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA):   I think they will make use of the evidence that we previously presented in our report to further their investigations. And I think it makes an important statement, not a political one, but a statement about the evidence of an attack on the institutions for democracy and the peaceful transfer of power, that Congress examining an attack on itself is willing to report criminality. So I think it's an important decision in his own right, if we go forward with it, and one that the department ought to give due consideration to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There is a severe mental health crisis playing out all over this country, as you just said, and to answer that I have to give you a brief history.So, a hundred years ago, when people were deemed to be mentally disturbed, they were sent to psychiatric institutions that at one time, were these places of refuge, and they were fully staffed and some of them were even quite bucolic. They were safe environments and if they stayed continuing -- they continued to be like that for a while. But then decades later, they have just become these asylums, and doctors were experimenting with questionable practices, and the quality of care just went way downhill. So in 1963, President Kennedy pledged to de-institutionalize people and promised Federal funds to build community mental health centers. But after he was assassinated, progress just completely stopped. Years later, when Ronald Reagan became Governor of California, California became the first State to move forward on de- institutionalization, but it didn't fund any local mental health centers. So all of those people who were released had no place to go, and this was repeated throughout the country. And so decades later, like so many things, as you saw in the clip just now, it has been left to law enforcement to deal with this problem in so many cities.",

It is more likely for people who are mentally ill to be attacked themselves, and the issue that I have with Mayor Adams' plan is that to involuntarily take someone and put them in a hospital, they can only be there for two weeks max in most cases. There aren't long-term facilities for people to go. And so these people, they might be able to get on some kind of regimen over the course of those two weeks, but then, again, there is nowhere to go.
