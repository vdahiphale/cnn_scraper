But with the war in Ukraine a key focus, the guest of honor is this man, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He is expected to sign a new 10 year security pact with the U.S. on the sidelines of the summit. That perhaps the most important but only one of a number of key offers he is expected to get while he is there. Our own international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson joining us from Italy. So let's start with that. What does this expected long-term security deal between the U.S. and Ukraine look like Nic?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is something that's not precisely what President Zelenskyy wanted because, if we go back to theNATO summit last summer, what he wanted was essentially that Article 5 security guarantee commitment, that an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all. He wanted to be inside that umbrella. But the NATO summit said, look, what you can get is bilateral agreement with all 32 NATO nations. So this is the United States' version of that bilateral agreement or security pact, that essentially says the United States has your back. It's a 10 year pact that will perhaps we understand have language in it that will sound like, if Ukraine is attacked again by Russia in a future scenario, then the United States would be dealing with it as an urgency within 24 hours. So this, it tries to buy Ukraine a firm commitment, whoever is the President of the United States going forward, because, as we understand, potentially with Donald Trump to become president, he might try to weaken the relationship and weaken support for Ukraine. So potentially that might head that off. But we know that the other NATO nations have already taken similar steps; 14 other countries have already signed off on this. So this leaves another 17 other countries to make these bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. One other thing we're expecting to hear from President Biden today will be about 300 additional sanctions on individuals and companies in Russia that the United States feel are sort of getting around the existing sanctions, to get in technologies, computer chips, that sort of thing, that Russia is using on weapons. That already there are sanctions designed to stop that happening but these are going to broaden out the language and who they can apply to blunt Russia's military capability. So that's another thing we're expecting today, Becky.",

They usually release the days just a few days before. But like you said, I mean, the big case that we're looking at is for the Supreme Court to decide whether or not Donald Trump -- and for that matter, all former presidents -- whether they have immunity from criminal prosecution once they have left office. Now Donald Trump's team has argued that he has immunity from criminal prosecution for every act he took while in office. And the Department of Justice has said that's absolutely not the case. Perhaps official acts, you might have immunity for. But private acts, you certainly wouldn't. And the DOJ is arguing that everything Donald Trump did around January 6th, around the election, in their view, to disrupt the election results, they say that those were private and not official actions. And therefore, Donald Trump shouldn't be immune. So the question is, how is the Supreme Court going to come down? They have never decided this issue. And it looks like they will decide it in the next two weeks, we're not sure on which day. But of course, Becky, that will directly impact the remaining criminal cases against Donald Trump. The one here in Washington has been on hold because of that very question. So we'll see if that case will be able to move forward.

So as a result of which, I find it very hard that, in the end, that any court would side with that plaintiff who is complaining about the harm that was done. They went shopping for a specific judge.

We've seen the number of ballot initiatives in recent years since the overturning of the constitutional right to abortion, a couple of years ago, where Democrats have even made progress in very conservative states. It's shoring up abortion rights. In the midterm elections in 2022, we saw this was a very important issue in mobilizing Democratic voters and independent voters coming to the polls and voting against the Republicans. So every time a conservative court or a conservative state legislator takes a step, that is seen as making it harder for people to get abortions, the Biden campaign comes out and said, this is all because of Donald Trump. This is because of the Supreme Court that he created, the conservative majority during his first term. And it's all on him. As Julian was saying, Trump's position on this is very unclear. I mean, it reminds me a little bit of Boris Johnson, when he said that -- the former British PM -- when he said that his position on cake was having it and eating it. Trump once credited -- as Julian was saying, for the Supreme Court majority -- for the overturning of abortion but he doesn't want to take the political consequences of having done so. He says, it's up to the states to decide, which is -- mirrors the original Supreme Court decision to overturn the right to abortion. The problem with that is states all over the country are deciding different things. And it's absolute chaos. And one thing that you're seeing today in this judgment is the Supreme Court having to deal with the consequences that it unleashed by its original decision to overturn abortion.
