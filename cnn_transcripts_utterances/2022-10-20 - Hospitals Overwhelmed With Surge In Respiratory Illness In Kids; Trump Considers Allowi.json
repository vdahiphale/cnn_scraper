How do you eventually or at all negotiate with someone like that?WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: You probably don't, Kate. You probably don't negotiate. President Zelenskyy has made it very clear that he's not going to negotiate with President Putin. He'll negotiate with the next Russian president. But to negotiate with someone who's performing these atrocities that is killing your people -- killing Ukrainians, civilians, this is not a military fight. This is -- this is the Russians under President Putin attacking civilians, schools, hospitals, power plants, hoping that Ukrainians will be miserable this winter. How do you negotiate with that kind of a person? You wait until you've pushed the Russians out of their country. And that's what the Ukrainians say. They're willing to negotiate when they push the Russians out of their country, then they'll sit down. President Zelenskyy is ready to sit down with the next Russian president. That's what's going to happen.",

The CDC says cases of RSV specifically have tripled in the past two months are already nearing last year's peak. One Children's Hospital in the Northeast is seeing so many cases right now that they are considering setting up a field tent on their lawn to deal with the influx.And joining me right now is Dr. Juan Salazar. He's the head of infectious diseases at that hospital, Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. Doctor, thank you for jumping on with me. I saw you -- that you say that this spike feels unprecedented for at least the northeast. Talk to me about that. DR. JUAN SALAZAR, PHYSICIAN IN CHIEF, CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER: Yes. Kate, good morning, and thank you for having me. And we certainly have seen a dramatic increase in kids coming into our hospital with RSV. This has really stepped up over the last two or three weeks. And it's created some difficulties for us because again, our beds are filled to capacity, the kids keep coming in, and so we've had a situation where we have to expand our services in a way that we can provide all the care for the kids that are coming in with RSV. I've been doing this for a long time, I've been a Connecticut children's for 25 years, and I have never seen this level of the surge, specifically of RSV coming into our hospital.",

Over at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital, they told ABC that they have about three kids admitted for COVID, and 30 admitted for RSV, which is kind of jarring when you think of where we've -- where we were just you know, two years ago -- starting two years ago and all -- and the real fear of what COVID means for everyone. Is that what you're seeing? And what does this say about where we are with COVID, and with other dangerous viruses?",

We've had over 100 kids that have come in with RSV into our system, which is really unprecedented. In the COVID era and the peak of the COVID era for children, we never had 100 kids come into our hospital in any given week. It was a very different pandemic for the kids and for the adults. So, we're sort of in the -- what I would call the similar face with RSV for as children, as adults with COVID. Now I want to make sure that I don't alarm parents because RSV is not as serious as the COVID crisis in the adult population.",

But in the midst of this, they require intensive care, they require oxygen therapy, and supportive care so that parents can feel assured that we can actually do this.Now, we are coming out of the COVID era, but COVID I think has created this dynamic where kids were socially distanced that were wearing masks for a long time properly so. And we needed to do that to prevent COVID infections. But now these viruses are capturing a population that is completely not used to them. And they're seeing it in large numbers. And so I think for the next four to eight weeks, we just have to be careful. We have to be thoughtful. And one message to parents which is really, really important, get your kids vaccinated for influenza, this is the time you need to do it. Six months and above, you can get your flu vaccine, go to your pediatrician, and then avoid a surge of influenza and four to six weeks so we're not dealing with this over the next four to eight months.",

Now, his team had previously been very adversarial, both in their court filings, but also their private interactions with the Justice Department. And that's now changing.You know, faced with all of these various investigations that are ongoing, the former president and his attorneys have decided to act in a bit more of a conciliatory way toward DOJ investigators. And one thing -- one thing that's been tossed around behind the scenes, as his attorneys discuss how to cooperate with DOJ or how to accommodate them is potentially inviting federal investigators back to Mar-a-Lago to conduct a supervised search at the former president's residence. Now, this would, of course, look very different from that August search that was conducted by FBI agents at Mar-a-Lago. This would look more like the June meeting that took place between FBI agents, the way they were supervised on the premises accompanied by Trump attorneys. But that is one idea that's being discussed. No firm decisions have been made. But his team is looking for ways to basically placate federal investigators and wrap this investigation up quickly so that Trump can look at his political future and plot that out, Kate.",

You know, I'm a Gen-X black guy from Detroit, so hip hop has always been present in my life growing up, it's shaped my worldview in a lot of ways and it continues to shape my worldview because these artists, these rappers, they aren't just entertainers and musicians, they're also storytellers and our grills. They're supposed to help document what happens in the world as artists are supposed to do. But in hip-hop, it's particularly important to black people.And so I wanted to talk about this journey because to see Kanye go down this path also hurts me as a hip-hop fan because I used to love Ye. I used to love his music. I could not wait for the next track like a lot of people. But there comes a point in which you need to understand that you're supporting everything else that goes with it. You know, if you watch a Woody Allen film, you might enjoy Woody Allen, but he's got some issues, right? The same thing with Michael Jackson, same with R. Kelly, we all have the personal responsibility of asking ourselves, you know, is this working for me?

Mega agent Ari Emanuel wrote in the Financial Times that companies need to stop working with him because he has not gone the path of really showing that he is apologetic. Writing this. Those who continue to do business with West are giving his misguided hate an audience. There should be no tolerance anywhere for West's antisemitism. What do you think of that, LZ?",
