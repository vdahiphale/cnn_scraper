I mean, this has been four elections that he's now run in, in the past two years. Finally gaining that full six-year term.",

      "sentences": "Right, and so Victor and Bianna, you hear two-seat majority going from 50 to 51, and you think, well, does that really make a huge difference? It absolutely makes a gigantic difference and I'll tell you why.When it's just a 50/50 Senator like we have had the last two years, Republicans and Democrats undergo this power-sharing agreement. So, at the beginning of that term they came down -- or the they sat down and hammered out this power-sharing agreement that really did give Republicans quite a bit of power. Of course, Vice President Kamala Harris could always come here and break the tie. But what will happen now that they have the full 51 seats, they don't have to have that power-sharing agreement anymore. It means they're going to have majorities on all of these committees. They're going to be able to process things more quickly. They're going to be able move through nominations likely more quickly. They're likely going to have more subpoena power. It also kind of changes the dynamics a bit of what Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will be dealing with within his caucus. Because you remember centrists like Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema have had enormous power in the last two years because he has needed a vote from every single one of his Democratic Senators to get that legislation passed. 51 gives him a little more cushion. He won't need every single one. So, it may change the power dynamics slightly there as well, as just who has outside power in the party moving for. So, it cannot be underscored just how significant this is, and for majority leader Schumer to go out and welcome Warnock with outstretched arms and walk him into the Senate. It kind of tells you everything you need to know about how every Democrat is feeling up here on The Hill today.",

      "sentences": "Yes, but a lot of mistakes were made. So, that's what this report is just filling in the blanks. Now let's just back up a little bit. Reminder our viewers of who Whitey Bulger is if you haven't seen \"The Departed\" like Bianna.Essentially of course a gangster back in the '70s and '80s, notorious in the Boston area. He was in federal prison being transferred to Hazelton which is a very notoriously violent prison in the federal prison system, and as you guys mentioned, killed several hours after arriving there. There were so many questions as to what happened, and that's why this investigation happened and why this report came out by the inspector general's office. Essentially, they found that more than a hundred BOP workers were aware of that transfer, that it was going to happen, that they spoke about it openly in front of inmates that were actually at the Hazelton prison. Of course, raising the risk of possibly a hit. Of course, we're talking, again, about a gangster who certainly had a lot of enemies. Also, he was 89 years old in a wheelchair. They found that the personnel were confused about the transfer process and also just his medical condition. Why was he transferred to a place where the medical facilities were less than what he was coming from? So essentially at the end of the day, what this report did was made 11 recommendations to the bureau of prisons which we're understanding now that they are going to take a look at, see if any sort of changes need to be made in light of this. But so interesting to learn, of course, what happened behind closed doors. I mean, the fact that more than 100 people knew this guy was being transferred and talked about it, it seemed like this was the end that you would get.",

      "sentences": "Well, that is quite the statement from the Walmart CEO. He's essentially saying that in some markets, shoplifting is such a big problem that it would make more sense to just close up shop altogether rather than keep them open. Of course, that would be terrible for the employees and the customers who rely on it. It's really bad for everyone in the sense that they're passing along these costs to the consumers.But we know this is not just a Walmart problem, right. Target has said that shoplifting is up by 50 percent from last year. The National Retail Federation says that last year alone industrywide more than $94 billion of inventory was lost through shoplifting, fraud and other issues. Shoplifting has also been on the rise here in New York City -- which doesn't have any Walmart -- but according to the NYPD commercial shoplifting reports in the city up 65 percent this year through the end of July. Some of this is organized retail crime and this has caused a bit of a cat and mouse game. Like drugstores have locked up deodorant and aluminum foil and other things that keep getting stolen. Home Depot they're trying to foil shoplifters by testing out a line of power tools that don't work until their activated at the checkout counter. Anyway, the Walmart CEO did have some good news outside of the shoplifting situation. He's seeing prices coming down. Listen to what he told CNBC about inflation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
