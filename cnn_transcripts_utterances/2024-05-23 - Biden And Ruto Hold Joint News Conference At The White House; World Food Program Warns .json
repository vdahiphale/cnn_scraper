The Israeli military says that 281 trucks passed through the land crossings of Kerem Shalom and the Erez Crossing, but this is where it gets a little bit tricky too, Richard, because the Israeli military and COGAT, the Defense Ministry agency charged with getting aid into Gaza has been offering these figures of hundreds of trucks per day going in through these crossings. But the United Nations and some of the other aid groups that are supposed to be picking up the aid on the other side of these crossings are all offering far different figures. And a lot of that has to do with the fact that security conditions caused in part by the Israeli military's expanding and escalating military activity around those crossings has impeded the ability of these humanitarian aid groups to get the aid and then to safely distribute it throughout the Gaza Strip. And today, the World Food Program is warning once again of a potential catastrophe looming if the situation of distributing aid and getting it into the Strip is not remedied quickly.",

He was always affiliated with that shrine. In fact, his father-in-law is still the prayer leader at the Imam Reza Shrine. So, the folks here in this town of Mashhad, many of them are supporters of Ebrahim Raisi, and many of them told us that while they're in great sorrow at this point in time, they also say they will remain loyal to his ideals. Which of course, were very tough on the United States. You can hear them screaming now, death to America here in the streets of Mashhad as the casket is being wielded through those streets.

Both symbols on display were during the January the sixth attacks at the U.S. Capitol. The justice claims the flag in Virginia was hung by his wife and has not commented yet on the one in New Jersey. Now, U.S. lawmakers are drawing divided conclusions on how justices should respond to the controversy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): It's totally inappropriate. In the case of Samuel Alito, he definitively needs to recuse himself from any matter pending before the United States Supreme Court that has to do with the January 6th violent insurrection.

There were politicians that brought people from Live Nation up to Capitol Hill to grill them about this. And this lawsuit from the Justice Department and 30 different states has been very expected for some time because of that. The Justice Department wants to take this to a jury. Unusual for an antitrust lawsuit like this because everybody who buys tickets in the U.S. does get a service fee included in that purchase price.
