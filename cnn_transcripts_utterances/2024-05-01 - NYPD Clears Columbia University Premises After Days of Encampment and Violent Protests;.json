Demonstrators have barricaded themselves inside Hamilton Hall for the better part of a day. Police entered the building through a second- story window and used what they call distraction devices, including flashbangs, but not tear gas. Now we are told the doors of Hamilton Hall were barricaded with chairs, tables and vending machines. More than 100 protesters have since been arrested, both at Columbia as well as the nearby City College. But the student protest leaders remain defiant.

Instead, they dealt with it as an internal student discipline matter. They've negotiated with us about bringing food and blankets to the encampment.

The sense of confusion more so comes from the university's fraught relationship with the NYPD. In 1968, in fact, this was the 56th anniversary of the NYPD raid in 1968 on anti-war protesters that had occupied Hamilton Hall. There was a sense of uncertainty as to why the university wasn't being clear about their communication with the police department. Faculty and students felt if the NYPD was going to be called in, they would have liked advanced notice. This notice was not received, creating a sense of confusion. So while people are happy that the university made a decision to quell this illegal occupation of the Hamilton Hall, the relationship historically between Columbia and the NYPD means it's a more of a murky conversation and people have different feelings on the subject.",

We are hearing different things from the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as you say. He said publicly that he would be going into Rafah with or without a hostage deal.But then we've also heard from an Israeli source that a deal would prevent Rafah. So it's difficult to know exactly what the stance is. And you can see there the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, actually speaking to some of the protesters after meeting with the Israeli president. So he is in Israel really to try and secure this deal. Let's listen to what he said earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Even as we're working with relentless determination to get the ceasefire that brings the hostages home, we also have to be focused on people in Gaza who are suffering in this crossfire of Hamas is making. And so focused on getting them the assistance they need, the food, medicine, the water, the shelter is also very much on our minds and the work that we're doing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So U.S. official tells CNN that they don't believe that a Rafah ground offensive is imminent, they're saying potentially not in the next few weeks, because that is the indication that they have had from the Netanyahu government. We've heard also from the national security spokesperson John Kirby saying yet again, that they do not support this major ground offensive.And if it does happen, they want to see a plan to evacuate safely, more than a million people who are sheltering in Rafah at this point, many of them have been moved from where they live by the Israeli military saying, Rafah, they will be safe. And many of them have been moved a number of times. And the U.S. says that they simply haven't seen a credible plan at this point, that shows how that can happen. So there's a few different strands to this. The fact that the Israeli Prime Minister is being so strong, rhetorically saying that, that this will go ahead, it could also play to his domestic audience, he is under pressure from the far-right in Israel, much of which is in his own cabinet. But he could also be trying to push Hamas and push this deal for the hostages to be released. Now at this point, we know that hostage deal is potentially 20 to 33 hostages in return for several weeks of pause, Palestinian prisoners being released. And we understand that the onus on this point is on Hamas waiting for the leader in Gaza to make a decision on whether or not they would accept that proposal. Now the U.S. has put the pressure on Hamas saying that it is in the balls in their court at this point. And it's extraordinarily generous is, the quote, \"what Israel has agreed to at this point\". We understand from an Israeli source that Israel has agreed to allow displaced Palestinians to move back to north Gaza. That was one of the real sticking points that we have seen over recent weeks.

This is not something you see every day. And it could speak to potentially the optimism that the Secretary of State feels at this point. He said there is an extremely strong deal on the table. He has said that he believes there could be a deal within the coming days. It's fairly specific, and it is a fairly short-term scenario. That does appear to feel as though there is a window of opportunity.We know that Hamas went to Cairo on Monday to speak to Egyptian and Qatari mediators. We know that Israeli officials have gone on Tuesday. We understand that there are U.S. mediators in the mix as well. So there certainly is a hope that something could be done. But there is also this recognition that if this doesn't turn out well, then this Rafah ground-off offensive could certainly take place.
