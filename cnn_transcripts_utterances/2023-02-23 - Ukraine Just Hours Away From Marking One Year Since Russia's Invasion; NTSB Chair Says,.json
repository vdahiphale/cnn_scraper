And we saw what I think we expected, the prosecution went in hard on Alex Murdaugh about telling that lie, not once, not twice but continuing to tell that lie throughout the entire time period really until he took the witness stand today to try to give us an explanation for why he lied. [18:30:04] BLITZER:  And, Shan, Murdaugh also admitted he lied, and he admitted he was at the scene just before the murders. How big of a gamble is this testimony?

To put him on stand, he's got to deal with the fact that he lied about it, he's got to deal with the fact that there's financial lies he committed, he defrauded clients. So, it kind of opens up of this whole cascade of stuff he has to admit to and trying to turn that into, well, he's admitting all these other terrible things, he's an honest guy but he didn't do this one terrible thing, that's a tough road for him.

He used the nicknames that he had for his wife and his son to show that they were very close and, you know, how he used these terms of endearment to describe them.I agree that there was a huge gap in the defense's case because of that video, but I still think the prosecution has a problem too, Wolf. They have no gun. They have no murder weapon. They don't have an eyewitness, so all of their evidence is circumstantial, and they want the jurors, so they need the jurors to believe that a man that was that close to his wife and his son would blow his son's brains out simply to distract from his financial problems. Now, clearly, the man is a liar, he is a thief, so far based on all the evidence that's been, you know, presented, but that's a big leap from I lie and I steal money to I kill a wife and I kill a son, who clearly, from all evidence, he was very close to. So, I think of their parents on that jury. I'm a parent. You're still going to be scratching your head saying, I don't know.

But if he was that addled by the addiction, he might have been acting very irrationally at the time and the jury might believe that this very opioid addicted person went off into this paranoid frenzy and did slaughter his own family. So, it's a double-edged sword, but, again, it's something they have to put out there in making this difficult choice to have him take the stand and expose him to the cross-examination.",
