Those officials tell us one of the biggest challenges is breaking through Russia's defense lines in the South and in the east. In the Donetsk region, Mr. Zelenskyy says the death toll is now claimed -- has now climbed to nine after a Russian missile attack on the city of Pokrovsk. 82 other people were injured in that attack. And in just the last few hours, the mayor of Moscow says two combat drones were shut down in the city suburbs. This as the Ukrainian president warns that Russia -- warns Russia that it will respond to attacks on its ports. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): If Russia continues to dominate the Black Sea outside its territory, blockading or firing at us again, launching missiles at our ports, Ukraine will do the same.

All of these things come together.And the -- really, the depth of the working defenses has made it very, very difficult.

And I think it would give them a longer range and would allow them to hit Russian targets a bit further back from the front lines than they're currently able to do.Now, if we had planned this correctly, at about this time, we could potentially have had F-16s flying with Ukrainian pilots. That, of course, is something that is not happening at the moment, it will happen in the future. But it won't be ready for this particular phase of the offensive operations that the Ukrainians are conducting right now. But this is the kind of thing that they would need. Plus, the other thing I would say, Linda, is that we need some more unconventional weapons for the Ukrainians. Some of them, they are producing themselves, such as the seaborne drones that they have been able to manufacture and use to great effect in the Black Sea, but also, you know, some of the other rockets and missiles that they've been able to develop. So, part of that is something that the Ukrainians can develop. Other things, of course, are from the west. And the last thing I would say is that a continued supply of munitions, especially artillery shells of the 155 millimeter variety, those are going to be critically important for the Ukrainians, and they must be part of any plan to help them during this period.",

That could all come down on Thursday when the extraordinary summit of ECOWAS meets. But in the meantime, the Niger military junta rejecting a joint delegation of the African Union ECOWAS and the U.N. that was expected in Niamey on Tuesday. A bit of this letter says, the current context of anger and revolt of the populations following the sanctions imposed by ECOWAS does not allow to welcome the said delegation that required serenity and security. The postponement of the mission in Niamey is necessary, as is the revision of certain aspects of the program, including meetings with certain personalities, which cannot take place for obvious security reasons, in this atmosphere of threatened aggression against Niger. General Abdourahmane Tchiani, who's declared himself president of Niger has time to meet with other people. He met with a delegation from Burkina Faso and Mali who came in to the army to declare the solidarity with Niger.
