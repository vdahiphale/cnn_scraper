President Biden and Speaker McCarthy may have ended their stare down over the debt ceiling, but progressives and conservatives are saying their respective sides gave too much away and this compromise.Here's where things stand right now, if the bill passes the U.S. avoids a default. And Washington won't have to deal with the debt ceiling again until January 2025. Probably not a coincidence that that's after the next election. This bill also would cap future spending, leaving Social Security, Medicare and defense spending untouched. So both parties have some modest wins to point to. CNN's Lauren Fox is at the Capitol tracking all of this. Lauren, some hurdles still remain on the Hill, walk us through them?",

One of the key hurdles, of course, is some of that conservative outrage that you have been seeing on Twitter with lawmakers threatening to use every tool at their disposal, potentially to try and stop this. But even still, the expectation is that Republican leadership is still very optimistic that they are going to have a majority of their Republican Conference backing this bill.I talked to two lawmakers in the last hour who told me that they are still very confident that they are going to be able to get this through the House of Representatives, in part because Democrats are also working very hard to secure the votes on their side. Many Democrats wanting to back the President as he's seeking reelection, also many Democrats arguing that things could have been much worse in these negotiations. And this is a part of divided government when you have Republicans controlling the House of Representatives, Democrats controlling the Senate and the White House compromises have to be made. And a lot of Democrats and the White House, in particular, is arguing the compromises made here are not nearly as bad as they could have been. If the House passes this bill out of their chamber on Wednesday, that puts the U.S. Senate in the driver's seat. It's a question of how quickly they can move. Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader in the Senate has warned members that they could have weakened votes. This could drag out just to that June 5th deadline if any one member slows this process down. And as you know, things can move very quickly in the Senate when lawmakers are united when they have an agreement. But if they don't have that this could take a little bit of time.",

Sloane Stephens made the comments as the first round of this year's French Open got underway. Officials at the open say they've got a new way of dealing with online harassment.CNN's world - CNN World Sports' Patrick Snell joins me now. Tell us how they're handling this. I mean, this is really, really hard to police. PATRICK SNELL, CNN SPORT ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Jim, it really is and that's why it is very, very encouraging indeed, to see the stance again taken by Sloane Stephens. There's no question she's a very powerful voice, a very powerful platform. And once again, she is using it to great effect, the 30-year-old from Florida who won the 2017 U.S. Open just to remind our viewers. She has been speaking out in Paris, where she is currently competing in the French Open. Stephens a 2018 finalist as well at Roland-Garros saying racist abuse targeted towards her via social media has been a problem right throughout her entire tennis career. And here's what's really, really concerning, Jim. She says it's only been getting worse. Stephens speaking to reporters earlier today after winning her first round match against Karolina Pliskova, the Czech Republic in straight sets. The American player was asked just how bad the abuse is right now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SLOANE STEPHENS, 2017 U.S. OPEN CHAMPION: Yes, it's obviously been a problem my entire career and it's never stopped. If anything, it's only gotten worse. I mean, obviously, when there's FBI investigations going on what people are saying to you online, it's very serious. And obviously, it's been something that I've dealt with my whole career. And I think that, like I said, it's only continuing to get worse and people online have the free rein to say and do whatever they want behind fake pages, which is obviously very troublesome.

Sloane who's currently ranked 30th in the world, she actually didn't provide further details on the abuse she's been receiving when speaking the report is Monday. But I will say those powerful words coming after tournament organizers in the French capital.And this is the new development here, Jim. They actually announced last week the players will have their social media content actually moderated by an anti-online harassment and hate speech tool using artificial intelligence, the software basically filtering out abusive comments on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram and Tiktok. Sadly tennis players, we've seen this all before sadly, you look at greats like the Williams sisters they've been targets of such abuse, pro athletes as well for the world of football around Madrid player - superstar player from Brazil, Vinicius, Jr., the most notable recent case after the despicable racial abuse he suffered in the primera La Liga in Spain.
