The truce between Israel and Hamas is now over, and this is what we have been seeing today in Gaza. Airstrikes have been raining down and fighting is raging once again after the weeklong pause ended at midnight eastern time. The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says Israeli strikes have already killed people. The number now, 32 people killed in Gaza. As we're told trucks with that desperately needed humanitarian aid have stopped going into Gaza for now. Israel is accusing Hamas of breaking the truce by firing rockets on communities near the Gaza Strip.",

No clear answer as to whether or not that will reach a resolution. What about those remaining hostages? This morning, Israel says 137 are still believed to be in Gaza. A senior U.S. official telling me before the pause fell apart, Hamas was claiming it did not have any more women or children hostages to exchange, which was the agreement that had lasted seven days. Israel saying that's not true. A U.S. official telling me Hamas didn't submit a list of hostages to release last night like they had been doing in days prior.What happens now to the civilians in Gaza? That is the other critical question here. The Biden administration has been pressing the Israeli government to protect those civilians. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli leaders yesterday. He says he told them the massive loss of life that had been seen in northern Gaza cannot be repeated in the south. Joining us now, IDF spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. Lieutenant Colonel, we appreciate your time this morning. With what we're seeing right now, should it be characterized that operations in the south are officially underway? LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES:  Good morning, Phil. Yes, indeed. Since Hamas decided to cancel the ceasefire by not releasing women and children, we have been instructed to engage. Before we conducted any sort of activities, Hamas had already fired rockets from southern Gaza before 6:00 a.m. this morning here in Israel. They had been firing throughout the day at Israel. So, yes, we are engaging. We are seeking out Hamas wherever they are. We are evacuating people from specific areas that we intend on operating on. This is the nature of warfare.",

Hamas have put their terrorist capabilities within the civilian arena, intentionally putting the civilians of Gaza at risk, whether it's in hospitals, schools, mosques, high-rise buildings, wherever they are, they are using the civilian arena in order to try to conduct their attacks.

Hamas could unconditionally surrender and release all of the hostages, and there would be no need for any more war. This is a reality we are facing currently. The government has instructed the IDF to engage Hamas. We intend on defeating Hamas. We intend, on one hand, dismantling and destroying Hamas as a governing authority, but on the other hand, we intend on bringing the hostages back, every last one of them.We have an obligation to do so to the families, that there are now 140 Israeli families have been torn to pieces, their lives torn to pieces for 56 days now. We are heading into our eighth week in conflict with a ruthless terrorist organization that is conducting psychological terrorism, that is trying to squeeze us extensively. Hamas have to go. We need to bring back the hostages. We need to bring them back now. We will use everything in our disposal, operational, intelligence capabilities, in order to try and realize that. But indeed, there is a huge challenge in that effort. Obviously, their presence influences the operational activities that we are conducting.

I can say that I have some indications from this morning that there has -- some of that has actually been siphoned off by Hamas. So there are concerns.I can't say that I -- from what I know today there has not been any transfer of goods today, indeed, but we will be looking into that throughout the next coming days.

So when you look at this map, and it's a very detailed -- they have very small zones, either usually three or four digit numbers. And so what they will do, if I understood Colonel Lerner correctly, what they are going to do is they're going to tell people to evacuate, like this zone here is 2231. So if they evacuate this zone, then they can move into other zones. But they will probably be using a series of zones that will be the area in which they are going to be striking.So if that's the case, they are going to basically force people to move, let's say they are striking in this area, they will move out of all of these different zones. There are probably 20 different zones here. And when they come out here, where are they supposed to go? Then theoretically, everything that is not mentioned is safe. So they could potentially go here or here or here. But if they do that, then they have to, of course, be cognizant that this could change.

Let's bring in CNN Political and Foreign policy analyst Barak Ravid, and Yaakov Katz is a senior columnist and editor at The Jerusalem Post and author of three books on the Israeli military.Barak, I want to start with you because you've been covering every in and out and moment of this over the course, in particular the negotiations over the last seven days. Is there any chance that they come back to life? I know the Qataris say they're still talking. US officials say that Israel is still talking to intermediaries, and so is Hamas, how real is that? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; FOREIGN POLICY ANALYST: Good morning, I think it's real, I think we just moved, let's say a week ago or ten days ago, Israel and Hamas were holding indirect talks under fire. Then we had this pause, and the talks went on during a pause, during a ceasefire. And now we're back to talking under fire, and I think we can find ourselves again, maybe again, not today, not tomorrow. It will take a few days, but we can find ourselves again in some sort of a pause around some kind of a renewed or a bit different hostage deal, I wouldn't close the door on this at all. HARLOW: Yaakov, given all your reporting on the Israeli military, do you agree with that assessment? YAAKOV KATZ, SENIOR COLUMNIST &amp; EDITOR, THE JERUSALEM POST: Yeah, I think that there's no question that the military offensive is what has been instrumental in putting pressure on Hamas to even get them to think about a deal, right? We have to remember, what was Hamas's strategy? They went in on October 7. They massacred and butchered about 1200 people, they showed that all of Israel's defenses and its intelligence were flawed, and they were able to break in. The security measures did not work. But why did they take the hostages? That is because they wanted to continue to cause Israel pain, and they wanted to have that leverage. Israel's offensive on the ground has put Hamas into a corner, and it got them under pressure. They felt this is the way to relieve some of that pressure, but it's like a valve. They opened it for a bit, they released about 100 hostages, there are still 130 or so inside the Gaza Strip now fighting resumed. At some point, they'll feel the pressure again. They'll be willing to open the valve again. So, I think that the pressure by the IDF is important, is key, to get these hostages back home.",

They did that in the North, and despite the heavy toll, and we have to recognize there's a tragedy unfolding in Gaza, we cannot ignore that. I would argue it's the fault and it's the responsibility of Hamas. They're the ones who embed themselves in civilian infrastructure, they're the ones who hide under hospitals in schools, and in mosques. And unfortunately, Israel is a country that has a right to act in self-defense, and to take out those military targets, people are going to get killed. That's the ugly truth of war, but Hamas is going to continue to use these civilians, that is their modus operandi.

So, the fact is, Republicans nationwide, there's no reason why House Republicans should fear repercussions from their voters.
