And I am told that he, at some points, wanted to go down to Atlanta to Fulton County, but that his senior advisors convinced him that this was more important, that this directly affects him, this is a criminal case. And as you said, it is a critical day here.We are going to learn today likely if Donald Trump will face trial before the election in 2024 while he is potentially the Republican nominee for president. Now, let's talk about what this case is exactly. Just a reminder here of the charges that were brought by District Attorney Alvin Bragg. He is charged with falsifying business records, and accused of allegedly covering up to hide reimbursement payments. Remember, these are payments that Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels. They say that he covered this up with these reimbursements. Now, he has pleaded not guilty to 34 charges and denied the affair with Stormy Daniels. I do want to point out something really important here. Donald Trump's campaign has said that they believed that he is going to be the nominee by mid-March. If this trial date holds, it would be March 25th, meaning the Republican nominee for president, again, if their math is correct, would be sitting through a trial ahead of a general election in November 2024. That couldn't be more crucial. Now today, Donald Trump's lawyers are attempting to get this case dismissed. They will also likely attempt to delay that trial date. But again, if that trial date holds, that will be quite striking to learn that Donald Trump will be sitting through a criminal trial ahead of that 2024 election.",

It is going to focus these allegations that Fani Willis and her top prosecutor, Nathan Wade, had an improper romantic relationship and thus, they should both be disqualified from the case. That's what Trump and his defense attorneys are arguing.And we may hear from Nathan Wade directly today. Defense attorneys that surfaced these allegations initially said that they want to call Nathan Wade as their first witness. The judge in this case has said that he wants to hear from a Nathan Wade's former law partner first, so it'll be interesting to see if he allows the defense attorneys to call Nathan Wade first and question him about the timing of this relationship and ask me what but the name nature of it. Was it romantic? And most importantly, the judge wants to nail down on whether or not Fani Willis benefited financially from her relationship with Wade. Take a listen to what the judge said on Monday when he was ironing out and laying out the parameters of today's hearing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Guys, thanks so much. Katelyn, I want to start with you because this New York case was the first one out of the gate, arguably changed the trajectory of the Republican primary.

This is a situation where it's not just people making accusations about Donald Trump, how he was running his business, how he was paying off Stormy Daniels through Michael Cohen. Now, we are in the process of stress testing these cases. There are prosecutors that did the investigations, they took these through the grand jury. There are four criminal indictments against Donald Trump.And whether you think the hush money case has the least likelihood of success before a jury, right now, this is where judges are coming in and looking at the validity of the case, the validity of the charges. The judge is looking at the motions to dismiss that Trump has filed today. We're likely to hear that, not just a trial date, if he wants to toss the case or keep it. There are checks and balances here within the system. And then even with Fani Willis in Georgia, this is also a stress test day for that, stress testing the ethics of the prosecution team, letting it go forward. So allowing all of that to move forward, at the end of the day Donald Trump will be before a jury of peers, and those people will weigh on whether these charges are valid enough to convict, acquit, or ended in mistrial. It's momentous in any situation, whether you think it's a bad case or not, you just won't know until it's before the jury. HARLOW: Astead looking at the numbers that Harry broke down from earlier today -- between the two of us. The numbers for the hush-money case in terms of people who would turn to not vote for him if convicted are -- they're there, but there are much lower than the election subversion case, either the federal one are the ones in Georgia.

And so that's what changes the argument ion the case and I think what the judge is saying. I think he sent the message, this may be enough to get rid of you. You better think about what you're doing. And it gives her a chance to say, well, maybe I should back away.And today, the problem that they have is they maybe walking into a trap that was set for them by Ashleigh Merchant, the defense lawyer. She laid out in her motion a very simple allegation like this is happening. It baited the district attorney and Mr. Wade into giving a response under oath in a court filing. By all accounts, she has this evidence. And so now, if she proves that they told something that wasn't true in their court filings, they've fallen in the trap that a lot of people do, and that is that the coverup is what catches of more so than the acts themselves.",

And what happens in Georgia, and Michael sort of walked me through this, but there's this special panel then that can reassign the case to a different county. But that takes forever.You may recall two years ago, Fani Willis was actually disqualified because she had a conflict of interest on a small piece of the investigation. That piece of the case has still not been reassigned. So if Fani Willis is disqualified, that will be a major problem for this prosecution. And I want to make this point. The judge tried to give Fani Willis a hint the other day, right. Judges do this, they will signal to you, hey, I'm kind of leaning this way. So if you want to work something out or do the right thing before we get to the moment of truth, go ahead. And they are proceeding with this today, I think, they, the D.A.'s office, very much at their own risk. And one thing that Fani Willis could do here, it doesn't look like she's going to do, but that she could do is she could step aside. She could say, I have a conflict of interest. By the way, not necessarily any shame in having a conflict of interests. They happen all the time. It just means that you don't want it to look bad for the public. And so she could say -- she hasn't, but she could say, I'm going to step aside. I'm going to appoint such and such, my trusted longtime deputy will step in as acting district attorney for this case.

New York City had twice that number of murders last year, but New York City has 8.6 million people, Kansas City has 500,000. So if you look at the rate of violence there, and what are they confronting? They're confronting gangs like the 247 Crew, the 51st Street Crips, the Benton street gang. I mean, there is Crips sets, Blood sets. It's a city that has a terrible problem with youth violence, gang violence, 25 percent of their shooting victims are between 18 and 24. So some of that is going to factor into the thinking here, but they also have a good base of knowledge of who the crews are and who the players are. And we don't know what the shooting is yet, but there is a lot of people with knowledge in there who should be able to put those connections together if they're there.",
