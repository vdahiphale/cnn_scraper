There's a lot of finger pointing over exactly why Silicon Valley Bank failed. During yesterday's hearing, regulators point -- they pointed the finger at bank management. Some lawmakers, they blamed regulators, accusing them of being asleep at the wall -- at the wheel. And then progressives, they cited deregulation in 2018, the rollback of Dodd-Frank.Now, no matter the cause, Senator Jon Tester the moderate Democrat from Montana, he really demanded that regulators get to the bottom of this so that it doesn't happen again. Listen to Tester. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT):  I am not a banker. I ain't even close to being a banker. I'm a dirt farmer. And I'm going to tell you, when they laid out what this bank had happened over the last two years, you did not have to be an accountant to figure out what the hell was going on here.

And now, we're hearing about it from the acting head of the FAA.He says, essentially, that the air travel rebound is happening faster than aviation workers can handle. Billy Nolen, the acting head of the FAA, made these remarks during an internal FAA meeting in Baltimore just yesterday. But what's interesting here is that this was also echoed by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg during my exclusive interview with him earlier this month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG, TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  It would be one thing if we found a certain piece of technology in the cockpit or a certain control tower where there were a lot of issues. But instead, what we're finding is that pilots, ground crews and controllers alike seem to be experiencing this uptick. Some have described it as a kind of rust. But that needs to turn into a very concrete diagnosis and specific action steps. We're not going to wait for something worse to happen to act now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it is a cable that goes directly to the secretary of state and the top State Department officials here in foggy bottom.If these diplomats are setting a dissent cable to the secretary of state, what it indicates is that their opinions, their views haven't been acknowledged in a real sense by their direct leadership. And we know in this situation from talking to U.S. diplomats who signed on to this specific dissent cable that they felt that their views were being labeled as alarmist by the diplomats in their direct line of leadership that they were bringing those opinions, too. So, they felt the need to bring those concerns to the secretary of state. Now, this specific dissent cable was written in July of 2021, that's about six weeks before the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. What these diplomats were concerned about was a catastrophe when the U.S. withdrew because they didn't think that there were specific actions being undertaken by the State Department to actually prepare for that withdrawal. So, things like enrolling the Afghans who had worked with the U.S. in biometric data program so that they could easily get out of the country. Now, of course, this is where the battle between the State Department and Chairman McCaul is unfolding right now because the secretary of state is saying that this is a channel that allows those diplomats to express their concerns in a confidential way. He doesn't want to give this dissent cable and all of those names of those diplomats who signed onto it to Capitol Hill because he's concerned about having a chilling effect on diplomats who would use this channel in the future. But the chairman of the committee is saying that he needs that information. He wants that information. Understand what the State Department wasn't doing to prepare for the withdrawal at that time, guys.",

Now this Narcan, or the generic naloxone, has been available in drugstores, but it's behind the pharmacist's counter. You had to know it was there and you had to ask for it. You didn't need a prescription, but you had to know it was there and you had to ask for it.Now, it will just be out there on the shelf with the shampoo and the toothpaste and the aspirin. Let's take a look at why this is so very, very important. This graph shows opioid overdose deaths since 1999. You can see how those numbers have just gone up so much to the point now where you look back at 2021 more than 80,000 people in this country died of opioid overdoses. That's nearly 9,000 children and adolescents from 1999 to 2016, nearly 9,000. So, hopefully this will make a difference. It made a difference even when they just put it behind the pharmacist's counter in various in various places. And the one big unknown here is the cost. We don't know how much it's going to cost.
