      "sentences": "Hello. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London.Just ahead, we're live in the region as Israel and Hamas have reached a deal for the release of 50 civilian hostages in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a four-day fighting truce. Then Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address virtually Western leaders at the G20 summit in New Delhi. We'll have the details. And Sam Altman returns as CEO of OpenAI after his tumultuous exit. We'll discuss what his next steps might be. After nearly seven weeks of war, Israel and Hamas have agreed to a temporary truce. The complicated deal is being greeted with hope and anxiety by the hostage families, and it's getting a positive reaction from the international community. Qatar delivered the proposal following weeks of intense negotiations. An Israeli official says the truce is slated to begin at 10:00 a.m. local time Thursday. Under the deal, Hamas will release at least 50 women and children who were abducted during the October 7th terror attacks. The Israeli government signed off on the deal after a six-hour long cabinet meeting. In exchange, Israel will pause its campaign against Hamas for four days. 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children, will be released from Israeli jails as part of that deal. CNN's Oren Liebermann is in Tel Aviv and joins us now. We've got a better sense now, Oren, of the timeline.",

      "sentences": "Max, we're understanding how this will play out after the full cabinet voted last night. We knew there was a 24-hour period, according to Israeli legal and political process, where people against the deal can file an appeal against it at the Supreme Court.That timeline, which is already ticking, will end tomorrow morning, and then the ceasefire will take effect, or rather, the pause in fighting will take effect at 10:00 a.m. So just about 19 hours from now. In the meantime, we have seen pictures from northern Gaza, we have seen explosions in northern Gaza. So it very much looks like the fighting will continue up until that point. And frankly, that's not a surprise. We have seen Israeli strikes and rocket fire up until a ceasefire takes effect in the past, and that's very much what we expect now. In terms of how the hostages are released, we know it'll be 50 Israeli women and children that will be released in stages over a four-day pause in the fighting. We don't know exactly how or from where they will come out of Gaza. So that has yet to be announced. And then we know in exchange for those 50, it'll be 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Now, we also know, according to the Israelis, that there could be a continuation of a pause in the fighting for every 10 Israeli hostages. Another one day pause. Max, it's interesting to note that Israel released a list of 300 names of Palestinian women and children. So it looks like they're opening up the possibility of a much longer pause in the fighting if Hamas releases Israeli women and children who are hostage in the days following the initial four-day pause in the fighting.",

Right now, the war continues with explosions rocking northern Gaza earlier. If the pause happens, it'll be the most significant break in fighting since October the 7th. And it does look as though it's set. And Hamas could potentially expand the truce as well, as Oren was saying.

So it's also been difficult under this bombardment since the 7th of October for Hamas to even know where some of its people are holding the captives as well. So this will allow the possibility, perhaps to get a better idea, or Hamas to get a better idea of where the captives are being held, who's holding them, and the identity of the captives. Let's keep in mind that, you know, the women and children, the elderly are one thing, but military combatant prisoners being held by the Palestinian groups, that's a whole different category as far as those groups are concerned.

This is the first time in months Putin's attended any G20 meeting since the onset of the war in Ukraine. Back in September, he was absent from the summit in Delhi, you might remember.Clare Sebastian is going to be looking at that. I mean, what are you looking for in terms of Ukraine?

      "sentences": "Well, this is really significant, Max, in itself, because it's been two years since he has attended a G20 summit, virtually or otherwise. So he hasn't done since the start of the war in Ukraine.He hasn't addressed Western leaders directly, although of course you can assume that pretty much everything he said has been indirectly targeted at the west. So it will be really significant to see how he couches the situation with the war in Ukraine. But I think it's safe to say that this is a moment when Putin might feel the wind in his sails, right, because there's much less international scrutiny of what Russia is doing in Ukraine because of the situation in Gaza. It has been 12 months since Ukraine has made a significant breakthrough on the battlefield. Now, Russia hasn't either, but at least they've managed to hold off Ukraine. And that's how Putin will see that. And I think, you know, with the situation in the Middle East, we don't necessarily expect him to address that today. He did address that yesterday in a BRICS summit, saying that he called for an immediate ceasefire. He blamed the U.S. for the situation, the humanitarian situation on the ground. But in a sense, that does work in Putin's favor as well, that situation, because he can try to present Russia as an alternative mediator to the U.S. And, of course, it distracts from what's happening in Ukraine. So we'll be watching for any hints, any changes in his tone around Ukraine, and, of course, the optics of this critically important, you know, Russia, trying to show that it is not isolated because of this war.",

Israel has not looked kindly on suggestions that Russia is denazifying Ukraine. Plus, Russia now needs Iran and by extension, you know, its relationship with Iran's proxies more than ever because of the arms relationship it's now in with Iran supplying drones for the war in Ukraine. So I think you do see that in play. It took Putin nine days to call Netanyahu after the October 7 attacks. He has yet to overtly condemn those attacks. So it is a shift in dynamic that we see here.",

It's not a ceasefire, but it is a pause which will allow for, on the one hand, the release of these first hostages, civilian hostages, women and children being held by Hamas, and we'll talk about that momentarily.

Well, it includes fuel, fuel for humanitarian infrastructure, schools, hospitals across the strip, both in the south and the north.

So in each day, we aim to have a number of releases because the number is big. So we've managed to get the parties to agree on the releases systematically. In other words, there will be an organized schedule allowing the releases in each day, and each party is quite familiar now with their obligations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
