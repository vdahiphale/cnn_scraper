And that decision, that abrupt reversal by Turkey to accept SWEDO into the NATO alliance is one symbol of unity and strengthening of the alliance that the administration is trying to push here. Now, this has been in the works for over a year now. Sweden had applied for NATO membership back in 2022 in May of that year, but Turkey had been blocking this in part due to concerns that they believed, Sweden was harboring groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists. Now, this deal was ultimately struck between the leaders of Sweden, Turkey, and the NATO Secretary General. But behind the scenes, President Biden and his team, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, had been in touch with their Turkish counterparts heading into this summit. President Biden, you'll remember, hosted the Swedish Prime Minister at the White House last week and in the lead up to the summit, President himself placed a phone call to Erdogan as he flew from the U. S. to London on Air Force One where he had a simple message that he wanted to see Sweden admitted as soon as possible into the alliance. Now, one thing that Turkey had really been pushing for, they've been pushing for some concessions in the lead up to this agreement. And that includes the sale by the U. S to Turkey of F-16 fighter jets. That has been held up on Capitol Hill. In part, lawmakers, including Democratic lawmakers frustrated with the fact that Turkey had put a hold on Sweden's application into NATO. It appears that could now potentially be shifting, and that would be something that Erdogan would be receiving, though the White House has continuously stressed that these were not directly tied or contingent upon each other. But the White House is viewing this as a big win in this summit as they're trying to project that unity, even as you have that flashpoint brewing over Ukraine's membership -- a pathway to membership to NATO, really dominating much of the conversation here.",

But, you know, after this war, I think, first of all, given we have an Open-Door Policy, it's important to state that we believe Ukraine does belong in NATO, there are some steps that need to be met to get there, and those steps would involve the likes of making sure its military is up to standard. But we can see right now that its military is up to standard. Its military is taking on a vast superior-sized Russian force and has dealt with a heavy defeat.

Tens of thousands of people have been taken to the streets every Saturday night for 27 weeks since January when the measure was announced. Tuesday's protests come hours after Israel's parliament the initial approval to advance a key provision of that package. Lawmakers voted Monday to strip the Supreme Court of the power to declare government decisions unreasonable. It's the first of three votes required for the bill to become law. The sweeping judicial overhaul, a package of several bills, includes other measures, as well, such as giving the Knesset power to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a majority vote and changing the composition of the committee that selects judges so that the government of the day has effective control. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his allies say the measures are necessary to rebalance power. Opponents call the plan a coup and say it threatens to turn Israel into a dictatorship.

This is where cars would normally come to pick up passengers. But as you can see, it is completely blocked by these protesters. This is part of what they're calling the National Day of Disruption. Protests have been going on since the early morning hours and they plan to go on throughout the evening across the country from downtown Tel Aviv to small towns and cities all across. This National Day of Disruption is part of the larger protest movement that has been going on for several months, but the reason that it's particularly amped up today is because last night, the legislation of the judicial overhaul was put back on the table. The first vote of one small aspect of it was passed on first reading. This specific aspect would strip the Supreme Court's ability of declaring government actions unreasonable. This is an ability that they have right now. The legislation had been essentially frozen in place since March. That was when there was those massive general strikes and protests. The defense minister had come out against the overhaul plan. And so, the legislation was frozen and there were attempts at some sort of compromise negotiations with the opposition. But those clearly didn't go anywhere. And so, the government coalition, led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is pushing forward once again with this legislation. They say it's a softer legislation. They say they've taken away some of the more controversial aspects, and they're going to do it in a slow, piecemeal fashion. But essentially, these protesters, the opposition, they don't believe anything that Benjamin Netanyahu or his government says. And they want this overhaul just completely off the table. Now, Netanyahu and his coalition say that judiciary is in The judiciary is in desperate need of reform. They won the election. They have the votes in parliament. But they're getting grave concerns, not only from these protesters, but also from allies. We just heard President Joe Biden in his interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria calling this government the most extreme in decades. But yet, Netanyahu and his government still say that they will be pushing forward. And these protesters say that they will continue coming out to the streets. In fact, some of them even say they're going to be pitching tents in downtown Tel Aviv to make this protest even more permanent. Zain.",

And he said this is an opportunity to just push everything at once. And he did not take into consideration, the huge pushback, the strong resistance that his government would meet in the streets of every Israeli city, hundreds of thousands of people protesting, people within the military, in the Air Force, in the special units, in the intelligence saying, we will quit, we will no longer serve if this becomes the law of the land, and of course also the international reaction. And then he said, okay, let's stop and let's try to do it instead gradually, piece by piece. We call it here in Israel the salami mess, like you slice a salami into pieces. So, now, they're trying to push through one piece of it, which is basically taking away the Supreme Court's ability to conduct judicial review over governmental decisions. This is not about legislation right now. This is about what we call the reasonableness standard, the ability of the Supreme Court in Israel to come and say that a decision made by a minister in the government, an appointment perhaps, is extremely unreasonable. I want to give you one example, Zain. Netanyahu is a criminal defendant right now facing his own corruption trial in the Jerusalem District. Of course, he's innocent in the Israeli system until proven otherwise, or if he retains his innocence. But theoretically, he could try to fire the Israeli attorney general who is leading the case against him. Today, it's very likely that if his government fires the attorney general at the same time that he has a clear interest there, the Supreme Court will say, no, this is an extremely unreasonable decision and it will strike it down. If you cancel the reasonableness standard, new options open up.",

Much of the focus of the next couple of days at the summit will be the question of Ukraine, both how to support that country in its war with Russia and the more complicated issue of when and how to make Ukraine a NATO member. Time now for The Exchange and joining me live now is someone who knows NATO and Ukraine, as well as anyone. Kurt Volker was U.S. Ambassador to NATO from 2008, 2009, and later served as the U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine negotiations. Ambassador Volker, thank you so much for being with us. So, so great to have you. Obviously, it is virtually impossible for Ukraine to join NATO in the middle of a war for obvious reasons. But one thing that Zelenskyy intimated was that by being hazy about a timeline for Ukraine to join NATO, Russia might indeed try to capitalize on that. Perhaps by making it part of the negotiations to end the war, saying, look, we will end the war. There will be a ceasefire as long as Ukraine does not join NATO over the next X amount of years. I mean, is that a concern here, the fact that Russia may indeed capitalize on the fact that there is no clear timetable for Ukraine to join NATO? KURT VOLKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: All right, so, I think that there are a couple of big issues here that maybe aren't getting -- of course, Ukraine's not going to join NATO at Vilnius itself. Both the objective could be to send a very clear message to Putin that his war is failing, it will fail, and Ukraine will be a member of NATO, so we will have security in the future. This is not only about Ukrainian security. It's about NATO security. We are now suffering, all of us in NATO, paying money, taking refugees, spending all of our defense resources because of Russia's attacks on Ukraine. So, we don't want to be in this situation again. So, Ukraine must come into the alliance. That's the signal that Putin has to get. If we waffle, and that's what Zelenskyy is referring to, if we just give another vague statement that is hard for anyone to really understand what it means, Putin will take that as yet another green light to keep fighting.",

Compare that to a lot of existing NATO allies, if you're going to go into a fight, you really want Ukraine on your side, rather than even some of these others who have much smaller militaries. So that's one thing. A second thing is that it is the absence of a security guarantee for Ukraine that has caused Vladimir Putin to attack, and this war has foisted consequences on all of Europe now. We've seen it with refugees. We've seen it with energy supplies, with inflation. And it is going to get worse, unless Putin is convinced that the days of warfare in Europe for him are over. So, it is important for NATO to rebuild security in Europe by bringing Ukraine in.

He did get Sweden to make a few important steps on committing that they do not want to be a supporter of terrorism. They don't want their territory used by a terrorist group such as the BKK.

As far as other things, though, and you mentioned the comment he made about the European Union, I don't think that you can link these promises because they are so different.

So, obviously, Meta has found a lot of success with Threads, a hundred million users in just a few days. But obviously the more serious issue is the issue of the elections in just over a year from now. Just explain to us what safeguards are in place. I mean, what lessons have been learned by Threads in terms of what Twitter has gone through on this front? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, a hundred and a hundred million and one users now, with you joining.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and two, with you, Donie.O'SULLIVAN: Exactly. Look, I will say, obviously, Threads has been you know an enormous success for Meta and I think it does say a lot about just how bad a job Elon Musk has done with Twitter, kind of making it a space that has been inhospitable to the truth and to facts. You know, the platform's just become really, really messy. So, people are looking for an alternative, and Meta is kind of filling that gap right now. So, you know, it's a great platform, people are enjoying being on it. I'm certainly using it now more than I'm using Twitter. But we asked some simple questions of Meta over the past few days, particularly, you know, you've launched this whole global new platform, although it's not yet available in the European Union due to privacy concerns. What additional resources have you put there? I mean, is there going to be more moderators? Are they hiring people to work on that? And essentially, Meta was unable to answer that question. They didn't seem to suggest that they had hired any additional people to work, you know, moderating and monitoring to make sure this platform of a hundred million people is safe. And of course, then, that also comes as we're also hearing from people inside the company, and people who have just recently left the company about these costs to election teams.",
