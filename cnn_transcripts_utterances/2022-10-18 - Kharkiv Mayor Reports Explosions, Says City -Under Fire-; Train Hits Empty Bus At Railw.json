There were a further round of attempted drone strikes in Kyiv last night. They all seem to have been intercepted. There were air raid sirens here through the night as well and no indications of impacts that we're aware of it in Kyiv at the moment. But the strikes in Kharkiv show that there are still holes in Russia -- in Ukraine's air defense systems. Clearly, there's a major effort to protect the capital.

It isn't far from U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM forces. Just one day after the attack on the PAK base, CENTCOM shut down another Iranian drone, which appeared they say as a threat to CENTCOM forces stationed in the area. And as the U.S. anti-ISIS presence in Iraq is set to continue, so is the threat Iran poses. These female fighters have vowed to fight until there is a regime change in Iran.
