We're standing by any moment now to hear from the president United States about what in any other economy would read as a simply blockbuster jobs report. 253,000 jobs added last month, beating out expectations by 70 plus thousands.Unemployment at a 50-year low. Look at that, 3.4 percent, black unemployment a lowest ever level of 4.7 percent, job gains in healthcare, in the restaurant industry, in construction, wages climbing, the superlatives are plenty resilient, durable, historic, but yes also disruptive. The Fed suggesting this week it might be done with interest rate hikes, but these jobs numbers spiking after a downward trend in the past three months, again, underlines the Fed struggled to cool the economy just enough to tame starboard inflation. As we wait for the president. Let's get straight to New York with CNN's Matt Egan. Matt, walk us through the big numbers? And forgive me if I have to interrupt.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, these historic jobs boom continues, despite everything going on right now, despite the Fed slamming the brakes on the economy, despite the worst banking crisis since 2008, and despite the wave of tech layoffs that we keep hearing about. A lot of people thought that hiring would slow down in April, instead it accelerated 253,000 jobs added, unemployment rate 3.4 percent.You know, to get a lower number than this, you have to go back to 1953 under Dwight Eisenhower, and really, we saw across the board solid numbers here. Professional services, healthcare, leisure and hospitality, all of them adding tens of thousands of jobs. RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas, I think he summed it up best he said, quote, \"the American labor market right now is simply unstoppable.\" Now, there were negative revisions to February and March that showed fewer jobs added. And we could say that hiring has slowed down, but not by that much. All of this, of course, is great news for everyone who's worried about a recession. There's nothing about today's report that screams an ongoing or an imminent recession. But here's the problem for the Federal Reserve. Inflation is still more than double what is considered healthy. That is the green line on the screen. And wages, the blue line, they are still well above what is considered normal, what you need to get to get inflation back to 2 percent. So, this does suggest that the Fed may have more work to do. In fact, John, after today's report, investors on Wall Street, they started to dial back their expectations of interest rate cuts later this summer. These numbers are all going to change next week when we get a very important inflation report.",

Matt Egan, thanks for kicking us off. Let's continue the conversation. With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Melanie Zanona, Toluse Olorunnipa of The Washington Post, Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times, and Bloomberg's Peggy Collins.Peggy, let me start with you. And it just showed this chart. Joe Biden has been president during the pandemic recovery, if you will. Jobs in the American economy, now exceeding where they were pre pandemic. 253,000 jobs, historically low unemployment rate, black unemployment lowest ever. We could go on and on. And yet, there's this concern that what, it's a little too strong and the Fed has to keep going.",

Such a strong number showing that people who want jobs in this economy are still getting them.Also, interesting that the numbers came out amid the banking turmoil. This captures April. So, showing that some businesses are not cutting back per se, even though there's some volatility out there. I think what Powell is going to have to deal with is, can we pause in June and give the economy a little bit of time to catch up to the rising interest rates? Or do we have to raise again?",

So, half of the country is saying now they're worried about their money in the bank. At the White House, they get the idea of like, can we catch a break here, but the fundamental numbers are pretty strong.",

Not only do you have a substantial number of Republicans who just don't want to raise the debt ceiling under any circumstances, you actually also have a subset of those people who don't even think that defaulting would be a problem.Clearly, you know, what we're hearing from market experts and economists and the White House and Democrats, and many Republicans is we can't default at any cost. But there is a group of Republicans that doesn't even believe that. And because there is so little political consensus, there's very -- it's the path to getting to the negotiating table for anything substantive. Now, obviously, Kevin McCarthy and President Biden are going to meet next week. They will talk, but there's no sign yet that there is a substantial negotiation that's going on either in public or behind the scenes to get this done.",

If you say if you ask people now, ask today, we'll see as we get near the end of the month, we get into the deadline and the negotiations and all of that.We ask people to say who would you blame? Who would have the main blame for default? 39 percent say Republicans in Congress, 36 percent say the president, 16 percent say both.

So even if Republicans get more of the blame, there's a chance he's going to get some of the blowback as well. And talking to Republicans, they are doing polling in their own districts, and they say the public is on their side in terms of demanding spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling.So that is really what's driving both sides. That's why they're so dug in right now. One potential off ramp is that they could do a short- term patch. That's something that the White House left the door open to yesterday. But the question is whether Republicans would agree to that. In my sense is that they would not agree to that unless there is some serious commitment from the White House that they are willing to negotiate on spending cuts. And even then, they still have to agree on something like the date, whether they do add anything, right down. So, it's just -- it's very complicated.

And yes, we spent a lot of money to pull the country out of the pandemic, but they're trying to say that that's working, and don't allow Republicans to start slashing the budget and cutting all of these important programs, repealing some of the laws that were passed under President Biden's first two years, because that would reverse some of the progress.And we've started starting to see that messaging ramp up, saying that all of the bills Republicans have passed recently out of the House, including their debt ceiling bill would reverse some of this project progress halted in its tracks and not allow the economy to strengthen and get to what the White House calls stable and steady growth.

And yet the president then quickly shifting to the big crossroads just ahead. His meeting next week at the congressional leadership to discuss, he says he's not negotiating to discuss raising the debt limit. The president says, we should do that, then discuss potential budget cuts or spending priorities. Republicans want to do it all at once. Our great reporters are back at the table with us.

What's striking to me listening to him just now, and he's been doing this for months.And you hear Democrats on the Hill doing the same thing is how determined he is to keep these two conversations separate, the conversation about raising the debt limit, and the conversation about potential spending cuts, deficit reduction, and all the rest. It's becoming harder and harder for him to do that as the x-state gets closer and closer, and he wants to show and that he's willing to talk to Republicans and that he's not being unreasonable. Republicans are really trying to drive that wedge. They obviously want to connect these things together. That's how -- that's the only way they have any leverage in this discussion. And I think it's going to become more difficult, you know, starting on Tuesday, when they sit down for the White House and for the president to keep those two things apart. Obviously, there's a reason he's arguing that, and they want to have the question in a vacuum, should we default, or should we not? Because the answer seems pretty obvious, I think, to most people in the public. But it's going to be very hard to keep the conversation just focused around that given the stakes.",

Even if you have to have a conversation to the kitchen table about should we be spending less, can we buy more? Can we take that vacation?The president says that's how normal people do it.
