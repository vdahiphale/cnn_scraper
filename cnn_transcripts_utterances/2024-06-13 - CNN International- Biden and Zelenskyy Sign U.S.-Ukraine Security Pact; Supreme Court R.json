I'm Erica Hill, in for Jim Sciutto this afternoon.You've just been watching, of course, President Joe Biden of the United States, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine there, taking just a few questions at the G7 summit in Italy on the hail -- on the heels, rather, of announcing this historic long-term from security agreement between the two countries. The leaders laying out what this long-term relationship between Washington and Kyiv entails. Its a 10-year commitment to train Ukraine's armed services, help produce weapons, increase intelligence sharing. Zelenskyy calling this a, quote, truly historic day, and said that this pact will benefit the entire your world. Joe Biden also asked him, one of the very first questions there at the press conference, about his son Hunter's conviction on federal charges earlier this week. He, of course, was convicted on three different federal counts for illegally purchasing and then owning a gun in 2018. The president saying he's extremely proud of his son for overcoming his addiction and repeated, he will not pardon Hunter Biden. Joining me now to discuss, CNN international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, who is in Italy for the G7 summit, and CNN senior reporter Stephen Collinson, who is in Washington. Nic, just to start off with you. So we heard that the details here of this executive agreement that we had known abroad strokes about interesting, some of the questions I think are the questions that a lot of people had that were first posed to the presidents there, which were so what happens when somebody else is in power because, of course, the United States staring down an election in just a matter of months? What is the reality for this agreement if in fact President Biden is no longer in power next year, Nic?",

Those are also important words moving into this election here in the United States, which is being watched so closely around the world because of the comments that have been made by former President Donald Trump about his thoughts on NATO, especially if he were to be reelected.",

And they're also very important words for the people of Ukraine to hear from their present after what has been quite a grim period in the war that's civilians are taking a lot of punishment from Russian raids. And we've seen some advances for the Russians on the battlefield.I think what really stood out to me was when the president in reference to remarks that Zelenskyy was making about unity around the world for Ukraine's cause. As you mentioned, he said that they were pulling Ukraine closer into the Euro Atlantic community. All of these agreements that Nic was talking about, not just the U.S. Ukraine agreement, the agreement to use interest on frozen Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine, coming agreement with NATO to institutionalize support for Ukraine. They are hedging against the possibility that Donald Trump could return. In some ways, they are also increasing the political and the moral cost that Trump would incur if he walks away. I think if it was any other kind of leader, that might be something that would weigh upon him if he goes into the Oval Office on January the 20th next year, but there is I think some danger that Trump will watch this and think that he's being boxed in and that might even harden him more against Ukraine, more against those NATO members. He spent his first term, many of them berating on the question of what whether they're spending enough for their own defense. So this is very interesting diplomatic development, but its going to really have, I think reverberations back home in the United States during this election campaign.",

And then when they give those weapons, a lot of them come with a lot of rules, caveats and limitations. Right now, that Ukrainians are allowed to use some weapons to strike the Russians around Kharkiv. But they can't strike other logistics supply lines with U.S. weapons without getting censure from the White House. That's frustrated European allies. Even British officials who've given weapons systems to Ukraine and put no limits on how they can use them. Think everyone has this sense of time running out, just possibly so the feeling is, get the Ukrainians as much as you can as quickly as you can, right now and let them do what they think they have to do. So that's what I heard from multiple European officials. So there'll be somewhat reassured and pacified by what happened today in terms of the ten years security pact.

CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider and CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell, joining me now. So, Jess, when we look at this initially, so the court said you had no standing here. Basically, this was a procedural -- a procedural ruling, but he didn't weigh in on the merits of this case or the argument which could have had a major impact, not just on this drug, but also on the FDA and its approval process.

So yes, it is very possible that another group could assemble and then bring this -- bring a lawsuit very similarly, in hopes that they have the standing. I mean, it could be people like women who have been injured by this drug even though this drug is very safe, very effective.So it is possible that the legal questions surrounding whether or not the FDA had the authority to first approve this abortion drug in the year 2000 and then ease some of the restrictions on it in subsequent years. For example, it's now available via mail. Its now billable via telehealth, women can get it up to ten weeks of pregnancy instead of previously it was only up to seven weeks of pregnancy. So a lot of the restrictions have been relaxed in recent years, and those are all things that this group of doctors who opposed abortion, they were all fighting the fact that the FDA had approved this drug and then ease some of these restrictions. But the Supreme Court dismissing this unanimously today, saying that these doctors, because they didn't use mifepristone, because they didn't prescribe mifepristone. They just had no basis for bringing this lawsuit. But you're absolutely right, Erica, it leaves the door open to other challengers who might have a more direct link or direct injury to mifepristone to bring a case in the future. I will note if they do, were probably talking months, if not years down the road that this would take to put together a lawsuit, bring it into the courts, and then come to a decision. So, for now, it's going to be status quo with this abortion pill it will remain widely available until some other legal challenge makes its way through the courts.",

The other one is this is my misoprostol and people are increasingly accessing these medications through telemedicine. So 19 percent of all abortions in the U.S. last year were via telehealth. So this is an increasingly important way that people access these medications and this is not going to change as a result of this ruling because this was tossed out on standing. But as we were just hearing, this could come back and another legal challenge through the same pathway. But I'm also hearing that there's a lot of focus on who wins the next presidential election because that could put leadership into place at the Department of Health and Human Services and at the FDA that can potentially even roll back some of these things that have made this drug easier to access, that can happen a lot faster.

But for the November election, as well as their third agenda item, was it begin discussing specific policy for 2025 five should Donald Trump reclaim the White House so that they could hit the ground running. Now, look, the House Republican meeting with Donald Trump this morning was what you described. Even though he had wanted to talk about policy, talk about staying on message, he kind of did rant and go all over the place. You mentioned, he talked about Taylor Swift. He criticized her support of President Joe Biden. He brought up Nancy Pelosi. He criticized many of the members who voted to impeach him, not very much on message. However, we did hear from members in the room that the he did really get that kind of rah-rah pep valley -- pep rally vibe that he was seeking in that meeting. Now, for the Senate Republican meeting up until later in the day, that was more subdued. And I think you saw that with Donald Trumps remarks following that meeting. We were told that Donald Trump was very cordial, particularly with people who have opposed him in the past. Now, we know a key person that we were watching was Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, someone who had not spoken with Donald Trump ever since the Capitol attack around January 6 in 2021. They spoke today. Donald Trump sat next to him, our great reporters who were getting details from inside the room told us. And again, he was cordial with those, even those who argue that they do not plan to support him. And so, a different kind of Donald Trump indeed.

Now, from Donald Trumps perspective, I can tell you that he privately continues to tell people close to him that he thinks the issue as a political loser. He does not want to be discussing this as they look forward to November. And he's very worried as well about the Republican Party and the rhetoric they -- they use to discuss abortion. That's why we heard him say today that he wants them to use the correct language, to be careful how they frame this to the American public. And of course, we know this about Donald Trump.

It is on the agenda as you say it, with religious groups, it's on the agenda with the Supreme Court and Democrats need voters to feel that this is an important voting issue in November, because what we see in polls is that while this is a winning issue for Democrats, it's not necessarily the number one issue that people are keeping in mind as they vote.So, Democrats hoping to send this message over and over again in as many ways that they can, that this is going to be on the ballot and that people need to keep this issue in mind. So as you say Republican, some Republicans proposed their own -- Republicans have been trying to send the message that they want to protect IVF, but that in this case, they had concerns with this bill. There were details about it, that they did not agree with. It would have created an insurance mandate, for example, that Republicans viewed as not necessary or is too expensive. So there were reasons that they had for not supporting this particular bill, but they still want people to know that they do not want Americans to believe that if Republicans win the House and Senate and/or the presidency, that they would somehow move to ban IVF because I overwhelming majority of Americans, I believe nearly 90 percent in some polls do support IVF, do support there being access to reproductive technologies for them to be able to grow their families.",

That kind of detail hasn't been given. In the court documents, though, in the indictment which had been made public for the first time, there were a few kind of interesting details about what he's accused of, details that hadn't been made public before. First of all, the documents say that Gershkovich was acting on the instructions of the CIA at previously a specific allegation that Gershkovich was working with the CIA, had not been made by the Russians. Obviously, it's something the United States government and Gershkovich himself categorically denies you mentioned. It says that he collected secret information on a tank factory in Yekaterinburg. The factory is called Uralvagonzavod, which means the train carriage maker in the Urals, a factory there. So it's basically a maker of military equipment. It repairs military hardware as well. But the indictment goes on to say that Gershkovich did this with careful measures of secrecy, that that's the phrase that uses. And so the allegation obviously denied by Gershkovich and all around him is that he was engaged in espionage. Now, there's already been a denial from \"The Wall Street Journal\". The U.S. government has also denied it, but \"The Wall Street Journal\" has issued a statement, the editor in chief of the journal, saying the Russian regimes smearing of Aaron -- of Evan is repugnant, disgusting and based on a calculated work, based on calculated and transparent spirit lies. He also says that it's an assault on the free press -- Erica.",
