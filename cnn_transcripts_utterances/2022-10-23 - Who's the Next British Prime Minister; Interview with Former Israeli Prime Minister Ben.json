Now the proximate cause for all of this is that Liz Truss turned out not just to be as you said the shortest lived prime minister in British history. She was also clearly one of the most incompetent or if not the most incompetent. And she came in with a package of sort of warmed over Reaganism where she was going to use tax cuts and deregulation to kick start British growth. And weak British growth has been a problem.But the way she did it and the fact that she brought an even more tax cuts than she promised. She fired her chief financial civil servant, she said she wasn't going to look at any of the technocrat reviews of how much she was spending. That meant that she lost the confidence of the market as you'll remember. The pound tumbled, gilt yield soared, and that loss of confidence over the financial markets in the Conservative Party, in the British government, was the kind of proximate cause. But behind that, I think there are two things which you're right are related to Brexit. One is economically. Britain is a riskier place since it left the European Union because its economy has been hit, and the fact that we had COVID and the pandemic sort of masked that. But there is no doubt that the British economy is in less good shape that it would have been if we hadn't left the European Union. And secondly, politically as you say, Brexit still hangs over the Tory Party, a party that is tired after four years in government that is still driven by debates about whether Brexit means that Britain has the ability to become a kind of buccaneering and deregulated Singapore on Thames which was sort of the Liz Truss view, or whether it's actually a means to allowing a clamp down on immigration and a much more sort of Little England be which many others in the Tory Party have. And so the Tory Party is completely factionally (INAUDIBLE). It's the oldest political party in the world. It used to be absolutely brilliant --",

Italy has long had dramatic political instability. It has been under the thumb of the bond market and had chronically low growth.[10:15:04] And actually if you look at the U.K. now, it has many of the same things. We've had the same number of prime ministers as Italy since 2015. We're also under the thumb of the bond markets, even though we have our own central bank and own currency. But perhaps most worryingly, our productivity has slumped. It's still better than Italy's, but it is has slumped, and we have very slow growth. And one thing that Liz Truss was right on is that Britain needs to get its growth rate higher. It needs the reforms that make the economy grow because we can't support our social spending, our National Health Service, all the things that Britons like without faster growth. But we are at the moment unable to produce a coherent set of policies and have politicians who are serious, steadfast and have the caliber to get that done.",

Actually, what you did was reverse that. You and the Gulf States in a sense. What do you think changed? Was it that the Palestinian issue has just declined in importance for Arabs? Because there was a time, you know, certainly when you go back to Nasser and people like that, where it was the central issue.

I devoted a good chunk of my life, and all my adult life to enhancing Israel's military power, which could only be enhanced by freeing up its economy. So we have economic power. And the combination of the two gave us the third power, which is diplomatic power.When Israel became the leading -- perhaps a leading if not the leading innovation nation that produced thousands of start-ups, produced cybersecurity, produced unmatchable intelligence against terrorism, we became interesting to other countries in five continents, but also in the Middle East. And when I frankly led the opposition to Iran's arming itself with nuclear weapons, that created a common interest with many of the Arab countries. So the rise of the Iranian threat on the one side and the rise of Israeli power on the other side, combined to, I think, to create the interest in the Gulf States who now view Israel not as their enemy, but as their indispensable ally to confront a common threat, Iran, and also to better the lives of their citizens with Israeli innovation and technology.",

That was a deliberate decision.Also, to be honest, and I don't think I'm revealing here something you don't know, but I'll say it any way. There's no way that the accords with the Gulf States would have happened without the approval of Saudi Arabia. So Saudi Arabia is inching its way towards normalization. I think that's enroute. That will be certainly be my chief goal, diplomatic goal if I'm re-elected, as I hope I will be in a few weeks. I think they have to have the confidence that Israel is continuing the policy of standing up to Iranian aggression, which threatens them, not as much, but not much less than it threatens us.

In fact, we then went to the IAEA with three sites, three nuclear sites that they hadn't declared.So Iran was cheating. The deal wasn't protecting in any way. And yes, with a deal or without a deal, Iran would go forward to develop nuclear weapons. The only thing that stops a rogue regime from developing nuclear weapons, and I say this very specifically in my book, is the combination of crippling sanctions and a credible military option. All the agreement does, Fareed, is give Iran an international seal of approval to become a threshold nuclear state. Everybody understands it. The deal is not going to stop Iran.

Of course not. It's not Holland that's getting nuclear weapons. It's the ayatollahs, for God's sake.
