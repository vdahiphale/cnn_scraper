The traffic, bumper to bumper right now heading out of that city.What's expected to be the most powerful storm of 2024 is approaching the Gulf Coast of Florida at this hour. Here's the view of Hurricane Milton from the International Space Station. Wow, look at that. It's expected to make landfall late Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Mandatory evacuations ordered in parts of nine counties. Thousands jamming highways looking to get to safety. Forecasters expecting Milton to hit cities like Tampa with up to 15 feet of storm surge. That is double what Hurricane Helene delivered less than two weeks ago. Let's bring in former FEMA administrator Brock Long. Brock, good morning to you. Thank you very much for being with us this morning. Obviously, the Tampa Bay area is still reeling from Hurricane Helene. FEMA is stretched pretty thin. What are the challenges here and how do you think the preparations are going for this? What are you preparing for?",

But in this case, when you're talking about a major hurricane, the damage is going to be off the charts, you know, as the - as the forecast track holds.The debris isn't - is vegetative, but it's also commercial and demolition.

It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish, and it is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): I've had storms under both President Trump and President Biden. And I've worked well with both of them. She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm and she's doing that just because of her campaign. She's trying to get some type of an edge.

We also saw John McCain do the same thing. And I think part of what we are seeing right now is, yes, an attempt to - to - to really position themselves politically. But also there's the recognition that this is a moment that is - that is devastating, right? Essentially, one of the things that we're hearing over and over again from FEMA is that the amount of misinformation, the amount of politicization that has entered the conversation right now is actually negatively affecting what they are able to do and how people are able to respond to the storm right now.

A new focus group moderated by pollster Frank Luntz and \"The New York Times\" recently asked a group of young, undecided voters exactly that, what have they changed their minds about in recent weeks.Twenty-seven-year-old Lillian told them this, quote, \"I think the thing raising my opinion of Trump is my opinion of Kamala. The Biden- Harris administration couldn't establish deterrence in the Middle East for the last year, and so now they are bombing the heck out of Israel.\" \"Walz surprise me as well. I thought he was eloquent and civil,\" responded 20-year-old Laura. And for 24-year-old Joseph, it was foreign policy. He felt like, quote, \"at points in the last month, we haven't even been a power given everything going on in the Middle East.\" Joining me now, former adviser to George W. Bush and John McCain, Mark McKinnon, also the creator of Paramount's \"The Circus.\" Mark, always wonderful to have you. Thank you so much for being here. A lot of talk this week about October surprises or lack thereof. I feel like we may be at the point where there - there's just so much that's stacking up that there's no single thing that may surprise us, but also, when you make these kind of predictions, I think we've all learned that lesson enough to know not to do it anymore in our politics. What do you see as being the major - potential major impacts on this race that has been so, so, so close all the way along here since the top of the ticket changed? MARK MCKINNON, CREATOR, \"THE CIRCUS\": Good morning, Kasie. Well, the one thing I would say is that at this point, in this race, there really aren't very many undecided voters. I - Frank Luntz had to do a lot of work to find those undecided voters, I guarantee you. So, the question when you have limited resources, you spend trying to find those very limited undecided voters, do you try and persuade those people, or do you try and motivate people who have already made up their minds? That's where you should spend the resources. You're trying to - you're . trying to animate and make enthusiastic voters who are for you and get your base out, because there just aren't that many undecided voters. So, that's kind of a waste of resources because there just aren't that many people now. That said, with the - with the election pretty much set and with voters deciding what could change it. Well, the one thing that could change it is a storm, and a massive storm and an historic storm. Ask me about Katrina. You're doing a heck of a job, Brownie. You remember that one?",

And I think that the - there's two things that you mentioned in your polling earlier about Harris that I think are - are - are compelling and relevant. One is, that she's become the change candidate. But, you know, more than Trump has, which is astonishing when you think about the fact that she's a - she's technically the incumbent. So, that's - that's kind of a magic trick that she's pulling off, that she's become the change agent as an incumbent.The other thing was your fun factor. I mean, you know, at a very base level - this is kind of the Occam's razor point of view on this thing, which is, who do you want to see on your television for the next four years?

One, she gets to talk to gun owners, right? This is area - an area that largely Democrats have been cut off from. But she also simultaneously gets to talk to two-thirds of Americans who believe in sensible or stricter gun reform, right? She gets to do both. And then the last point here is that, while we focus on this, while we talk about, OK, what kind of gun is she going to do? What - you know, how long has she been this? She actually doesn't have to answer other questions, right? So, we're so focused on these kind of conversations around gun ownership and things like that, we're not actually talking about the other hit points from these interviews, whether she answered them, did she answer them appropriately, that kind of thing.
