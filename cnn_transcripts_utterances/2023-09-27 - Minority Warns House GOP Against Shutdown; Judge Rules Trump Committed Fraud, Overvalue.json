We do expect the Senate to pass its bill eventually, but because of its inclusion of about $6 billion in aid to Ukraine, Rand Paul of Kentucky plans to drag out the process over his opposition to that, but it is expected to pass probably into the weekend and then what happens? There are several options the Senate could pass the bill that doesn't ever get a vote in the House. The House Democratic moderates could join forces with House Republican moderates to try to circumvent the Speaker and try to force a vote on the floor. That's an effort that rarely succeeds, but one that is being actively discussed.Or this could simply just be a prolonged government shutdown until McCarthy allows -- agrees to move forward with a bipartisan bill to keep the government open. But as you know, Dana, the threat from the far right continues to linger over Speaker McCarthy if he cuts a bipartisan deal. Some of them are warning they could push him out for the Speakership, for doing just that, showing just how complicated things are for the Speaker and for Republicans to get on the same page as Congress dares a shutdown into this weekend.

There has to be Democrats and Republicans coming together, we're seeing it happen in the Senate. It's going to have to happen in the House too.

That -- I mean, also will play into this as well. But also have to answer the question, if not McCarthy, who? And the fact that no one really wants this is job could play in his favor.

And those incentives are just like gone now in the House. And instead, they are getting rewarded by the right-wing media, the circles in which they travel, for what they are doing.And a lot of the things that McCarthy has tried to do through the course of the week and -- I mean, as you know, you and I have covered this in those hallways a lot. We have stood out a lot of doors, like while they were trying to avoid some of these shutdowns. And in the past, people could be convinced when they were shown that there was a lot of anger at them within their own conference, that leadership would perhaps punish them if they didn't go along with things. And none of that is working. And so, I think to a certain extent, McCarthy looks both stressed out and also kind of resigned, like it's going to happen.",

You can see kind of Republican leadership, particularly in the Senate, really kind of call their caucus to get in line and make these specific arguments that this wasn't about D vs. R, this is about supporting border agents, military, the folks who will really be hurt by this government shutdown.But o the earlier point that these individual congress members, particularly in the House on the right flank, have an independent power structure now. They are supported by right-wing media. They are popularized through Donald Trump. And they frankly find Mitch McConnell and that league of conservatives to be an oppositional force. I was in South Carolina when Trump led the audience in boos for Mitch McConnell. That was the reason they are kind of politically insulated from that type of pressure. But I got to say, like with these types of situations, with shutdowns, we typically ask the question of who this benefits kind of D vs. R, if this were to happen. I think the point is really true that this benefits no one. This is just another kind of instance of pain that Washington would inflict on American people that really drives that sort of effect (ph) between what we see in kind of D.C. versus the rest of the country. I think as we look to the election next year, that's really going to be a thing to track. These continued instances, do these shutdowns, do these impeachment inquiries, do they drive people to feel completely disconnected from the system. Do they drive people to be less likely to back D or R, rather than being something that benefits one party versus another.",
