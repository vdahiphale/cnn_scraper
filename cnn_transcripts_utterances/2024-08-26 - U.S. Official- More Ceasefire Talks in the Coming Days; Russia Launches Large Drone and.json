That will be any moment now. It is 09:00 a.m. in Virginia. It's 05:00 p.m. here, back at base in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\" also happening over the next two hours, Israel and Hezbollah exchange fire as fears escalate of a wider war, even as the U.S. says progress is made in Gaza talks. Ukraine hit by a new massive bombardment in one of Russia's biggest attacks on the country to date, and after the Founder of Telegram is detained in Paris the Kremlin denies President Vladimir Putin met him in Azerbaijan. Well, the stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. It's 09:00 a.m. now, the markets, of course, open at 09:30 and the futures markets at least pointing to a mixed open in New York. More on that bottom of the hour. We start with this region where I am on a knife's edge after weekend cross border attacks between Hezbollah and Israel happening as Gaza ceasefire talks grind on in Egypt after Israel launched what it calls pre-emptive strikes, its prime minister bluntly warned quote, what happened today is not the end. Hezbollah's leader says a first phase of attacks to retaliate for the killing of a top military commander recently is over, but that more may happen in the future, all fuelling genuine concern that a wider war may still erupt in this region. And in Cairo, negotiating teams are still trying to hammer out remaining issues for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza. A U.S. official revealing new details of the deal and reports progress, but says there is still work to be done on the sticking points. Well, we've got an awful lot to unpack here with our team of correspondents. Ben Wedeman connecting us from Beirut today. Nic Robinson is in Tel Aviv, and we'll start with Nada Bashir, who is in Cairo, monitoring those talks. And the U.S. Nada seems optimistic about the progress of these talks. They do those seem to be the only party feeling that way. What do we understand to be the situation at this point?",

It appears that both sides are claiming success. That Hezbollah said that they struck the Headquarters of Mossad and the signal intelligence unit of the Israeli military unit 8200 Nasrallah said that everything we planned, we achieved, and the Israelis say that none of their bases were hit. So, it appears that now we are back to where we were before all of this. But however, Hassan Nasrallah, in his speech last night, did say that another escalation has not been taken off the table.

One appears to have been afailed attempt to kill a local Hamas leader. Hezbollah has claimed that it struck surveillance equipment at an Israeli military position in the central border area. Hezbollah has made it clear that it will stop firing at Israel as soon as the war in Gaza comes to an end, and of course, that all depends upon the until now dismally unsuccessful American efforts to bring a ceasefire and a final halt to the fighting there. So, as I said, we're back to where we were. Daily exchanges of fire between the two sides. There are more than 100,000 Lebanese who have had to flee their homes on this side of the border, more than 60,000 Israelis on the other.

Well, Ukraine's President is calling a new massive bombardment, one of Russia's biggest attacks on his country. President Volodymyr Zelensky says that more than 100 missiles and about the same number of drones targeted more than a dozen Ukrainian regions overnight. At least four people were killed, including a British citizen who worked for Reuters news agency. Ryan Evans, a safety adviser and former soldier, was staying at a hotel hit by a Russian missile. Right now, you're looking at footage of Ukrainian forces shooting at a Russian drone. Ukrainian officials say energy facilities across the country have been shelled, knocking out power in cities, including in the capital of Kyiv.

Ukraine's air force acted quickly to intercept those but of course, there were consequences, including four people killed power outages across the country. The main target here was Ukraine's energy infrastructure. And of course, many, many families sent into bomb shelters, hiding underground, hiding in metro stations, taking shelter wherever they can, as these air raid sirens, of course, sounded all across the country. And the intention behind this, Ukrainian officials say, is to make ordinary life difficult, if not impossible for Ukrainians, even those who are very far from that battlefield, but that battlefield very much continues to move. President Zelenskyy, while also addressing this barrage, did update people with the latest movements in Kursk, where Ukraine is, of course, continuing to claim some wins.

And I also want to take you one last location here, Becky, Kramatorsk. This is important. This happened over the weekend. Kramatorsk is an area that is used by journalists as a base in order to cover the conflict, and that's exactly what a Reuters crew was doing. They were staying at a hotel in Kramatorsk, Hotel Safire, when it was struck over the weekend by a Russian attack. Several members of this Reuter crew -- Reuters crew, rather, were wounded, and one person their security adviser, a British national you did mention his name was killed in this attack. Reuters is appealing for more information. Is issuing condolences to his family, and President Zelenskyy says that this was a deliberate attack on journalists.

Alayna, let me start with you with these pictures coming to us live from Arlington National Ceremony. Donald Trump, the Former President, paying his respects to the 13 service members killed during the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

In fact, according toa campaign memo, a third of the donations were from first time contributors. And the reason that is important is because that's the type of momentum that they're going to want to continue over the course of the next two months. I'm told that there are conversations being had among Harris advisors in terms of how they do that. Of course, grassroots donations can be a little harder to predict than tapping into some of the big-time donors. And so, they have to capitalize on key moments, and one of those moments for them did happen last week with the Vice President closing out the Democratic National Convention. Again, according to this memo, that speech marked the best fundraising hour since they launched the Harris presidential bid. So of course, this is a massive sum of money, $540 million. They already have some plans for how they want to use the money in the -- in their coffers. $370 million for example, at least that much is going to be reserved for television and digital advertising between Labor Day and Election Day. The intent there, of course, a flood the airwaves. Try to take up as much space as they can over the course of the next two months and trying to relay their message. But in addition to all of this, it's also making sure that they keep up their fund rate that I'm sorry, their volunteers and their travel blitz to these battleground states, including Georgia, where the vice president is headed this week, a state that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes in 2020.",

Telegram is a messaging app that's encrypted, which means there's privacy baked in by design. People can have these private conversations that the app doesn't necessarily have a ton of control over, and that's by design. CEO Pavel Durov has become something of a champion for free speech. He's also been known as the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia, although he doesn't live in Russia anymore, he sort of likes to flaunt his lavish lifestyle online. But what's interesting about this platform, and you see this sort of challenge of this free speech debate, is that Telegram has been used by people in places like Iran, where free speech is restricted. It's become a really important tool in Ukraine for citizens to get warnings about air raids. But that privacy also means that the platform has been used by drug traffickers, by money launderers, by terrorists, by far-right extremists. And the app has really started to gain growing scrutiny as it's grown you see that number on the screen there 900 million users on this platform. Now Telegram does have some control over what people do on the platform. It previously shut down communication channels related to Hamas, related to organizers of the U.K. riots that we saw recently, and the platform says that it follows EU law, including the new Digital Services Act that put new requirements on online platforms to moderate harmful content. So, we'll have to see what more French prosecutors say about what they're looking for from the platform here, what information they want or what these charges are?",

The size of that relief, of course, remains open to question. Let's take a look at how these stock markets are faring at the start of the week. And well, I'm little worried about our S&amp;P graphic there, so ignore that one for the time being, the DOW and the NASDAQ. Not a bad start if you are hoping these markets go higher. Of course, not everybody is. Some people betting they will go lower. And the U.S. dollar halting its recent slide against other major currencies like the euro and Sterling. Keep in mind the greenback is still way down for the month, but it does appear to be in recovery mode today, firming slightly after touching new multi month lows on Friday, when the head of the Fed announced, in his words, the time has come for a shift in policy. And oil prices quite somewhat higher today. That's partly due to the escalating tensions that we've been reporting on in the Middle East, but there is a new worry, and that's a worry coming out of Libya. Bloomberg reporting that Libya's Eastern government says it will shut down all oil production and exports in a dispute with its Tripoli based rival over control of Libya's central bank. And that will have a significant impact on the supply of oil, of course, on the markets.
