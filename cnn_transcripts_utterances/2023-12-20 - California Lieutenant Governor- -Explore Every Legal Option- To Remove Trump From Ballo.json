The new push, in America's most populous state, to try and boot him off the ballot, after Colorado Supreme Court removed him, from the Republican primary, for engaging in insurrection. Is California next? The official leading that charge joins us tonight. Also, the fate of the hostages in Gaza. There is word of Israel's new offer, how Hamas is responding, as the humanitarian crisis, in Gaza, grows more desperate by the day. And it's an infamous murder case that once gripped the nation. A pregnant woman killed, and her husband's accusation that ignited deep racial divisions, and mistrust, in Boston. Tonight, an apology, 34 years later, to the two Black men, who were wrongly accused. Kaitlan Collins is off tonight. I am Brianna Keilar. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump's potential return, to the White House, will depend in part on the same branch of government that repeatedly rebuffed his election conspiracy theories. The judiciary. Colorado with its 10 electoral votes unlikely to decide the 2024 race. But there are other cases that are still in the works, one pending in Oregon, and others going through the appeals process, in Arizona, Minnesota, Michigan and New Hampshire. And other states could follow suit, if folks like our first guest, tonight, have their way. We'll have more on that in a moment. As for Trump, he has long made clear, the fealty, he expects, from those he considers allies, including on the bench, once telling supporters, quote, \"If it's my judges, you know how they're going to decide.\" And he filled the courts with lots of judges that he likes to think of as his.

But in another case, Trump is in no rush to put his fate, in the hands of the very people, he gave lifetime appointments. Just today, he asked the Supreme Court, to hold off, on the issue of presidential immunity that Special Counsel, Jack Smith, asked the court to expedite. In California, a number of Democrats are pushing, for their state, to follow Colorado's lead. And that includes our first guest, tonight. California Lieutenant Governor, Eleni Kounalakis. Thank you so much, for being with us, this evening. And we should note, you sent a letter, just hours ago, to California Secretary of State to, quote, \"Explore every legal option to remove former President Donald Trump\" from California's 2024 primary ballot. You cite repeatedly, the Colorado case. But in that case, and frankly, in these other cases as well, that I mentioned, it's anti-Trump groups, suing the Secretaries of State. Is that what you have in mind? LT. GOV. ELENI KOUNALAKIS, (D) CALIFORNIA: Well, good evening, Brianna. It's great to be with you. Thank you for having me on. We are in uncharted territory, in our country. And the decision, out of Colorado, is a very significant fact. When the Supreme Court of Colorado determines, in an examination of the facts, that Donald Trump is an insurrectionist, and therefore is disqualified from being on the ballot? Certainly, here in California, we have to look at that information, and make the same determination here.",

But we all know what happened, back on that terrible day, when the Capitol was overrun. We all know the information that has come out since. And so, for this Supreme Court, in Colorado, to evaluate the facts, make that determination, that is very material. It doesn't say, you have to go through a legal process, and be convicted as an insurrectionist. So, that has to be weighed into this as well. And I really think it's also important to note that in the history of our country, we have never had a former President indicted for anything. But Donald Trump has been indicted four times, on 91 felony counts. This is a highly unusual situation. And for the courts, and the court in Colorado, to make a, determination that he meets the threshold, as an insurrectionist? We absolutely have to consider that, in determining whether or not he's qualified to be on the ballot, in California.",

And you can only imagine what they had to go through, being kidnapped from the home, being in captivity for two months, actually being able to run away, and then being killed a minute before they're being rescued by the IDF. We are looking into the details. The fight with the terrorists happened a few days before the incident, when they were shot. It's unfortunate. It's unfortunate that we were not able to gather the information. But we have to realize that it's a war zone. Our soldiers are fighting against terrorists, a lot of traps in this area. So, I'm not blaming the soldiers. They're under a lot of pressure. We're going to do the proper inquiries. We're going to learn the lesson.

Her husband, Charles, shot in the chest, beside her, told Police, a Black man was responsible. And what followed was a crackdown, by the Boston Police Department, which launched a vigorous campaign, targeting Black men, throughout the city. The investigation stoked long-standing racial divisions, and hardened existing anger, in the city's minority communities. Two Black men, Alan Swanson and Willie Bennett, were wrongfully named as suspects. They were never formally charged. But just how wrong police were, became clear, after Charles Stuart's brother told police that Charles orchestrated the whole thing. Today, Boston Mayor, Michelle Wu, issued an apology, to the families of both men, who were wrongly accused.
