Think of this committee as like the traffic cops on January 6th. They are the ones advising members, you know, about what they can and cannot do on the 6th. And the chairman of this committee is going to actually be up on the dais reading the votes coming in for each state.So they play a very big role that day and I've learned through reporting that the committee has hired these two former Trump campaign officials. One is a former Trump campaign lawyer -- lawyer, Josh Finley, who according to e-mails that our colleague, Marshall Cohen, obtained shows that he was very involved in the planning of the fake elector schemes from emails that we have around 2020. And he's going to be on as a contractor with the committee. He just started earlier this month. And he's supposed to be focusing on election poll workers specifically. Then you have Thomas Lane who is actually the chief counsel on the elections subcommittee. So this is the subcommittee that's investigating elections for this entire committee. And he was a Trump staffer in 2020 in Arizona who actually served as a backup fake elector according to documents that we've obtained and was also involved in a lot of the planning e-mails. So it just raises this question of what happens when you have position -- people in these positions who have different interpretations of what certification means, how that could go on January 6th.",

Now we know obviously it was not four years ago so you're great reporting is shining a light on what could happen, you know, in just a couple months' time.

And they are hitting social media posts, questioning the masculinity of Tim Walz, Doug Emhoff, insinuating effectively that if you are a real man, you will not vote for Kamala Harris.

And you guys talked about this earlier in the show, those sort of culture war manosphere issues, UFC, Zin, masculinity, Joe Rogan, those are adjacent to topics like inflation, to concerns about the state of the world, to general anxiety that has existed with young men, because you're exactly right, you know, they -- some of these folks that I've been talking to on this college tour we've been doing for \"Good Luck, America\" were only nine, 10, 11 years old when Donald Trump was in office.They also went through COVID when they were coming of age. And so young men in particular, in polls and focus groups bear this out, just have a lot of anxiety about the state of the world. Donald Trump is using some of those cultural tactics to tap into that anxiety.

Again, only about a third of Americans, Dana, have a college degree.So this is a subsample of younger voters in general. But the young men that I have been talking to in particular, they don't hate Kamala Harris. They actually like her in certain ways. And even young Republicans I've talked to talk about her more warmly than I guarantee they would have about Hillary Clinton. They just say they think the world was better and safer under Donald Trump. The economy was healthier. One other thing that keeps coming up, too, that you don't hear a lot about in the national media, Dana, is a lot of young men are worried about global conflict because they are of draft age.
