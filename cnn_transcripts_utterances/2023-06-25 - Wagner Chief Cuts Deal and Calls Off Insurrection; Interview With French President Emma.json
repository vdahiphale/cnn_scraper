The rebel leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was the Kremlin's top caterer before he threw away his kitchen apron. He now wears military fatigues as the head of shadowy Wagner Group which has provided mercenaries for conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, and most recently has been a key player in Russia's war against Ukraine.According to statements from the Russian government, the criminal case against Prigozhin was dropped yesterday after he agreed to leave Russia and go to Belarus. For more let me bring in CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow. Good to have you, Matthew. What is the mood in Moscow?",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, that's a great question because I mean yesterday the mood was extremely anxious. It was bracing itself, the city was, for a potentially bloody confrontation. Barricades were set up at the entrant points of the city. Not tunnels, but trenches were dug across the main access roads to try and slow the advance of the Wagner armored column which was heading decisively toward the outskirts of the Russian capital. It stopped a couple of hundred miles on the outside in the end. But,you know, there was a lot of tension that people were sort of bracing themselves for potential bloodshed. And that's been averted because of the deal that you referred to, Prigozhin has apparently been sent to Belarus, although I spoke to Belarusian officials this morning and they say they've got no details on what his status is going to be inside the country or whether he has actually arrived yet. But that relief is also, you know, amongst people in Moscow, is also coupled with a high degree of anxiety as well about what comes next because the idea that this is now doing to have a line drawn under it by Vladimir Putin, and it's just not going to be mentioned again, is totally unrealistic. I mean, this was obviously an unprecedented challenge to Vladimir Putin's authority over the country. He could well now move in the days and the weeks and the months ahead to crack down on the supporters of Prigozhin, to tighten laws even further. I mean, who knows what. And that's what the anxiety is all about now -- Fareed.",

In 23 years in power, he has not faced this kind of challenge to his monopoly on political action and his monopoly on violence. So, you know, it can't be underestimated. Granted, it is a coup that failed and most coups failed, and another important thing is that Prigozhin never said that he was going up against the president.His march was to the president. He very much sort of maintains this narrative that if the president is doing something that he doesn't support, that the people don't like, the people that he claims to represent, then it's because the president doesn't have the right information. The president himself is beyond assault.",

      "sentences": "Yes. This to me was the most extraordinary thing that he said yesterday. He said there were two reasons for the war. One was that the Defense Minister Shoigu wanted to become a marshal, you know, he wanted to raise his rank, and the other reason was that lots of Russian elites have made money from the occupation of eastern Ukraine from Donbas since 2014 and now they wanted to make more money.In other words he was saying this is purely self-interest, this is purely greed, there was no reason to fight this war, and he accompanied that by saying, you know, how badly Russian soldiers have been treated, how many had died unnecessarily. I mean, this is really undermining the entire narrative of the war and really the entire narrative of the invasion of Ukraine going back to 2014. I think it put him in tune with the Russian army in a way that maybe the Russian military leadership is not in that, you know, he wasn't talking about imperialism or Peter the Great or some kind of idea about, you know, Russia's special role or Christianity. You know, he was talking about you aren't giving us enough weapons, you aren't letting us fight. And he -- you know, I think this is the reason why so many soldiers seemed at least initially prepared to support him. I mean, to me the extraordinary moment yesterday was after that comment was when he was sitting in the courtyard in Rostov with the leaders of the Southern Military District kind of chatting away and they seemed very happy that he was there and nobody was trying to arrest him or take him away. So he has some kind of rapport and he has some kind of -- you know, he had some kind of ability to impress the army. I mean, the question now is whether any of that will be retained.",

The only guess I can have is he was -- you know, this is a mercenary. He wanted his money, you know, his contract was over July 1st and they offered to pay him off. That's one possibility.The other possibility is that maybe he expected more inside support than he got. Maybe he had some expectation of somebody being there in Moscow to welcome him that didn't -- you know, that didn't materialize.

Because it does seem like Putin called Prigozhin a traitor. He called this an armed rebellion. He called this an act of betrayal. He compared it Bolshevik revolution. And then he negotiated with the guy and gave him -- seemingly has given him asylum in Belarus. So, to me, it seemed to suggest that when faced with a real -- you know, a real threat, Putin climbed down, that one should -- you know, one shouldn't worry too much about Putin being willing to climb down in Ukraine and find himself a face-saving excuse because when confronted with force, he found a way to back down.",

There have been a number of moments in the last several years and also even in the last year and a half when faced with something stronger, Putin steps back, he retracts, and then he just changes the story and makes up a new one. You know, as you said, in the morning Prigozhin is a traitor. He's starting a civil war. In the afternoon we forgive him and he's moving to Minsk, maybe.We've seen this in a number of other moments. I mean, there was an interesting moment in 2014 when the Russian army tried to -- using kind of saboteurs and provocateurs, tried to take more cities in Ukraine. Wherever they were met with force, they stepped down and moved back. And so we may well have overrated his toughness. We may have overrated, you know, his ability to, you know, to push things through to the bitter end. I mean, this is somebody who will step back and who can clearly make up new stories if he needs to make them up.",

For a variety of reasons he's not wanted to use the regular army initially because he wanted to -- you know, pretend that there wasn't an invasion in 2014. In this most recent invasion it's because the army wasn't fighting hard enough and so he gets the Chechens and then he gets the Wagner Group.Does this mean that that whole strategy is now going to be disbanded and it's just going to be the Russian regular army which didn't seem to be fighting very well in Ukraine.",
