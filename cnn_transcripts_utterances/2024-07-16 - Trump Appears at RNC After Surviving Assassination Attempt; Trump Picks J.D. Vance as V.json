We are alive inside the CNN Grill right here in Milwaukee, where convention attendees are gathering. They are celebrating after a busy first night of the Republican National Convention.And you know what, a lot has happened already here tonight. But perhaps the biggest moment we were all waiting for, the arrival of a man who just 48 hours ago survived what is being investigated as an assassination attempt. Former president Donald Trump. You know who was next to him? The man who solved the mystery of who Trump will name as his running mate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, and both were nominated by Republicans earlier today. (VIDEO CLIP)",

It was \"Make America Wealthy Again.\" You probably saw all the different signs that were in the convention hall, and each day it's going to bring yet another new theme of the convention, and speakers mostly focused on those issues. The economy, Biden's policies, but also both of Trump's sons spoke to CNN about the shooting and how it is affecting their father.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: He was in the hospital and, you know, I get a call from him and, you know, he cracked a little joke and I knew, you know, the Donald Trump I know, the father I know is, you know, he's back. He certainly understands how close it was and, you know, at the same time, he's not deterred. DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR, DONALD TRUMP'S SON: That moment when he stood up after being shot at and just showed resolve to keep fighting for this country, that was everything for me. I just literally told him, I go, you're the biggest badass I know. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Despite being, what, 37 days away from the Democratic National Convention, sources telling CNN that the private effort from Democrats to nudge President Biden out of the race is apparently still going on, and it continues tonight. We'll talk about all of these things from inside the Grill here but let's first begin with the convention. Joining me here Harry Enten, David Polyansky, Tara Palmeri and CNNs' own Mark Preston. So glad to have all of you guys here. Look, we were all waiting on this moment where, what, 72 hours since an assassination attempt of a former president of the United States. He came in. He appeared to be quite emotional at first. We walked on to the convention floor. How significant was that moment to see him knowing that he intends to change his speech to be one of unity?",

It's been suggested already, is they just assign somebody else to file the case, and then there's no problem. Except that Merrick Garland and the DOJ want to keep this looking impartial, and that's why you have an appeal and appeal so quickly. But however quickly it is, I think she's done full service to Trump, because the 11th Circuit, I doubt has time to reverse this before the election. The state of play for now is it's been reversed.

What are the odds of being able to raise this issue in a way that could move the needle back towards having a prosecution?I mean, this 11th Circuit in the past has been critical of Judge Aileen Cannon. That had to do with the special master overseeing documents in the FBI probe. And they found it just unbelievable that she would try to insert herself into a criminal investigation. But the 11th Circuit now would have a very different role. What do you think the chances of this appeal being successful are?",

It's especially outrageous for a district court to take it upon herself to do it. So, I think it will be -- be reversed. The question is, will they then recuse her? That's a bigger stretch. But yes, with the -- with the preamble that you talked about in the search case, I think they have more than enough predicate. And she's just a sort of black eye now in that district, and I think they will want to bounce her if they can. Again, we're talking February, March, a time when, if we have a new second Trump regime, all of this is -- all bets are off. They'll just tell the DOJ to close down shop.",

As witnesses warned police of his very presence, long before the gunfire. All that as the director of the Secret Service spoke for the very first time since the assassination attempt.

And the developments that we're hearing tonight, this news that not only were local police, but snipers were actually inside the building where the gunman was. I mean, we're just over two days now in the investigation. I find that pretty shocking, that there aren't any leads so far. But what do you make of this new news that there would be local law enforcement and snipers inside and not a whole lot of leads to go on? DONELL HARVIN, FORMER CHIEF OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTELLIGENCE, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Well, I mean, it's so shocking. Once you get over the shock at the fact that the leading Republican, now the candidate for the Republican Party, was -- came within an inch of losing his life, then you wake up to the shock that, you know, witnesses were pointing this individual out minutes before this occurred. There are layers of security when these type of events take place. And there's different police organizations that protect or have charge. At the end of the day, the Secret Service is responsible holistically for the entire scene. And so obviously, there's going to be an inquiry. It's stunning that this individual -- Laura, this -- this individual graduated from high school two years ago. Let's just take a second and think about that. And in two years, without any tactical training or any other -- anything that was significant, he was able to almost take the life of the presidential candidate. And so how is that possible with the layers of security that -- that are in place, is something that we all are waiting to hear.",
