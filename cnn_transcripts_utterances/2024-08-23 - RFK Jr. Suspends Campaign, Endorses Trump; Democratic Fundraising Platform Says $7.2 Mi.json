CNN's Kristen Holmes is in Glendale, Arizona for us, that's where Trump is about to rally with supporters and quote -- a quote, \"special guest.\"Kristen, give us the details. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I can tell you that Donald Trump's team hopes that special guest is Robert Kennedy, Jr. Now, we're just at the event in which he endorsed Donald Trump and he suspended his campaign. He said he was throwing his weight behind the former president, who he had said essentially he aligned with on various issues. He said that the former president had offered to enlist him in his administration, but wouldn't go any further than that. And he also said that part of the reason that he was suspending this campaign was because he had come to realize that in battleground states, he would be giving votes to Democrats, essentially taking away from Donald Trump and that he doesn't support Democrats, essentially blaming Democrats, the DNC, for his failed campaign. Now, here are some of the issues he said he aligned with Donald Trump on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., (I) FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're aligned with each other on other key issues, like ending the Forever Wars, ending the childhood disease epidemic, securing the border, protecting freedom of speech, unraveling the corporate capture of our regulatory agencies, getting the U.S. intelligence agencies out of the business of propagandizing and censoring and surveilling Americans and interfering with our elections.

However, they do believe that it is a mighty base, and they believe that this election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is going to be decided by a razor, thin margin in any single vote is going to count. They look at a state like this, Arizona, which RFK is polling at 6 percent, Donald Trump, however, polling at 42 percent and Kamala Harris at 45 percent in a recent \"New York Times\" poll. They believe that this will help boost Donald Trump's numbers.

This is something that we've heard from campaign officials time and again, essentially trying to see if there are any openings here, and appealing to those voters who perhaps gravitated to RFK Jr. because they were disillusioned by Donald Trump and were interested in him as a candidate, and perhaps also disillusioned by Joe Biden. Now, of course, the last four weeks, they have the option of Vice President Kamala Harris, and so the campaign trying to appeal to them in this statement.And frankly, that is also the message that we were hearing from the Vice President directly in her keynote remarks last night, where she tried to try to bridge the gap to other voters, independent voters by being moderate and saying that she's a candidate for everyone.

And then, of course, the campaign infrastructure continuing to build in these battleground states.Of course, one of the states they're eyeing very closely is North Carolina, the battle battleground campaign director noting that that is a place they want to be quite bullish and building out their infrastructure and putting out those surrogates, Wolf. Of course, we saw that this week at the convention. The Obamas and the Clintons expected to hit the campaign trail this fall.

She's also chair of the Georgia Democratic Party. Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. Kamala Harris clearly tailored her speech to swing voters, like in your home state of Georgia. How does she turn that message into more support there? REP. NIKEMA WILLIAMS (D-GA): So what -- what I heard was not a message tailored to swing voters, but a message tailored to all Americans. Kamala Harris spoke on that stage last night. She was strong. She was personable. And she sounded like the next President of the United States. And in battleground Georgia, we're going to make that happen, because what I've learned on the campaign trail, we have voters in our state. We're not a blue state or a red state, Wolf, we're a periwinkle state. And we've got a lot of work to do.

But as you mentioned, there has been that new proposal put forward by the Israeli delegation focused on the Philadelphi corridor, that buffer zone separating Egypt from Southern Gaza.Now, previously, the Israeli delegation had put forward a proposal which would see Israeli troops stationed and deployed at the border. That is something that Hamas has said it doesn't want to see. Egyptian officials, according to sources, rejected that initial proposal since describing it as a non-starter. However, the Israeli delegation has come back with a revised proposal, which would see a reduced number of troops on the corridor, a reduced number of military deployments there. And this proposal, according to sources, has been deemed somewhat more acceptable by the Egyptian delegation, who have now said that they are planning to send this proposal to Hamas officials for their consideration. Now, this has been a key sticking point over the course of these negotiations. It's one of the key areas of the bridging proposals that the Biden administration has put forward to try to narrow the gaps in the current ceasefire negotiations. It remains to be seen, of course, whether or not Hamas actually agrees to this proposal. We've heard in the past from Hamas officials saying they do not want to see any long term presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip. They want to see a full withdrawal. But of course, pressure is mounting on both sides to come to some sort of agreement. Talks will continue over the weekend, U.S. officials meeting with their Egyptian counterparts here. It remains to be seen whether Hamas will be participating directly in those talks, whether they respond positively to this revised proposal put forward by the Israeli delegation.",
