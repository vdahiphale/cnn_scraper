And we know that sometimes those storms coming on the mild side, and we get a denser snow pack, so it's easier to make snowballs or a snowman, for instance. But sometimes there's so much moisture associated with these winter storms and they actually pose a threat to structures and homes.I bring that up because that's exactly what the National Weather Service out of California is warning some of its residents for the upcoming weekend with this latest atmospheric river event that's about to take place. Did you know that 12 inches of snow, on a typical sized home -- wet snow we're talking about -- is the equivalent of having three pickup trucks on top of your roof. Let's say you double your snowpack. We're talking 24 inches of heavy wet snow falling. We're talking about nearly 40,000 pounds of pressure on top of your house. No wonder there's the risk of structural collapse with this heavy wet snowfall. We just have to investigate the origins of where this moisture is coming from. We call it the Pineapple Express because it originates near Hawaii. Pulling in a lot of deep tropical moisture and that means that this will be a mild storm, as it unleashes this kind of fire hose of water and heavy wet snowfall on the higher elevations. Weather Prediction Center picking up on that level three of four when you see that shading of red. Sacramento to San Francisco, notice that like a very small southerly shift in that moderate risk of flash flooding for the day on Friday. So, keep that in mind. Malibu, northward. Now, this is how much rain we anticipate, 3 to 6 inches for the most part. There will be the heavy wet snowfall that will be measured in feet, especially across the Sierra Nevada crest. But you have heavy wet snow on top of what's already fallen. And that is why we have the potential for rapid snow melt, flash flooding, landslides and mudslides. Can't forget about the potential of 70 mile an hour wind gusts on top of that for the highest elevations. Here's a quick look at the latest winter weather alerts blanketing the Western U.S. Back to you.",
