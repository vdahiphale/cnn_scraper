      "sentences": "At the U.S. Capitol, a final salute to President Jimmy Carter begins just minutes from now, with more of the fanfare of the nation's highest office and an extraordinary gathering of five American presidents.Welcome to CNN's special coverage of the state funeral of James Earl Carter. I'm Jake Tapper in Washington. President Carter's flag-draped casket is about to be carried down the Capitol steps from inside the Rotunda, where he has been lying in state. The first of many solemn rituals in Washington, D.C., on this national day of mourning. We will, in minutes, see the hearse and motorcade travel through the streets of Washington, D.C., passing near the White House where the flag is at half-staff in honor of President Carter. Then it's on to Washington National Cathedral for the funeral service. The Carter family will join with us and U.S. and world leaders to pay tribute to Jimmy Carter's 100 years of life and his legacy. A bipartisan moment as Washington is on the brink of dramatic change. Five of President Carter's successors are expected to be in the cathedral. Current President Joe Biden, the former president and now president-elect, Donald Trump, and former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. President Biden will be the one to eulogize Carter, his longtime friend, whom he endorsed in 1976, just days before his own presidency ends and Trump's begins. We're going to be closely watching all the interactions among the presidents, of course. We're also following breaking news on the most destructive wildfire disaster ever to hit the Los Angeles area. And we're going to bring you updates on this very fast moving and dangerous situation. But right now, as we wait for the Carter funeral ceremonies to begin, let us go to Washington National Cathedral, where we find CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Kaitlan, official Washington is about to honor a proud D.C. outsider, Jimmy Carter.",

But for President Biden, this eulogy, he has delivered countless eulogies over nearly a half century in Washington. But for Jimmy Carter, I am told by his advisers this is one of the most personal and poignant and important. I'm told he was working on this speech last night when he was flying back to Washington aboard Air Force One.I'm told that he's going to implore Americans to take lessons from Carter's life and he'll tell people to study Jimmy Carter, a man of principle, of faith and humility. But for Joe Biden, of course, he was a young senator in, you know, in his 20s and then 30s, and he was the first senator to endorse Jimmy Carter. And he was an --",

But he both set out a map for what a post presidency could look like right after he left. But he also rejected many of the things that other presidents gone were willing to do. They were willing to take payments for speeches.They were not necessarily living the kinds of humble life that Jimmy Carter really exemplified in the years after he was president of the United States. And of course, part of why he may have lost reelection, why he may have been a one term president, was because he was unwilling to play the game here in Washington that can get you reelected. And that sort of lack of cynicism in a way may have ultimately been part of why his presidency is remembered as it is.",

The funeral motorcade now leaving the U.S. Capitol and driving to Washington National Cathedral where the leaders of Washington, D.C. and the Carter family will pay their respects to the late president. That includes the five men alive who have also served as commander in chief. As we stand by there, you see former Vice President Al Gore, as youstand by for the funeral service. There is, of course, the breaking news on the wildfire catastrophe in Southern California. Residents in Los Angeles County are waking up to continued mass devastation this morning with thousands of homes and businesses now reduced to rubble and ash. You're looking at live pictures from the Pacific Palisades, courtesy of our affiliate KABC. At least five people have died in these fires, but officials expect that number to rise sadly as the most destructive fire is still 0 percent contained. CNN's Julia Vargas Jones is in Altadena. Julia, tell us what it's like there on the ground.",

And you see, you know, this vegetation dried out California vegetation that is so ripe to just ignite as the fire makes its way through construction materials and destroying people's homes, their memories, their lives in these homes.We see on my other side here, a neighbor has a gas leak that's been going for at least a few hours since we've been here. Firefighters working tirelessly to try and contain this. As you mentioned, 0 percent contain. This is the Eaton Fire that has come down from the Angeles National Forest on the hills that are just behind Altadena and Pasadena, these cities just east of Los Angeles. And it's ravaged through these neighborhoods. We've witnessed people here trying to make their way back to their homes, trying to check on their homes and being faced with just rubble, skeletons of what it used to be. Meanwhile, firefighters working 36, 48 hour shifts. And we have support from National Guard and firefighters coming from as far as Oregon to help fight this. The main aspect that might change the luck of these firefighters in the coming hours is the wind, Jake. You know, I've described this event as kind of a hurricane of fire, and it's because the winds are the most important element here in the containment of this fire. Firefighters have had a lull for the past almost 16, 24 hours of just having being able to get some aerial support with the winds not being so high. But we are expecting for them to pick up back again this afternoon, Thursday afternoon. And it's anyone's guess what that could do. We're still looking at 10,600 acres out here in Altadena and in Pasadena and up in these hills. Who knows where that will go next? What I will say is the scale of this destruction is jarring. Driving through the streets, going through these neighborhoods, it is people's homes and it's businesses. It will take a really long time for these communities to get back to what they used to be.

We have seen all sorts of officials going into the pews, walking into the pews of the cathedral. We saw former Vice President Mike Pence just a few minutes ago. There he is. He was talking to Al Gore, the former vice president, at one point. There he is, Mr. Gore's head on the left there of your screen. And Anita McBride, one of the things that's so remarkable, when you live to be 100, you tend to outlive a lot of other people. And we're going to hear two eulogies today from individuals with whom President Carter was close. One, his vice president, Walter Mondale, and the other, the man he defeated for the presidency in 1976 and became a good personal friend of his former President Ford. Both Mondale and Ford wrote eulogies for Jimmy Carter, but Jimmy Carter outlived them.",

It was Bush 41. It was Bush 43. It's very interesting. Doesn't dispute the fact that their relationship was close.
