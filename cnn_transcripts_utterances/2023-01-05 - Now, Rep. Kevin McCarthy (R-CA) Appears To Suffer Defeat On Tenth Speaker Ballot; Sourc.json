What's taking place right here on the nation's Capitol is truly stunning, 21 Republicans declining to vote for Kevin McCarthy today, leaving the California Congressman without the votes needed to finally grab the speaker's gavel.The humiliating losses come despite McCarthy privately offering up even more concessions. And we're now learning negotiators between the two camps are pushing to strike some sort of deal tonight in an attempt to show progress. But what will that progress look like?

      "sentences": "Well, this is actually a key moment, Wolf, because they are finishing up the tenth vote in which Kevin McCarthy will have lost once again the effort to try to become the next speaker of the House. Remember, this has been 100 years since we have gone to multiple ballots. Now, it's going to be since the mid 1800s we have had this many ballots to elect a speaker, Kevin McCarthy going to lose his tenth ballot.By why is this a key moment? Because there have been negotiations that have been happening behind the scenes between pro-McCarthy forces, as well as the McCarthy opponents, even happening all day long, furious talks. I am told they are making good progress. There's an expectation, a hope that there could be a deal tonight between these two camps. If they're close to a deal, they feel they are close to a deal, then we could see the House move to adjourn right now after this vote is officially called. If they move to adjourn, that is a positive sign for those negotiations. That means that enough conservatives agree to vote to adjourn. Remember to adjourn the House, you need 218 votes a majority of the House. Democrats are not planning to vote to adjourn. They want to continue this process. They want McCarthy to twist in the wind. Republicans are divided about the adjourning. They same conservative who are pushing or denying McCarthy to speakership have yet to give McCarthy those votes to adjourn. So, if they do vote to adjourn right now, that would suggest that they believe a deal is within reach. Now, this deal would essentially amount to a number of concessions that McCarthy has offered to empower some of those members on the far- right. One of the big chief demands is to give them more power over the speakership, allow for one individual member to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker. That used to be a red line for McCarthy. Not anymore, he has given in on that. He has also agreed to give two -- at least some members of the far- right freedom caucus seats on the very powerful House Rules Committee. That is the committee that sets the parameters for floor debate, determines what legislation can come to the floor, that those concessions among other issues appear to be enough to win over some Republicans, assuming they sign off on all the details that they've been haggling about all day long. But, Wolf, that is still not enough to get Kevin McCarthy the 218 votes he needs. It could close the gap, but Republican sources tell me tonight, Wolf, that still McCarthy will have to go member by member. There's some incoming freshmen, some other members who still have concerns. He has to alleviate those concerns, get them on board and then eventually he could get to 218 votes. So, Wolf, this could stretch into next week. There are at least four members of the Republican conference who have to leave town for medical issues and family issues tomorrow, which means that they probably are not going to have 218 votes tomorrow. So, we could see these drag into next week and who know if it goes longer than that. So, a key moment right now for Kevin McCarthy as he's pushing to lock down the votes, which he does not have just yet, but he believes once there's a deal, then things will start to fall into place.

I mean, this is just a preview of what is going to happen when the hard stuff actually presents itself.I mean, it seems to me today was a day of -- a study in contrasts of public and private, right? So, in public, there's been zero progress for Kevin McCarthy. In private, he and his allies claim there is progress. Manu, just described what a critical moment this is at right now, to see a potentially deal on paper and for people to see if there's actually something for them to actually move for.

Remember back after the 2010 election, the 2014 election, a lot of people in this town were somehow shock or surprised that the tea party people said they were going to vote -- they were voting against -- they're voting to no on everything. Well, campaigned and say they were going to vote no on everything. So, we should not have been surprise then.These, especially the never-Kevins, have said they're anti- establishment, anti-system, they have made pretty clear, if you listen to the mega media universe that they speak in, if you listen to Matt Gaetz on his own podcast, that they're going to vote no, even against their own leadership. That's what they say they're going to do. So, Jamie makes the key point. Kevin McCarthy can cut the deal with some of them. There's a chess game they can play. He has to get to 213 because the Democrats have 212. So, he has to get to 213 and then can he negotiate with the never-Kevin's to vote present or go on vacation, or go out of town. So, this is incredibly complicated. They keep saying they're making progress. They keep saying they're cutting a deal, but the speaker of the House is the guy who runs the place. Leadership team are the people who are supposed to count the votes. They have been wrong. They have been wrong everyday so far. If they finally gotten it right? We'll see.

MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  When Donald Trump was president, taxes were cut, regulation were slash, energy was abundant, wages were rising, capital was returning from overseas to fund the dreams and ambitions of our fellow Americans and the economy was roaring. What a contrast to what we have seen from this administration now. And so I rise to nominate Donald Trump for the position of speaker of the House. And for all of the vitriol that we hear from the media, in the Times and the left, there were great moments of bipartisanship under the Trump presidency. And the Democrat nominee for speaker knows that well because he led valiantly on the efforts for criminal justice reform and I was honored to join him. And I know no matter who's sitting in that speaker chair, we've got a lot of work to do on that very issue. We took a first step, but there's a second and a third steps to take and I'm glad that we were able to work with President Trump, with Republicans and with Democrats to provide real outcomes for Americans to create greater prosperity and more opportunity. I also care deeply about President Trump's focus on our nation's veterans. It seems for far too long on the campaign trail, veterans were disregarded, forgotten about. When we would get elected to office, their issues would not always rise and get center stage, but we were able to pass veterans accountability measures. We were able to actually get people fired at the V.A. who weren't doing their job. What a great idea that would be to extend and continue and to continue to nourish. President Trump oriented our views on trade so that we could actually put the American people first, not foreign interests abroad or special interest here at home. President Trump knew that we had to confront China, that China had already engaged in a trade war against us but it was a war that we were surrendering, and so we started to fight back. He stood with our farmers. And on foreign policy, we stopped trying to find a new Jeffersonian democracy to build out of sand and blood and Arab militias in the Middle East. As a matter of fact, President Trump, I believe, is the first president in my lifetime that didn't start new wars.

I think he agreed to draw support for a bigger number than 20. Obviously they were not able to do that. And Kevin Hern continued to build some momentum.

But, you know, toget out of the sports analogy, there are real life implications of what is going on. A lot of people want to know what is on that paper. A lot of people want to know what commitments have been made to get these votes, because that's a big concern to people, to Republicans in that caucus, to Democrats in the Congress.
