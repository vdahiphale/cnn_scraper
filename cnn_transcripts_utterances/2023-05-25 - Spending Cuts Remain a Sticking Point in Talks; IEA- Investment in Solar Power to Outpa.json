House Speaker McCarthy says both sides were burning the midnight oil overnight working well into the early hours that at least is a good sign the negotiations continue. Well look at the NASDAQ. They're up some 2.3 percent bond investors though, not complacent. I think especially where short term debt is concerned. In some cases, the prices have fallen so far, that when you compare their yields, they're comparable to risky junk bonds. That's what the markets telling you the bond market at least very concerned short time. And then come to the rating agencies Fitch warning it could soon cut America's pristine AAA credit rating, citing the political partisanship that has driven the U.S. to the brink of default. In the words of Tina Turner, it's time for deal negotiators to simply be the best and get the deal done.

But the bottom line is not really many people. Ultimately, were listening to this thing live as it was happening. So you know, when you think about like CNN, I know there have been some comparisons to the town hall. CNN hosted with Trump, which average 3.3 million viewers, those were people concurrently watching at the same time, whereas this Twitter space, at the most it buckled under about 600,000 people watching or listening at the same time so a much smaller audience. And ultimately, when it did get working, I think it had a fraction of that about 200,000 people listening to this Twitter space. And so I think most people probably did not watch or listen to this live. They're hearing about it after the fact that maybe trying to find the link to listen to some of the audio.

If we look at some of the aerial footage that we've seen over the past couple of days, the past couple of weeks at city have essentially been annihilated. So Yevgeny Prigozhin, who of course, in the past couple of days have been claiming that Wagner mercenaries and the Russian forces have now captured all of Bakhmut which the Ukrainian still dispute. It really isn't that much of that area left now he did. He was pictured earlier today. And what we just saw in that video walking around Bakhmut would go into some of the positions of his fighters and telling them that they were going to withdrawal is quite interesting, because one of the things he said is that they would rest, regroup and then wait for new orders. So certainly, it seems as though while he might be done with his force in Bakhmut, he certainly does seem to think that he is going to be coming back to the battlefields of Ukraine. But the big question, of course, on the ground right now, is this real? Is Wagner really withdrawing from that area, because that certainly would mix things up in one of the toughest battlefields that this war has seen since it basically started? We were in touch with the Eastern grouping of the Ukrainian forces, Julia, earlier today. And they told us right now, they can't confirm that Wagner forces really are withdrawing from Bakhmut. However, one of the things they say that they have been seeing is a significant decrease in the amount of shelling and the amount of tank attacks coming from Russian forces in that area. So that could be an indication that is really happening that there is indeed some sort of change going on, on the Russian side. Of course, one of the things that the Ukrainians have said is despite the fact that the Russians are saying they've captured all of Bakhmut the Ukrainians are saying for them, this is not done. They are currently mounting a counter attack in Bakhmut; they say that they are pressing the Russians on the flanks on the outskirts of Bakhmut. And they intend to take that city back. So Yevgeny Prigozhin may or may not be leaving. Certainly the indications are they very well could be hard for the Ukrainians. This is something that is not done and they say they're going to take that town back from the Russians, Julia.",

I mean, we had a hint of this just two weeks ago with some data for March that showeda big drop in industrial output and production, a big drop in retail sales as well. So it didn't come as a huge surprise. It's perhaps more in line with the IMS projection for the German economy. Although some economists today actually now thinking perhaps Germany is heading for a slightly deeper recession than many had hoped. Capitol economics was that further weakness and Commerzbank think German GDP will actually decline by 0.3 percent this year, much deeper than many others have projected. And they are pointing to weakness in manufacturing, all important indicators in that sector are now pointing downwards. Now, the main cause of all this is actually aside from industry manufacturing, it's really to do with household spending at this stage, and one of the starkest figures I think we had was the decrease in household spending by 1.2 percent in the first quarter. And that's across all things less food, less drinks, less spending on clothes, on cars. And this is the impact both of inflation and interest rates. And it is stark inflation is still above 7 percent in Germany, food inflation is very high, it was over 20 percent earlier in the year, it's still above 17 percent year on year, it is eroding spending power. And frankly, people just don't have enough money to spend. And that is going to have, of course, a further impact on manufacturing. Plus, Julia, big impact on China, we've had data this week suggesting that Germany's exports to China have dropped significantly and compared to the rest of the block.

You don't put all the eggs in one basket, but Europe made a historical mistake. And there was over reliance on Russia, but again, they made huge efforts. And as of today, the share of Russian gas, Russian energy in Europe reduced substantially to single digits now, but I hope we learn from that. What is happening is that as a result of this shock, energy security shock, European countries and other countries redouble their efforts to look at the alternatives to natural gas and oil. It is one of the reasons why we see such a big jump in clean energy and nuclear power. In the past, clean energy was mainly driven by a climate concerns. And now, a government's investors see clean energy is a lasting solution to our energy security problems. And nuclear power in the context, in addition to solar and wind is making a strong comeback in Europe, in Japan, Korea, U.S., Canada, everywhere.

In the last few minutes we have also learned the identity of the two police officers. One is a man who was 46 the other is 61. The other person killed a woman who is believed to be in her 40s or 50s. And that's what we have been able to gather so far. But again, exactly how this unfolded still not clear, this is believed to have taken place in some kind of residential area. There are many homes nearby, and that some people were actually evacuated at one point. A storyline that we're following right now is a potential standoff involving who we presumed to be the gunman in a building nearby. There are some reports that a shot was fired about an hour ago we have heard that but that is not something that police are able to confirm at this point. It's important to point out that gun violence in Japan is very rare. If we look at history in 2022 last year, there were four gun related deaths. One of those cases involves the assassination of Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who was assassinated using some type of homemade weapon that the gunman used as a homemade device. Many of the other cases in majority of those other cases were gang related, if you will. And finally as far as gun ownership in Japan, handgun ownership is very rare. But in this area of Nagano it is known for its outdoors. It is known for its wildlife, it's a big hunting area. So it is not uncommon for people there to own rifles, hunting rifles, if you will.

But I do want to talk short term, about the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. You've been through these back in the 1980s yourselves where you had to worry about the spending limits and increase the debt ceiling. David, what do you think of what's going on today? I think for most people looking at this, it's utter lunacy.",

So I've advocated at some point, people take a deep breath, and rewrite the law. So that what it does is actually gives a limit on spending before you spend the money. I've been pleased to see, you know, the House of Representatives passed a bill to increase the debt limit. So at least there's one thing on the table, and then they've engaged in the negotiations, this is what happens almost every few years, they go into this cycle. So I'm hopeful that they can get to an agreement that will raise the debt limit, all we're talking about is paying for money that's already been spent, and then also find a way to have more restraint on spending going forward. That's the age old question.",

So there's a lot of work that goes into actually getting to a restructuring. So I guess I have to say I'm optimistic that there will be some, but meaning a few countries that successfully restructure, but the key takeaway is the wait for the countries, the years that go by working on it, are really costly. So for the world, what I would like to see is a better process that there's more certainty on that there will be an outcome, it will reduce the net present value of the debt using a standard -- a single discount rate, not gains in terms of the financial engineering, and actually gets it done. That means the creditors need to reach agreement and there needs to actually be that the paperwork that restructures the debt, and it's got to be done right now.

I'm also proud that we've and happy that we've been able to put themacro issues on the table, as you look over the next 20 years or 40 years for the world. It's really important that there be a better balance within global growth, that gets more jobs created and more broadly, included in jobs. That means strong growth in median income for people around the world, that hasn't been happening. And I think there needs to be a real rethink of fiscal and monetary policy in the advanced economies. And then in the developing countries, that to an extent know how countries get to growth, they just it's an implementation problem. That means they have to have currencies that actually work that allow people to exchange through a money system, a payment system that works, there has to be some fiscal and monetary policy cohesion within their program. And then very importantly, the regulatory policies and micro economic policies that enable job creation. The World Bank is working with private sectors around the world and I think this will be an important push for the future is to work with the countries on what exact changes are needed in the regulatory structure that invites more capital inflow from their own citizens and the rest of the world.",
