I'm Boris Sanchez, alongside Jessica Dean, in Washington.And we're following the latest developments in the Middle East today, a split-screen moment, on one side, a show of strength among allies. as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was back in Israel again forcefully backing Israel's campaign to eliminate Hamas, even as he bluntly addressed the need to do more to alleviate the civilian suffering that campaign has unleashed inside Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. There will be no partners for peace if they're consumed by a humanitarian catastrophe and alienated by any perceived indifference to their plight. We have gone from zero to now over 100 trucks going into Gaza through the Rafah Crossing every day. But this is still not enough. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as we listened to him speak, he didn't say that. He said that option is on the table, but he did not -- he did not put his forces to bear here and announce that they're coming in. And, notably, we were watching the skies very closely as he was speaking. Were his words joined with action, more missiles, more rockets? We didn't see that either. It could change, but, today, his words were limited to praise for Hamas and the October 7 attacks. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN NASRALLAH, HEZBOLLAH LEADER (through translator):  It was an action that was heroic, brave, innovative, and it was very well executed. It was great.

But, of course, that doesn't answer the larger question of what is going to happen to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the ones that are being killed, the civilians, I should say, that are being killed on a very regular basis as part of this Israeli military operation and a large reason why the administration has started to shift its tone less towards kind of all-out support for Israel, in terms of unconditional support. And more towards cautioning them behind the scenes, we're told, that them continuing to kind of launch these indiscriminate airstrikes that target Hamas commanders in densely populated areas that result in a large amount of civilian casualties, that could lead to an erosion of international support, and it could make them have more difficulty achieving their military objectives in the long run. So, the reason that Blinken is asking these Israelis to consider this humanitarian pause at this moment is because he wants to see a situation where civilians can get out, aid can come in, and, of course, hostages can be released, but, as you said, Israel already putting their foot down, saying that they need a commitment from Hamas that they are going to release the hostages before they will entertain any kind of cease-fire.",

What does that mean for the broader effort to eradicate Hamas? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  So, Boris, the key thing here is that notice where the Israelis have come in. They have come in from the north, the northeast and the east. So, just to give you a quick idea of what it looks like, they come in this way using bulldozers, their tanks, their armor personnel carriers, and troops on the ground who are moving forward in each of these directions. And every single one of them has a particular mission. In this particular case, they captured this town hall and raised the Israeli flag there. So these are the kinds of things that they're doing. And the idea is to take over this area, as much of it as they need to, and then go in and encircle Gaza City right in through here. And that is basically what they have been doing. They're moving this way in order to basically force Hamas fighters into this area, so that they can't escape.",

Hamas, the group in Gaza, the Sunni political group, up to 25,000 fighters, 7,000 rockets. Look at Hezbollah, Shia, aligned with Iran directly, as is Hamas, but not as directly, and then they have about 50,000 estimated active personnel and as many as 150,000 rockets. So when you look at all the different areas that they could possibly be involved in, the key thing is right here, the Israel-Lebanon border. On this side of the border, you have got Hezbollah. And this would then -- if Hezbollah got involved, it would mean a second front in the war. And that then means that Israel would have to divide its forces even more between the south and the north.",

Now, that's below the expectations of 180,000 and sharply lower than the roughly 300,000 jobs added in September. But -- this is important -- October is also the first jobs report to include the fallout from the massive auto strike, that dispute between the UAW and the Big Three automakers now largely resolved. But the Labor Department reports strike activity was the main culprit here for the loss of about 35,000 manufacturing jobs last month. And, on Wall Street, the markets welcoming the softer numbers actually, because experts believe the Fed will now be under less pressure to raise interest rates. Let's dig in a little bit deeper with CNN economics and political commentator Catherine Rampell. Catherine, always great to see you. Is this slowdown kind of a sweet spot? Or how should we interpret all of this? Because it is lower than expected, but I just was talking about Wall Street liking this, because they're hoping now the Fed won't raise interest rates.",

It's not so cold that it suggests we are facing an imminent recession.That would be the ideal scenario. That said, I do think there are some signs of weakness in the report, even beyond the ones that you just flagged, things like, for example, the length of the average workweek has been going down. So people aren't losing their jobs, but they are working fewer hours in any given job, as well as the fact that, almost every month so far this year, the initial numbers that have come out have subsequently been revised downward. And that was the case, for example, for September as well. So those kinds of things suggest that there are some vulnerabilities in the economy, even if they are not obviously outright signs of recession.",

In fact, there are a number of market participants out there who think that the next move from the Fed would involve cutting rates potentially some time early next year. If that were to happen -- and, again, it's anybody's guess -- that could potentially translate to lower borrowing costs for regular consumers for things like auto loans, credit card loans, et cetera. The one wrinkle in all of this is that longer-term Treasury yields, so these are things like the 10-year Treasury yield, which the Fed is not directly targeting with those rate hikes, those have still been very, very high. That's part of the reason why you're seeing, for example, very high mortgage rates lately. So, even if the Fed doesn't choose to raise rates or even, in fact, cuts rates in the near term, some of these other factors may still keep mortgage rates for people who are trying to buy a home very elevated.",

And it's been a little bit of a puzzle about why that's been happening. But I think one key to that has to do with the fact that childcare has been subsidized. There has been this major federal program keeping the struggling childcare system afloat. That program just lapsed. That money has now expired at the end of September. And there's a real question about what happens to childcare providers going forward and what the knock-on effects are for the families that rely on those childcare providers if they decide to pull back or close entirely, because, when workers can't have care arrangement for their kids -- care arrangements for their kids, they will struggle to continue showing up to work. And that disproportionately hurts working women, i.e., mothers in particular. So, the fallout from that, I think we haven't yet seen. We have seen Biden request additional funding to keep the childcare sector afloat. But, so far, House Republicans have basically rebuffed that. And I think I will be watching that going forward to see what happens to women's labor force participation and employment rates.",

He said basically that he thinks Israel has bitten off more than it could chew, that they have set ambitious -- overly ambitious and lofty goals, and that they should have learned the lesson about doing that in past invasions, including the 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
