As a champion of the hard working men and women of our country, J.D. has had a very successful business career in technology and finance, and now, during the campaign, will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American workers and farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond.

      "sentences": "Yes. So we've had lots of conversations around who Donald Trump was going to pick talking about those top three contenders, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Senators Marco Rubio and Senator J.D. Vance.And around Vance, the conversation continued to be, if he chooses J.D. Vance, he is looking to secure his legacy in the MAGA movement. As you noted, he is 39 years old, and it is clear to everyone, including former President Donald Trump, that obviously on day one of a potential Trump administration, J.D. Vance is likely to start running for president in 2028. But that would mean that Donald Trump would secure this message of populism that has really taken over the Republican Party. And J.D. Vance, as you noted, was a CNN commentator, but he was also a Never Trumper back in 2017. He was somebody who had spoken out very critically against the former president. When I asked people around them how it was that Donald Trump overcame that, somebody who cares so deeply about loyalty, they said that J.D. was able to win him over, not just through himself, but also through his son, Don Jr. Don Jr. has been one of the biggest proponents of J.D. Vance constantly building him up to both his father and publicly as well. Some of the tea leaves that we had seen is that Donald Trump's team seems to be very receptive to J.D. Vance as well. I will note that Vance was the only of these three potential candidates who went with Donald Trump on a West Coast swing recently. Burgum did meet them there. But part of the reasoning was because J.D. Vance had secured relationships with a number of Silicon Valley Tech Moguls, including David Sacks, who's speaking later tonight. This was a huge coup for Donald Trump. This is a world that he had never really ventured up into. So clearly, we had seen this moving and inching in this direction. But it is interesting when you hear about Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, a lot of this is him really securing his legacy and moving that MAGA movement forward, Jake.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jake. And I think it raises a lot of questions about what this is going to look like for the MAGA agenda, because when Donald Trump was president, obviously the last time, Mike Pence was not a threat to him necessarily politically. He was someone who bolstered the ticket in 2016 with evangelicals.But one part of the consideration and this veepstakes has been whether or not Donald Trump would view the person that he picked as his vice president as potentially a threat, someone who wanted to be kind of the heir apparent to MAGA. Obviously Senator J.D. Vance is someone who, as you noted, is incredibly young, has big political aspirations. And right now they are noting that J.D. Vance has been the pick as vice president. A lot of delegates here, Jake, are not able to watch TV. They're not on their phones. They are learning about this all in real time. But I will tell you, one thing that has been happening behind the scenes as Kristen Holmes just alluded to, is this push for Vance in recent days as Donald Trump was kind of waffling on his pick. Everyone had always believed that he favored Vance the most, but in recent days, he had been asking people about Burgum, about Rubio. He was even throwing out names, Jake, like the Texas Governor Greg Abbott and even Nikki Haley. That is kind of how Donald Trump's brain works during this selection process. But I will note, Donald Trump Jr. went to his dad in recent days and made a final push for Senator Vance. And I should note, I'm standing right here by five empty chairs. One of them has Donald Trump Jr.'s name on it. That is where he is going to be here any moment now. They've cleared a pathway for the family as they are about to come in here because this is the Florida delegation, which of course is going to officially put their father over the top.",

And when I did, he was, you know, just some shot, but a lot of resolve. He was able to -- he was joking about it and talking about it in a way that only my father could do. But it was just that moment when he stood up after being shot at and just showed resolve to keep fighting for this country. That was everything for me. I just literally told him I go, you're the biggest badass I know. And so we had some jokes about that. That was the first thing I thought to think of even in that moment because it was that powerful and that's the kind of resolve. That's why we had peace deals under Trump. That's why we had a great economy. You need that.

I mean, I know he basically scrapped his speech that they've been working on. I was in the office when they were working with it for hours last week, and I think they just started from scratch with just a different message. We are going to try to unite this country. I mean, I take that kind of moment of just shocking moment that really changed I think even in his mindset of what we need to do to replace everything. I mean, I basically I think we all got the directive like, hey, whatever you were doing and I tend to get a little bit hot. So we're going to tone it down and keep it keep a different message out there. And I think that's going to be important actually. I think it's going to be important for us to move forward that way as a country. COLLINS: Is that what your dad himself -- I mean, I know we've heard from political advisers and sources, they want to say -- D. TRUMP JR.: My dad is -- yes, listen. My dad, you know, this is his political adviser, when he hears the people, when he speaks to the crowds, that -- he doesn't listen to the pollsters or he doesn't look at polling. He doesn't make decisions that are bad because the poll says it's, you know, 0.24 basis points more, he doesn't think that way. He understands. He listens to the people and he has a trust his own gut instinct that he's done pretty well with that throughout his career.",

He is -- he's more determined to make America great again. He's got an incredible fighting spirit. No different than when he's pumping his hand in the air with blood running across his face. And I'm really proud of him. I've never been more proud as a child, as a son. He's a remarkable human being.
