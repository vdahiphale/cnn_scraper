What stance is the U.S. taking? Biden's National Security Advisor John Kirby will be here. And leading this hour with only 175 days left in his term, President Biden is rolling out bold new proposals for the U.S. Supreme Court calling for term limits for justices, which would need the approval of Congress. He wants to strip legal immunity for future presidents, which would require constitutional changes. Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, has endorsed these reforms as her own presidential campaign takes hold. This hour, as Biden gets ready to speak in Texas, two Democratic governors, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, will campaign in support (inaudible). And in just a few minutes here on \"The Lead,\" I'm going to talk to the governor of New Mexico, Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham, as Harris faces an uproar of Republican criticism in her border state. But first, Biden's court reform plan. CNN's Kayla Tausche is at the White House. Kayla, the prospect of Congress passing these reforms is pretty much nil. How much of this is really just about rallying the Democratic base?",

House Speaker Mike Johnson today calling those proposals dead on arrival. The White House's director of public engagement saying that they were going to give it the good old team try, but that they understood that there were going to be immense challenges awaiting some of those proposals, which include 18-year term limits for justices, a code of ethics that would apply to justices, as well as a constitutional amendment removing presidential immunity. That's something that would require the involvement of states as well, which makes it an even more Herculean task than before. It's also worth noting, Jake, that this is about legacy for President Biden. He began his administration by appointing a bipartisan commission on the Supreme Court. That commission produced a nearly 300-page report at the end of his first year in office that's been sitting on the shelf. And they did very detailed studies on things like term limits and an ethics code for those justices. So the president certainly had a lot of material to draw from in making this decision. And we've also now been told that Vice President Harris was deeply involved in deciding how and what to propose today, however unrealistic it may be, Jake.",

You need to be able to get visas up front.We need more economic opportunity for the countries that create in the triangle this kind of mass migration. But we also need security at the border. We've got to use new technology and tools. We don't invest in border agents or ICE. We're not smart about our ports of entry. We've just sort of languished in this political design. And it is for me despicable that the former president and Republicans continue to politicize this and weaponize these issues at the border. It harms our commercial activity, our economic activity, our public safety, our ability to work across the border with Mexico to make sure we're all safer. I'm sure you saw two huge arrests related to the cartel happened actually in New Mexico in the El Paso sector. So I don't want anyone anywhere politically except pass comprehensive immigration reform. This is a candidate who believes in that, who stood up for that.

But it's easy to change perception, demonizing immigrants, having really heinous. Frankly, it's pure evil the way in which they talk about minorities and immigrants in this country. And so to divide the country, to stoke fear and hate as opposed to that we're doing the right work. But it will never be enough until Congress stops weaponizing border issues. Meantime, states like mine, we understand. I understand smart border security. I worked on the USA Act with Senator McCain and Will Hurd from Texas and Congressman Aguilar. We had a really good package. Probably Trump wasn't going to sign it. We know the damage to attacking Dreamers and their parents. We've got so many mixed status families.
