Plus, path of destruction. Tornadoes kill at least two dozen people in the southeast, and the severe storm threat isn't over yet.And nukes next door. Vladimir Putin now says he'll put tactical nuclear weapons right on Ukraine's doorstep in Belarus. All right, welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans. We begin with the crisis in Israel, where the country's main airport just halted all takeoffs. It's part of a general strike called for just a short time ago by Israel's largest labor union. The aim is to stop Benjamin Netanyahu's government from pushing through a highly controversial judicial overhaul, what one labor leader called, quote \"this craziness\". Right, street protests against that plan have intensified, huge crowds filling the streets of Tel Aviv after Netanyahu fired his defense minister for opposing the overhaul. CNN's Hadas Gold is live in Jerusalem this morning. What are we hearing from Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning, Hadas?",

      "sentences": "Nothing. We have heard nothing from the Prime Minister so far. The last time we heard from him was last night when he announced he was firing the defense minister. Meanwhile, this country has essentially come to a grinding halt as a result of this general strike.As you noted, the airport has completely stopped takeoffs. There are still landings happening. I spoke to -- we spoke to an Israeli airport spokesperson who said 70,000 passengers were expected to take off and land today. About half of those were for takeoffs, half of those for landings. Now, people who are trying to get out of the country will not be able to do so. The ports, the largest port in Israel, in Haifa, has also announced that its workers are on strike. We're also hearing from shopping malls. We are hearing now that potentially that school assistance will be on strike as well. I have never heard of a strike this large in Israeli history. The last time, Christine, that the airport called to take off at the airport was closed was during war, was during the 2021 conflict between the Israeli military and Hamas and militants in Gaza when rockets were flying in the air. And now, once again, the airport is essentially shut down as a result of this massive judicial overhaul, is all of course, started Saturday evening when the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant dared to make a speech, calling for the legislative process around these reforms to at least be frozen for a few weeks, because he was worried the divisiveness over these reforms, he said, was causing a credible and real threat to Israel's security. Keep in mind, hundreds of Israeli military reservists have said they will not heed the call to serve because of these reforms because they will feel as though they were no longer serving a democracy. Twenty four hours later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister who is a member of his own Likud Party, saying he had lost confidence in him. Then we saw these massive spontaneous street protests. Now, protests here have been going on for more than 12 weeks, hundreds of thousands of Israelis regularly taking to the streets with a protest last night, Christine, they felt different. They felt angrier. They even felt a little bit violent. They lasted well into the night, and then, this morning we're hearing voice after voice, the Israeli president, the head of the Jewish agency, it is now harder to count the number of people who are still in favor of pushing these reforms through compared to just the massive wave of high profile figures and everyday people calling for these reforms to at least to be halted. There are reports that Benjamin Netanyahu will come out and call for a freeze. But so far, we have heard nothing from the prime minister, Christine.",

That is the term that is used for those two types of categories for tornadoes is extremely rare. They make up roughly 1 percent of the total tornadoes that we see.So again, just kind of goes to show how rare they are. And the damage is significant. You see this car right here, that is basically been lifted up and tossed over onto the side of the building there. That is one of the indicators that the National Weather Service will look for, when they go out to survey these storms and determine, is it an EF zero all the way up to an EF 5. Because 4 and EF 4 specifically, they are looking for cars and other objects that are thrown, well constructed and whole frame houses leveled. And those are two very specific things that we saw with that particular tornado, but it was one of many that has occurred over just the last 72 hours across the southeast. Now, we do still have those ongoing storms as of right now. They're located in the Carolinas, stretching back through Georgia and Alabama as well. Now, the most imminent, widespread concern over the next few hours is really going to be the flooding potential. This is the amount of rain that has already fallen in just the last several hours. Again, in the last 24 hours, you see this long stretch here of orange and even red color, indicating widespread rainfall of 4 to 6 inches that's already fallen. And that's why you've got the flood watches and the flash flood warnings, Christine, and more rain is on the way. So that's really going to be the concern going forward for the rest of the day today.",

In Melitopol, the Russian occupation authorities are reporting that there was some kind of an attack this morning.We're seeing images on social media of a building that was damaged there, I've got a source on the ground who says, in fact, there were some big explosion there this morning, the Russian occupation authorities saying they're still trying to figure out the extent of potential casualties. Meanwhile, in Mariupol, Russian state news agency \"TASS\" is reporting that there was an apparent assassination attempt on the Russian occupation administration's police chief there, naming an individual named Mikhail Moskvin(ph), we've also seen images of a car that appears to be badly damaged and a neighboring building as well. And I've been speaking with Ukrainian officials who are in the city government of these two cities. The mayor of Melitopol for example, they are completely unashamed about the fact that they say they have resistance operatives in these cities that are carrying out assassinations, bomb attacks, attacks on the Russian occupation administration, on what they accuse to be collaborators in those towns working with the Russian occupation. All of these officials say they swear that these cities will be liberated sometime in the future. In the meantime, in the active frontline, as you mentioned, that city of Bakhmut in the east, which has been the scene of more than seven months of fighting of Russian troops, hurling themselves against Ukrainian defenders there. The Ukrainian officials are saying that their tactic is to try to bleed out the Russian military. They see that the tempo of Russian attacks have decreased, but they say the artillery strikes are continuing just as intensely as they always have. And the big question is, how much have the Ukrainians lost, sacrificed in this war of attrition on the ground there, defending what many would argue is a symbolic city, but not a strategically important one.

But I will tell you, we spoke to dozens of people who were there to see Donald Trump, and almost all of them told us that not only would an indictment not impact them at all, but that they believed it would make Trump stronger.
