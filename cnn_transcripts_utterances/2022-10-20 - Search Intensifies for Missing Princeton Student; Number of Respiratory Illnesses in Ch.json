Right now, police are using blood hounds to trace the scent of Misrach Ewunetie from her dorm room to a nearby lake. That's according to a law enforcement source.There are serious questions about who last saw the 20-year-old and when. Some things are just not adding up. CNN national correspondent, Brynn Gingras, is there in Princeton, New Jersey and just spoke with Misrach's brother. Brynn, let's start with what we know about her last whereabouts.",

      "sentences": "Ana, they don't know much. They have a knot in their stomachs. They're not getting answers.We've been watching family members, friends passing out flyers across the campus. Her family members distraught, frightened. They don't have the answers. To reiterate that information that we learned from John Miller, a source close to the investigation, telling him that investigators are focusing the search right now on a lake area that's about five miles from where I'm standing right now. That's after bloodhounds traced a scent of this 20-year-old junior at Princeton from that dorm room where she was last seen early Friday morning to that lake area. At this point, the investigators are still trying to ask the question, is foul play a part of the investigation? It's not clear just yet. But as I talk to the brother of Misrach, he basically said the family's trying to put together their own sort of timeline of what possibly happened. They know on Thursday night she volunteered at one of Princeton University's eating clubs. She was there until early morning Friday. Her suite mate saw her brushing her teeth, getting ready in the early morning hours Friday assuming she was going to bed. By Saturday, the family hadn't heard from her, which they thought was a little weird, but they knew she was busy with work, handing in a research paper. The last they communicated with her was the middle of last week. They didn't think much of it. The texts were going through. But Sunday, the texts stopped. She missed a very important meeting that was scheduled for her citizenship. And then by Sunday, they alerted authorities to do a wellness check. And on Monday, the university sent out an alert saying she is missing. That's why the investigation stands at where it is. But the family is just distraught. They say it's so uncharacteristic of her. She wouldn't just disappear like this. I want you to hear from the brother. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're kind of kept in the dark, as they say, and they're trying to get anyone who will help to help them. One thing, quickly, Ana, I asked her brother, how was she feeling the last time you guys talked to her? He said she was excited. She was handing in a research paper. But she had a job offer. She was getting excited to actually be a part of. She wasn't even set to graduate until 2024. So that's how they're choosing to think of her right now. But again, no answers for them. It's so unsettling to see them trying to search for anything to give them clues as to where she might be.",

      "sentences": "Ana, we're seeing this come back of flu, RSV, and other respiratory illnesses. As to why this is happening. We have to think back to the early days of COVID. We were all social distancing. We were masking for the past two to three years. That not only prevented the spread of COVID-19 but it also preventedthe spread of other respiratory viruses like flu and RSV. Because of that, we haven't seen much circulation of the viruses until now. We haven't really had a robust immunity. Now we're seeing what some experts call an immunity gap where we're seeing a resurgence of these viruses but community levels of immunity are still somewhat low, especially among children, especially among babies born in the past two to three years. That's why we're seeing so many cases and we're seeing some hospitals overwhelmed. Most of the children in many hospitals do have infections with RSV. What we know about RSV, symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, wheezing. And it's important, if your children have any of these symptoms, still to get them tested for flu or COVID. Because, as we know, these symptoms are very similar to other respiratory viruses. As for caring for a sick child, of course, fever reducers, pain relievers can help. Make sure they stay hydrated. Talk to your pediatrician. And most infections go away on their own in a week or two. But for some of the youngest children, infants, they might need hospital care for some time, which could add to hospitals feeling overwhelmed -- Ana?",

And of course, hospitalizations are declining. The decline in hospitalizations is a sign the vaccines are working. Officials are paying close attention to this graph you see on the screen, even though COVID cases appear to be leveling off. We are keeping an eye on Omicron subvariants. BA.5 is still dominant, as you see there in yellow. But we are seeing other variants, BA.4.6 as well. And of course, officials are worried about some of these variants kind of running up in the winter. So they are keeping a close eye on that -- Ana?",

When I arrived, Merritt Gainey (ph), who's not here right now, was here. Bobby and Conor and John Fetterman are all here, along with the responders. You all told me about the emergency workers who pulled the survivors to safety. They were heroes that day and a complete catastrophe was avoided. But it never should have come to this. For too long, we talked about building the best economy in the world and the best infrastructure in the world. We talked about asserting America's leadership. We talked about the best and safest roads, airports, and so much more. But now, now, we didn't do what we were finally getting to it. We were getting it done. We finally decided. And instead of being ranked number 13 in the world, 13 in the world, the United States, 13 in the world in infrastructure, we should be ranked number one. (APPLAUSE)",

I want to thank you.This really matters. Folks in the neighborhood rely on this bridge and the walking path underneath, to get to work, to get their kids to school and run errands, to stay connect to other areas like Squirrel Hill and the waterfront. Below the bridge, the big park is going to be fixed up when this is done to be better than it was. Hiking paths, new seating areas. This bridge was built initially in 1901. It was rebuilt in 1970. None of the guys behind me know that. None of them were here, I don't think. The fact of the matter is now it's a modern bridge in the 21st century, four lanes for vehicle traffic, a path for cyclists and pedestrians.
