      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper.Donald Trump's criminal hush money cover up trial is underway in Manhattan right now. Trump's defense team is now cross-examining the prosecution's first witness, former tabloid executive David Pecker. This is Pecker's third day on the stand and today for the very first time, he described the deal that he helped broker with adult film star and director Stormy Daniels, a deal that is at the center of this case. The prosecution has used Pecker to set the scene for the jury, introducing them to keep players in the case, how they all fit together in the story right now. The defense tactic in its early questioning is part of a strategy -- the strategy to argue the David Pecker's work helping Trump during the 2016 election was nothing new, nothing unusual. Also notably today, Judge Juan Merchan so far still has declined to issue a ruling from Tuesday's hearing on whether Trump has violated his gag order, despite the prosecution arguing that this morning that Trump continues to violate this order against disparaging members of the jury and the witnesses, of course, this is four times over the last three days, the prosecution says. Let's discuss with our panel. And let me start with you, David Chalian, because the trial is going on right now. David Pecker shrugging, says he's testifying to the best of his knowledge to be truthful because Emil Bove, Trump's lawyer, is saying what I'm getting at is these things happened a long time ago, even when you're doing your best, it's hard to remember things. He's saying like maybe you don't remember this all that well. This is years and years ago. Pecker's in his 70s, et cetera. Trump has his arms folded across his body watching Pecker answer his attorney's questions.",

He added that Walmart was the main distributor of the magazine and it would be very bad for AMI, the publishing company that produces the \"National Enquirer\". Pecker also said, if anyone was going to buy it in terms of buying the story, I thought Michael Cohen and Donald Trump should buy it. The significance of that do you think?

Pecker says, I believe the story was true. Pecker recalls Cohen told him about paying for the story, saying the boss will take care of it, Pecker clarifies the boss.

So, one main focus of the cross-examination is to try to tell the jury that some of this was normal. It's not necessarily illegal he goal and that is one of the themes that we knew the defense was going to be pushing on. Now, they're also trying to chip away at David Pecker's credibility and they're doing that by asking him some questions about interviews he had given with prosecutors saying, you know, he -- going back to the August 2015 meeting, that this is the meeting where the prosecutor city of alleged conspiracy between Donald Trump, Michael Cohen, and David Pecker was hatched in which they agreed to catch and kill these deals to help the campaign. So they're asking David Pecker about his initial interviews with prosecutors when he said that the meeting was at a different date than the date that it actually was, and that he didn't remember Hope Hicks being there in which he later said that she was so trying to suggest that maybe he is altered his story. It's a common tactic that defense lawyers use to try to cast some doubt on the credibility of the witness and try to make it as though that they've been rehearsed pointing out how many times David Pecker has met with prosecutors. He said he's met with them about four or five times this year, which Trump's attorney and doing the questioning here, Emil Bove said, that seems like a lot of times. So, just trying to cast some doubt in the credibility of David Pecker's testimony. He has been on the stand now for three days. He's given more than five hours of testimony for the prosecution, where he is laid out a story and telling them the narrative of these catch-and-kill deals, repeating how he had done three of them of -- buying a story of a door man who said that he had a knowledge of -- that Trump had fathered an illegitimate child, which was a false story, buying the Karen McDougal story and then bringing the Stormy Daniels story, to Michael Cohen repeatedly saying that he had done that for the campaign. And so, Trump's attorneys now getting their first chance to try to challenge that. Cross-examination is expected to go for several hours, I'm told. So David Pecker will be back on the stand tomorrow morning where they will likely get into some of the more specific of this case. But right now today, in their first swing at him, they're focusing on -- just to suggest that this was normal, that having catch-and-kill deals is not illegal and it was as he put it, standard operating procedure for magazines and media to work with politicians -- Jake.",
