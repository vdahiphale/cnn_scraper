      "sentences": "Yeah, we know only what the Russian Ministry of Defense is telling us, which is about 3We've heard that in the past that they have claims to significantly prevented Ukrainian air assaults. But the significance here, of course, is that nobody appears to be wasting any time in getting this permission from the Biden Administration into the battlefield, possibly because it is possible that when President Donald Trump takes office in January the 20th, he may reverse the, frankly, unexpected but long, in the mind of Ukraine, overdue decision by President Joe Biden at the weekend. It is extraordinary because the pace here, not sure it's necessarily unexpected to some degree because we have known that Ukraine have been in possession of ATACMS missiles like this to hit targets inside of occupied areas of Ukraine. And so in theory, I suppose the target list would've already been in their possession and this simply being a matter of Kyiv deciding that they wanted to use this new U.S. permission. But it comes on the thousandth day of a war so full of unexpected moments here. And I think we are now going to have to see whether Ukraine steps forward and officially acknowledges that this indeed was an ATACMS missile launched in this particular strike. Just in the last 48 hours, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sort of hedged that generally saying, look, we're not going to necessarily announce this. Missiles will speak for themselves. Well, certainly that news has indeed emerged. What could Russia's response be? They have been unclear at this particular point. Previously warning, that if these missiles were fired by Ukraine supplied as they are by the United States, that that would essentially be NATO, the U.S. and Europe joining the war, becoming a party to the conflict. Putin has not reiterated that himself since this, but indeed its foreign ministry made similar noises. So it's a key moment here, certainly, and it's one important (inaudible) here, Amara. We are seeing the Trump presidency loom, the likelihood of negotiations there. European allies maneuvering, showing the fact they're not on the same page, frankly, as Olaf Scholz, the lame duck chancellor of Germany made a call to the Kremlin head on Friday. That notion of diplomacy is clear and coming down the track. And so, I think we're seeing the Biden Administration giving this permission to use the ATACMS to potentially complicate the war that President Trump -- president-elect Trump inherits, and I think also gives Ukraine a chance on the battlefield to get the upper hand. [08:05:00] Remember, they're very worried, the Americans about North Korean troops and a Russian offensive into that Kursk area where Ukrainian troops are currently occupying part of it. Amara?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. It's been, Nick, a remarkable series of events starting with President Biden, with this major change in policy, allowing Ukraine to use these longer-range missiles inside Russia. And then what we saw was Putin signing this declaration, revising the nuclear doctrine that you mentioned, that would basically declare that a conventional attack on Russia by any nation supported by a nuclear power would be considered a joint attack. And then we see Ukraine using these long-range missiles. It's yet to be seen what Russia's response will be, but this would obviously be seen as quite an escalation by Moscow.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, look, I mean, they saw the American decision as an escalation. The Americans saw the decision by Russia to station North Korean troops on the frontlines as an escalation by Russia. And so, we have that ladder people continually climbing. I'm not sure really what Vladimir Putin's statement today in his amendment of the nuclear doctrine outside of the scariness of the words \"Amendment of the Nuclear Doctrine\" actually necessarily does.It essentially says, that conventional attacks by multiple parties against Russia could potentially lead to responses by Russia towards those parties. It's nuanced, highly nuanced, but it's part of a pattern we've seen where Moscow feels potentially under threat or, look, feels it has to make a sort of bombastic statement that it reaches for the phrase to remind people that it is indeed a nuclear power. Do I necessarily think this means that Vladimir Putin is getting ready to launch nuclear weapons? No, certainly not. He appears to have shied away from that significantly over a thousand days of war where Russia has experienced multiple conventional military defeats. Indeed, it's been invaded by a much smaller army, Ukraine, in just the last four months. But I do think it's a bid by them to try and please a domestic audience who might be wondering exactly what juice Russia has left at this particular moment. And I think it is his way of suggesting that this is perhaps Moscow's response. Do they necessarily have the military might to take on NATO in full? Well, almost certainly not. They're struggling to defeat Ukraine. Do they necessarily have the desire geopolitically to inflame this conflict? Remember, China is a key ally in here and probably doesn't want to see that happen ahead of a Trump presidency. So, I think if we do see outside of this statement by the Kremlin head, Vladimir Putin, any further responses from Russia, we might end up looking at sabotage. There'd been many accusations that Russia has been behind exploding packages and courier depots. Indeed, we have reports from Lithuania and Germany their undersea internet cables towards Scandinavia have been damaged in the last 48 to 72 hours. That's I think where we'll potentially see this exacerbate. But be in no doubt here at all, we're into a very different part of the war here. American-made and supplied weapons are being fired into Russian territory. That's a place that we frankly never imagined we'd get to a thousand days ago. Amara?",

Live force there with the latest from London.Turning now to U.S. politics, and Donald Trump and Elon Musk have been virtually inseparable since the presidential election. And now, there are reports that Trump will join Musk today for the latest test launch of the SpaceX Starship, the largest rocket ever built. Musk has reportedly been intimately involved in Trump's decision making on his cabinet picks. Trump's latest selection is former Congressman Sean Duffy to head the Department of Transportation. Now, Trump has yet to name his choice for key economic spots like treasury, labor, and commerce secretaries. Let's go now to CNN's Alayna Treene with a closer look. And Alayna, back to this, what's been made a lot about this bromance between Musk and Trump. It wasn't the two names on the Republican ticket, but it seems they can't be separated at the moment.",

      "sentences": "That's right. I think, Musk's influence right now with Donald Trump is pretty unmatched. He has spent so much time at Mar-a-Lago. He has been talking to Donald Trump daily about these different transition appointments, and they've been going to a lot of events together, and that continues today when -- and we have this according to sources familiar with the plans, that Donald Trump and Elon Musk together are going to be attending that SpaceX launch this evening in Texas.Now, one thing I also think that is notable again, is how Musk is not only making it clear to Donald Trump and his allies and those on the transition team, who he thinks would be right for some of these roles. He's also making it known publicly and also trying to publicly put pressure on Republicans in Congress to help them with Donald Trump's pick. I want to read for you what he posted really early this morning about Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick for Attorney General. He had said that Gaetz has three critical assets that are needed for the attorney general role. He said, a big brain, a spine of steel, and an axe to grind. The post went on to say that as for the accusations against Matt Gaetz, \"I consider them worth less than nothing under our laws. A man is considered innocent until proven guilty.\" Clearly, he is discussing the House Ethics Report which there is a lot of talk right now in Congress over whether or not to release that, including some allegations from a series of women who said that they were paid to have sex with him. Now, look, that comes, this post, as Donald Trump we know has been calling up Republican Senators and privately pressuring them to move forward with his pick in Gaetz. That really -- they -- he wants them to move forward, even though there is this widespread uneasiness on Capitol Hill and among Republicans in the Senate, who will be the ones who need to confirm him eventually, once that nominating process begins. Trump is making very clear that he is standing by him. And clearly, I think where you're seeing Musk weigh in here, just knowing how close they are and how much time they're spending together, how much they're talking about these opinions, it's very clear where Donald Trump stands when you see Musk post something like that.",

(END VIDEO CLIP) WALKER: This as Israel pounds targets in Lebanon. At least five people were killed by an Israeli strike in the heart of Beirut Monday, a densely populated neighborhood was hit just hundreds of meters from the Prime Minister's office in Parliament.

      "sentences": "Well, they seem to be better than they were a couple of weeks ago, at least there seems to be some momentum. The fact that Amos Hochstein is back in Beirut, as he said, the discussions there have been constructed. They're narrowing the gaps. He did say, of course, that it's up to the parties to make this work. It's up to them to come to the decisions, but he is certainly creating an atmosphere in how he is talking about how the discussions are going, as a positive atmosphere.He's met with the Prime Minister in Lebanon today, Najib Mikati. He is meeting later with the Parliamentary Speaker, Nabih Berri, from the Amal Party. He is -- Nabih Berri is the main interlocutor with Hezbollah. His party is affiliated with Hezbollah. They certainly have a lot of this -- a lot of similar views. So, there's a sense that the gaps are narrowing. But we don't know the detail on what those gaps are. We know the broad terms that it would go back to the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 of 2006, and Hezbollah would pull back about 30 miles from the border. And the Lebanese army would have a responsibility for being the military force, the only military force other than the -- other than the U.N. UNIFIL Force there along the border, monitoring the situation. However, what we understand from Israeli officials yesterday that they want to have in any ceasefire deal, this sort of right to reply if the ceasefire is broken in any way, full operational freedom is how they describe it, direct action. And this is very important to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet at the moment. And it's not clear precisely what the language is. It's not clear if the language around that is written down or this is going to be an understanding. Because from the Lebanese side, over the weekend, we understood that they hadn't seen neither the Prime Minister nor Nabih Berri, the Parliamentary Speaker, had seen written language about this right of response. But that's where we seem to be, the gap is narrowing. That seems to be positive. But I have to say, we've sort of been here before.",

That's why the United States is mobilizing billions of dollars in partnership with national and local governments, indigenous people and businesses to protect and reforest the Amazon and other forests. That's why as a U.S. Senator back in the '80s, I first proposed to offer debt relief for countries willing to conserve their forest and other natural resources.
