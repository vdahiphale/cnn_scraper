Authorities say this man, 32-year-old Serif Zorba, they say he allegedly stabbed the imam multiple times while more than 200 congregates were kneeling for the five a.m. prayers. Officials say Zorba then attempted to flee but several people - you can even see it on video -- they were able to restrain him, stop him, and hold him until police arrived.CNN's Omar Jimenez has the very latest for us. Omar, what are officials saying this morning?",

You can see on your screen there, this is a man in a white hoodie in the third row of congregants. When they go down, he goes forward and does this act. Tries to then run away as congregants are all grabbing onto him trying to slow him down. They eventually do subdue him until police arrive. And that suspect was eventually arrested. That suspect is 32-year-old, as you mentioned, Serif Zorba, according to the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office. And so we're -- he has a court appearance expected later today.But as for the imam, he was taken to the hospital and is expected to be OK. But as I mentioned, this is in the holy month of Ramadan.

And there has been a great deal of pressure from the likes of Fox News host Tucker Carlson, putting pressure on the governor to pardon Daniel Perry. In fact, Tucker Carlson talked about this case Friday night during his show, and it was the next day, on Saturday, that the Texas governor made this vow, saying that he is, quote, working as swiftly as Texas law will allow to ensure the pardon of Daniel Perry. He also -- this -- you know, the process here in Texas is rather complicated, though, John. This case has to go before the board of pardons and paroles. They have to issue a recommendation before a Texas governor can issue a pardon. So, it has to still go through all of that. And what is really striking in this case, John, is that this case technically is not fully over. In fact, the punishment phase hasn't even started. Sentencing testimony is scheduled to begin Tuesday in Austin. So, this case isn't even over. And the district attorney in Austin says that it is, quote, deeply troubling that the governor of Texas is intervening in this case at this stage.

Back then, China had launched these massive military drills that surrounded the island and, for the first time back then, even fired missiles over Taiwan.So, part of the reason why we're seeing relatively more restraint is because the meeting between Tsai and McCarthy was held on American soil. That was done on purpose to avoid overly provoking Beijing. And experts also say that Beijing has been normalizing military activity around Taiwan. It already sends military jets and ships around Taiwan every day. The key context here is that the U.S. does not officially recognize Taiwan as a country, but unofficial ties have been growing and that infuriates Beijing. So this kind of military intimidation is likely here to stay. Kate.",

And that's when the Dalai Lama called him on stage and not only asked him for a hug but a kiss on the cheek as well, and the boy obliged. Moments later, you have the Dalai Lama then ask him to give the Dalai Lama a kiss on the mouth. He drew the boy in, pulled in his chin and kissed him on his mouth. And then, seconds later, he went on to say, suck my tongue. Now, this is extremely disturbing. It's unsettling for even parents who watched this video across social media. And, moments later, we had - or rather hours later we had the Dalai Lama's office come out and issue a statement where they said that the Dalai Lama regretted the incident. Just an extract from that press release, and I'm going to read it out here, his holiness wishes to apologize to the boy and the family, as well as his many friends across the world for the hurt his words may have caused. Interesting the use of the word \"hurt\" and the use of the word \"word.\" They're not talking about the actions of the Dalai Lama that may have hurt the people, hurt the boy, hurt the family, but the words used by the Dalai Lama. Now, like I said, there's been extreme anger and outrage over this video. You've had the Dalai Lama come out and apologize. But like I said, for his words, and not for his actions, which have been questioned by activists as well across India, where they've questioned the Dalai Lama, who holds such a high post. A spiritual leader, religious leader, who's acknowledged across the world, and his actions, completely, completely disappointing is what many have to say. John.",
