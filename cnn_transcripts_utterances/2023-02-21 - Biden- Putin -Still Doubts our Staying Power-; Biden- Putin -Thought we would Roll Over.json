Instead, they remain strong. The President also saying that a year ago Putin thought autocrats would be stronger today. Instead, they have grown weaker, thought democracies would be weaker, and instead they have grown stronger there as he was speaking. In the same place he was just a year ago, shortly after Putin had invaded Ukraine. I want to bring in Christiane Amanpour, Christiane, what did you think of the President's speech?",

Clarissa, you're there on the ground in Kyiv listening to this.And I thought one of the most notable parts of this speech from President Biden was when he spoke directly to the Russian people pushing back on what we heard from Putin earlier today, when he was blaming the West for this war, saying and Biden saying that it's not it's Putin's choice. This is not a necessity. It's a tragedy, but it is something that Putin has chosen.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it was interesting, Kaitlan. It's not the first time we've heard him sort of directly address the Russian people. And also something that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy does a lot as well, in this case, to say, listen, we do not view you as the enemy. Our fight is not with you.And I thought it was very interesting what Phil was saying, and I was so struck by it as well, the White House had really said this is not going to be a sort of battle of the speeches between President Putin and President Biden. And yet President Biden speech really did hammer President Putin and it actually felt quite personal at times, it almost felt like he was addressing him directly when he said, you know, Putin could end this war with a single word. And I thought that was very striking. Whereas if Ukraine was to end this war, it would cease to exist, as a country really pointing out just the stark contrast there, and underscoring that the issue is not with ordinary Russian people. I think that this speech will have gone down very well with Ukrainians who have watched it, not just because of its praise for the response of Ukraine in the face of this aggression, but also because it really hammered on this theme of freedom. And it is very interesting. When you talk to Ukrainians, they are very passionate about freedom. I have asked them many times where that passion comes from. One woman told me she thinks it's because they're an agrarian society. So they are very kind of devoted to this idea of their land, and what that means to protect and defend their land. But a lot of the rhetoric that we heard from President Biden tonight, which was some of the more powerful and soaring that we have heard in some time. I have no doubt will be very well received by people on the ground here in Ukraine, who does feel incredibly grateful for the support of the international community. And that's something that you hear again, and again, when you walk around people say thank you to the U.S. Thank you to NATO and thank you to all those who are supporting us in these very difficult times. And you heard it again, from the president as well, on that front; we have to be clear eyed about the future he said. It's going to be tough. This isn't going to be ending in a matter of weeks, or probably even months stealing people's expectations for you know, the inevitable heartaches and devastating battles that will be to come likely.",

But one important part that I thought Biden talked about was burden sharing, essentially, what you've heard from some lawmakers back in the U.S. about how much support the U.S. is sending to Ukraine. But there's also the refugee aspect of this, and Europe has been shielding most of that, and no country more so than Poland itself.",

And as he said, people embrace these refugees, because they knew that they were neighbors and partners in what Poland had been defending all these years before it became now Ukraine's turn, and that is the fight for freedom and independence.You know, I've been to many, many invaded countries. And in every one of those countries, no matter who the invader is, the people just fight back. Everyone defends their land, everyone defends their territory and everyone defends their flag, when push comes to shove. And I think that's what you're seeing in Ukraine, for sure. The Poles understand that they're in this fight. President Biden gave this dramatic speech about how they would not tire of this fight for democracy and freedom, also convincing not just his friends and allies in this region, not just telling Russia, but also the American people and praising the American fight, always throughout history to uphold these values. The key thing, Kaitlan is going to be the speed with which all these promised weapons and the ammunition gets to Ukraine, because the way to keep public support for this war is to get it done as quickly as they possibly can. And that is going to be the key over the next several months for sure.",

Kaitlan Collins live for us in Warsaw. Kaitlan, thank you and to our entire team!Let's get some important perspective now from two women who know understand the challenges ahead better than most, the Former Deputy Director of National Intelligence Beth Sanner and the Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Evelyn Farkas. Beth, to you first and let's start by listening to a little bit of the President for those who might have joined us just at the top of the hour, as the President was wrapping up. In the early days, one year ago, the mood around the world was that Kyiv might fall in days. The President standing in Warsaw today, the day after he was in Kyiv saying Vladimir Putin know.

We also have on the right side of Putin some pressure about like, why didn't you go and shoot Biden down while he was in Kyiv.But in ultimately, as Fred pointed out, there is really no threat to Putin right now. He remains popular and this was about rallying the Russian people, even if it was about rallying them around threats and fear. KING: And so Evelyn Farkas to that point, if Putin was wrong about the first year and the resolve of the United States, the resolve of the NATO allies, the resolve of Europe, what do you see as the major challenges as we go into year two? Putin still believes time is on his side. He still believes whether he's right or fanatical about it, that the West will crack at some point. More tanks are going into Ukraine, but there's still a debate about whether that should be followed up by fighter jets. What is the military challenge, if to keep it - if we are going to be here one year from now saying Ukraine won the war not prepare for year three? EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT DEFENSE SECRETARY FOR RUSSIA/UKRAINE/EURASIA: Well John, I think you're right, the challenge is military. And I think Christiane and others hinted at it as well, or talked about it directly saying that, you know, Putin thinks that time is on his side, that as long as he's still fighting, as long as he's still in office, he hasn't lost yet. And as long as he hasn't lost yet, he's going to count it as a win. So our job is to make sure that Ukraine gets all the equipment, it needs fast. And the reason the plans are so important. I have a piece that's hopefully going to run soon an opinion piece with General David Deb Tula arguing for those F-16s, because they can provide not only of course, air cover, the more air cover the better for Ukraine to protect the civilians to protect the troops. But most importantly, if the troops are going to go on the offensive, they need not just armored vehicles to carry them forward through the Russian lines. But frankly, they need air cover and the fighter aircraft would provide that. And they would also provide longer range reach for that for the weaponry on the Ukrainian side. So it is important for us as fast as possible to help Ukraine win because every day that they don't win, they're losing lives. And the economic cost, of course, is extreme. And there's a risk that somehow this will get out of control and spread. I want to just add one quick thing John; you might have noticed that President - from Moldova was there, she regards her country probably as the next target on Putin's list.",

You know that, that, one - basically that China is more or less not going to take our side, and that it wants peace. And you know, what does that mean?We're hopeful that China will not try to get involved by providing military assistance to Russia. But as you heard over the weekend, Secretary Blinken was worried that they would do that. So he had some strong words with Wang Yi. The Chinese need to take the lesson from this, that it's very dangerous. And of course, it's illegal to go in and seize - the territory of your neighbor. That is an imperial objective that Putin is, you know, on right now, he's trying to reach that objective. And it goes counter to the international order, and China will pay a heavy economic price if they go farther with their support to Russia. So I think what we want to do is try to keep China out of this equation in terms of their additional support to Russia, and we want to make sure that we can in the meantime move quickly to help Ukraine.",
