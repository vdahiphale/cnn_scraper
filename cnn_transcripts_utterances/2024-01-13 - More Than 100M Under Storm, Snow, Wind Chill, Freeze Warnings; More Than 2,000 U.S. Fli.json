Washington had warned the Houthis to stop doing this. The situation kept escalating. So it was time really for the U.S. to enforce a red line. And this was seen by the White House as not just a signal to the Houthis but to other Iranian proxies around the Middle East that have up to their activity following the U.S. war that is rarely war in Gaza, that the U.S. would act to protect its interests.This is something that the White House had tried not to do. For weeks, it has been trying to avoid a widening of this wall. It got to a point I think where the tariffs needed to be reestablished.

He says that he would maintain the status quo and like Tsai Ing-Wen pursue peace through strength. And China has denounced his party and denounced lying his views as separatist. The second candidate Hou Yu- Ih of the opposition Kuomintang is the mayor of New Taipei City, a longtime police officer who says that he will reengage with Beijing if elected. Now his party, the KMT traditionally favors closer ties with Beijing. And then you have the third presidential candidate Ko Wen-Je of the TPP. Now he is the former mayor of Taipei. He was a surgeon before entering politics. And what we also know is that his focus on pocketbook issues like the increasingly high cost of living has been something that has really drawn and resonated with young voters across Taiwan.
