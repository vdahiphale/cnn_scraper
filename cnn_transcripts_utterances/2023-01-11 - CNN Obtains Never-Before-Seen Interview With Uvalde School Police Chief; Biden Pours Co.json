Through his lawyer, he has previously denied that he was ever in charge and said he never issued any orders. A CNN analysis of never before made public body camera footage and newly obtained phone calls reveal Arredondo repeatedly directed the officers around him not to enter the room with the gunman. This is at 11:40 AM just seven minutes after the shooting began. PEDRO \"PETE\" ARREDONDO, FORMER UVALDE SCHOOL POLICE CHIEF: Hey, this is Arredondo. This is an emergency right now. I'm inside the building. I've been inside the building with this man. He has an AR-15. He shot a whole bunch of times. He is in one room. I need a lot of firepower. So I need this building surrounded, surrounded with as many AR-15s as possible.",

No other boss, no other law enforcement official, senior law enforcement official goes into that hallway to ask him what the hell is going on, what are you doing here? At one point, they thought he was in the room being held hostage. So much of the information that was being put out that was wrong. But he was at the center of that. He wasn't communicating with anyone. The one thing is a lot is made about whether there was a key needed for the door. Investigators I've talked to believe no key was needed. They seemed to need to get the team together and open the door. A lot has been made about how radios weren't working. You can clearly hear in this video officers standing feet from that door where the kids were, they could hear the radio transmissions, that call that comes over that says a kid is calling from inside the room. A lot of excuses. He's made a lot of excuses. Other law enforcement officials have made a lot of excuses. But all this is out now. And we've spent eight months getting information, digging into this. That's in terms of his interview, his nearly entire one-hour interview is on our Web site. We put it out there because we wanted people to see for themselves, to hear him, to see his explanation. Part of it is because he hasn't really talked. He did a newspaper interview through his lawyer. He's dodged reporters. And he's at the center of this.
