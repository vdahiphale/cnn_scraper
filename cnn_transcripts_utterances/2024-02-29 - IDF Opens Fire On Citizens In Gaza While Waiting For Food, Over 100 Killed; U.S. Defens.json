The enclave's health ministry says more than 100 civilians were killed while they were waiting for food. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDERSON (voice-over):  This video released by the Israel Defense Forces shows a large crowd rushing toward aid trucks just outside Gaza City. A local journalist tells CNN that Israeli forces opened fire and many were killed when people were trying to escape, including the aid trucks which were ramming into people. Israel does not dispute that its troops opened fire. It says they were under threat but says the gunshots came after the stampede for aid. More video coming in from nearby hospitals. And I have to tell you, it is graphic. More than 700 people are said to be injured. This horrific incident underscoring the dire humanitarian situation for people living in Gaza. And it comes as we get word of a grim milestone in this Israel-Hamas war. The Gaza health ministry says more than 30,000 people have been killed since the war between Israel and Hamas began. Well, Paula Hancocks is back with me this hour. That is the backdrop to what we are reporting on here on CNN as brand new, the backdrop being we have passed the 30,000 dead milestone in this conflict. And today, more than 100 more dead, possibly as many as 750 or more injured in what is a mass incident here in Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. I mean, there were two crossings at this point that are functioning, not functioning to their full capacity,according to NGOs. It's not nearly enough aid getting in. But they're both in the south and so to be able to get these trucks to the north, the U.N. agencies, other NGOs have talked to us about how difficult it is. They try and coordinate with the Israeli military. They have alleged that they have been fired upon by the Israeli military in certain cases. This is also why we're now seeing more of a reliance on airdrops. Airdrops happen when you can't get aid to an area any other way. It shows the difficulties, the desperation of being able to get the aid to these particular areas. Now we know that this is also an area which, much of it is fairly uninhabitable. It is an area that the Israeli military has been focusing on, northern Gaza, Gaza City -- this happened just in the east of Gaza City -- really, since the beginning of October. I mean, people are not living in homes. They don't have food, they don't have aid. They don't have water, shelter. So any aid that is coming in, as you see from some of the images, the sheer desperation to get whatever is on those aid trucks, to be able to survive. And it also shows what we have heard again from NGOs, that the infrastructure, to be able to distribute aid, collapsed a long time ago. They have trucks that have to be in a convoy with Israeli military protection, if you like. And yet they are still unable to distribute the aid because of the sheer chaos. And in this particular occasion, according to those on the ground, the Israeli military opening fire.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky. I spoke with Khader Al Za'anoun, that local journalist. I also was just on a briefingcall with the Israeli military. And what is emerging are two competing narratives. The Israeli military offering a very different timeline from what not only Khader is offering us but from other -- what other eyewitnesses on the ground have told us as well. And that's where I want to focus and begin at least. Because the people who are actually on the ground have told us that what happened was, after these crowds began to swarm these aid trucks, the Israeli military, within minutes of those trucks crossing into this part of northern Gaza, opened fire. It was that gunfire, according to people on the ground, that caused these truck drivers to begin driving away furiously, most likely out of fear for their own safety, for their own lives. Now Khader told us that the majority of the people who were killed in this incident -- and the Palestinian ministry of health puts that number at 104 -- were killed in that ensuing chaos. But he was very clear that that chaos was caused by the Israeli military gunfire. Now I spoke with an Israeli military spokesman on this briefing call, who offered a very different timeline, saying the truckloads went into the north, that there was a stampede that ensued, that people were killed and injured in that stampede. And it was only afterwards that he described what he called \"a separate incident against our forces\" is the wording that he used, saying that there was a group of Palestinians, who began to approach that military post where those trucks had come in from. They approach that position, according to the Israeli military, in a threatening way. And that it was at that point that the Israeli military opened fire. They say that they first fired into the air and then they fired at the individuals who continued to approach that military position. Now again, that is contradicted by the reports on the ground. The evidence that the Israeli military has offered so far is video from a drone that appears to have been overhead. In that drone footage, you can see huge crowds of people swarming around these aid trucks, getting on top of the trucks to try and pull bags of flour or whatever it was that they were able to grab. What it doesn't show critically, Becky, is those truck drivers driving over people, driving away with high speed. So it doesn't show that point of it. And it also doesn't show the Israeli gunfire. So we're certainly missing some elements. But based on what we're hearing from people on the ground, including a trusted local journalist who we've spoken to in the past, he says that it was the Israeli gunfire that triggered this chaotic scene, resulting in the deaths of so many people.",

And despite the fact thatwe have been seeing that progress has been made in the last week or so, we also know that they have yet to actually reach a deal. So anything that happens on the ground can, of course, change that dynamic. But as you are noting, it also, this incident today, also underscores the need for that deal to happen, the need for a temporary ceasefire to go into place. Because that seems to be the only way that the sufficient quantity of aid that is needed in Gaza, in particular in northern Gaza, could actually get in, get in safely and be distributed appropriately to the people on the ground, who desperately need it. You know, we, in the last day, we've heard from humanitarian aid groups, including U.N. agencies, who have warned that, if the situation on the ground doesn't changes (sic) within a matter of a month or two, about 0.5 million people in northern Gaza will face famine. And so when you just look at the sheer numbers of that, you look at how desperate the situation is already, just imagine that situation worsening even further. And so it's very clear that more aid is needed. It's very clear that the conditions on the ground do not allow the amount of aid that is needed to actually get in. And so something clearly needs to change.",

But at the same time, there's no clarity on how this all unfolded, on what happened, what led to all these deaths and injuries, all these casualties that we are now reporting. And the issue with that, Becky, has been with the same that we've -- it's exactly what we have been saying for months. It is the fact that we are not on the ground, that we are not able to report firsthand on what is happening, what is unfolding in Gaza right now. And what you end up having is a situation, as you and Paula were discussing, is when the IDF is presenting its own version of events and when you have journalists from Gaza, Palestinian journalists, who are on the ground reporting different version of events of what actually happened on the ground. Months into this war, Becky, you are seeing this death toll continuing to rise. You are hearing from people in Gaza, saying that, if they're not going to get killed by the bombs and by the airstrikes, it is starvation that is going to kill them. It is a very dire humanitarian situation, where you hear from international aid groups saying that they have run out of words to describe the situation on the ground and they continue to call for a cease-fire. They continue to allow for the access of humanitarian aid. They have been very concerned about a situation like we have seen today. You have aid organizations that have stopped sending their aid trucks into northern Gaza, because they have been worried about the situation there. Because of losing -- because people who are starving, who are trying to feed their families, their children, have in the past looted these trucks as they have come in. So we are still going to have to wait and see to get further details about what happened today. But yet again, you are looking at a catastrophic situation that is continuing to unfold on the ground, with no end in sight for civilians in Gaza, who have nowhere out of the enclave. They are trapped in there. And they would tell you, they have nowhere safe to turn. They have nowhere left to go. And another reminder, Becky, we are talking about a place where, as we have reported time and time again, the majority of the population there children. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I believe most members of this committee are bewildered at how these events could transpire. I am primarily concerned with the effect of your actions and the actions of your closest adviser on the confidence of the American people at a time when overall trust in the government is declining. Americans must still believe that the government can protect them from the growing threats in this world.

I chair the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and I'm charged by the chairman with the oversight of our entire nuclear arsenal, including the command and control of our nuclear forces. Every day, our service members who maintain and operate the weapons systems that employ these destructive weapons are ready to act within minutes of receiving a valid order from the president, that flows down through you or your designated representative. Today, many on this dais will speak about disruptions and chains of command. I will say that the most dangerous change of command to break is that which communicates orders to our missile silos, ballistic missile submarines and strategic bombers. We will only deter attacks on our homeland if our adversaries are assured that we are capable and willing to respond in kind, massively if necessary. Not only is our homeland threatened by adversaries' ballistic missiles but will increasingly be threatened by hypersonic missiles. So all of these attacks are a matter of minutes, not hours. We can't afford to have the continuity of our nuclear command and control fail for even a minute. My district of Colorado Springs is home to the Cheyenne Mountain complex, which is the primary site of our missile warning center. The missile warning center maintains an unblinking eye that buys the president and the Secretary of Defense critical minutes in a crisis.

They claim there were two separate incidents.First, trucks, he says, were rushed by crowds and rolled over people before Israeli forces opened fire on a group of Palestinians that approached them, the IDF says. Well, a senior Hamas figure has warned that the killings could cause the ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations to break down. Izzat Al-Risheq saying, and I quote here, \"Negotiations are not an open process. We will not allow for the pathway of the negotiations to become a cover for the enemy's continued crimes against our people in the Gaza Strip.\" Well, joining me now is the secretary general of Medecins sans Frontieres, Doctors without Borders, Chris Lockyear. And as I understand it, Chris, you have some staff still on the ground in northern Gaza; not a lot. And those staff have, as I understand it, chosen to remain not necessarily with MSF operations but you have been in contact with those staff over the past few days. Have you been able to access any of those staff since this incident today? What more can you tell us? CHRISTOPHER LOCKYEAR, SECRETARY-GENERAL, MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES:  Well, Becky, thanks for having me on and highlighting this horrendous incident, which is an unfolding catalog of horrendous incidents in Gaza over the last -- the last -- the last few weeks and months. We're trying to get -- to answer your question, we're trying to get in contact with our staff, who remain in north Gaza. Contact with them is very sporadic at the best of times. A few of them have remained in the north of Gaza to try and assist with patients and to look after their families. But since this incident, not yet; we haven't had any contact with them on a daily basis. We're incredibly worried about them, especially when we hear stories like this, because they themselves are telling us how desperate the situation is in the north of Gaza. They're talking about themselves and their families going hungry amongst whole neighborhoods which have been destroyed in that part of the city (ph). The reality being, as this incident and many others are showing us, is that there is no place left in Gaza which is safe. And the only way out is for a cease-fire immediately.",

There's no clean water and people are extremely sick. The backdrop to what we have seen today is a very grim milestone of some 30,000 killed in the Strip. And those who have survived are in absolutely desperate straits at present. You have spoken at the U.N. a number of occasions but I listened to what your last testimony. What is your appeal at this point, Chris? I mean, I feel as if we have literally got to the point where we have normalized conversations about starvation, about famine, about catastrophe, about carnage. Where are we?",

Tens of children have become martyrs because of the famine. I cannot wait until my child is martyred because of the famine.

There are -- the president said that there are competing reports at this time. And then I asked him whether he believes that this incident might complicate the negotiations that are currently underway to release hostages, get more aid in and potentially have a temporary ceasefire. The president acknowledged that he does think it will complicate those negotiations. He also told reporters that he is hopeful that a deal could be reached by Monday but acknowledged that that might be difficult to do. The president said that he spoke with some people in the region a bit earlier today. We're still trying to get some clarity on whether that was any specific leaders or simply his team there. But the White House is watching the situation that's unfolding in Gaza City quite closely. The National Security Council spokesperson responded this morning, saying that, quote, \"This is a serious incident and we are looking into the reports. We mourn the loss of innocent life and recognize the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza where innocent Palestinians are just trying to feed their families. \"This underscores the importance of expanding and sustaining the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, including through a potential temporary ceasefire. We continue to work day and night to achieve that outcome.\" The Biden administration is really viewing this with a great sense of urgency. They're trying to get this hostage negotiation, completed working around the clock with counterparts in the region, trying to bring the two sides to some type of agreement. But there are big questions about how today's situation that's unfolding in Gaza City, with more than 100 civilians reportedly killed, hundreds more injured, whether that will have any direct impacts on these talks. The president, of course, had said that he had hoped that there would be a ceasefire by Monday. But certainly that appears to be challenging at the moment as these negotiations are still underway.",
