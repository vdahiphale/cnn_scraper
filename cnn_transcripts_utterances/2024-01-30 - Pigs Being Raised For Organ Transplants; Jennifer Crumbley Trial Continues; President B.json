Administration officials indicate that this response, when it comes,will be stronger than recent actions taken against these Iranian- backed militias in the region. We want to start off with the White House with CNN's M.J. Lee. So, M.J., the president says he's made a decision, but the details, he's keeping close to the vest. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Boris, you heard President Biden there telling Arlette Saenz directly that, yes, he has made a decision how exactly to retaliate after the deaths of these three American soldiers. But, as you can imagine, the White House has been very careful in recent days to not telegraph in any way what exactly that response would look like. But officials have said that the response that we are going to see in the coming days is likely to be more serious and more powerful than some of the retaliatory strikes that we have seen in Iraq and Syria. Now, it's clear that the president is grappling also with the reality that some of those strikes in the past haven't successfully worked as a deterrence. It was interesting. When Arlette asked him what will actually be different this time with this response, he responded, \"We will see.\" So that wasn't exactly showing confidence about the fact that this future response is going to have a different effect. We do know that the administration is clearly considering a range of options as well. We heard Secretary of State Antony Blinken alluding to some of those options. He said that the attacks could be multilevel. They could come in stages. They could take place over the course of a while. And so these are the decisions that the president has been grappling with. But, again, he says that he has made a decision. But it is an extremely complicated and difficult decision, because there are two things that he wants. He wants to show force and serious force that's different from before. But, as the White House has made clear time and time again, the one thing they do not want is for this conflict to broaden out into a bigger regional war, Boris.",

But officials have made it clear this is expected to be wider, broader in scope and perhaps sustained over time, far -- much more so than we have seen in previous U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria. The question, of course, what does it look like? And that's where President Joe Biden has options. He could carry out strikes in Iraq or Syria or both. He could go after weapons and facilities, which has been sort of the M.O. of the past, or he could go after leadership, which the U.S. has done on occasion. That would be a larger message. The strikes themselves could be sustained over time. They could have a cyber element to it as well, a cyberattack accompanying sort of a kinetic action. And then that doesn't even get into all the special operations forces options. So the president certainly has his options. It is the Pentagon's job to come up with those options. And then Biden makes his choice on what he wants to do here. It is clear two things. First, it is expected that this will be bigger, and then, second, it is also expected that they will try to calibrate this to not spark a regional war here with Iran.",

They could be -- we could be listening to what's said after the first set of strikes, find out where they're being directed, the enemy's directed -- getting directions from, go after that site next. There's a lot that could be done militarily here. The question always, as the president has said, is, he wants to do the best he can to deter. He doesn't want a regional war.

So you can strike with Tomahawk-launched attack missiles, the TLAM, fired from Navy ships. You can strike airborne. You have got some attack helicopters that you could use. So there's different ways of doing it.

But we know what the intelligence says. And we know that these attacks are not only supported, but organized and equipped. And in many of these militias, they actually have Revolutionary Guard technicians there to make sure the equipment works properly, the drones are launched on time and on schedule and armed properly, et cetera. So we know that there's a big Iranian hand behind this. And the question is, what's it take to get Iran to decide that this campaign is not in their interest?
