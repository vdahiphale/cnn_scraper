Should there be stronger local news in Texas? Yes. Right? Would they have sniffed it out? But there's no mechanism in our Constitution to really sort of catch this or prevent it from happening. It's on the press corps. And we, you know, we just have to figure out how to figure it out. And it takes real reporting, right? This is real resources. You have to call up people in the offices. You have to talk to their lawmakers. You have to talk to her colleagues. You have to get the story. Not impossible to do.

And so I think that this applies to folks on the Hill, this applies to people in the White House, this applies to these other institutions that are very important for American life.
