The major questions now, how will his win impact the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East, and how are leaders in those regions reacting to Trump's re-election? I'm joined now by CNN's Chief International Security Correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh and CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Matthew Chance.Matthew, let me start with you. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as we now know, is quick to congratulate his friend Donald Trump on the victory. You have some new reporting though, that the two have now actually spoken on the phone. What can you tell us about that? MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, you're right. In the minutes after Donald Trump made his sort of declaration of victory speech, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, sort of posted a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, basically saying this is history's greatest comeback, really congratulating in a gushing way Donald Trump on this election victory. That's been followed up with a phone call. There's been a readout of that over the course of the past few minutes. They had a conversation that was described as warm and cordial. The Prime Minister of Israel congratulated Trump on his election victory, and the two agreed to work together for Israel's security. Now, that's key because in the course of the past year or so, there's been a great deal of tension between the Israeli government and the Biden Administration, figures in Israel thinking that Biden and his vice president of course, Kamala Harris, has been seeking to sort of hold back Israel's military response to the October 7th attacks. In contrast, the presidency of Donald Trump, the first term is remembered fondly here as a time when there were several pro-Israel moves. Trump of course, moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. He acknowledged or accepted sovereignty of Israel over the Golan Heights, which was captured from Syria back in 1967, and sort of paved the way for a normalization of diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab states, as well as taking a much harder line against Iran. Israel is anticipating and hoping and expecting there to be much more of that, at least early on in a Trump presidency. And so that's why there's so much enthusiasm here from Benjamin Netanyahu, from other Israeli officials, and indeed from many Israelis as well. Recent opinion polls before the votes suggested overwhelming support in Israel for a Trump presidency. And that is what, Wolf, they have now got.",
