Millions of people may have to work without pay, and hundreds of thousands of government workers could be furloughed. Air travel could be disrupted if unpaid TSA workers don't show up, which has happened before. So we're talking about some delays at airports. And about 10,000 low-income children will immediately lose access to head start early childhood education programs. Also, FDA food safety inspections could be disrupted.

And that includes, for example, the Small Business Administration having to stop processing new loans for small businesses, delays in long term disaster recovery efforts, risk of millions of women and children not getting food assistance, and going back to those federal workers, millions of federal workers not getting paid over the course of this time. In fact, just yesterday here at the White House, officials received notice in their inboxes about the instructions if they are furloughed, and just a little glimpse as to what that looks like. Some senior aides have to learn the jobs of junior aides because they might not be here.

But the reality is, as long ago as a week back, people were saying, members of Congress that I was talking to were saying there's going to be a shutdown, you know. This is a stalemate. There are about 20 members of the Republican House Conference who have voted over and over again, procedurally and substantively, for going in the direction of a shutdown, and they will not take yes for answer.Some of them wanted action on impeachment hearings against Biden. They got that. They had the hearing this week. Some of them wanted deep, deep cuts to non-military discretionary spending. That's the procedural bill that McCarthy put up just yesterday, 30 percent cuts across the board. They wouldn't vote for that. So until they get to a point where there's something that you can actually bargain with, there's almost no way to avoid the shutdown.

These are candidates, Mike Lawler one of them, who to be seen as moderate that they can't afford to go down the path of closing down the government or trying to impeach Biden and so forth because they'll get voted out office.And so the political needs and desires of about 20 Republicans who are on Gaetz's side and about 18, including Lawler, are really just at odds.

But there was some reporting that Gaetz has been talking quietly with Democrats about ousting McCarthy as the speaker. Now if that's the case, then that might be what this is really all about. Because again, you know, it's really sort of stunning to see McCarthy give this faction of his conference everything, every single thing that they've asked for and they're still sort of tying him up in knots.Even this question about whether or not we should move away from continuing resolutions to full year appropriations, the House is actually doing that right now. They've moved forward, I think, four of the 12 bills.

Since then, of course, she's done quite a lot of legislating and has quite an impressive legacy.Look, Governor Newsom has said that of the many people who were already planning to run for this seat, he's not going to name any of them. And so I think what we'll see is the governor playing some of his own California politics, rewarding somebody who's not in the current group of ambitious legislators who were running for this seat. And it'll probably be him, I would think, playing to part of the base of the Democratic Party. Maybe name a Latina, maybe name somebody from the Asian American community to sort of work his local politics.

This is a look at what it looked like yesterday on not just this road, but so many roads across New York yesterday, just covered in water. You can see we still have some rain pushing across the Northeast, sprinkles right now across much of New York, but you've got some heavier bands making their way across Connecticut, Rhode Island and even portions of Massachusetts.We do still have the bulk of the heaviest rain out to sea, but likely still going to be seeing at least some showers as we go through the morning hours. Most of this should wrap up by about lunchtime today. We do still have some flood warnings in effect. Those aren't necessarily for the rain that's expected to come, but how much rain fell, because it takes time to lose all of that rain, and we've had a ton of it. As Polo mentioned, yes, JFK airport breaking an all-time record, picking up over eight inches of rain yesterday. And they were not the only spot that picked up quite so much. You had numerous locations picking up six, seven, even as much as nine inches. That's correct. At Valley Stream, New York just crossing over that nine inch threshold. So for the rest of the day today, again, you've still got a lot of these showers that are going to be coming from some of those outer bands of the system, but it will gradually make its way east, farther out to sea and taking with it the moisture. So the good news is, by the time we get to Sunday, we will finally have a day with sunshine from start to finish. We've just got to get through the rest of the day today. Overall, though, we're not expecting anywhere near the amount of rain that we had yesterday. Most of these areas likely picking up about a half of an inch, up to one inch at best. But again, when you've already had six, seven, or even eight inches of rain, even one additional inch is likely to cause some problems because it takes time for that water to go away, and that ground is very saturated at this point. Another concern, too, is going to be coastal flooding. You've still got some of those across New York, New Jersey and even Delaware.

In September of 2020, a man was arrested and brought to a police department building, and when officers wanted to conduct a strip search because they believed he had some drugs, the man was struggling. Those officers brought out their tasers, they started to tase the man several times, but they didn't realize that activated their body cameras. Later on, a supervisor became aware of how this went down. They watched what happened through an app and tried to have the body camera destroyed, according to the chief, that way the video wouldn't be logged into a server.
