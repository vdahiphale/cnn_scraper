      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE, Donald Trump's fourth surrender could happen, just hours, after the first Republican debate, which we are now learning, tonight, he is expected to skip.Plus, Jack Smith, you might want to call your office. CNN has new video that now places one of Trump's co-defendants, at the Capitol, on January the 6th. Is that why the alleged mastermind, of the fake electors plot, pleaded the Fifth, to Congress? And the West Coast, tonight, bracing for the impact, of Hurricane Hilary. Forecasters fear that that Category 4 storm that you see there, could unleash a year's worth of rain, in a single day. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Only one week left to surrender, from now, actually a little less than that since the deadline is new, next Friday. Tonight, we are hearing from sources that Donald Trump is not expected to do so, until next Thursday, or next Friday, that deadline day. And while he will show up, to be arrested, fourth time, because he has to, we have now learned that he is likely going to be a no-show, at the first Republican debate, next Wednesday night. With Trump, of course, there is always the caveat that he could change his mind. But I am told that he must let the Republican National Committee know whether or not he is going to, in fact, be on that stage, in Milwaukee, by Monday night, at 9 PM. Multiple sources, familiar with Trump's plans, tell CNN that he has basically made up his mind, and he does not plan to be there. Instead, he is expected to sit, for an interview, with Tucker Carlson, that night, snubbing the network that is hosting the debate and, of course, fired Tucker Carlson. It would not only be a snub to Fox News, though, but also to the Republican National Committee, which is holding the debate. The Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, personally appealed to Trump, to come. Fox executives did too. They actually went to Bedminster, his golf club, to lobby him, to go. So far, we do know who will be there, on Wednesday night. Eight candidates have met the RNC's polling and donor requirements, to qualify for that stage. And we should have a pretty good idea, by Monday night, at this hour, who is officially in, and who is officially out. That is by the time the GOP candidates must deliver their signed loyalty pledges, to support whoever it is, is the eventual nominee. We should note Mike Pence's campaign says that he signed it today. Our first guest says he has just met the polling threshold, as well. Let's go straight to the source, Miami's mayor, and Republican presidential candidate, Francis Suarez. Mayor, thank you for being here. You say that you have qualified to get on that debate stage, on Wednesday night. The RNC, I should note, says that you have not yet qualified. Are you sure you're going to be there, Wednesday? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ, (R) MIAMI, FLORIDA, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, I'm sure I'm going to be there, on Wednesday. We've been having conversations back-and-forth. They've never done this before. We've never done this before. And we are sort of crossing our T's and going through the process. For example, we've shown them that we've reached the donor threshold, by having, I think, 42,000 or so donations. But understandably, they need to audit that. So, there's a process, for them to audit that. We've sent them, just tonight, a couple of polls, including one, by Kaplan Strategies, where we're actually at 2 percent, which would meet the national polls. They're certifying that as well. And so, it's a process. We understand it's a process. We did sign the loyalty pledge. And we expect and hope that very, very shortly, in hopefully the next 24 or 48 hours, but certainly by Monday, we'll know, for certain. We're planning on it. We booked hotel reservations. We're inviting people. We have a bunch of guests coming up from Miami. It's going to be -- it's going to be wonderful opportunity, to introduce myself, to the nation.",

And it seems like they're not even reading their own oppo research, which they've paid, God knows how much money for. In a $150 million campaign, where they're, hiring a ton of staff, they're not even reading their own oppo research. Because, in the first page of their own oppo research, it shows that I voted for Republican in 2016, and 2020. And yet, they continue to say that. So, they're a campaign that's struggling to tread water. But meanwhile, we're growing, right? We went from 1 percent to 2 percent, in the latest national poll. So, we're excited about the opportunity, to really tell the country, who we are, introduce ourselves, connect with the country, talk about my policies, but also let them, you know, get them to know who I am, as from a personality perspective, and also why I have the right profile, to gain, an advantage, in the contest, in 2024, and get voters, from the Hispanic community, to get voters that are young voters that we lost by 26 points, to Joe Biden, who is --",

That is one story. They're not two separate stories. And I think what the video shows us is that exact point. The political coup, created the fertile ground for what happened and the violence that took place. Donald Trump, with his words of incitement, created, again, the ground of what took place on that, on the 6th.

The courts shut down trials anyway. And so, you started to see this increasing backlog of people, who are stuffed in the jail, with nowhere to go, because the trial dates weren't coming up. To this, you add just the pandemic problems of violence, in the city. We had a tremendous -- we had a 60 percent increase in homicides, in the City of Atlanta, during the pandemic. That's starting to come down. So, you end up with an overcrowded jail, and a jail that's got a lot of folks, who are accused of violence. The problem is you also have a jail that's filled with people, who have mental health problems, who are there for relatively petty crimes, like shoplifting, criminal trespass, which is you could be graffiti, frankly, is 20 percent of the folks, who are there.",
