We will explain why.Also this hour, House Speaker Mike Johnson is walking the political tightrope right now with a foreign aid bill that has infuriated Republican hard-liners. And speaking of a House divided, the Kennedy family will join forces today to back President Biden's reelection bid over RFK Jr.'s campaign. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Happening now, in New York, Donald Trump is back in the courtroom as jury selection continues in his criminal hush money trial. It's the first ever criminal trial for a former U.S. president. One of the seven seated jurors has already been excused. She had expressed concerns that aspects of her identity had been compromised. And we're also hearing there may be issues with yet another juror. Let's go to CNN's chief legal analyst, Laura Coates. She's in New York for us with all the late-breaking developments -- Laura.",

That was already cut in half by those who said they could not be impartial by a show of hands. I'm back here with Kristen Holmes. And, also, Kara Scannell joins us from inside the -- this whole area. Kara, tell me what happened today. There were 96 jurors who were brought in after that juror called in to say she can no longer serve. What's happening?",

      "sentences": "So, they brought in the 96 jurors, this new pool. The judge gives them the instructions about what it is required to be a juror, what the elements that they need to prove, the prosecution needs to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. And then they ask the question of, is there anyone who feels that they cannot be fair and impartial?We saw a number of hands go up. Specifically, there were 48 people who said that they couldn't. That was on par with Monday. Monday, we started with 96. About 50 hands went up for that. So, this is a similar situation that we're seeing. And then another nine said that they couldn't serve for some other reason, like a scheduling reason. So they just started doing the 42 questions in that questionnaire, where the judge is inquiring about people's biography, if they have ever attended a Trump rally or an anti-Trump rally. And they're going to build out the little profiles for the first 18 jurors in the box. Once they seat 18, meaning they have gone through the questionnaire, and they don't believe any need to be excused, because the judge feels like they're potentially suitable, there's not an apparent issue of someone being unable to be fair and impartial, then they will start the questioning by the attorneys. And the attorneys, both the prosecution and Trump's lawyers, will have 30 minutes each to ask these questions. And what we learned Monday, part of the strategy is, prosecutors are asking, you know, people can believe someone who's already admitted that they have lied under oath, for instance, or if they can look past someone's job to, like, a tabloid publisher or an adult film actress and evaluate them based on what they have said. So they're trying to get to the actual issues in the case. And Trump's lawyers, as we saw, were asking a lot of questions around, how do people feel about Donald Trump, trying to unearth if there was like a hidden bias or a subconscious bias against him. And also, as we learned too, they were looking into people's past social media posts to try to see if there was something in someone's past. And they were successful in getting two jurors excluded yesterday -- Tuesday because they found some problematic posts going back years in their past.",

The judge does not want that to take place.They want the overall 30-minute voir dire to be used to actually identify any social media posts. But there's also one juror today who was very forthcoming about just how much she knows about the allegations in this case. She's a lawyer. She's somebody who has read, I think, the Mike (sic) Pomerantz book, who was a -- one of the members of the DA team who was outraged that Alvin Bragg did not initially want to go forward with this case.

Just now, when we were talking about that same juror who was being questioned, and with her deep wealth of knowledge on the case, he was looking at her directly. Now, there's nothing that says that he can't look at these prospective jurors directly, but there is something when it is a former president and to how these jurors would feel and if that does end up coming up, in terms of, they walked in, they were surprised to see it was the former president. We heard from jurors who were dismissed who said that there was something kind of shocking to them when they saw him up close and personal. So what does it mean when he's turning around and looking at them? Does that make them feel intimidated or does it not? And, again, it's not necessarily something he's doing. It's just where we are in this case, given who the defendant is.",

We only had 11 -- well, really 11 to go to get to that coveted 18, which includes the 12 and the six, and has already called in to say, listen, I think that my anonymity has been compromised.The judge is well aware of this might having been an impact on other jurors, including prospective ones as well. What's the era -- the aura in the courtroom right now knowing that there's already been one who said, look, you seated me, I can't do it? SCANNELL:  Well, the judge has now added additional parameters of what information can be known about the jurors. I mean, this juror, just to be clear, said that she felt that aspects of her identity were known and she was being inundated by friends and family asking if she was this juror.",

Now, CNN did not identify her employer. Other news outlets did. She has -- she is an oncology nurse. There are hundreds of oncology nurses in the city, but she felt like she -- her -- more identity -- more aspects of her identity were known that made her feel uncomfortable. So, the rule going forward is, the judge said that, reporters can't report where someone works, which is appropriate, because that does narrow it down some. And we are also trying to provide some insight so the public knows who is going to be in judgment of the former president in the first historic case, but not provide too much identity that they could be identified, because we don't know their names. Only the lawyers in the case know the jurors' identities. And that is for a reason. And we see this in other high-profile cases.",

Again, we're doing this because it's a public service to get out who the jury is to kind of show, even when you have Donald Trump saying the jury is completely unfair, you know, showing the other side of that, who these people are that believe that they can be fair and unbiased.

And that piece of information is just too specific. I think that the judge and the parties should have foreseen that this might happen, and they should have already put in place some sort of measure to say, while it's important to the parties to know where someone works perhaps, it's not important to the public and it has the risk of identifying them.

There may not even be enough Republicans in the committee to advance this legislation. So, at this point, it becomes a question of whether or not Democrats are willing to do what is not traditional in the House of Representatives, and that is to help the majority get the rule across the finish line, so they can actually have a fulsome debate on this package. Now, many Democrats coming out of that meeting said that there was no consensus as to how they were going to proceed. But I will tell you, there are a number of Democrats who are signaling that they want to ensure this Ukraine piece passes and that they are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that U.S. allies across the world have the money that they need to fight against enemies. So, I think that that is really weighing on Democrats in this moment. It's really sort of a political question versus -- versus this question about the U.S.' standing around the globe. Now, there's a complicating factor here, and that is the fact that some Republicans are urging Speaker Mike Johnson to change the threshold for the motion to vacate. That is the ability of one person to oust or at least call for a vote to oust the speaker at any time. Some Republicans saying that that rule should be changed as part of this package with the supplemental. That becomes a more complicated question, though, as to whether Democrats would help with that. Here's what one of those Democrats, Dan Kildee of Michigan, told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI):  I mean, it's just another layer, for sure. I mean, I -- first of all, I think the rule as they wrote it for themselves was preposterous. So I don't disagree that it's a ridiculous rule. Whether or not, in this moment where we have a global security challenge, we ought to be trying to bail them out of their politics is another question. But I'm open to the conversation. It's going to be a leadership decision. They have created this mess for themselves, though, and it was predictable. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We need to get the lethal aid to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan in this challenging time. Russia, China and Iran have engaged in an unholy alliance that seeks to undermine and destabilize the free world. And we have a responsibility, as leader of that free world, to bring our allies together, to support them in their time of need. If we shirk in that responsibility, then we cease to be that leader that nations can count on and rely on, and you will see a new world order in which China, Russia and Iran are the driving force around the globe.

Ten-year-old Shahed is one of those children, her bright pink pants unmistakable in the arms of the man carrying her away.

But Shahed is not alone. She is one of eight children who died on that crowded street in Al-Maghazi. The hospital says they were killed in an Israeli airstrike. By publication time, the Israeli military said only that the incident is under review. One after another, their small bodies arrive at the hospital's morgue and into the arms of grieving parents. His eyes swollen and red, the father of 9-year-old Loujain recounts his daughter's last moments playing foosball with her friends. \"This is my eldest daughter,\" he says. \"A drone strike hit them while they were playing. They're all children.\" Hours earlier, Yusuf was one of those children, playing alongside Shahed and Loujain, when he was suddenly killed in a war he did not choose, his mother still clinging to her son. Neither does this boy, who cannot believe his brother is dead. \"He is still alive,\" he cries. \"Don't leave him here.\" Amid the outpourings of grief, there is Shahed, her blood-stained pink pants once again impossible to miss. \"Dear God, what did they all do?\" one man cries. \"What did they all do?\" (END VIDEOTAPE)",
