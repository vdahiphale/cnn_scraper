One involves potential criminal liability for his conduct spreading election laws about the 2020 vote, and we'll get to that in a moment. We start though with our breaking news. Sources telling CNN that the former President's legal team is considering whether to allow Federal agents to conduct a new search of Mar-a-Lago. CNN's Sara Murray joins us now with that story.

So this would be, you know, a potential way to try to satisfy thegovernment's demands. There are, of course, people around former President Trump who don't believe he has any additional documents, but the Justice Department has been very insistent that they believe that there are still documents out there and that potentially Trump and his team could have run afoul of this May subpoena, which you know, could potentially put him in legal jeopardy.

We now know that that wasn't true. She has hired a lawyer. She has spoken to Federal investigators. We know that Evan Corcoran, another lawyer on the team, people are worried he could have some kind of legal exposure. According to sources, he does not believe that's the case.

Interestingly, it's not just these e-mails that are being handed over in the order today, some of the documents that are also being given to the January 6 Committee involve Eastman's pitch to former Vice President Mike Pence to block the certification of the vote, which, of course, Pence ultimately refused to do.

What this is, is a smoking gun in Georgia, because if you look at what the Judge describes here of these e-mails is they file up a lawsuit, a State Court lawsuit in early December -- December 4th -- making various allegations about dead people voting, about felons voting, about unregistered voters voting, and by the end of December, they are aware that these allegations are false, and that is the e-mail that the Judge quotes here, one of the e-mails where Eastman says: \"The President has since been made aware that some of the allegations have been inaccurate.\" And then they go and they make him -- they -- actually, the lawyers go in, they have him file a Federal lawsuit where Trump certifies under oath or verifies under oath that these allegations were in fact true. And that's perjury, and that's certainly evidence of Federal crimes.   But remember, when Eastman makes this statement, it is December 31st. What happens three days later? Two days later? He makes -- Trump makes the call to Raffensperger. He makes that famous recorded call, infamous recorded call, where he is asking Raffensperger, demanding Raffensperger, threatening Raffensperger if doesn't to find exactly 11,780 votes, one more than he needs. This is a smoking gun for the prosecutor in Georgia, and the Georgia investigation is very advanced.

The one thing I thought was interesting, though, to Jessica's point is, I would -- I've worked with the January 6 Committee, the work they're doing is important, but this needs to go to the Department of Justice.

And the search, of course, once the Judge grants that warrant, and they executed that search in August, it should have been exhaustive, and it wasn't anything that we would consider supervised by the individual that the search has been conducted against. And so they would have gone through whatever physical spaces that were authorized by the Court in that warrant to conduct a pretty exhaustive search. So, I really do have a big question why the Justice Department would even be interested in this offer for them to come back on a voluntary basis, under \"supervision\" by Trump lawyers, when they really should have found everything that they were looking for in the August search.",

And so presumably, they have sources of information, and they have methods of gathering information that would, we would think, clue them in if something drastic like that was happening. I mean, the former President really has harmed himself in terms of his legal culpability over the course of this investigation by not cooperating up until this point, by dragging it out and obstructing until the point that the Justice Department felt compelled and had to go get the search warrant in August.

That may be why they have suspicions they are missing documents.   I don't think Trump is inclined to play nice, and I don't think you can trust him playing nice.

Now on the Democratic side, an outside group today released an ad attacking Johnson over his comments over January 6, but that has not been a major focus of the Democratic campaign. In fact, I asked Mandela Barnes why they have not chose to focus on that issue. Instead, he said we want to focus on other issues like economic ones instead.But Democrats still believe there is a path to victory here that Marquette University polled that has Barnes done by six points tested likely voters when it tested a larger set of voters registered voters. It showed the race and a dead even race. So, Democrats hope if they can get their voters to the polls, they still have a path. You know, Johnson seems to have traction at this point in the campaign.

Now, it's not as bad as martial law in those Ukrainian regions. But there's always that groundwork that's now been laid, there's every possibility that if the circumstances require it, or demand it from the point of view of the Kremlin, they could always expand martial law to those border areas, and potentially across the rest of the country as well.

Those were quite different. short lived and they were more about the economy. But they're all reporting firsthand. These terrifying tactics used by the authorities, Anderson. They're not only being shot out when they're out on the streets, they're beaten up. They say they're detained, tortured for days on imaginable torture. And they're coerced into signing confession, saying that they've been paid by the U.S., the UK and Israel to create chaos in Iran. And then they're released but it doesn't stop there. They say that they're watched for years, and they're threatened. This one man we spoke to who is a protester in 2019, he says authorities continue to harass him. They freeze his bank account at times and sometimes they call him threatening to kill his children and rape his wife. And he's out on the streets again, protesting this time with his children.
