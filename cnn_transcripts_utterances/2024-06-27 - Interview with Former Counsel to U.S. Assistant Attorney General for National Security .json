I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. This weekend, France heads to the polls and the far-right looks set to come out on top. President Emmanuel Macron threw the dice with this snap election after his centrist party was trounced by Marine Le Pen's National Rally in recent European parliamentary elections. Correspondent Melissa Bell has more on how Le Pen has reshaped the party's dark origins into an apparently palatable mainstream alternative. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was, for France's national rally, a historic win. The European elections marked the first time the hard right had won a poll nationally. Now, with the party's campaigning for seats in France's parliament and a shot at government. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The party was long demonized. But that's the work that Marine Le Pen and her team have managed to do, to show that we are a party capable of governing and a party that is democratic. BELL (voice-over):  No mean feat for a woman who inherited the party from her father, the Holocaust denier Jean-Marie Le Pen, who founded the National Rally or National Front as it was known, with former French members of Hitler's SS. A history steeped in fascism that was credited with long keeping the party from power, even when it got close. France is a country, after all, heavily marked by the horrors of Nazi Germany.",

BELL (voice-over):  The village, frozen in time, left exactly as it was on that fateful day 80 years ago, in order for the world to remember. But in the new village, rebuilt after the war, the European elections saw the National Rally come first here too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Here the National Rally did a big score like in other rural communities. Times have changed, the means of communication are no longer the same, societal issues have evolved too, and there's been a detoxification of the extremes, of the far-right. BELL (voice-over):  The key also for the National Rally, the young, who voted massively in favor of a party that few in the past would have admitted voting for, but that has now gained something that long eluded it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Legitimacy, that's it. We're no longer ostracized. We're taken seriously. They said that 30 percent of French voted for us. French people who love their country, who don't want to see it change and get eaten by globalization. BELL (voice-over):  A message that looks set to resonate in a parliamentary poll that could see the National Rally gain, not just legitimacy, but power itself. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, Justice Jackson and Justice Alito, in the pieces that they wrote, both said that they think that the Supreme Court should have actually resolved what the conflict in this case was, which was whether or not the federal law preempts or should hold over the Idaho law. Both of them would come to complete opposite decisions as to how that would be resolved. But they both wrote that they thought it should have been resolved.

And we know that there are at least two cases affecting the former president. One is the immunity case, which is significant to him and to the institution of the presidency, whether a president is immune from prosecution. And then there's another case which pertains to obstruction, which would affect, not only Former President Trump, because if the court agrees with the petitioner in that case, it could potentially dismiss two of the counts against Former President Trump. And it also would affect hundreds of the cases of individuals prosecuted in connection with January 6th.

And the howling has got louder and louder, especially onMarine Le Pen, who sought power more aggressively than her father, previous leader did. And I think that there's a resentment against Paris that's built into it. That's a very big part of it. So, France, like the U.K., is a country with a wealthy capital that's sucking in investments and jobs, that sucks in young ambitious people. And France is a country where people farmed for millennia. And that kind of died in the last 80 years. So, a lot of the French territory is abandoned, and people feel left -- abandoned by the republic. There's no bus services, there's no post office, there's no doctor, there's no school, and that's part of this enormous resentment against Paris, and Macron has become the embodiment of that. And then, there's a great discomfort about immigration. I think the French are more uncomfortable about immigration on average than the British. And the far-right expresses that.",

Jean-Marie Le Pen, as you say, was an explicit antisemite who repeatedly said, the Holocaust is a detail of history. And that just went too far for most French people. They couldn't vote for somebody who recalled the kind of pro-Nazi Vichy regime. And Marine Le Pen has sanitized that part of the party. She doesn't do antisemitism. She says she loves Jews. Her focus is against Islam. So, she's removed that link with the World War II past that was just a bridge too far for many voters. She kind of has presented a party that's against Islam, that's against broadly African immigration, but doesn't have that kind of pro-Nazi tinged to it.

So, it's led by the six principles that were outlined by Martin Luther King in a famous essay, \"A Pilgrimage to Nonviolence.\" And I want to play a little bit of Harry himself in the documentary talking about it.

You know, last year you joined us on the program.

      "sentences": "Yes. And I think that the interesting part of this story is the way in which most of these laws aretargeted at trans people specifically. And while there are fewer than passed last year, that's for two main reasons, Hari. The first is that roughly now, half the states in the United States have some sort of anti- trans legislation on the books, either sports or medical care or some other aspect. So, that first wave of bills has been largely, sadly successful. And so, what's happening now is what? I've seen in my reporting on this over the last five years is that there's some years that there's experimentation on new types of laws. And we're seeing that this year, such as a law in Tennessee, which criminalizes parents or caretakers who wish to provide gender-affirming care for their teens outside of the state. They now can face criminal liability from the state, or the fact that even in Missouri, for example, you know, chosen names and also preferred pronouns, even if parents consent to that, schools are not allowed to recognize either of those. And if a school individual does, they can be prosecuted as a felon and made to be put on the sex registry list and then lose their license. So, I think what we're seeing is the laws being more insidious. And there's even another one in Florida that also allows for the transfer of custody in cases where there is one parent who is trans affirming, the other one is not, it can be the basis to transfer custody of the kid to the parent who is not trans supporting, and that even applies for people visiting outside of the state. So, the laws are getting more invasive in the most intimate and sacred of relationships.",

And the reason why that is the case is because the organizations in the United States, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom, are global in nature as well. They have chapters in the United Kingdom and in Hungary and elsewhere. And one of the things that is emerging, for example, and I've heard people who are in the trans community in France, tell me that increasingly they are seeing the exact same rhetoric and the exact same approach that's used in the United States now be picked up by far-right French politicians in a way that did not exist two years ago, for example. And so much so that there was actually a nationwide protest in every single department in France last month by trans people to underscore the -- their visibility and their essential need for rights. The other thing that we need to understand is that in other places, such as Africa, a lot of the anti-LGBTQ legislation there is also supported by religious institutions in the United States who are sending know-how and talking points and even cash to help generate support amongst legislators, in Ghana, for example. So, we have to understand that what is happening here is changing and toxifying the climate around the world. And it's something that I don't think that we pay enough attention to.",

The same is true for President Xi in China, who also, you know, goes after what he says are girly men in China, and that they are bringing down the Chinese state, and that people need to act in a more masculine way. And we also have to say that the anti-trans push in the United States began legislatively and administratively during the Trump administration. And we have a political party in the United States now, which is devotedly anti- trans.
