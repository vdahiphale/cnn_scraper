(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (voice-over):  Messina Denaro was last seen publicly in 1993, shortly before he went into hiding after he was convicted in absentia for the assassinations of anti-mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, both killed in separate targeted bombings in 1992. Police have been searching for him ever since. Messina Denaro is thought to have led the Cosa Nostra mafia in Sicily since the arrest of his predecessor, Bernardo Provenzano, who was captured near the infamous Sicilian town of Corleone in 2006. Messina Denaro has multiple convictions for murder, including the kidnapping and death of a 12-year-old boy whose body was dissolved in acid.

So when there's a disaster, farmers usually have a safety net to fall back on that provides payments of an insurance program they paid into.Now, when we think of specialty crops, like fruits and vegetables, much of that acreage is uninsured. There's not a lot of good programs to protect specialty crops -- fruits and vegetables -- against disasters because of how small and thin those markets are traded on. There's not a good data pricing set for farmers to -- and insurance companies to provide insurance. So much of those farmers don't have insurance so they really fall back on ad-hoc disaster assistance programs. We know recently, the omnibus bill passed -- $3.7 billion in additional disaster aid. But that's only for 2022 losses, not for 2023. So these farmers are going to wait a long time before they receive any aid, and don't have a lot of risk management options to fall back on.",

This means that the lower valleys can rely on a more steady stream of water.The bad news is there is a lot of water management districts in California that still don't have any drought mitigation plans in place -- most of them just for strict water use and decreased food production in times of drought. They should be being more -- a little bit more proactive when we have this much moisture in collecting that rain for off-year storage.
