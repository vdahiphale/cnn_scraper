Does he have a knowledge of what's happening in this review of the hijab law, which should become public within a couple of weeks?But this notion that the government is trying to sort of change its tack if you little -- if you will, and take some sting out of the protests on the streets, through changing the hijab law. If that's what -- if that's really what happens and we don't know that at the moment is really vague and ambiguous as the State Department describes it. Is that -- is that what he's doing? We just don't know that. It really isn't clear, Kate.",

The lava flow is now about two miles away from the road but so far officials have no plans to try to redirect it. David Culver has more for us from Hawaii.DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Kate, as the lava is crawling closer to where we are, we're even starting to smell the sulfur in the air. Now, the view from here pretty striking with that lava glow but to give you an even better look, we go higher. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (voiceover): We go up in the morning dark.

Those acidic gases dangerous if the concentration levels are too high. That's 2 to 3 thousand degrees Fahrenheit or about 1000 degrees Celsius. That's molten rock, flowing like water. Which has already crossed one volcano road power, lines in all a searing slice right through it.It's incredible the heat you feel as soon as you get close to it. Look at this. The rushing flow like a river. You see the current of lava. Darren estimates it's moving 30 to 40 miles per hour. But this -- the source of it all, I mean there's nothing like this just spewing from the top. (END VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (on camera): It is incredible to be up there in person, Kate. Now the lava flowing way up there about 15 miles from where we are, moving really fast. As it gets closer to where we are, it is slowing down, starting to fan out as it hits flatland, moving much slower at some 40 feet per hour. Still, though it is inching closer to that major highway.

Dan, thanks for coming on the show.The lava as my colleague who's on the ground said it's just about two miles from a major highway. And CNN heard from some experts who say it's unlikely there's going to be any attempt to redirect the lava flow. Is that what you would expect? I mean, what would that even entail trying to redirect it? DR. MATT PATRICK, VOLCANOLOGIST, USGS HAWAIIAN VOLCANO OBSERVATORY: Yes, that's really a decision for Hawaii County civil defense on what kind of measures that can take in that regard. But lava diversion has had a tricky history. It's worked in some cases in Italy, but in many other cases, it hasn't. It's particularly tricky on shallow slopes like we have here. So, yes, that's really a decision for Hawaii County civil defense. They'd be working with Hawaiian Volcano Observatory where I work to try to figure that out if they decide that's something that they want to do. But I -- yes, that's -- it's -- that really hasn't gotten to that point at this point.",

And in that letter of resignation, she says that it was a horrible personal mistake. And you know not too long ago, she released another statement in which she says she understands why some folks may think she mishandled that situation but it was never her intent. And points to that moment in which she asks if the officer has his camera on to say that she knew she was being recorded, a very different take from the city of Tampa. They also released the internal affairs report in which they say that she violated Tampa Police policy and even say that she compromised her ethics and professionalism. Let me read with you a statement from the mayor in which the mayor says \"it is unacceptable for any public employee and especially the city's top law enforcement leader to ask for special treatment because of their position. Public Trust in Tampa's Police Department is paramount to our success as a city as well as a community.\" So, now what? Well, Mary O'Connor says that she offered to pay any sort of potential fine or citation associated with that traffic stop. This investigation has been complete. And now Tampa is looking for a new police chief. There is now a national search but no telling yet the timeline or the deadline of when a new police chief will be chosen, Kate.",
