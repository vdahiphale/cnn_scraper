We have no idea how the 12 jurors in that room are taking Todd Blanche's closing arguments as he is getting out -- he's about hitting the two-hour mark. And he said he expected you to go about two and a half hours or so when they spoke to the judge earlier. So, he is in the homestretch of his argument.I will say we do expect President Biden to weigh in himself, not just his campaign surrogates and allies on this verdict once the jury has reached it. That will be a really notable moment as well because regardless of the outcome of this, it is going to have some kind of political impact. We just don't know which way.",

Right now, there is more breaking legal news involving former President Donald Trump this time in a different case, the classified documents case in Florida. A federal judge has rejected the request from Special Counsel Jack Smith. He requested a gag order against Donald Trump. Let's bring in CNN's Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, tell us more about this ruling, which came just moments ago.KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes, Jake. So, prosecutors from the Special Counsel's Office at the Justice Department are not going to be able to limit Donald Trump's speech about law enforcement, who were part of that Mar-a-Lago search in August of 2022 at this time because they didn't follow the proper procedure. That's what Judge Aileen Cannon just said moments ago. The prosecutors had gone to her on Friday, in the evening, right before the holiday week, asking her to put limitations on what Donald Trump could say because he was out there talking misleadingly about the FBI policies around the use of deadly force, a policy that was standard and in place for that search of the resort in Florida. But Trump was trying to say that he was in danger because of it. That was not true. So, the prosecutors wanted to protect the proceedings, protect their own officers, and have a gag order. They felt that it was a very dangerous situation, so they went to the judge. Trump's team though, took issue with this because they said they didn't have enough time to think about this and to respond and meaningfully work with the prosecutors to provide some sort of meet and confer, that's what they say, in court. And so, Judge Cannon today agreed with Trump's team. She said this was professional -- unprofessional and not courteous in the way that the Justice Department went about this coming to her with the gag order request that anything in the future, they need to have more time given to the defense team. And so, she's denying. They could always try again. But as of now, no gag order for Trump in the Florida case.",

Meaning, you just have to do the prosecutor, you have to call up the defense lawyer and try to work out amongst yourself some meaningful exchange of ideas. And Judge Cannon said, well, you didn't do that so go back and give them a call.It's quite clear Donald -- where Donald Trump's team is at, right? They're not going to agree to anything.

I mean, these making arguments that easily, if I'm the prosecutor, I'm writing down saying, OK, you say, where is Allen Weisselberg? Where is -- why didn't he testify? Where is Mr. Schiller? Why didn't he testify?If I'm the prosecution I'd say, these are people who are friendly to Donald Trump. If they had anything to say that was positive, then you would expect that Donald Trump would call them as a witness. And he did it again just now when he -- when he made this argument is why weren't they buying the story in April? What was happening? Why did it take so long? Well, that just buys into the whole prosecution theory because it wasn't until right before the election that they cared. That makes it criminal, right, because it's about the election. And so, I think they just are really kind of missing what their strong arguments are and making arguments that the prosecution I think has a much better explanation for. And it really just plays into the whole prosecution theory. LAURA COATES, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: And don't forget, Access Hollywood is still this elephant in the room. I mean, the timing of all this, what would have been the straw that broke the political camel's back? The defense wants the jury to look at all this in a vacuum. That's virtually impossible to do because there's evidence it's already come in and these people were all living in the real world around probably the same time this is happening. So, you have these issues about the softballs that Karen spoke about, but also, they're trying to plant the seeds of doubt. It is very reasonable for the defense to say, here's who you did not hear from. You didn't hear from Allen Weisselberg. You didn't hear from Mr. Schiller. You didn't hear from Dylan Howard. Why not? They want that lingering question as to why not to suggest that the prosecution could not have made their case without them and did not. But they went to such great lengths throughout the duration of this trial to pre-corroborate the testimony of Michael Cohen. The prosecution kept there and said this was not coming down to just the testimony of Michael Cohen. It's coming down to all the documents that supported it in advance those who are friendly to Trump, those who are not friendly to Trump. They all had some bite at the apple to try to corroborate Michael Cohen's testimony. And so, when you come back and the -- and the prospect doesn't have to do something about this, they can say it didn't -- it never came down Michael Cohen. It came down to all of the different people who testified in advance of his testimony about why you should believe him. It can't just be the documents -- it can't just be him. It's the documents.",

Welcome back to our live coverage of the hush money cover-up trial, now in the final stretch. I want to bring in Criminal Defense Attorney Bill Brennan. He represented Donald Trump's payroll Corporation in a tax fraud trial and Trump himself in his second impeachment trial. Bill, it's good to see you this morning. I'm wondering what you make of Todd Blanche's closing arguments so far. WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, FORMER TRUMP PAYROLL CORP. ATTORNEY: Good morning, Anderson. Well, he's in a tough spot because he's got a lot of ground to cover in a relatively short amount of time. I think he said he's going to try to keep it down to two and a half. And, you know, when you think of the length of this trial and the number of witnesses, that's really not a lot of time. The lion's share, if you're doing say, an eight-slice pizza pie, six of those slices should probably be reserved for Michael Cohen.

Unlike a civil case, there's absolutely no obligation for the defense to do anything. So, I think it's smart to hammer as hard as you can, where's Weisselberg? Why didn't hear from Weisselberg? There's all this talk of this document with these numbers on it allegedly written by Weisselberg, why didn't the prosecution put him up here? And then you -- if you could tie that into Cohen's admitted testimony that he stole $60,000 from his client, which is noted on that document, that testimony may not have eviscerated the document, but it certainly tainted.

She had signed a nondisclosure agreement, the same nondisclosure agreement that they're not even disputing that she struck with Michael Cohen and with Donald Trump. That is why she said she did not speak out publicly. She was not allowed to speak out publicly.And we also watched how closely between the testimony from Keith Davidson, the attorney on her behalf who negotiated that agreement, and Michael Cohen about just how closely they were coordinating. Michael Cohen who was booking Stormy Daniels on Trump -- one of Trump's favorite shows on Fox News, Sean Hannity show. It was ultimately canceled, and she did not go. But they were coordinating how she was speaking, what she was saying publicly. They talked about how they were all kind of in a tizzy when she was going to go on Jimmy Kimmel's Late-Night Show. And she put out a new denial that day that she and Jimmy Kimmel spoke about in the interview. But it was at the close coordination of Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. Donald Trump was furious when all of these stories were becoming public and was calling Michael Cohen. Michael Cohen was then in turn calling Keith Davidson. And so, they have a long history. The jury at least knows why that happened.",

Let's talk more about this because right now, Todd Blanche, the attorney for Donald Trump is saying -- picking back up with Stormy Daniels. \"Ms. Daniels has denied that there was ever any sex with President Trump in 2018 and earlier, but the government wants you to believe those statements were coerced.\"Blanche questions Daniels' statements saying she was threatened in 2011 and that's why she went public. Blanche is now playing more of the recordings between Davidson and Cohen where Keith Davidson, who was the attorney for Stormy Daniels said that sometimes people get settler's remorse. Todd Blanche says at the end of the day, what really happened is that somebody offered more money to Ms. Daniels. So, Kasie, what's going on here is he is providing an alternate theory of the case about whether or not Stormy Daniels and Donald Trump actually had some sort of rendezvous in that hotel room in Nevada in 2006. Todd Blanche, somebody offered her to pay her legal fees if she got out of the NDA she signed with Mr. Cohen. And again-- and this is not unusual. I know the attorneys are going to tell me this. But like when you have a rogue's gallery of unreliable narrators, each one of whom you know cannot -- have been -- you know, hasn't always told the truth. Stormy Daniels has signed at least two documents saying she did not have a rendezvous with Donald Trump. It's tough to -- it's tough to stake a case on it. He's saying right now. This started as an extortion, Todd Blanche says. There's no doubt about that. And it ended very well for Ms. Daniels, financially speaking, Blanche said. Trump has turned his chair 90 degrees, so he is facing Blanche, and the jury which we're told is unusual. Their goal was to make as much money as possible off of President Trump, Blanche says.",
