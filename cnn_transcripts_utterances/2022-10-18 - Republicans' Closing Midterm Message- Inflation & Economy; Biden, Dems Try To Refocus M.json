      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. This hour, President Biden looks to change the midterm trajectory. Three weeks exactly from election day. The president will promise new federal efforts to promote abortion rights, but also make clear, he needs Democrats in charge of Congress to succeed.Plus, the Trump tapes. CNN exclusively obtains recordings from a new audio book. Over the course of 20 interviews, the former president brags about his nuclear button, says he respects Vladimir Putin, and more. And democracy is always on the ballot, but this year is very different. Three Republicans who might win House seats were at Trump's January 6 rally, and a red state Republican senator who tried to help Trump hold power takes heat at a campaign debate. Any moment now, we will hear directly from the president of the United States. His goal today to shake up the final three weeks of the midterm campaign by focusing on abortion right. The president's remarks, we are told will include a new promise to open next year with legislation that would guarantee the right to an abortion. The why is clear. Exactly three weeks now to election day, Democrats see a summer surge slipping away. Last night appear of primetime debates in important battleground Ohio and Georgia. Both Democratic candidates raising abortion rights in those debates, warning if Republicans are in charge of Congress or your state house, then abortion rights are in danger. Close statewide races of course, tend to be one of the suburbs, where Democrats believe the abortion issue does break their way. But Republicans believe the economy and inflation matter more to most voters. Listen here, this is the Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp on Fox this morning after his debate with Democrat Stacey Abrams last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): People here are concerned about 40-year high inflation. I saw where you heard where you guys saying President Obama was coming down here. I wonder why Joe Biden isn't, is because his policies are very unpopular. It's called 40-year high inflation to disaster, the gas pump, a disaster the border. And these are the policies that Stacey Abrams supports. I mean, she wanted to be his vice presidential candidate. And these are the policies that she would bring to Georgia and we're fighting against that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Audie Cornish, CNN's Melanie Zanona, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs of The New York Times. Shifting our cameras around, we'll get you all on television as quickly as we can hear.So, who's right? Who's right, you just heard Governor Abrams there. He's going to focus on economy, on jobs, on inflation, on the incumbent presidents on popularity. The president today is going to urge voters, assure you're probably worried about the economy, inflation, but don't forget about abortion rights. In your newspaper, New York Times/Siena College poll published this yesterday. What voters care about most, the economy 26 percent, inflation 18 percent, abortion 5 percent. So, if we went back to right after the Dobbs decision, abortion might be higher, or the president is trying to push it up some. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Right, trying to push it up. This has been a messaging sort of strategy that we've seen from the White House, from Dems across the country. Really, since that decision, the dynamic here and the challenge for the White House, for President Biden, even today for Democrats is going to be, can you still galvanize the base, even past the immediate weeks of that decision. Even when the economy and some day-to-day issues, high gas prices, they are rising again, as well, continuing to be at the top of voters' minds. It's no doubt if you listen to the White House, if you listen Democrats, if you listen to public health officials, that this is a decision that impacts so many lives, as well. And that is a factor as well and continuing to speak about this as well to not just make it a referendum on the administration. But a choice between what the Democrats are saying is a party that seeks to take away these rights, seeks to directly threaten the health of individuals, and one that seeks to actually codify this law as well.",

      "sentences": "Well, Ryan, not surprisingly competitive, if you watch the debate all the way through, actually, there was a very good showing for him against J. D. Vance. But one thing, these elections are specifically about consequences, and you push on any issue in which a person can feel direct consequences.And while we're spending a lot of time talking about how Democrats are talking about abortion, the broader context is how Republicans are talking about abortion. If they are talking about national bands, if they at the state level are talking about more restrictions, that is also context for the typical voter. And so, it is easier for a Democrat to go out and say, what could happen, because the very next commercial is someone saying, this is what should happen. And it's the same thing in a way with crime, you know, Republicans, many of which are in districts where the violence rates are a little bit higher than the kind of blue cities, they claim are the problem. They turn on the TV at night, and they see local news, talking about crime. And that is the context which those commercials are airing. KANNO-YOUNGS: That's a fascinating point, too, because you saw that last point come up and in the debate in Georgia as well. Abrams actually taking a bit of a different line than sort of the national party by saying, look, you have overseeing, Governor Kemp has overseen this rise in crime, Governor Kemp has overseen this rise in housing prices. You know, Kemp as well trying to take a bit more of a positive or relay a positive perception and saying, well, look, we're doing well here, while his national party actually attacks Democrats over defunding the police, and which, again, for the White House, that is not true. The president has come out and says, he's funding it. But it was interesting to see both of those candidates take opposite lines of messaging---",

If you're an incumbent Republican governor, it's a little bit more complicated because yes, you can blame Joe Biden, you know, say the national economies is fault, say inflation is his fault. It's more complicated than that. It's a global issue, but he's in charge. That's the way politics works. But on an issue like crime, let's listen this is Kemp and Abrams.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KEMP: My question for Miss Abrams tonight is how many Democrat or how many sheriffs statewide publicly endorsed your campaign, but Miss Abrams refused to answer the question. So, I'll let you know that the answer is zero. No sheriffs are endorsing her statewide because of her stances on wanting to defund the police.",

One way they've done that is, try to recognize crime is a problem.And a lot of these places, but it's not because necessarily of what Republicans are accusing Democrats of it's because of the guns that have flooded the streets. So, they've really tried to thread the needle between some of the policies that they're pushing in terms of trying to crack down on guns and enact stricter gun control, while also recognizing the problem of crime.",

It began yesterday and they turned out in record numbers. More than 131 people casting ballots in person early voting, that compares to just 70,000 in the last midterm election back in 2018.

I hate to tell Ryan, but those people need to know just because you voted early, doesn't mean in your house the ads are going to play. The ads will still play when you come into your house.But to that point, you see those lines there, early voting was something that worked to the Democratic advantage in 2020, because you get a couple extra weeks to turn out your vote. You don't have to do it on election day. Donald Trump was screaming, don't vote early, the system's rigged. I don't trust the process. And that hurt Republicans, including many would argue in the state of Georgia and elsewhere. There're going to be interesting this time without Trump in the White House, without Trump saying that, do more Republicans come out and participate earlier in this midterm year.
