Women can continue to take it up to 10 weeks pregnant. They can continue to receive it by mail and via telehealth visits with their health care providers. And the generic version will remain widely available. So this is exactly what the Biden administration and the FDA, what they were asking for. They warned that, if there were restrictions imposed on this drug, that there would just be confusion and chaos. So now this chaos is being averted. So the question is, where does this go from here? The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will be hearing arguments on the underlying issue in this case. And that is whether the FDA properly approved mifepristone in 2000. The first briefings in this appeal actually must be filed the 5th Circuit next week. And the case will be fast tracked with these arguments set for less than a month from now on May 17th. But really, regardless what the 5th Circuit decides, any possible changes to this drug are being put on hold indefinitely by the Supreme Court decision, so women can continue to fully access mifepristone until the Supreme Court acts again at some point, which wouldn't be for months, if at all -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

So while abortion rights supporters are celebrating Friday's victory, they're still preparing for what comes next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BARBARA LEE (D-CA): It's safe and, again, it's the prominent method of abortions. And so we need to keep this in place. We need to not let politicians and judges try to make it illegal.

SUZANNE GILBERG-LENZ, OB-GYN, WOMEN'S CARE OF BEVERLY HILLS: Well, I mean, nothing would surprise me at this point to be perfectly honest. I'm relieved but I think, like everybody else is saying, I'm tentatively relieved because this is far from over. How we feel is the way we felt yesterday and the way we felt six months ago and that is that we really have entered into a period of serious decline when it comes to what we are able to provide and the safety that we're able to assure our patients that they can have for this extremely important and needed medical procedure.

But having said that, if a federal ban was to put be put into place, I would actually be unable to secure the medication. And at this time, this medicine is so strictly regulated in a way that is so obviously political. This is not a medication that I can write a prescription for and have a patient fill it at the pharmacy. So I, as the provider, have to stock this in the office. And as soon as it started happening a couple weeks ago, I went to our office administrator to make sure that we had enough supplies available for the foreseeable future. It's very -- it's been very, very disconcerting and very concerning because, of course, my job and my life's purpose has been to take care of women and to keep them safe. And when I can't even have tools that are FDA approved and legal in the state that I practice, to keep my patients safe, I really -- I don't even know what to say.

GILBERG-LENZ: It's really had a very, very negative impact. And I have to say it's not newly impacting us. Any of us who provide abortions have been dealing with threats to our lives and our livelihoods for the entire time that I've been in practice. I think the issue here is that people, the public has become more aware of what is really going on. So for a lot of people who lived in large cities where they had access to care, they really weren't aware of how difficult it has been in this country. For the entire time that I've been in practice, I remember in medical school learning that 85 percent of counties in the United States at the time in the '90s did not have abortion services available. So actually, this is not news to those of us providing care. What's happened is that I've seen terrible things happening in Los Angeles, where people have access, people not understanding what is available to them, people making poor decisions, people not getting care on time, people being afraid to ask for help, even in a state where it remains legal. There's been a lot of confusion. And I have dealt with things this year that I have never seen in my career, complications that never needed to happen. You know, threats to people's lives and health. It's very, very serious. So this isn't a place where people actually still have access, it's so my colleagues in other states and places like Texas, Alabama, et cetera, they are suffering and patients are suffering. And women are being harmed. The obfuscation of the safety issue with this particular lawsuit is insanity. The safety data is there. It is -- the FDA doesn't approve medications, especially medications like this, that are fraught politically without a lot of safety data. The safety data is there and this is an incredibly safe medication and, in fact, pregnancy itself is far less safe than having a medical abortion. So the lawsuit is really frivolous when it comes to science and medicine. It's disgusting.",

But so far the agreement has failed to completely stop the fighting.Civilians reported more clashes on the first day of the truce, which aligned with the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. The U.N. says the clashes on Friday killed one staff member from its migration agency and overall the organization is reporting more than 400 deaths since the fighting began last week. Meantime, the Red Cross says the violence has prevented the group from delivering much needed aid and it's urging both sides to grant it immediate humanitarian access. Earlier, Sudan's paramilitary fighters announced they were ready to partially reopen airports nationwide. They said this would allow other countries to safely evacuate their citizens. The U.S. is making preparations to evacuate diplomatic personnel from Sudan but a final decision has not been made yet. The White House says they are closely monitoring the volatile situation in the country and that preparations are ongoing for a potential evacuation. The State Department confirmed to CNN that a U.S. national has died in Sudan, although the circumstances around their death were not provided. The White House warned on Friday that private citizens should not expect the U.S. government to get them out of Sudan. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: When it comes to Sudan, this is a warning, a level four warning that we provided to them many months ago, basically telling Americans who were there to leave if they could and also not to travel, Americans not to travel to Sudan.

They're putting the resources in place to potentially carry out an evacuation of the U.S. diplomats who are in the country. They haven't made a decision to do that at this point. And one, of course, of the challenging factors here is the fact that there is this ongoing violence on the ground. So State Department officials are watching closely to see if the ceasefire that has agreed to can actually be implemented on the ground. So far, that has not actually been the case. And we know that the State Department is also not planning at this time for the evacuation of American citizens or in the country. There are about 16,000 Americans who are there. Of course, many of those are joint U.S. -- Sudanese American citizens. And we heard from a State Department deputy spokesperson earlier today that those Americans should not be expecting any coordinated U.S. evacuation at this time. So we're continuing to watch that space. They said that the State Department has been in touch with hundreds of Americans who are in Sudan -- Kylie Atwood, CNN, the State Department.

On Friday, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg reaffirmed that Ukraine will become a NATO member. But he didn't give any timeline. In response, Moscow described a NATO membership as a carrot the alliance dangles in front of Kyiv so it would keep fighting against Russia. Moscow also called Stoltenberg's statement \"dangerous\" and said it could lead to the collapse of Europe's security system. Russia has made it clear that one of its military goals is to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. Dominic Raab resigns as British deputy prime minister following reports of bullying.

CNN was the first to report last summer that the investigation was intensifying and that it had narrowed down to just a few charges, including some potential tax crimes and at least one charge of false statements related to the purchase of a gun. Now nothing has happened, though. Since last year in the recent months, we've also seen Hunter Biden's legal team become a lot more aggressive and forward leaning in their strategy, also becoming a lot more litigious. Now they're about to have another legal, potentially political problem as well on Capitol Hill, now that a potential whistleblower has come forward, writing to lawmakers, saying that he is an IRS agent who has overseen part of the Biden probe. This individual alleges that he has evidence that this has been mishandled, that there has been political interference and even alleges that this individual has evidence that would contradict testimony by attorney general Merrick Garland, who has vowed that there would not be any political interference in this investigation. But at this point, it is important to note this individual has not been granted whistleblower protections.

For example, the shooter purchased this gun legally on Tuesday, April 4th. That was less than a week before the shooting. And in Kentucky, the law only required that he filled out an ATF form and that he pass an FBI records check. What's in that records check?

Now the police say that community members told them in the very early hours of the morning on Friday they heard multiple gunshots in that zone of Pietermaritzburg, in KZN province.The police did go to inspect several gunmen who were suspected in being involved. An entire family, say police, were killed; 10 people in that shooting, the youngest being a 13 year old boy; the oldest, according to police, over 60. The police minister said that the quick work of community members to give a tipoff to police led them to several suspects they think may be linked to the shootings. They killed one in a action against the police or in their firing between the police and the suspects and they managed to arrest two. One got away. It's unclear what the motive of the shooting is and, in South Africa, there have been several shootings like this or similar to this in recent months, both in that province and other provinces. I have to say, in recent reporting across the country and particularly in Johannesburg, where I am based, there has been a sense by community members that they feel the police cannot help them in many instances with the levels of violent crime in this country, particularly with the resources that the police have. The leadership of the police, again on Friday, said that they are doing their best and are looking to increase resources. But the murder rates in South Africa in last year was extremely high, more than 25,000 people in murders that the police know about. This is in a country already dealing with high levels of violent crime -- David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
