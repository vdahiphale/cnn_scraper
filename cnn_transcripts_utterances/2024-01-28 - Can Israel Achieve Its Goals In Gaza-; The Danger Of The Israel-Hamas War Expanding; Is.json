It should be noted this is not a ruling confirming South Africa's allegation that Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide, and the court notably stopped short of calling for a cease-fire.The court will continue to hear South Africa's arguments and Israel's defense in a trial that could take years. Meanwhile, CIA chief Bill Burns is in Europe to meet with top Israeli and Qatari officials to try to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas that could lead to hostage releases and a potential cease-fire. Joining me now is retired U.S. Army General Mark Hertling, who is a national security and military analyst for CNN, and Robin Wright is a contributing writer for \"The New Yorker\" and a distinguished fellow at the Wilson Center. Mark, let me begin by asking you, Israel has this international pressure to either cease or scale back its operations substantially. There's also fears of a widening war. In the midst of all this, is Israel achieving its objectives which Bibi Netanyahu keeps saying is the total destruction of Hamas? You know, that's the military objective. I'm not quite sure what the political objective is. And I just want to hear from you from a military point of view, are they succeeding and can they succeed? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Fareed, indicators right now state that Israel has disabled about 20 percent to 30 percent of the Hamas network so far. The early comments about destroying Hamas, destroying an ideology we've talked about, but what the Israeli military has done is destroyed a significant portion of the terrorist network in Gaza. But it's fascinating because from the standpoint of time and alliances, time is not on Israel's side. Hamas is using time as part of their strategy, as well as using the underground tunnels which is -- which are built underneath the civilian population to draw Israel in. So this is something that really puts the Israeli military at a disadvantage while they do try and destroy the Hamas infrastructure. They've got a long way to go. They cleared a lot of area in northern Gaza but there's still much that remains in the center and in the south.",

Israel on the other hand faces serious political challenges. There is a division inside the country about its military priority. Should it try to free the hostages first and then go after the rest of Hamas, or should it destroy Gaza with the hope that that will eventually lead to the freedom of these human beings.And Hamas has enormous leverage over Israel and the fact that hostages are the largest issue for the Israelis. And it's very hard to see that Hamas is going to release all of these people in some sort of temporary cease-fire because this is the thing -- Hamas would want to hold on to human beings because -- for the long term because that's the way you pressure Israel to do more to release Palestinian prisoners, to allow Hamas to continue to exist in Gaza.",

But those purposefully built tunnels and the knowledge that Hamas has that Israel will continue to use their military advantage to destroy them, and at the same time they can't get to these underground tunnels, and so much effort has been placed in building these tunnels, that it makes it very difficult for Israel to even achieve their complete military objective, much less their strategic objective at destroying Hamas without destroying part of the Palestinian infrastructure throughout Gaza.",

But since October 7th they have all had a kind of common thread. Various conflicts have intersected. For example, before October 7th Hamas and Hezbollah were fighting different conflicts with Israel.They shared a common strategic goal in pressuring Israel or eliminating Israel but they had their own local agendas. The same is true of the Houthis who are fighting civil wars since 2014 and which became regionalized after Saudi Arabia attacked Yemen in 2015. But only after October 7th did you see the Houthis suddenly becoming an international element capable of lopsided leverage over international shipping, 30 percent of which goes through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. And then you have the different American components to it based in Syria and Iraq who are fighting the remnants of the Islamic State. And suddenly you find that the kind of occasional pot shots that the Iranian backed militias in both of those countries would take against American troops being -- kind of merging because of Gaza, in sympathy with Gaza. And then you see the bigger thread that plays out among all of them now that pit the United States against Iran. Ironically, no one wants a bigger war. But there's such a momentum at the moment that it's hard to see how the United States can contain it. Even if there is a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.",

And once the United States backs away, the question is, can Europe compensate? And so far there are indications that it either can't or won't.So there's -- and the problem is that the war in Israel has complicated -- has diverted attention, you know, where are American interests in weaponry?

I watch the daily sit-reps, situation reports from Ukraine, and they seem to be doing very well. And in most areas they've gone on the operational defense which is smart for them for this current situation. They can't attack right now. They don't have the strength.Russia has learned some lessons in the last two years, but they are still in my view ineffective in offensive operations and they're trying to do that. But due to the Russian approach to combat today, they ignore massive casualties and they will continue to bleed their army. The key is how will alliances fit in. Russia has North Korea, Iran and likely China, supporting them with equipment. Ukraine, on the other hand has the United States which as Mitt Romney said it's baffling why we're not continuing to support them because they have done such a great job and they are a partner in freedom and attempting to regain their sovereignty. The truth is, Fareed, right now I think Ukraine is holding their own. But unless there's some relief from the U.S. Congress and others to continue to provide arms and ammunition, it will be troublesome for the rest of 2024. There are some that think they can build the potential for counterattacks and more offensive operations in 2025. But that's a four-year war at that point.",

It's over -- or play chess again. Chess, I think, never been more popular than it is right now. And no one or almost no one watches two AIs play each other. We're like very interested in what humans do. We've had better tools before. But we're still like very focused on each other. And I think we will do things with better tools and I admit it does feel different this time. General purpose cognition feels so close to what we all treasure about humanity that it does feel different. So of course, you know, there will be kind of the human roles where you want another human.

My role is to like, you know, figure out what we're going to do, think about that, and then like work with other people to coordinate and make it happen.

I mean, I believe and I think the world now believes that the benefit here is so tremendous that we should go do this. But I think it is on us to figure out a way to get the input from society about how we're going to make these decisions not only about, you know, what the values of the system are, but what the safety thresholds are and what kind of global coordination we need to ensure that stuff that happens in one country does not super negatively impact another. So, I like that people are nervous about it. We have our owner nervousness. But we believe that we can manage through it.

And I know there's some work going on but it's fairly preliminary.And what I worry about is that that turns it into a black box. You know, that it almost becomes like this god like or religious experience where you just have to have faith. You don't actually know why it's doing what it's doing. Do you think we will figure that out or is it just so complicated that it's not ever going to be something human beings can understand?",

We've got the idea that, you know, in the rich world when you're pregnant they scan you with an ultrasound but it's an expensive instrument, and a highly trained technician. By taking A.I. and looking at lots and lots of pregnancies, and seeing which came out well and which didn't, we can use this for less than $1.00 per delivery and warn a woman, OK, you should go to the hospital because you're going to have a complex delivery. Or it looks good, you can just stay out in your community. And so, this is going to save, you know, 50,000 lives a year as it gets rolled out.",

So, we need to get ready to take advantage of that, minimize the problems.The actual delivery things, at least for this next decade, we do have headwinds. Financial headwinds, distraction but, you know, the moral importance of getting these things out to everyone, hopefully, will allow things like raising money for Gavi to still succeed despite the turmoil.",
