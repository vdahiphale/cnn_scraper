A live look for you outside the Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C. where right now, the federal grand jury investigating Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results is meeting. Trump received a target letter, as you know, weeks ago. So any day the grand jury meets could be the day they issue an indictment. In the classified documents case where Trump has already been charged. CNN has learned that the Special Counsel has obtained new surveillance footage from the former President's Mar-a-Lago resort -- resort. According to a court filing, the video was obtained after the initial indictment was handed up in early June. That footage is connected to the new obstruction charges brought against Donald Trump, Walt Nauta and their new co-defendant, Carlos De Oliveira.

They now could be presented with that indictment and asked to vote on it related to the former President Donald Trump's actions when he was president after the 2020 election leading up to and on January 6.So the reason we say that it could happen at any moment now is because this grand jury is in today. This is the grand jury that has been investigating January 6 and the 2020 election, with the being ushered through this investigation by the Special Counsel's office appointed to specifically look at Trump and others at high levels of the Trump administration, the political environment. And they have been investigating this for several months. And then Donald Trump got a target letter just two weeks ago thereabouts saying that he was very likely to be charged by this grand jury on at least three charges, three substantial charges, conspiracy, obstruction, and a deprivation of rights charge. If there would be more that is possible, we don't know if there would be additional defendants. We don't know when the grand jury would be asked to approve this. But we're now in that window where they very could well be gathering to hear what the indictment would be, and it could be handed up through the court system because Donald Trump's defense attorneys did meet with the Special Counsel's office just last Thursday. The grand jury was in that day as well. And they don't seem to have a huge runway ahead of them of witnesses. So we're watching, we're waiting, we're seeing exactly what will happen inside the courthouse here. We have a whole team of people making sure that we're not missing anything that would be public inside this courthouse, Sara. And it is just another possibility of activity after last week was such a busy week, not just in this case, but also with that indictment. Another indictment returned against Donald Trump through the federal system in Florida related to obstruction of justice and the retention of documents after the presidency.

The subpoena for George Chidi, this journalist who had has testified before that he witnessed this meeting of so- called fake electors in the Georgia State House on that day. Why is that important? Why is it important if someone saw this so-called clandestine meeting? There goes Bradley.We're going to -- I'm going to riff for a second. While we try to get his shot back up. But in Georgia, George Chidi, who is this journalist, says he walked into the State House and he saw a meeting of what appeared to be a group of would-be Republican electors meeting in a room. They told him it was an education meeting and they kicked him out. Now, he testified to the special grand jury in Georgia about this first. He says he's been called back and will testify to again in front of a criminal grand jury. That is the Georgia case, where an indictment, frankly, is expected sometime in the next few weeks in Washington D.C. at this moment, a federal grand jury is meeting.

Police wouldn't elaborate on details. We do know, though, that two local Bahamian men were taken into custody. And according to local prosecutors, they agreed to carry out this murder for hire plot on the husband of American Lindsay Shiver on July 16 on the island of Abaco there in the Bahamas. The three suspects were in court on Friday. They did not have to enter a plea. And on social media, it seemed to indicate social media belonging to Lindsay Shiver, that she and her husband, her estranged husband attended Auburn University in the early 2000s. He played football on that team. And the social media looks like they are just a happy church going family. But it was back in April, according to court documents that we obtained, that her husband filed for divorce, citing adulterous conduct of his wife as the reason for that divorce. Lindsay Shiver filed for divorce herself the next day. We have reached out to the attorneys in those divorce proceedings, but we have not yet heard back.

Devon Archer told lawmakers that president Biden spoke to his son's international business associates several times. But over nearly five hours of questioning, he reportedly insisted that Hunter was merely trying to sell the illusion of access and that the President was never actually involved.

They include Jim Jordan, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, James Comer, the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and you know, Jason Smith, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. And look, this is part of a broader investigative pursuit by Republicans in the House, you know, under pressure from Donald Trump to really pursue every avenue possible related to Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. And they've really increased their focus on Hunter Biden specifically trying to tie the President to his son's various legal problems. Now, that's where you get into what happened yesterday behind closed doors when Devon Archer, the former Business Associate of Hunter Biden, testified for over five hours before this Committee and didn't provide any smoking gun evidence connecting the President directly to Hunter Biden's foreign business deals. And going into the hearing, that was the expectation that Republicans set. That was really what they had hoped Devon Archer might provide for them. But ultimately, he did not. So not surprising that we're going to continue to see Republicans, you know, initiate more and more investigations into the President with an eye toward possibly impeaching him. But I want to point out this sound bite from yesterday. Sean Hannity at Fox News was talking to James Comer and Jim Jordan after Devon Archer's testimony.
