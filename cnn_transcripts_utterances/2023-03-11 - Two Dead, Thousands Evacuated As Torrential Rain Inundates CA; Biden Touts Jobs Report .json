I put in something like the second tier Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina and the former ambassador to the U.N. And then candidates who are likely candidates who haven't announced, like Senator Tim Scott, also of South Carolina, or the former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. One interesting thing in this shadow primary right now is that many of the would-be candidates are ones who served under Donald Trump, who served in his cabinet. It's very rare that you see both a former president and his cabinet officials buying in the same primary for president, but that's what it's shaping up to look like here. And I think that in the next few months, as this primary continues, it's going to be about culture wars. It's partially going to be about education.

It's unclear if the five men arrested are the same group of men the cartel said they were going to turn over to Mexican authorities. Now, the family of one of the victims who survived the kidnapping reacted to the news. The mother of LaTavia Washington McGee told me they want to see more arrests, quote, they need to keep getting them until they get them all.

Take a look.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice-over): Funeral for a fallen warrior, an honor guard, and thousands of mourners gathered to remember junior lieutenant Dmytro Kotsiubailo, better known by his code name Da Vinci. He was the youngest battalion commander in the Ukrainian army killed this week in the battle for Bakhmut. A month's long deadly test of wills between the Russian and Ukrainian militaries over a small city of questionable strategic value. (on camera): This is how Ukraine is honoring one of its fallen heroes and also proof of the terrible cost that the Ukrainian military is paying in the battle for Bakhmut. In 2021, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy officially declared Da Vinci a hero of Ukraine. On Friday, the president paid his respects to Da Vinci's surviving family members, accompanied by the prime minister of Finland. Mourners gathered on their knees around Da Vinci's coffin in the Maidan, the square in central Kyiv where in 2014, Da Vinci then just a teenager joined thousands of demonstrators in a bloody battle against Ukrainian security forces. They ultimately sent the country's pro- Russian president fleeing to Russia. Soon after, Da Vinci joined a nationalist militia and fought for years against pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region, before formally joining the Ukrainian armed forces.

So these aircrafts and the missiles that's associated with this become a very important part of the Russian war effort.But the key thing to remember is, as bad as the destruction is from these missiles from the other weapons, that the Russians have used against Ukraine, their supply appears to be quite limited, that's not very much solace to the people that have been hit by these missiles, but the very fact that they're using them also shows a degree of weakness on the part of the Russians. So, you know, we need to really develop air defense systems, missile defense systems that can take these missiles out. But even with the Patriot system, it would be better for the Ukrainians once they get that deployed there, but it's not going to be a panacea when it comes to the -- and similar hypersonic missiles.",
