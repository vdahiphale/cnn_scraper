      "sentences": "First of, all as a New York lawyer, it is unusual for a client for the defendant to speak directly in the courtroom.Generally, that type of thing is done through the attorneys. However, in this particular, case this is what is called a bench trial. That means there is, no jury the judge ultimately makes a determination and the judge has a great deal of leeway over any procedures in the courtroom, including this request by Donald Trump and his team. But it's important; I think what he is saying on the courthouse steps is being misconstrued a bit. What had happened is, his defense team said to the judge in an application to the court, meaning asked the court's permission, for Donald Trump to be able to speak at the closing arguments. The judge said, OK, I will entertain that. However, there are certain parameters. He has to abide by the rules of court that would apply to lawyers, to judges, to anybody. And those rules are, in a closing argument, that only the -- (AUDIO GAP) -- extraneous, anything that is not in evidence. It has to be directly related to the case with the evidence that was presented in the courtroom. There could be no attacks on court, staff, on judges and it cannot be a political speech. The defense team said, we can't agree to those parameters. The judge said, well, that's it. Then yesterday, there was a deadline set for the defense team to say whether or not Donald Trump agrees. And they blew the deadline and they never responded. So that's how we got here with respect to whether Donald Trump will speak in the courtroom. He is certainly going to be speaking outside the courtroom, as we just heard. We're going to hear the press conference again, it sounds like, at 40 Wall Street later in the afternoon. But that, I think, is an issue to be cleared up, why he's not able to speak in that closing argument and how unusual of a request it is just in general.",

There is otherpending criminal cases, two in the federal court system, two in the state court system. All of those are criminal in nature. This one is civil in nature. This one is very, very different. And, ultimately, the result of this case will be whether or not the Trump Organization and Donald Trump himself can continue to do business in New York, probably the biggest implication. The other piece of it is a significant financial component. The attorney general in this case is seeking $370 million in damages. That's a significant amount of money. Whether or not that will be awarded, it could be, less, it could be zero, it could be anything up to that amount. So really, this is more about money where the other cases have much more significance in the grand scheme of not only developing constitutional law relating to a president and potential for criminal liability but also in the grand scheme of whether or not there will be a criminal conviction of the leading Republican presidential candidate. So if I had to rank them, I would say this one has less importance in that sphere of what it means moving forward for the presidency. But of course, think about the financial implication here, Becky, I mean that's -- $370 million is a lot of money, a lot of money in a campaign season.",

Becky, something we heard from the South Africajustice minister when we interviewed him yesterday. He quoted the words of Nelson Mandela, who said \"South Africans will not be free until every Palestinian has been free.\" This goes back historically to Israel's long-standing support for what had been the apartheid regime at the time. Again, Nelson Mandela and the ANC placing their liberation struggle on a par and a link to the struggle of the Palestinians. In fact, when you look at that 84-page document that was their initial petition and when you listen to the words of so many of their barristers today, what they said was not simply going over the facts of what happened over the course of the last three months in Gaza. But really putting this in a historical context of what they describe as a 75 year-long apartheid in Israel and the Occupied Territories. So there are extremely strong political ties between them. And yet the point of this case, the point of this petition, the point of the testimony that you heard here today -- this is something else the justice minister told us -- is to get the politics out of this, the emotion out of this and to get to the bare facts of what has gone on in Gaza. And to put that in front of the U.N.'s highest court, to see what international law has to say with all of the weight of the fact that the Genocide Convention, of course, Becky, was drawn up in 1948 in the  wake of the Holocaust. And I think that has cast a long shadow as well over what we've heard from the South Africans and what we are likely to hear from the Israeli side tomorrow.

We are here to consider the facts. We're here to lay it out before the law. And their case, they believe, is unanswerable. They've set the low bar relatively low, Becky. They're not asking the court at this stage to consider the question of genocide. They're asking the court to accept that there may be the possibility that genocidal acts are being committed.

I think for me, perhaps the most interesting takeaway was the extent to which the secretary of state was really focused on longer-term regional issues, talking about the possibility of integrating Israel into the region, normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia. That was an issue that we thought was effectively taken off the table, at least temporarily, after those October 7th attacks happened, launching this entire war. But the secretary of state got word from the Saudi crown prince that he's still interested in normalizing relations. But critically, it would require Israel to take concrete steps toward a Palestinian state.

Let's get you back toNew York, where Donald Trump's courtroom drama is playing out. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the courthouse. Brynn, we heard from Donald Trump as he went in. He said he hoped he would have a chance to speak at the back end of proceedings today. That is unlikely, at this point. The judges told him no can do. They can't trust him, effectively. That's what the judge is saying. What can we expect?",

But I can tell you, Becky, court started right at 10:00. There was little hesitancy there to see if there would be a delay because of a bomb threat that was made against the judge in this case. But it did start right on time. The judge, in fact, didn't even address the fact that there was a bomb threat this morning. And he said that the defense will have until 12:45 Eastern time to give its closing arguments. So that's what we are listening to right now. It was the lead defense attorney, Christopher Kise, laying out his arguments as to why, in their terms, no victims in this case. And he basically said that this case that was brought against (sic) the New York state attorney general, he says it's a manufactured claim to serve a political agenda. It has always been press releases and posturing but no proof at all. So that is basically the heart of the defense's claim here. Once this wraps up, probably after the lunch break, we will hear from the state's attorney's office for their closing arguments. And then we expect in this case the judge to make a decision about any damages by the end of this month.",

Just 12 hours after 72-year-old Nick Saban was announced he was leaving Alabama, having led them to six college national titles, we have this news very much coming. In the next hour or 20 minutes or so, officially, we expect, the \"will he, won't he\" debate that's been going on in terms of Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. This news conference being held with Robert Kraft and Belichick, both expected to be present. We don't expect a retirement announcement from Belichick but we don't think we will find out where he's going next. But a lot of questions still to come. What happens next for him? Who do the Patriots bring in? We might well get some answers. But certainly, a huge week for two of football, both college and professional footballs, biggest names, coming your way in a couple minutes, Becky.",
