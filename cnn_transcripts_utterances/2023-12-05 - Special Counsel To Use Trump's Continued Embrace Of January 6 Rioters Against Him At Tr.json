      "sentences": "Tonight on \"360,\" new word on how prosecutors plan to use the former president's embrace of January 6th defendants against him in court. We'll talk about that and more with Liz Cheney whose new book has plenty to say about Donald Trump and the threat she believes he poses if reelected.Also, tonight, exclusive new reporting on how much longer Israel might continue high-intensity ground operations in Gaza, which today saw some of the heaviest fighting in the war. Plus, what key voters in a key swing state have to say about their choices for 2024. John King finds out on the latest edition of our special series of reports all over the map. Good evening. Thanks for joining us again. Our guest tonight here with me in studio is Liz Cheney, former Wyoming Republican congresswoman and vice chair of the House January 6th Select Committee. Our conversation comes at the end of a day that saw two potentially significant January 6th-related developments. The first, involving the evidence the prosecutors in the federal election subversion case want jurors to see. The second on what House Speaker Mike Johnson wants to keep Americans from seeing and soon to be released video of the attack on Congress. And my conversation with the congresswoman -- Congresswoman Cheney is going to start in a moment.   First, the latest on both of those stories from CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid. So, Paula, what are federal prosecutors in Washington signaling tonight?",

In this filing, they said, quote, \"Trump continues to\", quote, \"openly and proudly support individuals who criminally participated in obstructing the congressional certification that day, including by suggesting that he will pardon them if re-elected, even as he has conceded that he had the ability to influence their actions during the attack.\" They also say they want to show the jury things that Trump said in the lead up to election day, including his refusal to denounce the extremist group, the Proud Boys, and his refusal to commit to a peaceful transition of power. Anderson, they insist that all of this is evidence of his intent to get his supporters, like the Proud Boys, to attack the capitol and undermine the results of the election when it didn't go his way. And interestingly, they're even going to try to take it all the way back to 2012 over a decade ago and show how Trump has repeatedly tried to claim fraud when elections had outcomes that he didn't like. And prosecutors say, look, this laid the foundation for what he tried to do in 2020. Now, this is their plan, but all of this has to be approved by a judge.",

They've used it to prosecute hundreds of people. Now, the speaker subsequently backtracked in a statement saying, instead, he's trying to prevent all forms of retaliation from non- government actors. But again, online sleuths -- the public, non- government actors -- have identified hundreds of people in that footage, and the Justice Department has even asked for their help in identifying others. Of course, the speaker was actively involved in efforts to undermine the outcome of the election, but he says he wants to release this footage so that people can, quote, \"do their own research on the Capitol attack.\"",
