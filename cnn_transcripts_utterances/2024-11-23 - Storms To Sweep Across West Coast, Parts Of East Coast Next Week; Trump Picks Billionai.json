The TSA, in fact, is expecting over 18 million people to fly over the holiday week. But stormy weather and potential air traffic control shortages in the Northeast could cause airport delays. And parts of New York and Pennsylvania, well, they've already gotten more than 1 foot of snow paralyzing traffic in some areas and leaving more than 100,000 people without power. CNN's Allison Chinchar has more on what to expect.",

      "sentences": "Travel plans in the Northeast earlier today may have been dicey in a few spots, thanks to this overachieving storm. This video coming from aptly named Mount Storm in West Virginia dumping several inches of rain there.We had several spots in the Northeast just coming up with incredibly high snow totals. High Point, New Jersey topping out at just under 2 feet. But other areas, including Pennsylvania and New York, at least getting 1 foot of snow in about the last 36 hours. Now, most of that snow is likely going to melt in the next few days as those temperatures begin to increase. You'll start to see them warm up in the Midwest first before gradually seeing that warm air spread into the Mid-Atlantic as well as the Northeast, where much of that snow was dropped. Take Memphis, for example, going from 58 from that high today back into the low 70s by Monday. Takes a little bit longer to see that warm up, so New York and Richmond will finally get there once we get towards Monday and Tuesday of the upcoming week. If you had travel plans today or even perhaps tomorrow, the Southeast and much of the central portion of the country had absolutely no problems whatsoever. The only other rough spot really is going to be much of the West. Now, that main bomb cyclone that we had earlier in the week has finally exited the area, but we still have moisture coming into a lot of these areas, albeit not as much. It's on top of what we've already had. So because that ground is saturated, it's not going to take much to trigger some flooding in a few spots. Just over the next several days, still looking at at least 1 to 3 inches more of rainfall along the coastal regions and snow likely to be measured in feet, looking at an extra 1 to 3 feet, specifically in the Sierras over the next couple of days. Then fast forward to Thanksgiving Day itself. If you've got some maybe local last minute travel you're going to do, the only really concerned areas are going to stretch from Pennsylvania back down into portions of Louisiana. That's where you're going to encounter some of the heaviest rain. But then it begs the question, OK, what about the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade? Many folks not only go to see it, but also watch it on TV. The rain is expected to really spread into New York City once we get into the back half of the day and especially Thursday night. So the question becomes the front end likely is going to be OK, but you may start to see some of those isolated showers beginning to pick up towards the back half of the morning. Regardless, it's definitely going to be a chilly one with temperatures at the time of the parade only in the upper 30s.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Fred, it's a good place to start because that was one of the biggest roles that we were waiting to hear from. I'd remind you that even two weeks ago we had started hearing Scott Bessent's name as the likely pick to head the Treasury Department.I know that many people who've been working with Donald Trump on the transition, his allies, many of them had been pushing for Besant. He's kind of a Wall Street darling. He's very well known in big business. He's obviously a billionaire hedge fund manager. But also people thought that he would be a stable choice for the role. However, that then led to really what we've seen be a two-week fight play out behind the scenes at Mar-a-Lago over who would have that role. We know Donald Trump's co-transition chair, Howard Lutnick, had really been gunning for that role as well. He later was then announced that he would be running the Commerce Department. But this was really a decision, I'm told, that weighed heavily on Donald Trump's mind. Partly because we know that throughout his time on the campaign trail, Trump made a series of promises, particularly as it related to the economy, that he was going to lower inflation, that he would make housing and mortgage rates more affordable. He vowed to impose widespread tariffs, something that has actually alarmed many people, many economists. And so he's going to have a very big job to fill when he's actually in this role, if he is able to get confirmed. Now, we've also heard Bessent be a really loyal defender of Donald Trump over the past several years. He's also been advising Trump throughout his time on the trail when it came to economic policy. I want to take a listen to what he said on November 14th about how he thinks Donald Trump will operate as it relates to economic spending. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)",

I think under Donald Trump, we could have a golden age for the next four years.(END VIDEOCLIP) TREENE: Well, Fred, that type of appearance on television is music to Donald Trump's ear. We know that one of his qualifications for many of these roles has been people who can go out and talk about exactly what they are doing and frame Donald Trump's agenda in the light that he wants it to be framed. And so that's partly why they believe Bessent is a good choice for this. But again, I have to stress a lot of people close to Donald Trump. And we have been hearing from the Hill as well. People like Senator Lindsey Graham, who, like Bessent, is from South Carolina, applauding Donald Trump's pick, happy and believing that they think that he'll be able to get through his confirmation process pretty easily.",

But one of the ones that stuck out to me as well is that he named Russell Vought to lead his White House Budget Office.Now, Vought also ran the Office of Management and Budget during Donald Trump's first term. But really, it wasn't until the end of that first -- Trump's first administration that we started to see Vought gather a lot more power. And since then, we've really seen him kind of crack down on the bureaucracy. He's one of the leading people who has called for Schedule F, which is what we know Donald Trump wants to do, by firing a lot of career employees and placing -- replacing them with loyalists. He also, very notably, was a key architect of Project 2025, the kind of policy blueprint that was created in the years after he had left office. And also something that, of course, Democrats really criticized Donald Trump over throughout the campaign trail. Trump has tried to distance himself, but now we're seeing someone like Vought, who was heavily involved in that, have a very key role in his second term. Fred?",

And that shortage is causing a price hike. You can expect to pay $3.37 on average for a dozen Grade A large eggs. That's according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich has more. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: It's the perfect storm with eggs right now. Prices have been on the rise for two years. Demand has remained steady, and the avian flu is spiking right now. And there's an increased demand for eggs around the holiday season. One grocer said egg prices have been out of control. The average price for a dozen eggs in October was $3.37. And, of course, it depends on where you live. In Connecticut, one grocer told me he was selling a dozen eggs for $5. In New York City, one grocer said north of $6. But prices across the board are up 30 percent from last year, and egg production is down 2.6 percent. The avian flu has been plaguing farmers and has killed 75 egg-laying birds over the past two years. And last month, there was a spike, which killed 2.8 million egg-laying birds in three states, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, most of where our eggs are produced and come from. So that's created an even lower supply ahead of the holidays. And, of course, we use a lot of eggs around this time, so demand is putting even more pressure on low supply, raising prices. But what's interesting is commodity eggs, basic white eggs, are now just as expensive as organic eggs in some markets. So many people are now choosing to buy organic, which in turn could put an unexpected strain on that market. And just to show how important eggs are, think about all the items we make, we eat, that have egg in them. Mayo, pasta, those prices are higher now because of the last spike in avian flu cases.",
