The thing is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to extract a heavy price from Israel's enemies and at least on the Lebanese side, the strikes didn't really do that much damage, at least based on the video that we have seen thus far.Which shows that there were some homes, some cars that were affected. There was an electrical transformer that was affected and there was a massive crater left in a farmer's field in a pretty rural area, a little farming community. Farmers there said that they woke up to these explosions that damaged some of their homes. But as far as we can tell so far there have been no one injured. No one -- no casualties either. Now as Salma mentioned, the Israelis are blaming Palestinian militant groups that are operating within Lebanon, and there are several of them. And they do have some military power in this part of -- they're in the southern part of the country, especially around some of the Palestinian refugee camps there. Israel says that of the strikes that it carried out -- there were 10 of them -- it was aiming at Hamas linked tunnels and production sites there. And it seems that Israel is being extremely careful here to make sure that they are only going after targets that they say are laid to Palestinian militant groups, rather than -- as Salma mentioned -- Hezbollah. Because that they see as a much, much bigger threat. In fact, it's been something that they've been worried about for quite some time. The Israeli assessment is that there could be hundreds, maybe thousands of rockets that Hezbollah has hidden in southern Lebanon inside private residences, all of them within range of actually hitting Israeli soil. Hezbollah, as Salma mentioned, neither confirmed nor denied. But previously for context here. It's leader Hassan Nasrallah has said that, look, any violations at the al-Aqsa mosque complex could lead to hell breaking loose in this region. Israel does, though, say that Hezbollah does bear --",
