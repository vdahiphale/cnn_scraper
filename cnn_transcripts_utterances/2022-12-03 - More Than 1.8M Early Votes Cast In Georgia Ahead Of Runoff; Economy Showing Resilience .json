And although there were Republican and Democratic leaning counties that offered early voting last weekend.Overall, it really benefited Democrats, those bigger, most hot, more populous counties that tend to really, really lean Democratic, were able to bank votes. Warnock was really able to bank votes last weekend. Yes, Republicans say they hope to have even things up over the week. But now the question is, what voters are still out there, and how many will show up on Tuesday? A. WALKER: So, Tia what are you hearing about what is motivating people to come out and cast their vote again? And I found it interesting, and I do want to point this out before you answer. A new CNN poll shows that nearly half of those who back Walker, the Republican challenger, they say their vote is more about opposition to Warnock.

Because the message we're getting for Republicans, the message we're getting from Governor Kemp, isn't so much about Herschel Walker being that candidate that they all want to get behind and support, it's more about what he represents, what he can do for the party, if he wins the Senate seat.But the risk there is, is that enough of a factor, especially those people who are skeptical of Herschel Walker. They want to support a Republican, but they're not sure they can support Herschel Walker. We heard that, for example, from Lieutenant Governor, Jeff Duncan, he got to the booth and he said, you know, he doesn't want to support a Democrat. He doesn't support Warnock, but he couldn't pull himself to vote for Walker. That's the question. Whereas on the Democratic side, we're seeing a lot of energy for Raphael Warnock. It's not just they want a Democrat to win. Most of his supporters say they believe in him, they think he is superior candidate to Herschel Walker. And there's also that energy on Democratic side just about voting rights, voting access, they weren't happy that Republicans tried to prohibit that early voting on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, for example. So there seems to be a lot more energy for their candidate on the Democratic side. Whereas on the Republican side, it's more about getting a Republican in the seat and encouraging voters to want to do that by supporting Herschel Walker. A. WALKER: I don't know about you Tia, but I would love for Tuesday to hurry up and come because I'm so sick of all those ads and the text messages. I just keep texting back, stop, stop, leave me alone. But you know, a lot of these ads, there's been a lot of negative ads, especially about Herschel Walker that really underscore you know, his erratic behavior and his rambling speeches.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER (on-camera): Boris and Amara, the hope was for a Goldilocks jobs number not too hot that would fuel inflation, and not too cold, that would hint at a recession. We did not get Goldilocks we got hot jobs growth has slowed. But the slowdown recently has been glacial. You almost need a magnifying glass to see it. Now some sectors did lose jobs at retail, transportation and temporary help. They were all down in November. But otherwise, there was a lot of demand for workers. Leisure and hospitality continues to recover from COVID, adding almost 90,000 jobs one-month alone. Health care, government and construction all of them added jobs. The part of the jobs report catching the attention of economists and investors is wages. Coming in the thinking was that wages would cool off which would be encouraging because that would take some pressure off inflation. That did not happen, wages heated up growing by 5.1% year over year, some context that is roughly twice as hot as the pre COVID pace. That's a just very strong demand for workers. At the same time the supply of labor is shrinking as the worker shortage continues. The labor force participation rate dipped for the third month in a row. Now, this will not please the Federal Reserve which is trying to get inflation under control by easing this imbalance between supply and demand in the jobs market. Now, this is good news for workers in the sense that their paychecks are getting hammered by inflation. So, they want pay, of course to go up. But despite the hot wage number today, wages are still not keeping up with inflation. I think when we take a step back, this is a good news bad news situation. The good news is that there's nothing about the November jobs report that screams imminent recession, this jobs market is still chugging along. And that is a relief. No one wants to see the job market go ice cold. And the bad news, though, is that this jobs report is probably going to embolden the Federal Reserve, to keep raising interest rates to cool this economy off. Not just at the upcoming meeting this month, but also raising rates continuing into next year. And the more the Fed does, the greater the risk that they will do too much keeping this economy into a recession. Boris and Amara. (END VIDEO END)",

The President said that he would not be where he was -- not standing where he was at the IBEW without their support. Now, of course, that comes as he's facing tough questions from other union members. The President fashion himself as we can remember as the most pro union president that this country has ever seen. But some say that when that the push came to shove, the President chose the economy over protecting workers rights.Now, you're right. The thrust of the problem here is that the President and a deal that he negotiated in September and then asked Congress to impose on these two groups just a few days ago, really is about that lack of paid sick leave something that these advocates really wanted to see, which led four out of the 12 union members to really reject this negotiation. But the President, as you heard in that clip before, say, faced with the potential of a devastating railway strike just above the holidays, before the holidays, rather, he chose really to try to do the best thing possible. And he said it wasn't an easy decision for him. It was a tough decision. But he went forward with it, asking Congress to intervene. Now the President yesterday when signing that bill, he doubled down and said that he wants to get paid sick leave in for railway workers, but also for all Americans is something that he's been trying to get since he initially took office in that initial proposals that he put to Congress but he didn't get it back then and 2021. And it's still likely a less of a chance that he could get it now in the future, especially as the House flipped to Republicans in January. But still, of course, what matters most of the White House in this case, is protecting the economy, protecting the games that they feel that the economy has made since he has took office. That is what he believed that he did when signing that bill on Friday. Boris, Amara.",

The National Vacation Agreement was established in the 1940s.

So, it can be cancelled at any time. There's not a good paid time off schedule in this industry. And we've been trying to address that for years. But then the lack of paid sick time, it compounds on that, because people get sick, and they need time off to deal with it. And by the way, we tweeted something out yesterday about a railroad CEO bragging about how you have to take time off to maintain your body. And you know, it's pretty, it's pretty disturbing that somebody during the midst of all this, a rail CEO would go around and say this and tweet it publicly or post this publicly on their LinkedIn page.

And as Ian Jefferies from the AAR said, you know, there's no elasticity in the transportation industry right now. He's right. And it's because they have no workers, they don't have enough workers to maintain this infrastructure. So, there is an opportunity here for both parties to cut the acrimony and get serious and have open discussions and dialogue about this.

Under House rules, if no candidate secures a majority of the vote on the first round, then House Republicans keep voting until someone does.Now McCarthy's critics are vowing to oppose him on the floor. And they say they have enough detractors in order to deny him the speakership. But McCarthy is saying he's not going down without a fight, and that he's going to keep fighting and go through as many ballots as it takes to get there. So this is really shaping up to be a game of chicken. And the prospect of a messy floor fight is starting to anger some of the more moderate members who are warning that this could really undermine the GOP just as they are about to head into the new majority. They wrote in a letter to their colleagues, \"Such quarrels will only delay our ability to establish a working majority in the People's House. Make no mistake. We will not allow this conference to be dragged down a path to a paralyzed House that weakens our hard- fought majority.\" Now, at this point, no serious candidate or challenger has emerged, but it's not for lack of trying. I'm told that the anti-McCarthy group has been trying to recruit some challengers. They've been having informal talks with some Republicans, trying to see if they'd be interested in jumping in the race. That includes Steve Scalise, the number two Republican, as well as Jim Jordan, who is in line to chair the Judiciary Committee, and Tom Emmer, who's going to be the majority whip. But they all said that they're supporting McCarthy and they wouldn't challenge him. However, it is really unclear what would happen if McCarthy can't get to 218 or if he drops out of the race before then. At that point, if that scenario emerges, it's likely that a number of Republicans could throw their hat into the ring. So just a ton of uncertainty hanging over the speaker's race right now.
