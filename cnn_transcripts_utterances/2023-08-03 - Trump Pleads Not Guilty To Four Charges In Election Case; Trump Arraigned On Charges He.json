Trump, John, he said, to the judge when asked to state his name. She asked him whether -- she gave him -- read him his right to remain silent and asked him whether he knew, obviously, what was going on in court, that he had not taken any drugs or any alcohol, and spoke very quietly.The former president, there was a few times are where he looked directly at Jack Smith and Jack Smith also looked at him during the 20 minutes or so that he was sitting it there before the magistrate took the bench. And then, of course, the moment where he stood up -- where he stood and said that he -- that he was pleading not guilty, Wolf. And, of course, we know now that the judge here has already set a hearing for August 28th. She says that the judge who is going to be overseeing this case, Judge Tanya Chutkan, is going to announce a trial date at that hearing. She ordered the Justice Department and the Trump team to essentially provide their own dates, and then she is going to set a trial date. That's a very, very fast timeline that the judge here is trying to set. We, obviously, were in this courtroom there for a while. We saw a number of the federal judges who sit in this courthouse, Wolf, who have been adjudicating the hundreds of former -- the former president's supporters, who have been prosecuted for crimes related to January 6th. Of course, you know that the Capitol is right across here from this courthouse. And even today, as the court was doing some of its regular business, the former president's -- his presence, of course, showed itself. There was a judge who told the defendant who was pleading guilty, a member of the Proud Boys, that he was going to make sure that nothing that the former president's presence here affected that proceeding. We know, obviously, that the judge is going to hold this next hearing August 28th. That's about five days after the Republican debate that's coming up later this month. Erin?",

However, as you noted, that statement was very short. This was completely different from what we saw the last two times that he was indicted. He held big parties at his resort. He talks for almost an hour. This was short. We yelled questions at him. I think you could hear it at the end, about five feet from him. He did not take questions, even though we were told that he was going to. And I know that I am going to get text messages after this from these Trump advisers, from these allies saying, well, it was raining outside. But I have seen that man stand in the rain for 30 minutes giving a speech at a rally in Miami. So, I don't believe that that's the only deterrence here. When you look at him and you hear from our own correspondents, like Evan Perez, who was in the courtroom, talking about how he held his head down, how he clasped his hands, it gives you a real indication of where his mind is at. And one thing we do know is that he doesn't enjoy these days. He doesn't enjoy getting arraigned or being indicted. This isn't something that he wants to do. He isn't reveling in that. But, again, from our own correspondents in the room, from that remarks itself, it seems as though today did hit him, he did realized the gravity of the situation.",

He has pled not guilty. But he is now in a Washington, D.C., jurisdiction, unlike perhaps maybe felt a little more comfortable in places like Florida, certainly the talking points indicate that, but he is in front of people, and a potential jury pool who remembers the fencing around the Capitol, who remember what it was like to have their Metropolitan Police Department try to intervene, to give comfort and aid, of course, to the Capitol Police. And they remember seeing all of this unfold. And so the idea that even when he spoke just now outside of that tarmac, he was very disparaging about the nation's Capitol because it served his own interests in that moment.

And it is about what he said, you know, the persecution of a political opponent.It's what he tried to do this afternoon in his brief speech, is to sort of almost take this out of the legal realm and make the jury the country. The jury now, for Donald Trump, are going to be voters, he believes, particularly voters right now in a Republican primary, which he needs to win, if he is going to run against a Democrat, Joe Biden. And so that seems to me to be the case that he is making, and that will -- he will continue to make. This is his case, not -- it's a legal case, sure, but the case that Donald Trump is making is a political case, a persecution. And he has said -- remember, he says to voters, I am your retribution.

Our CNN colleagues were reporting that they looked at each other after the terrible things that Donald -- and false things that Donald Trump has said about Jack Smith.But after the powerful and devastating indictments, this is how Smith has primarily spoken, through two devastating indictments. So, that was just a taste of the drama. This truly will be -- I don't even think trial of the century is strong enough. It's going to be the trial of the millennium, including because American democracy itself and its resilience is on trial. So, a solemn day, a historic day, but a good day for what we're about.

It's getting replayed on television networks that we aren't necessarily watching. And so that's his second front. We have to remember this. So, it's all quiet, not lots of crowds. He doesn't say much. He is not inciting anything. Don't believe it. Because what is happening online is the same -- that's a January 6th stuff. That is, you know, it's going to be a party, let's go, you know, everyone congregate. That's exactly what happened. It's just happening on forums that a lot of us aren't following.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, Wolf, I've learned through my conversations with Trump's advisers over the past several days now that Donald Trump is privately very concerned about these charges. He is also grown increasingly angry about the mounting indictments that he is facing. And I think you could see some of that today during his court appearance in D.C. from our great reporters who were inside the courtroom. They noted that his mood was somber. He had his arms crossed around him. And that lines up with what I'm told he is showing behind the scenes as well. Now, he has also grown increasingly frustrated that a lot of money is being dedicated to these legal fees. I mean, money, tens of millions of dollars that is supposed to be for his campaign, that his campaign has raised, that he has now having to dedicate to his defense team.Another thing I think is interesting is, earlier this week, his team has been strategizing about how to maximize the political benefit of this latest indictment. They have been trying to boost his fundraising around this. We have seen him issue a number of appeals to donors. And also he has ramped up his outreach to allies, specifically those on Capitol Hill, to defend him publicly, encouraging them to come out and issue statements of support. And one other thing, Wolf, that I find really interesting, is they had the decision today, Donald Trump's team, to not go in person. They had a choice to do this arraignment via Zoom. But they chose to come in person. I am told the strategy there was really to drum up attention from the media around this appearance today and also try to argue that Donald Trump is being taken off the campaign trail and forced to appear in person for these different court appearances. And that kind of speaks to their overall strategy to argue that this is election interference and that he is taken away from. But I should note, he didn't have any prescheduled campaign events today. He will be in Alabama tomorrow and South Carolina on Saturday. But that is what they are trying to argue here, Wolf.",
