June 5th, the new date to avoid the first-ever debt default in the United States if Congress and the White House cannot agree on a deal to raise the national debt limit, which now stands at $31.4 trillion.Default could have drastic economic ramifications in the United States and around the world. And it starts with getting a deal between speaker McCarthy, his top allies and the White House. There is no deal but they are close to one. They've been negotiating late into the night as they've horse traded on a whole wide range of issues. And as Republicans have pushed for spending cuts to be attached to any piece of legislation to raise the national debt limit, there are indications the White House is moving closer to the Republicans' position on that. And there are also some indications that the Republicans are getting a little bit more to the White House on how long to extend the national debt limit for. The White House wants it done through the 2024 elections. Republicans initially proposed to do it just for one year so they can get back and have this fight again next year. The White House does not want to have this fight again. It appears Republicans would allow for a two-year debt limit increase. The other major sticking points included over the issue of work requirements. That means actual -- for social safety net programs. Republicans want to impose on programs like food stamps new work requirements for those beneficiaries. Democrats believe that push will hurt needy families and could be detrimental to a lot of people who rely on that for their nutrition and for their daily lives. But all the negotiations, all the discussion going forward and as Garret Graves, one of the top negotiators, told me earlier in the day, that he will insist on work requirements to be part of any deal.

But a Ukrainian political adviser says the target was the city's Azovstal steel plant, where he says Russia had set up an ammunition depot. The plant became a symbol of Kyiv's resistance to the Kremlin because Ukrainian troops defended it for weeks before surrendering last May. Officials say search and rescue operations are still underway after Russia's rocket strike on a medical facility in Ukraine. Friday's attack obliterated the facility in the city of Dnipro, killing at least two people, leaving more than 30 wounded. Officials say rescuers have found more human remains during their search.

Quote, \"claimed that he was going to attempt to harm Queen Elizabeth and would do this either by dropping some object off the Golden Gate Bridge onto the royal yacht Britannia when it sails underneath or would attempt to kill Queen Elizabeth when she visited Yosemite National Park.\" The memo doesn't give more detail than that and it's not clear what kind of follow-up there was. It's also important to keep in mind that this memo was marked priority rather than immediate, which would have been taken much more seriously. Also by the time it actually gets to the FBI, this is now fifth-hand information. But the bureau was not wrong to be concerned, especially considering, in 1979, Louis Mountbatten was killed when a bomb planted on his fishing boat exploded. And, of course, the IRA was keen to target anything associated with the British state. These documents also show that even more benign protests were followed closely by the FBI, which had informants inside some of the local protest groups. One memo describes an Irish diaspora group, which was planning to distribute free beer at a protest of the state dinner, something they said could have added a dangerous dimension to the events planned. That same memo also makes it clear that the FBI wasn't just worried about the safety of the queen,; it was also worried about any potential incidents that could have been embarrassing either to the queen or to then president Ronald Reagan -- Scott McLean, CNN, London.
