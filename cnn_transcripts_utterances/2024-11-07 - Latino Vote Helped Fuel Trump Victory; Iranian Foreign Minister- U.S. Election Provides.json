They don't hear about the work that they've done to help create constructions jobs and to create more equity and opportunity for them. That's the opportunity going forward as we continue the conversations. Because Republicans, again, have passed none of those laws.

I'm curious to get your reaction to that.SABRINA RODRIGUEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Look, Boris, I don't put sexism and racism past the United States. I think that for some people, that was a factor. I have been out for months talking to Latino voters across the country and some people did say that. Some people did mention outright to me, to me, a Latina woman, that they would not vote for a woman, that they didn't want to see a woman in office, that they didn't think that she could be strong enough as a president. However, I think it would be shortsighted to just say that is the reason why this happened. This is years of Donald Trump's messaging. I mean, Donald Trump's campaign focused so heavily on targeting men, not just Latino men, but men across the board. We had conversations leading up to the election about black men and we've seen so much is focused on going on Joe Rogan's podcast and going to talk to young white men on college campuses. But with Latino men, there was this focus about, you know, as he was saying, the economy and how he's going to be better for you, and how he's going to provide for your family, and how things were so much better four years ago when he was president. And objectively, anyone that goes to the grocery store knows that things are more expensive. Anyone who's paying rent knows it's more expensive. So for a lot of people, that was a compelling argument, even if it wasn't necessarily backed up with him outlining policies.",

And if they European countries and, of course, the United States don't stand up to Russia, on their side as North Koreans are fighting, that all of this will only intensify. So certainly, there is a lot of concern on the part of the Ukrainians as to what this new administration can bring. One of the things that Volodymyr Zelenskyy also cautioned was not to play too nicely with the Russians. I want to listen to some of what he had to say today at that conference. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that he believes that his good relations not just with Zelenskyy, but with Russian President Vladimir Putin, will help do that. He has praised his relations with Vladimir Putin. Well, Vladimir Putin has now essentially done the same thing. Just as we we're going on-air, I was in the on the sideline watching Vladimir Putin at an event in Sochi, in southern Russia, and he for the first time congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election. I just want to read that real quickly. He said, that \"Regardless of what he said about his desire to rebuild relations with Russia, to facilitate an end to the war in the Ukrainian crisis, I think this deserves attention, at the very least, and I would like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to his election as president of the United States\" -- guys?",

I would like our president to be a role model in addition to a political and economic leader. And obviously, the person that leads the Army. I think that what a president says and what a president does absolutely matters. And that we should be trying to aspire to something greater. But that said, he was explicit, he focused on the things that mattered to him, particularly on immigration. And in the end, the public compared his immigration record and his proposals with Vice President Harris' record and her proposals and they found Trump better than Harris. Make no mistake. If you asked a person who they liked better as a person, Vice President Harris won that comparison. But if you asked people who could better handle affordability -- because it's really not the economy, it's about prices and costs, affordability and immigration, which is more about safety and security, they, by 10 points or more, gave that edge to Donald Trump.

And they felt like the Democratic Party had left them. This is no embrace, no bear hug of either Trump or the Republican Party. But they felt like Vice President Harris only cared about young women. And you saw it in the ads, you saw it in the rallies, you saw it in all the sound bytes and the clips visually. That clearly, she wanted to be a role model. And that's perfectly appropriate. And in fact, it's courageous to give young women a role model. But you don't do it at the expense of men, who have been voting Democrat, working hard, playing by the rules, paying their taxes. And there are too many of these men who abandoned the Democrats in 2024.
