It will begin with Donald Trump as a criminal defendant in court in Manhattan, facing the potential juror pool as that process gets started. What happened over the last couple of days was Monday, his team went to court -- went to an appellate judge and asked them to put things on hold for one reason, moving the trial. The appellate court said no, we're not going to do that. Tuesday, it was about a gag order and the appellate court said no, we're not going to do that either. And then yesterday, another scramble to get before an appellate judge with a smorgasbord of things that Trump's team was trying to use to say put everything on hold. They wanted to have a stay -- a pause because they want to look at the recusal of the judge in the case. They want to get him off of the case. They wanted to bring up presidential immunity issues. Some questions about filing during the trial. And the appeals court said no, we're not going to put this on hold. It's moving forward. These are not things that you are arguing with merit here at this time to cause the trial to stop. The district attorney's office in New York says there's great public interest for this trial to begin on Monday. And so, it certainly looks like it will.

So -- and I do think that will come into public. Trump always does this. He did it with the civil fraud action before Judge Angoran. He tests the limits. The gag order has already been extended to include family members because Trump was attacking family members of the judge. So we can expect some fireworks on this.

A little creativity with them and they used what they had around them. They made a \"HELP\" message with palm fronds, Coast Guard officials say. The trio were fishing when their skiff was caught, damaged by swells. So they swam ashore on a very remote 31-acre island in Micronesia and wrote the message and just waited.

But he was describing how the tornado or the wind was trying to suck him backwards away from his house, so quite dramatic.Now, that same storm system is moving up the East Coast and I want you to see the severe weather today. I'm going to highlight the Florida Peninsula and into southeastern sections of Georgia. But then I also want to bring your attention to that shading of orange across the eastern sections of the Ohio River Valley and western West Virginia. This is an enhanced risk of severe storms today. A few tornadoes still possible, damaging winds, and large hail. And then, the other threat here is also the flooding that has been ongoing. We're focusing in on the Florida Panhandle and that area had a flash flood emergency in and around Tallahassee earlier this morning. That's moved on. The bulk of the heavy rainfall today will be across the coastal areas of the Carolinas. John, back to you.",

Today, the White House is expected to announce an expansion of joint patrols in the Indo-Pacific as tension simmers between China and the United States. The announcement comes ahead of the president's historic meeting this morning with the leaders of Japan and the Philippines -- part of a move to strengthen ties between the three nations and counter Beijing. CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us now from the White House. What does this expansion look like at this moment?",

It's a historic summit -- the first time the leaders of the three countries will be meeting together. But maritime security is really expected to be at the top of their agenda at a time when senior administration officials heading into this summit said that they are very concerned about China's aggression in the South China Sea. A lot of that concern centers around the fact that China has taken aggressive actions towards Filipino ships, at times firing water cannons at their crews. And today, they will be making an announcement that there will soon be joint patrols by the Coast Guards of each country in the coming year. A senior administration official says that will include the U.S. Coast Guard bringing on members of the Japanese and Filipino Coast Guard onto their ships for training. And it also comes just on the heels of heading into this summit, there were those joint military exercises conducted between the U.S., the Philippines, Japan, and Australia really trying to have this show of unity and force as they are facing this aggression from China in the region. But really, this trip for -- these two visits from President Biden of the Japanese leader and also the Filipino leader really highlight his emphasis on the region in trying to rebuild those alliances as they trying to find ways to counter China going forward.",
