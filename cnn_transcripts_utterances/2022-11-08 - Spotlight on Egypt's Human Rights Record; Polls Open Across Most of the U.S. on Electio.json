All world leaders gathered here in Egypt face a double barreled problem as it were, finding ways to reduce what experts say are record setting greenhouse gas emissions pouring into our atmosphere and agreeing on ways to pay for the devastating damage wrought by climate catastrophes that are increasing in number and indeed increasing in severity. On the first issue, a warning today from the UN Secretary General about what he calls Net Zero green washing, Antonio Guterres says the world must not tolerate bogus net-zero pledges to cover up massive fossil fuel expansion. On the second issue, the demand for climate justice, there's a palpable sense of frustration from developing nations about when or even if the so called loss and damage compensation fund will actually ever happen. We're going to hear from Kenya's President on that in a few moments. But there are other global issues coming to focus here in Egypt, including calls to release the British Egyptian Writer and Activist Alaa Abd El- Fattah, who is currently on hunger strike in a Cairo Prison. David McKenzie back with me this hour. You've talked to Alaa's sister, what did she say?",

I was at an emotional press conference of his sister Sanaa Seif now there was a parliamentarian there from Egypt. We had to be manhandled out of there by UN Security because he accused the family of having double standards because last year, the well-known activist received British citizenship while in prison. He was arrested again after nearly a decade in prison on national security charges. But supporters his family, even the Head of the UN Human Rights Council say these are trumped up charges. They say he needs to be released immediately. His sister was understandably emotional many more than 200 days into a hunger strike. He's taken even further steps to try and get his voice heard. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SANAA SEIF, ABD EL-FATTAH'S SISTER: So we have not yet been defeated. But right now, all we know is that Alaa stopped drinking water 50 hours ago, we don't know where he is. We don't know if he's alive. My mother waited outside the prison gates for 10 hours yesterday for her weekly letter. They didn't give her one. She's back at those gates right now.

Troops from an elite Russian marine unit say they were thrown into an incomprehensible battle in the Donetsk region and that as many as 300 troops were killed or wounded, with others still missing. Now, Moscow's Ministry of Defense is denying any Heil, \"Pointless, casualty counts\". Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy referred to that intense combat in his nightly video address saying that the Donetsk region remains the epicenter of what he called the biggest madness of the occupiers.

Reconstruction in that suburb has taken on a new sense of urgency with winter, obviously on its way in a failing national power grid. But rebuilding homes will be easier than repairing hearts, traumatized by the brief Russian occupation. CNN's Christiane Amanpour has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): On the outskirts of Kyiv, the bridge into Irpin in the Bucha district was a lifesaver for those who managed to flee the early Russian advance. In the seven months since these scenes the horrors of what those troops left behind have been fully exposed. Mykhailyna, the Deputy Mayor of the Bucha region is taking us to meet residents who are rebuilding. But throughout this heavily destroyed residential area, it's a race against winter. As temperatures start to plunge and blackouts continue, money is tight, but spirits are high. At the very least, they need to replace glass in the windows and patch up holes the size of tank and artillery rounds. Tatiana shows us pictures of her apartment small bedroom, destroyed in March, rebuild now. Her story is hair rising and miraculous hunkering down in the basement for 10 days under Russian occupation. This is the picture of the Russian tanks arriving just 15 minutes after she fled. When we left they were shooting at us from behind she tells me, now I realized what kind of a second birthday I got. What kind of a gift because those people who left right after us were shot. As this city tries to put the pieces back together again, there's another more sensitive, perhaps even more difficult kind of rebuilding underway. The UN Children's Fund UNICEF has placed pop-up tents full of warmth, light and care. All these children have been traumatized and some have been forced to witness unspeakable horrors.
