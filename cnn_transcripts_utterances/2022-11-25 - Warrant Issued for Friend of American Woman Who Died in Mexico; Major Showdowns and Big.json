Joey, good to have you on this. I mean, it's a remarkable case. It's an alarming case here including the role that this video will play or may play in an investigation. First, how does the extradition process or how would it work between the U.S. and Mexico? Do the two countries cooperate on cases like this?",

We know that Mexican authorities now are looking and with regard to the arrest warrant for the extradition, that is to have the party or parties brought back to Mexico to be held accountable. And if they do that I think what you'll see is you'll see the Department of Justice involved.We have an Office of International Affairs. We have a robust extradition proceeding and we have actually a treaty with Mexico that's been in existence for some 45 years, and so there is cooperation. So on the one hand, you could see Mexico engage in the prosecution. On the other, we certainly have a statute in the United States that would provide for our government to be involved and the federal government to prosecute a foreign national, right? What happens is, just to be clear, in terms of that statement in the event that you go overseas and an American citizen is ultimately killed by another American citizen, there is a statute that could provide for the prosecution to take place in this country. So we'll see which way it plays out ultimately.",

At the end of the day you have to know and understand that the evidence that you have is gathered appropriately, that the crime scene would not otherwise be contaminated, that the autopsy was done properly. And so yes, there could be some challenges there.Having said that, with the FBI involved now, I'm sure that they'll undertake an investigation which is quite significant. They will be working with Mexican authorities. They will be all over the area where it occurred to try to get answers, so no investigation is without flaws, Jim, but ultimately, I think justice could be served here with the investigation to this point knowing what they know is done properly.",

Certainly didn't look that way. And so yes, I think that's admissible evidence, Jim, and there will be other things that would be admissible.

Came out the second half and they weren't quite the same team. And you know, they're a little jumpy. They're emotional. It's understandable.This is a huge stage for this young American team. And so what the American men have to do is play a full 90 minutes or whatever stoppage time there is. In other words, they need to really back up a good first half with a great second half.
