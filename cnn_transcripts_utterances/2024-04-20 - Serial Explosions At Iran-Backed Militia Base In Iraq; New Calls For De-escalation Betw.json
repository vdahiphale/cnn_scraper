An Israeli official tells CNN that Israel didn't play a role in the blast.And U.S. Central Command says neither it nor coalition members conducted the strikes in Iraq. Now the explosions happened at a base south of Baghdad but there's no indication so far of what caused them. A local security official tells CNN there were five explosions, including at least three militia members. But now there are signs that Israel-Iran tensions could be easing on Friday. Iran's president didn't mention the strike on his homeland. He did though, praise Iran's attack on Israel last weekend. Also on Friday, one regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran wasn't expected to respond further. Satellite images obtained by CNN show that there doesn't appear to be extensive damage at the airbase targeted by the strike. In fact, Iran's Fars news agency says the only damage was broken windows in several buildings. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us live from London with the latest. So Nada, with everyone calling for day-escalation, does it seem as though that's where things are headed right now?",

      "sentences": "Well, that is suddenly the hoping that has in mounting international pressure on both Iran and Israel to diffuse the tensions between the two regional powerhouses.That has certainly been the indication perhaps from Iranian officials over the past 24 hours, as you mentioned. There has been somewhat of an effort to downplay the impact of Israel's attack on Iran. We've heard from Iranian officials describing Israel's using tiny drones, that there was limited damage to the airbase. And, of course, we heard yesterday from the Iranian president, as you mentioned, Ebrahim Raisi, he made no mention of the attack. But of course, lauded Iran's retaliate Russian against the consular attack over the weekend in Israel and continues to focus on the Iranian military attack on Israel. So that continues to be a key focus. There had been, of course, mounting fears of this could spark and provoke a broader escalation in the region, particularly amongst Iran's proxies. That was certainly a fear but there seems to be some sort of regional considerations at play here. Of course, as well, we know, of course, that Iran may be considering its regional nascent friendships with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, again, both of them key U.S. allies. And the Biden administration has been clear in not wanting to see broader escalation. In fact, we did hear also from the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, he spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday. And while we did receive a readout from the Pentagon, that was no mentioned of Israel's attack on Iran. In fact, the Biden administration has remained largely tight-lipped around that. So there clearly is an effort by many in the international community to diffuse those tensions. But it's certainly been the message from those in the European Union. We heard from the E.U.'s foreign policy chief speaking ahead of the G7 foreign ministers' meeting, warning that the region could be the on the brink of an all-out war and that European leaders stand in a united front, calling against that. What is clear is both sides have attempted, put an effort out to show their strengths to assert their power in what has been the most dangerous direct escalation between Israel and Iran. But clearly there appears to be an effort not to drag either party or either members of the region into an all-out war at this stage, a war, which many believe neither side would be prepared for at this current time.",

It is something I do not fully understand but I really hope that the decision will come through and then the following up on that decision, that the weapons will be delivered as soon as possible, because literally there are some moments in history where politics should step aside.

It's the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Trump faces 34 felony counts for his alleged role in the scheme to conceal an affair with adult film star, Stormy Daniels.It could have damaged his 2016 election campaign. A full jury panel is now in place after the last alternates were seated on Friday. An appeals court has denied the presidential candidate's latest attempt to delay his criminal trial. The former president's lawyers had asked, again, to put the trial on pause until a ruling is made over his request to switch venues. Meanwhile, law enforcement says the man who lit himself on fire outside the courthouse where Trump's trial is being held has died. CNN's Kara Scannell was in the courtroom for Friday's proceedings and has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): \"We have our full panel.\" That announcement from Judge Juan Merchan after jury selection concluded.

POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. I mean, look, you know, Trump's strategy has been, from the beginning, to portray every case against them as a conspiracy so vast as Joe McCarthy. The language he used back in the '50s, that all of these different prosecutors and all of these judges and all of the witnesses, as people testify against him, are all part of an effort to silence him. He's had tremendous success with that within the Republican base. Now we see the test of what impact all of this is going to have on the broader electorate. I was really struck in the past week by a poll by our Associated Press and the National (INAUDIBLE) Research Center at the University of Chicago. Which found, not surprisingly, that fewer people, fewer Americans think that Trump broke the law in this case than in the other cases against him on classified documents and trying to overturn the 2020 election. But strikingly, the share of people who said that he would be unfit to be president if he was convicted in this case was about the same as in the other cases, where -- which they adjudge to be more serious. And I think that gets to this kind of threshold issue, which we may confront in a few weeks, which is whatever the charges. Whichever of these cases are involved, if he is convicted of a felony, are a majority Americans willing to return to the White House someone who has been so convicted? People have not really had to grapple with this in practice obviously. And it is now, we are now on the track that's going to see whether they are going to have that opportunity or requirement to do so in a few months. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
