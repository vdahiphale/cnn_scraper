So these are the people who are coming into the process. People who, for some reason, sat out in 2020 but are now seeing a reason to get engaged. Now, whether that is because they are dissatisfied with Joe Biden or because they're seeing something compelling in Donald Trump's message we're not really sure. But Democrats have quietly, and sometimes a little bit louder, been talking about -- there's concerns about the soft way that Joe Biden has started his reelection campaign.

Donald Trump, over the weekend, saying he will not testify at his civil fraud trial in New York today. The surprise reversal comes after days of him vowing to take the stand in his own defense. He posted this on Sunday on social media. Quote, \"I have already testified to everything and have nothing more to say other than that this is a complete and total election interference (Biden campaign) witch hunt that will do nothing but keep businesses out of New York.\" OK, let's bring in criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Andrew Cherkasky. Andrew, good morning to you. Is this Donald Trump finally listening to his own lawyers? What's going on here? ANDREW CHERKASKY, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR (via Skype):  Well, it must be because I think at a stage like this you have to look at what has already come into evidence. And, of course, he was called as a witness previously by the prosecution where he was examined for the better part of a day and had the opportunity to testify on his side as well. It didn't go all that well, with the judge reminding him that this wasn't the campaign trail. Rather, this was a trial regarding his businesses. But he did have a chance at that time to fully testify. And I think that this would have just been a rehash of what he had already had to say and it seemed as though his attorneys were advising him of that, even though he had earlier promised he was going to testify again.

He has conceded that.He said that he did so because of his rising legal costs.

Ending the increasing legal bills but now putting on him an excessively high potential for a very, very large verdict against him.

Now, how you define that is part of the battle that's going on.We have to remember President Trump hasn't been charged with, much less convicted of insurrection either in federal court or through the impeachment proceedings. So as he stands right now, the way in which they're trying to raise this insurrection is by doing so through the state courts. Now, Colorado said that he had committed an insurrection in that state court proceeding and now it's at the Supreme Court. But they had said at that lower court that it did not bar him from being on the ballot. So the Supreme Court has recently heard arguments that are wide- ranging from questions of whether the definition of insurrection was correct, whether he's technically an officer of the United States, and whether the 14th Amendment would apply in this case. And like you said, there have been challenges in many states. It hasn't landed yet. There has been no state that has ruled to keep him off the ballot. I think if that were to happen this would be most certainly headed to the Supreme Court and may go either way.",

They, of course, put that as a red line in the context of credible reports of horrific sexual violence against women on October 7. So that was that. There have been concerns in the past certainly from the Qatari onus (PH), the key mediator here, that the expanded ground operation complicates this.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make his case to American lawmakers this week for more aid for his war-torn country. His last- ditch lobbying effort comes as Congress remains stalled over an aid package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine's war effort. The aid caught up in Republican demands for changes to U.S. border policy. Lawmakers have just one week to pass the package before they're scheduled to head home for the holiday break. Let's bring in Stef Kight, politics reporter at Axios. Stef, good morning. This seems like a last-ditch rescue mission on Zelenskyy's part. He has been able to move the needle in the past. He's been a pretty effective -- an incredibly effective, frankly, advocate for his country, but things have really turned against him here in Washington of late. Can he move the needle here? STEF KIGHT, POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS (via Skype):  I mean, certainly, Zelenskyy's decision to visit Washington again shows just how desperate Ukraine is to ensure that they get this additional aid from the U.S. And it's also a sign of just how far apart Democrats and Republicans are still on reaching any kind of deal on this massive aid package that includes the $60 billion for Ukraine. And, of course, this comes after last week when we heard President Biden even say that he was willing to look at immigration policy changes in order to meet the demands from Republicans in order to get his aid package through. And I do think it will be interesting to see whether Zelenskyy is able to convince some of these Republican holdouts to get behind Ukraine's effort. Whether he does again with these conversations with leadership on both Republican and Democratic sides in the House and the Senate -- whether he is able to again convince people that Ukraine is a country worth supporting, worth backing, and really describe to these members of Congress how desperate things are getting in Ukraine right now.",
