For the second time in just two months, federal investigators are looking into another apparent attempt on the life of the Republican presidential nominee. Donald Trump is safe and was not harmed in Sunday's incident at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida.A 58-year-old man identified as Ryan Wesley Routh has been detained. A source says the FBI investigation has now gone global as officials look into his background. Trump meantime has posted on Truth Social thanking the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement officials for their actions on Sunday. He said quote, \"The job done was absolutely outstanding.\" Earlier we heard from the Palm Beach County Sheriff about exactly what happened at Trump International Golf Club as the former president was on the golf course.

He jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag, which was great. So we had that information, our real time crime center put it out to the license plate readers. And we were able to get a hit on that vehicle on I-95 as it was headed into Martin County. We got a hold of Martin County Sheriff's Office, alerted them, and they spotted the vehicle and pulled it over and detained the guy. After that we took the victim -- I'm sorry, the witness that witnessed the incident, took -- flew him up there, and he identified as the person that he saw running out of the bushes that jumped into the car. Now, in the bushes where this guy was is an AK-47 style rifle with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence that had a ceramic tile in them, and a GoPro, which he was gonna take pictures of. So, those are being processed right now. The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic job. What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the president was at. And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engage that individual at which time the individual took off. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROB D'AMICO, RETIRED FBI SUPERVISORY SPECIAL AGENT:  The reason that you put ceramic plates on is for a rifle engagement. They stop rifle rounds. So he is looking for an encounter. Why else would you bring it and put it there if you're not like going to put it on for the event? So I think he was preparing and he was looking out the chain link fence that he was on and seeing what his scope can see because there's scope. When you start looking through a scope, it really brings down the field of view. So he's probably checking that out, seeing where he could actually engage the former president. And the Secret Service agent sees his barrel sticking out, which again is a bad sniper tactic. You never allow your barrel to go past something. But he did that. Secret Service agent sees it and engages him right away. I don't think he would engage them right away if it hadn't been for Pennsylvania. But I think they caught him beforehand. I think he was waiting for him to get in what we call an ambush zone where it's a shorter distance and he has better field of vision and that agent interrupted it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Republican Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida, a member of the House Assassination Task Force, has called for a briefing from the Secret Service this week. In the aftermath of Sunday's incident, questions are being raised as to how this might affect the presidential campaign. Trump was scheduled for stops in Michigan, New York and the swing state of North Carolina this week. We don't know whether those events will go ahead as planned. It's also unclear how this incident might influence the tone or the focus of the of Trump's campaign.

I think with the first assassination attempt that took place on July 13th, there -- it was clear that this was going to have a huge impact on the campaign. Biden had a terrible debate, he appeared very weak, and Trump in the aftermath of the assassination attempt, the first one, appeared robust, that he had survived death.And to his supporters, he was this messianic type of figure who was incredible and could survive anything, and there was all kinds of elation and positive energy going into the Republican convention. And Trump himself said that he was going to tone down his own rhetoric and that he was going to try to be nice. After the assassination attempt, you also had Elon Musk declaring his endorsement for Trump. So there was a lot of momentum behind Trump at that time. But then as soon as Joe Biden dropped out of the race, we weren't really hearing much about the assassination attempt anymore. And now at this point, we're much more far along in the campaign. Many more people have made up their minds. And I don't see it having the same impact because I actually think the shock of it, the shock of it with the first one has already made its impact and this sort of aftershock, it's not going to be making such an impact politically speaking.",

It wasn't some sort of, as the Republicans might say, some kind of left-wing liberal that enacted (inaudible) made this attempt.This is important to cooling down the temperature a bit, because after the first assassination attempt, J.D. Vance blamed Biden and his rhetoric of calling Trump a fascist, and that was the reason why this violence occurred. But I think something that is even more concerning, apart from the ideological affiliation, is now that we've had the first assassination attempt, we're seeing these copycats. Political violence begets more political violence. If people see that there were openings there, there were cracks that the Secret Service was unable to protect Trump, and as a candidate, of course, you have different protection levels than if you are the sitting president. And so that's a major concern for me going forward that there could be more of these assassination attempts as it's become normalized.",

Now, we also know that he had with him according to what was found at the scene, to backpacks and a GoPro, as well as an AK-47 style rifle. Now this all unfolded after Secret Service, who was on the golf course working the holes ahead of Donald Trump saw the barrel of a rifle poking through the fence, and then they engage the suspect with some gunfire. He took off. They made chase. They eventually tracked him down and took him into custody. Now, in terms of the law enforcement presence here, still at the international golf club, the roads have been closed since this incident occurred. That has continued much through the day. Here on Summit Boulevard, which is the main thoroughfare outside front of the International Golf Club. That is where holes five and six where this incident apparently occurred. Those holes backup to Summit Boulevard where we are standing it has been closed for hours, so that is sort of a key boulevard as well as others that surround the club, which would be Kirk Road and Congress Avenue. All of them were shutdown following this incident. The former president was kept here at the International Golf Club for hours, made sure that the area was secure. The intent higher golf club was locked down and then he was brought to Mar-a-Lago, which he calls home about 15 minutes from here in West Palm Beach.

The law enforcement learns from every individual case and this is what's happening here right now. They're seeing and how could he accessed the weapon system? How could you access that location? And they're learning from each of these cases. So it won't be easy or even possible to do a similar attack in the future because of what law enforcement is learning. That said, though, I think to have any kind of rallies in close located, or indoor locations as a recommendation, that's we know others have followed and I think (AUDIO GAP).",

This video from Sunday, from Poland, you can see all of that heavy water filling up the streets and a lot of the communities there and also filling up some of the rivers and the creeks and streams, allowing some of those things to kind of flow down that wouldn't normally be there.We're talking substantial amounts of rain for a lot of these areas. Take a look at this, Prague picking up almost 100 millimeters of rain that is way more than they would normally see for the month of September. Same thing for Vienna, seeing much more than they normally be 2, 3, 4 times what they would normally see in the month of sale September, as are several other communities. Look at some of these rainfall totals, not just for Austria, but Slovakia, Czech Republic, a lot of them looking at least 100 millimeters, some of them even exceeding 200 millimeters. And sadly, that is not all we still have more rain yet to come. You can see the system continuing to spin during the day Monday before finally starting to dive a little bit farther south towards the Mediterranean, taking with it more of that rain towards coastal France, as well as portions of Italy and away from areas of the Czech Republic and Austria that we have seen the last few days. But even in the short term, still looking at additional rainfall and even snow for the alps, were looking at additional ten to 15 centimeters of snow for the alps and then a lot of the surrounding areas to the north, they're looking at additional 50 to 100 millimeters of rain also starting to see some new rain developed down south of proportions of Italy where we could also see an extra 50 to 100 millimeters of rain total through the next few days.
