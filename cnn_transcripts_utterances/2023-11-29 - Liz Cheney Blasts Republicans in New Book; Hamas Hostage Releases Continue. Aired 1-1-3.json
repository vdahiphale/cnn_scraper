We haven't seen the same sorts of delays and roadblocks on the way to yesterday's exchange, so we expect it will officially begin here shortly for 10 Israeli women and children. I will make one more point, and that's that the Israeli military, the IDF, said just a short time ago in a statement that two hostages, Israeli hostages, were handed over to the Red Cross that are in addition to the 10 women and children. So we're waiting for more details from that, but the process of those two has already begun, and we expect the process for the 10 others to begin soon as well and continue throughout the next few hours.",

And we're going to deal with this very carefully, because it is obviously a very sensitive and delicate story.The IDF has said they're looking into in assessing the claims made by Hamas' military wings, the al-Qassam Brigades, that 10-month-old Kfir Bibas, the youngest hostage in Hamas captivity, his older brother, 4- year-old, Ariel Bibas, and their mother, Shiri, were killed in an Israeli airstrike. The Hamas statement gave no information about where or when that strike was. It offered no evidence at all, in fact. Crucially, it also came out on the sixth day of a truce. Israel hasn't struck Gaza since Friday in any significant fashion. So there's no information about when or how this happened. The IDF says they have been in touch with the family and they hold Hamas ultimately responsible for anything that happened not only to this family, but to all the hostages calling for the release of all the hostages. We also got a statement a short time ago from the Bibas family. I will read this to you here. They say: \"Our family has learned of Hamas' latest claims. We are waiting for the information to be confirmed and hopefully refuted by military officials. We thank the people of Israel for their warm support, but kindly request privacy during this difficult time. Thank you very much.\" Wolf, crucially, as we wait for more information -- we don't have to say this. It's obvious. It is an incredibly difficult and sensitive time for the Bibas family and, of course, for all of the other families who still have loved ones in captivity in Gaza.",

The adviser to the Qatari prime minister spoke to our own Kaitlan Collins. Take a listen to what he had to say about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN:  It's an ongoing negotiation right now. I can't comment on the details of what's happening in the negotiating room at the moment, but it is happening in a positive environment, and it fills us with hope that we will be able to announce something positive by the end of the day.

And that's trying to look at the possibility of exchanging some of the men who are hostages of Hamas and the other Palestinian factions, of exchanging them for Palestinian men, and then potentially for military hostages as well. So this is a separate kind of set of discussions that we're hearing are also under way, also talks about the possibility of trying to return the bodies of hostages that have died in Gaza to get them out, but all of this, again, so delicate right now.

And as part of six-and-a-half weeks of fighting there, the death toll, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank, has been more than 14,800 Palestinian civilians killed. So if the fighting resumes again, that slaughter of Palestinian civilians will likely resume again. It'll be complicated by the fact that 1.2 million of those Palestinians in Gaza are -- have been displaced and, due to bad sanitation, sewage and destroyed infrastructure, they are -- many of them are suffering, the World Health Organization, from disease that may kill, the WHO says, more people than the actual fighting will kill as well, and all of these military operations, of course, in retaliation for the initial Hamas slaughter of more than 1,200 people on October 7 -- Wolf.",

I appreciate it a lot.The last time that I spoke with my sister was at October 7 morning from 6:30 a.m. until something about 10:00 a.m. It was on and off with me and my mom. And my mother got the last phone call from her. Most of the conversations that she had with me was about, what is she going to do? First, it was about their rockets and the missiles that were flying around like rain on them. And they didn't know -- they didn't have where to hide, because it's an open-air festival. And then, afterwards, it was a bloodshed of screaming, shooting around. People were terrified, panicking. Romi was acting -- I don't know. She was terrified. And she was hiding inside a bush for two hours. And she heard and saw all the terrorists, all Hamas terrorists around her. And she even told me to be quiet on the phone and to not speak, so they won't hear me throughout the phone. The last time that I heard her voice was a very hopeful one. And this is what I keep in my heart. She called my parents, each and every one of them separately, told them that Ben Shimoni, may he rest s in peace, picked them up, and they're heading home. So, I called her immediately, and she was freaking out, saying that she is so panicking, but everything is OK, because he knows the road. We even spoke about, I don't know, regular stuff, like what is she going to do, because her key was left behind her, and she doesn't have -- how to enter her apartment. So I was calming her down and said that everything will be OK, and soon enough she will be with my mom and come home, and we can take care of anything else afterwards. And it was a very hopeful conversation. Unfortunately, 10 minutes after, my mom got a phone call from her saying that she got shot and Ben was murdered, Gaya was murdered, and Ofir that was with them also wounded pretty badly. And she herself was -- she have a gunshot on her hand, and her hand couldn't function, and... (CROSSTALK)",

I don't know if Cheney's specific admission is admissible, because it's a third-party communication, but it certainly puts a bullseye on Kevin McCarthy and what he heard directly from Trump, that he knew he lost before he undertook all his efforts to overturn the election. Of course, it also puts into a stark relief what congressional Republicans did, so many of them joining the Mike Johnson lawsuit to overturn the results, voting to overturn the results, when their leader knew directly from President Trump in the immediate aftermath of the election that it was all based, all fundamentally rooted in a lie.",

I mean, I think that one of the key messages that comes out of what we know about this book so far is that it underscores the willingness of a broad range of Republicans to participate in an effort to overturn the election, despite, as I said, their leader knowing from the outset, in essence, from the horse's mouth, that it was all based on a falsehood. And that has big implications for 2025. I don't think Republicans are going to countenance another full-scale physical attack on the Capitol, but this does raise, I think, the issue of how far they would go again if they are in control of the House when votes have to be certified in January 2025 to support efforts by Trump to overturn the election, particularly if they are in the majority and he is the nominee again.",
