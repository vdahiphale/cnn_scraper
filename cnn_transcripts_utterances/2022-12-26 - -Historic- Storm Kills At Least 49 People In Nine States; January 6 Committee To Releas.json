Now, you get up toward Watertown, this is Lake Ontario. This is a deeper lake so it has warmer waters and that cold air is coming right up through the lake. So Watertown and surrounding counties still under a warning, they could see another foot, maybe a couple inches for the buffalo area. Buffalo typically gets their lake effect snows early in the season. Until these lakes, Phil, freeze over, the lake-effect snow machine still in full force.So, again, as the winter progresses, we're going to start to see this dwindle somewhat, only a little bit left in Buffalo but this was a storm nor a generation, touted as that. How often do you have an area of low pressure drop in from Canada, drop to equivalent category 2 hurricane which broadens the wind field and, therefore, you get wind chills that are minus 50, minus 60, minus 70 degrees. Hey, a little surprise snow, icy roads in southern Tennessee, Northern Mississippi, and Alabama, Atlanta could see some flurries. Not associated with this monitor storm that's going to drop quite a bit. Look at Ontario, you think it's worse here, or bad here, it is. It's more widespread to the north. Watertown roads are slushy, a lot of crews on the roads, they're going to continue to be below freezing for a while. This warm up, Phil, is a dividing line. Miami had their coldest Christmas on record with a high of 50. L.A. had their second warmest at 84. The temperatures are still quite cold but behind this little clipper notice a high of 11 in Minneapolis, 15 Omaha, 22 Chicago. But look at the dramatic warm up. Here's our next flooding -- flash flooding with all of this snowfall, the ice will clog into areas of the sewer drains so we're going to have urban flooding. You get near 50 degrees in Buffalo and your lows are in the 40s, Chicago, too, and that comes with rain. So, again, just remember the warm up is coming, it's going to be a massive melt off, but if you are out there shoveling remember the heart is beating faster to keep your body warmer, if you shovel a one car driveway with a foot of snow, it's equivalent to moving 4 tons. So, easy does it. We are going to most likely find, unfortunately, more victims in this crazy, crazy storm.",

So by raising the possibility of peace talks, they can appeal to some NATO members like Germany that have war fatigue and perhaps starting to pressure -- the French President Emmanuel Macron as well -- potentially pressuring the Ukrainians to start thinking about concessions. Ukraine said there is no end to the war until they get back Crimea which was taken by Russia illegally nearly nine years ago.And so, they think that this is Russia trying to cause a divide between the U.S., Ukraine and NATO. They also think this is Putin buying time to train his hundreds of thousands conscripts, some of whom are assembling, you know, to the northern border of Ukraine, Belarus, ready for potentially -- the Ukrainians are saying for another ground invasion attempt early next year.",

In our national lead, border officials in the Texas' El Paso region encountered between 1,500 and 1,600 migrants every day despite dangerous, below freezing temperatures. A drop from previous weeks when authorities came across as many as 2,500 per day. As CNN's Camila Bernal reports, many migrants spent the holiday on the street under blankets to combat frigid temperatures. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A dream come true in the form of a hula hoop, toys their parents say they would not be able to afford in native Venezuela. An opportunity for his children, says this 30-year-old, who left his country more than three months ago with his partner and four children. In November, they made it to the U.S. and turned themselves in to immigration authorities. They sent us back, he said. And because they're not legally married, the two got separated, and after about a week in a detention center, they ended up in two different cities in Mexico. Elvin's partner Caroline says she was told they were being sent back to Mexico because of Title 42, which allows border agents to immediately expel migrants, citing COVID-19 concerns. And this is what they say led them to an illegal crossing 20 days later. I wanted to cross legally, says Caroline, but as a family, they felt they had no other option. It's a desperation felt by many here. And, as a result, they end up on the streets during a cold front in El Paso. The city accommodates those who have documentation taking more than 400 people into this makeshift shelter in its convention center over the holiday weekend. Others ending up in Washington, D.C., outside of Vice President Kamala Harris' residence.",

So, the biggest announcement is from January 8. The country is dropping quarantine requirements for all international arrivals.Now, to understand why this is such a big deal, we have to look at what the reality has been. So, throughout the pandemic, China has been severely limiting who can go in and out of China, with strict border controls, flights have been very limited and expensive, all arrivals had to go through quarantine in government facilities. So, I went through multiple quarantines myself, including 21 days earlier this year. And, Phil, these are hard quarantines. So, no opening your door except for food pickups and COVID tests. But, look, a lot still remains unclear. We don't know how many flights will be allowed to enter the country or how easily Chinese nationals will be able to travel out.

But, again, that information was not made public and this medical system in this country is under a huge amount of pressure, fever and cold medicine nearly impossible to get at drugstores. But in a huge announcement, Beijing has said it is going to start distributing Paxlovid to community health centers in the comes days. That's a big deal because it's been hard for people to access antivirals. For example, in mid-December an online platform started selling Paxlovid but it sold out almost immediately -- Phil.",

Now, also in our health lead, respiratory illnesses have been circulating throughout the U.S. for weeks now, ruining holiday plans for many this year. New data from the CDC shows the seasonal flu activity is still prevalent in most parts of the country but states seen here in red with very high levels. Joining me now is Dr. Peter Hotez. There's at least some positive news, Dr. Hotez, hospital admissions for the flu dropped again for the second week in a row. Are we seeing a sign that the flu season may have peaked in the U.S.? DR. PETER HOTEZ, CO-DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AT TEXAS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL:  It's starting to look that way. It looks as though, Phil, that it peaked early, about two or three weeks ago and now it's starting to decline. Although it's really important to point out that the level of flu activity in the United States is still quite high. So if you have not gotten your flu vaccine, now is the time to do it. The big unknown with regards to influenza is as those numbers start to decline do they stay down or do we see another peak as we hit January or February. We've sometimes seen that, it sort of goes up and down. So, it's a bit unknown. It rose very early, we were great, the numbers would steadily climb into January. Right now, it's not looking that way, so perhaps some optimism.",

So, that's a perfect story. So, that's a humanitarian tragedy waiting to happen.Some analytics groups are saying 5,000 deaths a day. You know, and maybe 1 to 2 million deaths overall before this is over. And then when you allow this virus to circulate among an unvaccinated or undervaccinated population, we know what happens with that.

There are buildings, streets, locations, that will also be renamed. This is all part of a process the superintendent of the U.S. military academy, more commonly known as West Point, says this will be a multi-phased approach. It will take time as they work through this and there's a committee named the Memorialization History and Museum Committee that will look for recommendations for what to replace the names with. That part hasn't been decided yet. But the school did note, the Academy did note, I should say, that some of these that have to be renamed are class gifts, so they want to do this with a measure of respect in coordination with the class. As you point out, Phil, it's all part of the process that stems from the NDAA back in late 2020, Congress passed this with bipartisan support overriding former President Donald Trump's veto to institute this naming commission. The commission first looked at names of military facilities, recommending Fort Bragg be changed to Fort Liberty, then a look at the Service Academies, and it looked at a list of other items. It is West Point that's getting the attending now as the superintendent says the renaming process at the school will begin in the coming days.",
