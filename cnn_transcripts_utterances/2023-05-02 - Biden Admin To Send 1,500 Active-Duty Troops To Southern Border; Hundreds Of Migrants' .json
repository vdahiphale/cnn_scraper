The president, ordering 1,500 active-duty troops to the southern border. Already thousands of people camped out ready to enter the United States, and city say they are simply unprepared for the coming migrant surge.Plus, countdown to crisis. The treasury secretary puts a clock on how much longer America can pay its bills. June 1, that calendar crunch spurs the president and the House Speaker to set a meeting, but there is no movement on the big details. And Ron DeSantis nears his 2024 moment by making clear cultural war fights on abortion, on the mouse, even on the death penalty are central to his campaign in waiting. Up first for us this hour though, a big new Biden White House plan to help with a brewing border crisis. Sources telling CNN, the Pentagon will now deploy 1,500 more active-duty troops to the U.S. Mexico border. The decision comes just days before the pandemic era Title 42 expires and days before as a result of anticipated surge of migrants into the United States. Let's get straight to the Pentagon, CNN's Natasha Bertrand. Natasha, tell us more.",

In anticipation of that, we are learning that they are preparing to send approximately 1,500 active-duty troops to the border in order to help DHS. This came at the request of the Department of Homeland Security.And those 1,500 troops are not going to be performing any kind of law enforcement function according to U.S. officials. Instead, they will be providing support in terms of data entry, administrative functions, other things including ground-based detection and monitoring warehouse support. So basically, logistical help so that CBP, Customs and Border Protection can actually get out in the field and not be kind of hampered by those administrative functions. All of this, of course, coming as the administration including the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is saying publicly that they do expect the surge of migrants to try to cross the border when that Title 42 era law expires. But again, these troops will not be performing a law enforcement function and they will primarily be behind desks, John?",

With me to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Arlette Saenz, Jackie Kucinich of The Boston Globe, and Tia Mitchell of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Arlette, it's a big step for the White House. To Natasha's point, these troops it's been done before, they're largely to perform administrative duties. But the idea that you need 1,500 more troops to help the Department of Homeland Security, it comes in a time. 1,500 troops to the border. The president just yesterday saying, he wants to designate more than $50 million for an unexpected urgent migration needs. New paths to legal migration, new asylum restrictions, they're considering family detention for migrants who enter illegally. The president knows he's going to be sharply criticized from a political perspective, these policy moves, how at the White House do they think is next week going to be as bad as Rosa seems to believe?",

You saw as Rosa described there, how these cities are already being overwhelmed by these migrants who have come in now. There are more waiting across the border. And so, what you're seeing the White House trying to do at this moment is showing that they are taking some steps. But of course, the president is going to face a major political headache when it comes to the lifting of Title 42. As Republicans are eager to pounce on him on the issue. You have his own allies, who in many ways think that some of the steps that they've been taking are too harsh. This is also an issue that yes, it's driven by policy, but it's also driven by optics.

But now they're starting to head back up. So, the question is, from a policy standpoint, can you do anything? But the politics on this issue have been stuck for years, for years and years and years. This is Tony Gonzales from a border district in Texas saying, it's about to get worse and it's time we do something. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TONY GONZALES, (R-TX): Everyone is looking at May 11, as this day where, you know, where Title 42 is going to end. In my eyes, Title 42 might as well have already ended. In places like El Paso are completely overwhelmed. We need to give them the resources we need. And this is what the -- this is a part of the Biden administration is missing. They're adding capacity.

I think therein lies the problem that everyone's looking at right now, particularly as that calendar is getting so dangerously close to the potential for something that's never happened before and would without any question at all be catastrophic as a U.S. default on its debt.Here's the reality of where things stand. Obviously, House Republicans pass their bill. There's a lot of question here at the White House in the building behind me that they could actually do that. They were able to get that across the finish line. And in large part that was done in order to start negotiations. Negotiations the White House has said repeatedly will not happen. And continue to say, will not happen even with the meeting one week from today. When you talk to White House officials, John, there's a couple of things they make clear. One, they feel like they have the political high ground on this issue. A clean debt ceiling increase, the idea of not using the debt ceiling, not using catastrophic default as some piece of leverage. They feel like it's something that they can win in terms of a political battle. That is important because in these battles, and you've been through so many of them over the years. Usually, it's not that there's some grand compromise. It's usually one side politically, bludgeons the other and the other has to break. That has long been the position of Democrats and they have remained unified on that position over the course of the last several months. The question now, given where Republicans are, given that they've passed this bill, and the White House making clear they are not ready to negotiate. What is the off ramp? Is it some type of formalized budget structured, formalized spending proposals going forward? That's something that will be raised during the meeting, but there are so many unanswered questions. And John, just so little time in the next 30 days or so.",

Biden was around during that period.So, could that be an route that they decide to take? I mean, we'll see over the course of the next few weeks. But Democrats have been insistent for the past few months that they don't want to do -- have a debt ceiling height without any -- with conditions attached to it. So, we'll see exactly how they decide to navigate. I also think one thing that's going to be interesting is to watch the Biden and McCarthy dynamic. Because Biden, you know, as vice president was very involved with fiscal negotiations up on Capitol Hill, but he had a relationship with Mitch McConnell, him and Kevin McCarthy don't really know each other.
