I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is just before 6:00 in the evening. As the IDF withdraws forces from Khan Yunis in Gaza, the military says it is preparing to move from defense to attack on the Lebanese border. Plus, CNN sits down with the Japanese Prime Minister, why his country is reinforcing its defense capabilities after decades of pacifist policies. In the United States, the Biden administration unveiling a new student loan forgiveness program, but will it go into effect in time for the November election? And later in this show, we are live from a mass wedding, where star crossed lovers plan to tie the knot under the solar eclipse. Well, some major battlefield shifts by Israel this hour as Israeli troops withdraw from Khan Yunis, people first started returning to that devastated city in Gaza. This CNN footage shows utter ruin and destruction as far as the eye can see and the IDF says it is, \"Far from stopping military operations in Gaza.\" Israel's defense minister says troops are leaving Khan Yunis in order to prepare for, and I quote here, \"follow up missions,\" including the border city of Rafah where more than a million Palestinian civilians are crammed in. CNN's Nic Robertson is live from Jerusalem. Nic, what can you tell us about what is going on on the ground and this military withdrawal from Khan Yunis?",

It had the most brigades in it that have ever been used, which gives you an idea of the scope of the battle. The IDF there found themselves facing multiple layers of Hamas tunnels as they tried to find the hostages there. The destruction on the city though after four months of their presence has been huge. And in the past 24 hours, people have been able to get a look and see it for themselves. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice over): Khan Yunis's highway of hell shattered witness to four deadly months of Israeli occupation. Nothing untouched. The Jaffa Mosque reduced to rubble. The AFA (ph) gas station destroyed, spreading out from the thoroughfare a city sized stamp of destruction. Almost every building in the southern Gazan hub. Once home to 420,000 Palestinians wrecked by Israeli troops searching for Hamas. The scale testimony of the ferocity of the fight, the graffiti left behind. Venom Gaza for the Jews, it reads. The IDF's sudden departure over the weekend, opening the way for residents to return to what's left of their homes. It is a shock, a shock what happened. It was not small while coming here in the car, I saw things, the destruction is unbearable. Mohammed Abou Diab tells the cameraman, I'm going to my house and I know it's destroyed. I'm going to remove the rubble and get a shirt out. Return is not victory here. It's resilience. Salim going back to his destroyed home. I will put a tent on it. Even if they destroy all of Khan Yunis, we will stay here and we are steadfast. At first, just a trickle of people coming back, many weary that withdrawal not what it seems and with good reason. A drive along the border fence where the troop pulled out showing just that.",

As Israel says its mission then in Gaza is anything but over more than 100 hostages still held captive as we surpass six months of war. It is also moving its military into attack mode and its border with Lebanon. Israel says it has killed a Hezbollah commander in an overnight strike on southern Lebanon. The IDF has been exchanging fire with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah since October but in a statement on Sunday, the IDF said it would move from defense to offense. Meantime, Iran's foreign minister is in Damascus as both Israel and the U.S. are on high alert for an attack by Iran. Tehran blames Israel for a strike on its embassy compound in Syria last week that killed seven officials. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. And Ben, what do you make of this threat from Iran?

Hezbollah is a sophisticated, probably the most sophisticated, well-trained, well-armed non state actor in the world, they have the ability to inflict pain on Israel, and Israel is well aware of that. And as we've seen, they are preparing for the possibility of some sort of war. So, it would be a very destructive war on both sides. I was here, you were here in 2006 and we saw the amount of destruction that was happening on this side of the border, also within Israel, there was huge disruption. Tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of Israelis had to leave the northern part of the country because of Hezbollah's ability to fire missiles well inside Israel, so a war between the two sides would be very disruptive. And for instance, we've heard -- we saw a statement from the Prime Minister's spokesman in Jerusalem, saying that Hezbollah goes to war with Israel.

What is different now though, is the fact that speaker Johnson has been signaling and having conversations privately that he is on the cusp of wanting to do something when it comes to aiding Ukraine as they continue their war against Russia. Now, one thing that remains very clear is that Democrats, Republicans in the Senate, they believe now is the time for House Republicans to do something. But Johnson has yet to unveil the specifics of a plan. He has been floating a series of ideas including repossessing some assets that are seized from Russia, transferring those assets to Ukraine, creating some kind of loan program, so that the money that the U.S. sends to Ukraine would be repaid in some form. But that can be difficult when you're talking about the presidential drawdown fund, which essentially just replenishes U.S. weapons supplies that the U.S. is sending to Ukraine. So, he has several ideas who has been floating behind the scenes, his office has been having conversations with the Biden administration. But the issue for Johnson personally is if he moves forward with this aid against - - to help Ukraine, he could face a vote to oust him from Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has been threatening to bring this forward if Johnson moves ahead with any additional funding for Ukraine, Becky.",

If you're looking at some places like Little Rock, where we'll have some mostly cloudy skies a little bit close to that system, your totalities at 1:51. Place like Rochester, also, finding some mostly cloudy skies with your peak at 3:20. Now, what's so cool about this too is we will find temperatures taking a dip while you have the peak totality of that shadow, because it's cutting off the energy from the sun. So, those temperatures are going to briefly come down and will pop back up once the shadow moves away from the sun, and we get those temperatures to rebound. So, something that we'll have to watch out for closely. So not only will you experience the total darkness in totality, you'll experience that temperature drop, the relative humidity increases as the temperatures dip closer to that dew point the winds could have decreased too. And so could your cloud cover.",
