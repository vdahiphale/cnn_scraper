In their own words, stunning testimony revealed new transcripts out yesterday and today from the January 6th committee. Star witness Cassidy Hutchinson among them -- admitting she was pressured to not talk by her first lawyer, paid by the Trump super PAC, and her final straw was with him when he suggested she risk a contempt of Congress charge. What more might we learn from the committee's final report? Plus, nightmare before Christmas. Snow, ice, and dangerous arctic blast. Thousands of flights canceled, possible deaths where the weather may have been a contributing factor. And forget Siri, forget Alexa, see the future of artificial intelligence. The powerful and alarming content that technology can create all on its own. (MUSIC) And welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. We begin today in our politics lead and a treasure trove of interview transcripts newly-released from the January 6 Committee's long awaited, and still, as of right now, unreleased final reporting, including the full testimony from the panel star witness, former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, in which she details pressure from her first Trump aligned lawyer, Stefan Passantino, to not cooperate with the committee, even at the risk of being held in contempt of Congress. Hutchinson telling the committee, quote, it wasn't just that I had Stephen sitting next to me, it was almost like I felt like I had Trump looking over my shoulder. Hutchinson also testifying that she told her mother, quote, I'm f'ed, in the days leading up to her very first interview with the committee, fearing that Trump allies would ruin her life if she was open and honest with the committee. Other transcripts show leading figures in Trump's scheme to overturn the 2020 election, despite all sorts of grandiose pronouncements repeatedly invoking their Fifth Amendment right and refusing to answer any questions from the committee. CNN's Sara Murray is digging into all the transcripts for us, which are revealing for the first time intriguing new aspects about the committees closed doors disposition.

Whatever it was, as a miracle, Cassidy Hutchinson told the committee behind closed doors that she was told by then deputy chief of staff, Tony Ornato, in front of Secret Service agent, Bobby Engel, that in The Beast, then President Trump, on January 6, 2021, quote, tried to wrap his hands around Bobby's neck and strangle him because he wouldn't take him to the Capitol. Hutchinson also testify behind closed doors that when meeting with her first attorney, then Trump super PAC paid attorney, Stefan Passantino, his response to her desire to tell the truth about that story about what Ornato told her, quote, I remember he, like, sat back in his chair and he's, like, no, no, no, no, we don't want to go there, we don't want to talk about that, unquote. Hutchinson later dropped Passantino for fear that he was more concerned about protecting Trump than protecting her. Now, the people who can confirm whatever happened in The Beast, the driver, and bobby angle, and Tony Ornato, who is allegedly told by angle about what happened in The Beast, have all obtained private attorneys, not using those provided at no cost to them by the U.S. Secret Service. That fact is something that members of the committee clearly find suspicious. In private testimony, the committee revealed, or not said, he could not recall conveying that story to Hutchinson or conveying it to another White House employee who said that Ornato told him a similar story. The committee said, it is, quote, skeptical of Ornato's account, unquote.

Dr. Ranney, always good to see you. Based on the patients you see, what's your advice to the parents of sick kids when it is hard in so many places to come by antibiotics and pain medications? DR. MEGAN RANNEY, ASSOCIATE DEAN OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BROWN UNIVERSITY: This fall and winter feels like the viral season that never ends. It feels like back when my kids were back in daycare for the first time and every week, they were coming down with something new. So, the first thing is to keep those anti fever medicines, acetaminophen or Tylenol, and ibuprofen, also known as motion or Advil, keep those stocked in your house so that you are not running out when your kid gets a fever, desperately trying to find a pharmacy that has it in stock. Have a couple of bottles around, particularly that liquid suspension, which is most difficult to find. Have hydrating drinks too, Pedialyte, Gatorade, something that your kid likes to drink that will help get them through this fever and this viral season. And then have your pediatrician or urgent care phone number available. Like you said, a lot of what we are seeing right now is nothing that we can treat. It is random viruses that we often see in the fall and that we are just seeing a little earlier and a little stronger. There are some diseases, though, that we can treat. Flu, if your kid's high risk, obviously, COVID, there are some treatments, particularly if your kid's high risk. And of course, we are seeing increases in strep throat as well.

This is one of the bits of technology, remember where you heard about it first, because this is going to change your life. It does have some problems still, it's knowledge so far only goes up to 2021, because it's not Googling disinformation, it has it inside. But, they're also working on more advanced -- nothing more convincing about this does over than to look at this, Jake. This is a screen of Chat GPT, where I wrote in a simple question here. I said, write a short letter for software company job application. I'm friendly, like movies, and although I have no computer experience, I once worked at a zoo. Put it in and moments, it spits out: Dear employer, I'm writing to express my interest in the company of opening, although I have no prior experience in the field of computer science. I'm a quick learner and eager to start my career. One of my strengths is my friendly personality, which I believe would make me a valuable asset. In my previous job at the zoo, I enjoyed interact with visitors and providing excellent customer service in my free time, I like watching movies and so far, so forth. This letter was created right now, as we watch. This is not in a memory bank somewhere. It wrote this using artificial intelligence. It can write essays this way, it can write poetry this way. I had it earlier today right a very touching sentimental letter to my 93 year old mother about missing her Christmas time. I still wanted to see if he could do it, and it wrote a very credible letter. This will change your world because suddenly, it's going to take a lot of writing, as Rushkoff notes, that maybe we don't always want to do. My mother's letter aside, and say, I will do that for you. And it can write the things you care about.",
