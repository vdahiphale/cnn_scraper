I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. 1,000 days of war, and for the first time ever, Ukraine fires U.S.-made long-range missiles into Russia. The attack comes just days after President Biden gave Kyiv the green light to use the American weapons, ATACMS, to hit inside the country. Russian air defenses said they shot down five of the missiles and another was damaged. The Kremlin, meanwhile, is escalating its own campaign against Ukraine, blanketing the country with drone and missile attacks. And Vladimir Putin today updating the country's nuclear doctrine, which would, in theory, lower the bar for for the use of nuclear weapons. Well, Former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger is concerned about what Donald Trump's return to the White House could mean for Kyiv and for American democracy. Kinzinger, you might recall, cut his political career short, calling his former party a cult and later endorsing Kamala Harris. Adam Kinzinger joins me now live from Texas. Adam, welcome back to the program. It's always good to see you. FMR. REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL), CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FOUNDER, COUNTRY FIRST:  Good to be with you.",

I mean, it doesn't mean thatall of a sudden, you know, Russia is going to be -- going to lose, they're going to be cowering. But what this does is this expands the distance at which Ukraine can defend itself from where it's being attacked from. You can talk about taking out supply nodes, areas of weapon storage, ammunition storage. They just, I think, about a month or two ago, hit a massive ammunition depot that basically slowed down the amount of fire against Ukrainians from the Russians. So, that's why this ATACMS expansion is so important. And let's keep this in mind, because I hear people all the time say, you know, what's the goal? What's the end game for Ukraine? The end game, the pressure is on Russia. All a defending country has to do to win is to keep defending. You know, this idea that a defending country has to somehow reach in and I guess invade an -- invading country is not the case. You just have to defend. And the Ukrainians have defended themselves unbelievably. We -- I mean, the intelligence briefings I got, I was in Congress still when this invasion kicked off, was that this was going to be just a matter of a couple days that Russia was going to be -- going to, you know, fight. And then there would be some kind of an insurgency going on from then on. Ukraine has been amazing. And this is truly the most important issue facing our world today.",

He has famously campaigned on saying this war will end on day one. We know his past affinity and the comments that he's made about Vladimir Putin that has raised a lot of eyebrows. What, if anything, do you see in terms of his national security advisers and military picks for his cabinet in particular? Let's talk about Pete Hegseth, defense secretary, a decorated former veteran who served his country but has no experience running an organization the size of the Pentagon. And then Tulsi Gabbard, who -- at DNI, who also has made some very controversial comments in what appeared to be blaming Ukraine for Russia's invasion as well as showing sympathy for Bashar Assad of all people.",

So, Japan, I think, gave Ukraine a bunch of weapons at one point and Tulsi that day tweeted,reminding the world that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in World War II. I mean, like, you can't make this up. It was like, OK, you are that much in the -- on the side of Vladimir Putin that you're angry that Japan is giving weapons to Ukraine, so you're going to bring up Pearl Harbor, like it's nuts. And I was in Congress with her. So, I was actually friends with Tulsi up until the day she went and visited Bashar al-Assad. I mean, this guy, obviously, as we know, is a butcher, a genocide guy, you know, special place in hell for him when he finally does meet his end. And she went and met with him and gave propaganda to him to use to continue to hold on to power, gave -- gives propaganda daily to the Russian regime. They call her basically their girlfriend. Look, this is obviously very bad. She's a terrible decision for DNI, director of national intelligence. I don't know why any ally would cooperate on intelligence with us if she gets this. Pete Hegseth, I think his knee jerk reaction would be correct, but he's so eager to please Donald Trump that who knows, and really the same with Marco Rubio. My hope here, Bianna, it is that in the end Donald Trump recognizes the damage that leaving Afghanistan did, for instance, to Joe Biden. It really was when his approval rating went from 50 some percent to underwater and never recovered. If Ukraine was to collapse under Donald Trump, the American people would be really upset about this. So, would the world. And I think that could do real damage to his reputation. So, that's how we continue to get to Donald Trump. But there's no doubt, I think he's the least best of the two people running for president to continue to help Ukraine defend himself, which is why Europe has to step up. Europe has to do their job now in defending their own continent because, hopefully, we'll still be there with them, but we don't know.",

We also need to look at that with the State Department, by the way, in terms of what they've done with some of their visas. But here's the best part about that whole thing. Donald Trump is the reason we left Afghanistan. I mean, I get it. Joe Biden was the president at the moment we left Afghanistan. And he does own all of the tactical kind of embarrassments that happened in that withdrawal, but it was Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump that set Joe Biden up for no win situation. They basically made a deal with the Taliban that we would leave after 18 months. They had the troop number set so that Joe Biden either had to increase troops in Afghanistan or pull them out. I think he should have increased troops in Afghanistan, but obviously, a tough decision for a president. Donald Trump owns this as much as Joe Biden does. And so, this - - like, you know, it's Donald Trump. I mean, obviously, this guy doesn't take accountability for anything. This is his fault as much as it's anybody else's.",

The president under insurrection acts or national defense orwhatever they put it under has the right to enforce immigration, and that can be at the border and that can be within the interior of the United States. What Congress can do is pass laws to prohibit the president from using certain funds to actually do that. That's how you stop a president from acting. Obviously, with the makeup of the House and the Senate, that's not going to be the case. There's going to be no effort to stop Trump. So, he can do this. Now, here's where the question is, and this is -- I'm not convinced that once Americans start seeing people that are brown, you know, basically because they're brown, being rounded up, checked for their IDs, put in camps, and deported to a country -- by the way, you have to have cooperation from the country you're deporting them to. It's not like we can hostilely land in Mexico City and let a bunch of people off or, you know, in El Salvador. You have to have cooperation from that country. And I think once American -- look, I disagree with the election of Donald Trump. It was still a very close election. The American people though are not savages. And when you start seeing families being torn apart, I think this turns against Donald Trump in record pace. I don't think he's going to be able to do this. He talks about deporting criminals. We're already deporting criminals. This is already being done, by the way. So, look, yes, he has every right to do it. He may try. Stephen Miller, the dark lord under him, probably will try, but the American people, I don't think you're going to stand for what this looks like in actuality when it goes from theory to reality.",

They got pushed out or they left or they quit. There are so many that don't. And every day it continues to baffle me that there are people that are willing to literally go down this path to authoritarianism to be -- to have some proximity to power for a short amount of time. I read my bible. This is everything that the bible warns against, by the way. And so, yes, it does surprise me. And it surprises me that January 6th wasn't a bigger issue.

What was important for me as the author of this nonfiction book with 100 pages of end notes that was very scrupulously reported was not to be in there with some fantasy that what we were making was a documentary, but to make sure that in the places where a license was taken, that it felt as though it was a reasonable license to take.

And she was the first woman to join the Irish Republican Army as a sort of a frontline soldier. So, generations of women had been involved in the IRA in the past, but they were always doing things like hiding weapons or helping injured men. They were sort of behind the lines. And she essentially said, listen, I want to be out there carrying a gun and planning operations. And that was very intriguing to me, reading that in the obituary, because on some level, for me, The Troubles had seemed like a very male story. So, to learn that there was this woman who joined with her sister, Marian, and that the two of them actually went on hunger strike. They bombed London in 1973, they were thrown into Brixton Prison, and they went on hunger strike, which at the time, was sort of front page news, in 1973. That story to me seemed so interesting. And then the other aspect of it that I picked up in that obituary was that in later years, in middle age, Dolours Price looked back at the things she had done as a young woman in her early 20s, and was really kind of reconsidering, you know, what was it all for? Was it worth it, the things that I did? So, what I was trying to do in the book and what I think we've done successfully in the series is really interrogate the nature of radical politics and violence used in this kind of a cause, looking both at the allure of it but also at the cost of it, the human cost of it, for the victims and also for the perpetrators themselves.",

So, she was a widow of 10 children, and suddenly, she was -- she disappeared. And I guess she was accused of being a snitch for the authorities against the IRA.

So, Jean McConville was really one of the more iconic victims of The Troubles. She was a widow. She was Protestant, living in a Catholic area. She was a mother of 10. And in the winter of 1972, a gang of masked intruders came in and pulled her out of her apartment in this big kind of imposing housing complex in West Belfast. Her children were clinging to her legs. And this gang said, listen, we want to take her away. We just want to talk to her for a few hours. We'll bring her back. But never did. And those kids grew up eventually in orphanages, not knowing what had happened to their mother. They were split up after her abduction and disappearance, and it emerged much later that she'd been killed by the IRA. And that Dolours Price, that woman, had something to do with this. That she was somehow involved. So, for me, that was the seed that started this whole project, was the idea of telling a story about these two very different women. One of them a victim, one of them a perpetrator. And this act of violence that connected them. And that would really come to haunt all of Northern Ireland. Because this question of what happened to Jean McConville is a sort of a shadow that continues to hang over the place today. In the series, the first thing you see is the abduction of Jean McConville. It's a terrifying scene. You see her children.

Maybe we can sort of move beyond it without ever actually disowning the worst things that happened. And I think it's kind of an open question whether they will succeed as a really viable political party in being able to do that, in being able to essentially kind of, you know, make no apologies, not actually revisit in any real open way the worst of the extremes of The Troubles, but instead, just kind of stick with the talking points and become a different sort of party, right?

Pelicot then husband, Dominique, admits to drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious over a nine-year period from 2011 to 2020. Throughout the court proceedings, Pelicot braved the public, the media, and her attackers, all the while using it as an opportunity to call out the misogyny in our society and violence against women and girls. She should never have had to waive her right to anonymity, but by refusing to be silenced, she offers hope to survivors of sexual violence. In her final statement this morning, she said, I don't think I'll ever feel at peace until the end of my life. I'll learn to live with it. I'll rebuild myself. And also highlighted how it's time that the macho patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes. It's time that we change the way we look at rape. As this graffiti outside the courthouse shows, many are thanking her for her bravery. Well, back to the U.S. The election here has highlighted a distrust in American institutions. Many working-class voters opted to vote Republican due to the reputation of Democrats being the party for the educated elite. So, what's led this divide?

Over the last 70 years, we created a world in which people who do really well in school, get to go to fancy colleges, marry each other, invest heavily in their kids. They get to go to fancy colleges. They move to the same 10 or 12 cities, Austin, San Francisco, Washington, and they've created an inherited caste structure.

We'll bring them to places like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and they'll run the society really well. So, inherently, he was creating a new elite. The problem with his vision was that, A, rich families learned to game the system. And the second problem with his system is he didn't have the right definition of human ability. For him, it was all IQ. And IQ is important. It really is. If you want to be an astrophysicist, probably important to have a high IQ. But those of us who, you know, live life know there are other things that are more important. Being curious, having a passionate drive, being a good teammate agility, knowing how to move in life so it's you're graceful toward other people and decisive toward yourself.

But none of them were geniuses and none of them were creative. Intelligence is not the same as creativity. Intelligence is not the same as good judgment. Highly intelligent people are really good at persuading themselves. Their own false ideas are true. And so, eat a lot of other things aside from that. And so, to me, when you -- and so, you look at a study of -- somebody did a study of students and they gave him a bunch of consulting problems like as if they were in a consulting firm and the Ivy League kids did only a tiny amount better than the other kids. And so, for example, Adam Grant took the results of that study and calculated that a Yale grad, in these consulting problems, did about 1.9 percent better than a grad from Cleveland State, and that's not a big difference.

The second thing is we need -- one of the problems is our high schools and elementary schools and middle schools oriented themselves to feed into this system, where grades, AP tests and SATs are really what matter primarily. But some schools have ways of doing education that's different. And one of the models I describe, and they're all out there, and I find most teachers I talk to love these models, they'd love to transfer to this kind of model. So, for example, one kind of this model is called Project-Based Education. There are no grades, there are no class periods, you're part of a team and you're given a big project to work on. So, there's a school called High Tech High, which I happened to recently see a documentary about, and some of the students there were in a team and they had to analyze why do civilizations decline. And then, they not only had to analyze it, they built this big wooden gizmo with levers and gears and charts with all the different factors that feed into a civilizational decline. So, they were thinking about a problem together. They were working with their hands on something together, and they were producing a product. And that's more like life. And so, when you come out of a one of these project- based learnings, you may have grades and you have SAT scores, but you also have a portfolio. A portfolio of your accomplishments. And some schools have a thing called a portfolio defense, where they get the students in front of a team of teachers, and they ask them, why'd you make this decision? Why do you make that decision? And that's more like how the workplace works. So, when you get that kind of school, then you're nurturing certain abilities, like initiative, working on teams, having desire, being curious, being able to work hard through a difficult problem. And so, you're cultivating that, and you can't quantify it, but you can create a biography of the person and then that can be sent off to schools and they can find the right person.
