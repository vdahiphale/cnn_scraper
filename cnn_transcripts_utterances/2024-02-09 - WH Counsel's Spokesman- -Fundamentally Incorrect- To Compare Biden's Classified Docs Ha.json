      "sentences": "You know, it really is not clear at this point. And we have little to no details about exactly whatthis evacuation of the city of Rafah would look like, how it would factor into a planned Israeli military offensive in that city. The United Nations now saying that 1.4 million people are crammed into that city, that's more than half of Gaza's population. And all we have today from the Israeli Prime Minister's office is that the Prime Minister directed the military to plan for the evacuation of civilians in Rafah, this comes a couple of days after the Israeli Prime Minister said that the military would be advancing into Rafah next. And so it's clear that the plans for this offensive seem to have proceeded planning for the civilian population that is actually living in that city. But the Israeli Prime Minister saying effectively that there is no way to destroy Hamas as he has laid out that objective for this war without going into that city of Rafah, where he says that there are four Hamas battalions remaining describing that city as Hamas's last bastion. Of course, it has also become the last refuge for so many Palestinians in Gaza who have been seeking refuge there. And we know that in the past, the Israeli military has of course sought to evacuate civilians from cities where they have been planning to conduct significant ground offensive operations. But in many cases, we've also seen that those plans often don't provide the level of safety and security that humanitarian aid officials have been calling for. People have been able to evacuate some of these cities. But in many cases, we have seen that those safe evacuation corridors have not been as safe as initially described. So, the United States, obviously, bringing enormous pressure to bear now with the U.S. President, as you just heard there, saying that the Israeli military response in Gaza has been over the top. But significantly, his national security spokesman, John Kirby, also saying that a military operation right now in Rafah would be a, \"disaster\" for the civilian population there if Israel does not sufficiently plan for that population. So, it appears that right now that planning is indeed underway. But exactly what that will look like, where they will go, and whether or not there will be the significant humanitarian resources in the place where they are told to evacuate to all major question marks at this hour.",

So unfortunately, if the situation becomes more dangerous, if the conduct of hostilities expands into the Rafah governorate, this will only shrink the already limited humanitarian space to achieve the very minimum of humanitarian response by humanitarian actors, especially if adequate safeguards to human life in such densely populated areas during, you know, the conduct of hostilities are not considered.
