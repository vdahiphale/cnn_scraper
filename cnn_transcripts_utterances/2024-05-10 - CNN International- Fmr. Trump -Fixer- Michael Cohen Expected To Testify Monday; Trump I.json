We've just learned when exactly another major witness in this case will appear. We'll give you an update just ahead.The breaking news today coming out of the hush money trial is what will happen on Monday. CNN has learned that former Trump fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, a key prosecution witness, will take the witness stand on Monday, after the weekend. Cohen's testimony is expected to last several days, including cross-examination. Trump's former attorney is at the center of this case. He made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels to kill that story of an alleged affair right before the 2016 election. Former Trump personal aide Madeleine Westerhout finished her testimony in just the last hour. On Thursday, she testified that the leaders of the Republican National Committee were rattled by the release of the Access Hollywood tape, and briefly considered replacing Donald Trump on the 2016 presidential ticket. All that before the decision to pay the money to kill the Stormy Daniels story. Joining us now, Michael Zeldin, former federal prosecutor, the host of \"That Said With Michael Zeldin\" podcast.

We've had a lot of compelling evidence that is circumstantial, that you can ask yourself, does it make sense that Trump wouldn't know about these monies and these payments and its purpose?

And yes, I did this business that maybe many people don't like, but that was my choice. And so, I think that helps her in terms of her overall reputation in this case. In respect of the prosecution need for her, what she said was important, which was that my story, which was languishing, took on value after Access Hollywood. So, she confirms that while she has this story for a number of years, no one is interested in it. Access Hollywood hits and all of a sudden she is the most popular kid in town with a story to sell that they want to suppress. So, I think that was very important from the prosecution standpoint. From the defense standpoint, she has got some issues that relate tothe consistency in her story and perhaps a motive. But, I think in the very end, the second day of cross-examination, I thought the defense hurt itself. I think they should have not gone back at her, because I think they went after her in a very disparaging way that I would expect the jurors would find reprehensible in a way.",

You got to attack her more, because -- and that's, I think, (inaudible) by the fact that, what did they do at the end of the case? They asked for a permission to change the gag order so we could go after her on social media. So, I think that was the problem that defense lawyers had that they had to listen to their client.

But, we can expect definitely Israel was one and very likely the United States would have been another, and of course, the United States has a veto at the UN Security Council. So, should this vote come up again, as happened last month, there is the probability that the United States would was simply veto again.But, what the Palestinian representatives now have is the ability to propose debate, the ability to answer back in debate, the ability to discuss issues that are not just Palestinian-Mideast issues within the UN. So, this improves their voice at the UN. It doesn't make a substantial difference outside really are the holes of the UN, but it does show which way the global political will is leaning, and that is the challenge, Israel's narrative.

So, nothing will change quickly in this equation and in what we can expect. But, it shows, I think, that the mood here is moving away from Israel, and a lot of that is based on anger of how Israel has prosecuted its attacks in Gaza as action after Hamas' horrific attacks. What sympathy might have existed before for Israel's position and the brutality of Hamas's attack, I think we've witnessed today how much of that has washed away.",

Former Trump White House aide Madeleine Westerhout, she sat outside the Oval Office for two and a half years. She returned briefly to the stand today, testifying about the inner workings of the West Wing, particularly in that moment after the release of the Access Hollywood tape when there was great concern about whether Trump's campaign for President then would survive, influencing prosecutors argued the decision to pay money to catch and kill the Stormy Daniels story. Back with us now, former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin, also the host of \"That Said With Michael Zeldin\" a podcast, So, Michael, Michael Cohen, another Michael, is going to testify on Monday. Just describe again what the prosecution needs from him at this point, given that there have already been witnesses, Stormy Daniels to establish or at least testify that the relationship took place, the National Enquirer publisher to talk about the payments made, the discussions made to hide stories like this, what is the missing piece that Cohen himself has to provide?",

And therefore, we have reasonable doubt.So, what the prosecutors want to do is close that knowledge gap between the circumstantial evidence and Donald Trump's behavior to bring in direct evidence with Michael Cohen, hopefully, in a sober way, we'll say. I met with Donald Trump. We discussed this. We have this audio tape where he says pay cash. I paid Stormy Daniels and he repaid me and we agreed that he would up the rate from $130.000 to $420,000, so I wouldn't have to pay taxes.

And so, that could impact Planet Fitness. Analysts are not sure about the timing. And as you said, this $10 membership is critical -- has been critical to Planet Fitness' business model and its strategy.Planet Fitness is not a luxury gym, and it really looks to find first- time gym members. You look at its membership. About 40 percent of new members have never belonged to a gym before in the past, or just signing up for Planet Fitness. And that $10 price, it's cheap enough that it gets customers into the gym, but it's not expensive enough where they're going to cancel it. Sometimes, they'll just hang on to it even if they don't go that frequently. So, how is the $15 price going to impact this business model? A lot of questions. Planet Fitness says that it thinks it's the right time to do it after all prices are rising across the board.
