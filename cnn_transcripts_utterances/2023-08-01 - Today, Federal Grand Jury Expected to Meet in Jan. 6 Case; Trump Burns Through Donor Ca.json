Let's get a lot more on what is happening on the legal side. Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz joins us. Good morning.

Not that any surveillance footage that Trump Organization had of that property was actually deleted, but they're charged with wanting to try and take steps to get rid of it because it very well may have captured them moving boxes that had federal records in them when the Justice Department was seeking to get those returned. And that surveillance footage, that's only one piece of the evidence. From what we can see in the indictment itself, Phil and Poppy, there is a description of De Oliveira and Walt Nauta walking with a flashlight through a tunnel to look at surveillance cameras just days after the Trump Organization and Donald Trump became aware that they were going to be subpoenaed for all of this surveillance footage. There's also another episode where just a couple of days after that, De Oliveira is captured walking through the bushes and then walking back through the bushes on the grounds of Mar-a-Lago. So, all of that together could be quite substantial. But then there's also very likely witness testimony that could come into play here.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Poppy. So, we are clearly in endgame, but the big question is, when will we arrive at the end? Now, as it turns out, we have a pretty good example because this same prosecutor has already indicted Donald Trump, of course, in the Mar-a- Lago classified documents case. So, what does that tell us about when we might see a decision on an indictment in the election probe?Well, let's do a little math here. First of all, in the last case, and in this case, Jack Smith sent target letters over to Donald Trump. And in the Mar-a-Lago case, he sent that letter on May 19th. The indictment came on June 20th. That's a 20-day lag. Now, in the January 6 case, the target letter went out on July 16th. We are now 16 days in. There does not have to be mathematical precision here, but it can give us a rough sense of where we are. Will there be an indictment? We don't know. We're in the ballpark. Now, the other thing that happened at the very end of the other case is the defense lawyers came in and met with DOJ to make this sort of last pitch why you should not indict my client. Last time, that meeting happened on June 5th, the indictment came down June 8th. I had to do some hard calculus here. That was three days. And this time, the meeting happened on July 27th. We are now five days after that. So, again, what you can safely say is we are in the ballpark. When the end will come will be up to the prosecutors and the grand jury.",

And, by the way, last time the charges in the target letter were similar, but not identical to what charges ended up in the indictment.Here, we know that the charges listed in the target letter include conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and deprivation of civil rights. These tell me that the emphasis is really likely to be on the weeks and days leading up to January 5th, the scheme to try to steal the election. And then the third one is witness tampering. But we have to put -- I put an asterisk there on purpose because I actually think it's going to turn out to be different. There is a very broad statute that, yes, covers witness tampering, but also covers obstruction of an official proceeding, which would relate to an attempt to stop Congress from counting the electoral ballot. So, as soon as we get this indictment, let's see how this measures up.",

And Trump's political operation for his re-election, they're burning through money quite fast to try and meet those expenses and using some seemingly questionable financial tactics to cover those expenses.Now, according to the FEC filings, Trump started 2022 before any of the indictments came down with a whopping $105 million for his Save America PAC, his joint political action committee. Now, the same PAC at this moment, based on the filing that arrived last night, less than $4 million in the bank. The campaign is spending more than it's bringing in, even though its various fundraising arms for the former president brought in about $53 million in donations in the first six months of the year it has spent, when you look at the entirety of its committee finance consolation, more than $53 million. In fact, if you add in, the super PAC has spent more than $100 million in the first six months of the year. Also, Trump's Leadership Pac has spent about $21 million on legal fees for the president and his associates in the first six months, if you actually look at what that means, up more than 70 percent of the total distributions through the first six months of the year. Now, Trump's fundraising entities are trying to cover the costs in any way they can. And this is by far the most fascinating dynamic of this FEC filing, kind of the entire universe of the Trump campaign spend right now. The political action committee transferred 60 or donated 60 million to the super PAC, Make America Great Again. Now, super PACs and the political operations of a candidate are not allowed to coordinate. They are not allowed to operate within one another or talk to one another or give one another money. Technically, when it comes to giving it back, the political action committee asked for a refund, a refund of $60 million in total. What we saw in the FEC filing is that they have gotten, up to this point, $12.3 million in total. That's a larger refund, and to some degree, you want to put refund in quotes here, than has ever happened before, based at least on my read of FEC filings and refunds up to this point. So, the question is, one, how is this happening? Why is it happening? Clearly, we know it's a legal bill problem right now. They have a look liquidity issue, both from the campaign, and they're going to the super PAC to get money back. But this is something I've never seen before in campaign finance. It's not those rules are actually really strong to some degree, and the Trump campaigns make clear that they followed everything to the rule of the law. But it's fascinating.",

They don't need to report, they don't have the same contribution limits that the campaigns do. So, they raise a ton of money, and then they figure out how they can work with the candidates as much as they can within the bounds of the law. So there's innovation going on here. The thing that I think is fascinating about this whole Trump scene is that he is both bound by the fact that he has all these legal bills but he is also now in this increasingly non-competitive primary, right? So, he needs to raise a lot of money to pay his legal bills, was anticipating he could continue to be like, hey, we got to win this fight.

If Ron DeSantis' argument is essentially Donald Trump never built that wall and made Mexico pay for it, I'll really do it, he missed the entire point, right?The wall was a metaphor. People didn't care whether the wall actually got built. They wanted something done about immigration, and they wanted somebody to talk in a way that was disruptive of the longstanding, three-decade-long inertia on immigration. And that's what Donald Trump delivered. Ron DeSantis is sort of playing the wrong game and not winning at that game.",

Rex Heuermann is accused of killing three women in New York over a decade ago and then ditching their bodies in a now famous Long Island beach.Today's court appearance comes after last night, his wife's lawyer told CNN that investigators completely tore up her family's home during their search for evidence. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live in Riverhead, New York, this morning. Brynn, what are we expecting from this hearing today? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Phil. This is a status conference hearing, the next step in this legal process. So, we're expecting really the attorneys to go back and forth with discussions as far as evidence is concerned, but really no big headlines to come out of it. Just, again, the next step in the process as Heuermann is charged with six charges in relation to the murders of those three women whose bodies were found not far from here more than a decade ago. We're not expecting to hear from Rex Heuermann himself. However, as you said, we did hear from the divorce attorney for his soon to be ex- wife. I want you to hear what he said on CNN last night.

Remember, she is not considered a suspect in these cases, but she and her children are going back to their Massapequa Park home. If you remember, police were there for nearly two weeks, really just tearing it apart, trying to find evidence and see if anything could relate to the murders that Heuermann is charged with and possibly other murders that they are still investigating.And they shared pictures with us of what their home looks like now. And they quite literally say that they are trying to piece together their life at this point, trying to take an inventory of what police took from their home, what they left, and sort of get their life back together. As far as her communications with Rex Heuermann, her divorce attorney telling us that they have spoken, but I know from talking to the sheriff's office that she has not visited him behind bars. But her divorce attorney not really giving much insight into what those conversations are. But, again, it does seem like she is just trying to get her life back together at this point and receiving support actually from people who live in that community. And also, we are hearing from her divorce attorney, from the family of other serial killers who have reached out to have been in a similar position as she has, interestingly enough, guys.",
