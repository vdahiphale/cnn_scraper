The U.S., the U.K., the European Parliament, various E.U. nations and New Zealand. They've all enforced this ban.

Despite the recent bank failures, the Fed is forging ahead with its war on inflation, lifting interest rates for the 9th straight meeting.And benchmark rates are now at their highest level since September of 2007, right before the great recession. Now, the goal remains the same, get inflation under control without breaking something in the economy. But the recent bank failure suggests the Fed already has broken something. And that is why some experts wanted the Fed to pause here and survey the damage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said they did consider a pause, but ultimately there was unanimous support for this rate hike, in large part because inflation does remain way too high. Now, for consumers, this means higher borrowing costs, car loans, student debt, you know, mortgage rates are near 20 years highs, and it's never been more expensive to carry a credit card balance. Now, on the banking crisis, Powell, he did his best to try to reassure the public that bank deposits are safe. Listen to what he said about that.

The questions that prosecutors want to ask him, and the answers that they believe he will give, are about whether or not Donald Trump was trying to break the law in the response to the classified documents probe at Mar-a-Lago.So this is a crucial situation that is developed here over the past few hours and days. A federal appeals court in Washington on Wednesday essentially ordered that Corcoran would need to go and testify again to that grand jury, answer questions he hadn't before about his conversations directly with his client, Donald Trump. The appeals court also said that he would need to turn over documents that he had in his possession, handwritten notes, and transcribed verbal notes to the grand jury investigation as well. This is the grand jury investigation into the potential mishandling of classified records at Mar-a-Lago and possibly obstruction of justice. We don't know if there will be charges that emanate from this, but what the Justice Department has done so far to get us to this point is really putting an emphasis on how close they believe they are to locking up this case. They believe that there was the advancing of a crime. It's quite significant. And Evan Corcoran really is the central person, the central witness to the conversations, what was -- what Donald Trump was thinking and wanting to do as the Justice Department was trying to get classified records that he had at Mar-a-Lago back in their possession at the federal government, and that they weren't just turning over all of the things that were there.

The National Weather Service on location determining the exact strength of this confirmed tornado. But one thing's for sure, it caused some significant damage to some of the buildings. You can see this aerial photograph of one of the warehouses there. Now, when we think of March tornadoes, we typically hone in on the Lone Star State, right? They have 14 on average for the month of March. More the same across the Deep South, averaging about five to seven tornadoes from Mississippi to Georgia. Now, did you know that California averages one tornado during the month of March? And it just happened to take place in Los Angeles. Incredible. Here it is, radar loop, and you can see it just south and east. This is an area called Montebello, and it flared up local time, about 11:20 in the morning. And it was a very short lived tornado, but enough to cause, of course, the destruction you saw just a moment ago. Now, the energy from the same storm system is going to be ejected east from the Rockies, and it's going to move into the Ohio and Mississippi River Valley over the next couple of days. And unfortunately, it's going to be encountering a blocking high pressure system to the north. So it's going to allow for heavy rainfall, more showers and thunderstorms moving over the same locations. Weather Prediction Center picking up on this moderate risk of flash flooding. Look out, Memphis to Louisville. Anywhere across this area where you see the darker shading of yellow and oranges, we have the potential from 3 to 6 inches of rain through Friday.

Now, another threat with this round of rough weather across the nation's midsection is the potential for severe weather. We have a multi-day severe weather setup taking shape today. Slight risk across central Texas as well as central Oklahoma. And then an enhanced risk anticipated across parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and into southern Arkansas as storms start to flare up for the day on Friday.

Let's take a look at what a Senate Finance Committee report said last year about UNOS, the United Network for Organ Sharing. They said, \"From the top down, the U.S. transplant network is not working, putting Americans lives at risk.
