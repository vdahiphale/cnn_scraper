ROBERTSON (voice-over):  She used to work above ground but when miners got called up to fight and martial law cleared women for dangerous jobs she jumped at a job deep in the mine. TETIANA (through translator):  I always wanted to work here but girls were not allowed. When many men were conscripted the mine had to keep working. So to protect our country the girls stepped up. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  She works six-hour shifts -- three days one, one day off. Earns more than previously and wants to keep her underground job when the war is over. TETIANA (through translator):  My work is not physically difficult. I like it a lot. I would like to continue working here. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  In this bastion of male-dominated tradition that may not be so easy. OLEKSANDR, LEAD ENGINEER (through translator):  I think when the war is over and we will win, I think women will return above the ground and do women's jobs. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Yet, even chief engineer Oleksandr admits without Tetiana and many other women the mine could not have kept going. OLEKSANDR (through translator):  Around 700 of our miners got called up to fight. Our women wanted to help both the mine and the country. So far, 46 women are working under the ground now. ROBERTSON (on camera):  There hasn't been a general mobilization of women but plenty of traditional male-only workplaces are finding women stepping up and taking jobs that before the war would have only gone to men. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Maria is among them for the love of Ukraine and of her husband. MARIA KOBETS, BLACKSMITH, KOBETS FORGE (through translator):  I knew the theory, but the practice turned out to be a little harder. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  She took up his blacksmith job when he got called up to fight last year. They bought the forge together a few years earlier -- invested their future in it. KOBETS (through translator):  This is my husband's passion and his life's business. I decided to support him to keep his job alive while he is serving. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  She shows me a video of husband Andre working at the same anvil pre-war. His artwork -- some \"Game of Thrones\" themed -- selling in the U.S. and Europe for hundreds of dollars. She is focusing on simpler stuff -- ornate kabob skewers. KOBETS (through translator):  I very often cry in the forge here. My husband is defending us and that is very dangerous. But this work helps me to hold on and not fall apart. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Women have been here before. Remember Rosie the Riveter, icon of women at work in World War II? She and others cracked the glass ceiling. More than a hint of Rosie in Maria and perhaps of changes here, too. KOBETS (through translator):  It's tiring work but it's interesting. I would like to do it when I feel like it, not when I have to do it. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  Maria, Tetiana -- two of many who bravely stepped up -- no doubt, more challenges ahead.

It was also the first time in 20 years that credit card balances did not decline after the holidays as they usually do. Credit card debt nearly $1 trillion here. Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets finished mixed. China's retail sales and economic output weaker than expected in April. European markets are also mixed at this hour ahead of trade data and first-quarter GDP numbers from the EU. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now are leaning lower but not decisively so. We'll see what happens when the opening bell rings. U.S. markets rose yesterday as Wall Street continues to grapple with this ongoing debt ceiling crisis. The Dow snapping five consecutive sessions of losses. Just the idea that they're talking was supportive for Wall Street. Retailer Home Depot will report first-quarter earnings after the opening bell.
