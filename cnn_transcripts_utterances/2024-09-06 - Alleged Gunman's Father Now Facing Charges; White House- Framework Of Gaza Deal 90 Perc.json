Colin Gray faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter and two counts of second-degree murder. Police say he bought the AR-15 style weapon used in the shooting as a Christmas gift for his son in December. Investigators say he purchased the weapon, even though Colin and his son had been questioned over a school shooting threat that was made online in May of last year. CNN has obtained the interview from 2023, where the father assures police that the guns in the house are not a safety issue. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

I will say as it relates to getting accountability for anyone and anyone who is a parent of person who should be in a supervisory capacity, who should certainly have the ability to know what their child as we look there at the child 14, who's charged and his father, but parents are in a unique position to know who their children are, what their capabilities are, and what if any, mental maladies or other issues they have. And so, to be purchasing a weapon in December of 2023, under conditions where potentially your son should not have wanted its troubling, but I do think we are in a world where prosecutors are looking to use all the tools available to them to ensure that parents safeguard their firearms. There's a place for the Second Amendment. Nobody's arguing there's not, but there's a bigger place for responsibility. And so I think that's what prosecutors are doing here in terms of having parents keep these guns away in the event that their child cannot handle.",

Whilst the war is going on, he's pretty secure. Of course, he would argue this is all about destroying Hamas and getting the hostages home. The key point of contention most recently has been what we call the Philadelphi corridor that goes between Egypt and Gaza, a narrow strip of land. In the past, Hamas has been accused of using it to traffic goods. Now that Netanyahu is insisting that Israel retains control of that. And some people are seeing that as a last-minute addition, which is getting in the way of talks.

So they should be doing more to negotiate with Israel.I think the issue here for many people is Netanyahu because talking about Israel is not talking about Netanyahu is very unpopular there. A lot of Israelis want to see a peace deal as well. So it is whether or not you get tough with Netanyahu and his right- wing members of his governments. And really goes in hard there and perhaps you know, one argument would be negotiating more widely and politics instead of dealing with him.

Do you see that little rotation just off the coast of Texas there? The National Hurricane center has been identified in this area as potential tropical development. Now, there's a lot of things working against it. There's not a lot of time for this thing to organize, but it is just set off the coast of Texas and Louisiana for the past several days and that is the reason we have had this rain, excessive rainfall outlook today, highlighting New Orleans and much of the Deep South once again. You can see this kind of elongated area of low pressure that's going to bring more rounds of heavy rainfall to some of the same areas that have been hit. So heads up, flash flood potential today across the lowlands of southern Louisiana. The other big story, the heat, this has been something we've talked about all week long. It's built into the Pacific Northwest. Phoenix yesterday, the highest temperature tying the highest September temperature of 116.
