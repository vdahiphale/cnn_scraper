It's peak season in Rhodes. Over 20,000 people have been evacuated. And what the authorities have said has been the largest evacuation of its kind ever, and this is only to get out of the burning areas on the island. Along with Rhodes, we hear about fires on the island of Corfu, another popular destination, and the island of Evia, an island that burned down heavily two years ago. All of this as Greece prepares for the third wave of an extended heatwave that's likely to hit as of tomorrow. We're expecting to see temperatures over 40 degrees Celsius, over 104 Fahrenheit hit Athens and the rest of the country. And the authorities here tell us that there will be strong winds blowing as well, making conditions very difficult. The Greek Prime Minister has spoken about being at war with the fires and has promised to do the best he can in order to help those that have been most affected. At the same time, we expect these evacuations to continue. And we expect really that in some ways this is more of a developing story simply because the fires are not likely to go away anytime soon.

So one point to see, we don't expect to have the things happening in Antarctica and the North Atlantic, and those sorts of things, and yet we are. So that's where the models are failing us.And how are we going to solve this? Well, here's the point. During the pandemic, that year where the whole world was shut down, we cut CO2, cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 7% for that year. If we had followed up in 2021, '22, '23, with similar 7% cuts, so taking the austerity of the pandemic and repeating that year after year, after year, that's what it would mean to be on target to meet the Paris goal of staying under 1.5. We need to roughly cut by 50% from today's rates by the year 2030, which is about 8% or 9% per year we would have to reduce now. Meanwhile, 2022 was the highest CO2 emissions on record.

The party's leader says negotiations are underway. More now from Al Goodman reporting in from Madrid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AL GOODMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The coalition building towards a new Spanish government could take weeks and the outcome is uncertain. But one result seems clear from Sunday's vote, Spain voted to keep the far right Vox Party out of the Spanish government. The main conservative party came up with well short of a parliamentary majority and even adding on the far right seats. They still came up short. The far right has been making gains across Europe. It governs in Italy with hard right Prime Minister Meloni. It's got part of the government in Finland. But on Sunday, the Spaniard seem to be saying not here, not now. The main conservative leader says he'll reach out to try to form a conservative coalition. But some analysts say the socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, may have a better chance of forming a coalition because he's already got one in his current term. He's got the context and the experience. But a senior member of the socialist party told CNN this day that this second time for Sanchez to try to build a coalition could be a lot more difficult because the nationalist parties in Catalonia near Barcelona and in the Northern Basque Region could try to extract a much higher price for their support. In fact, in Barcelona on Sunday, the leader of one of the nationalist parties said that they would not be giving Prime Minister Sanchez another round in exchange for nothing. She said that their priority is Catalonia, not the governance of a Spanish state. Al Goodman, CNN, Madrid. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But in recent weeks, special counsel investigators have reached out to Kerik to schedule an interview and also to collect evidence. And after they reached out, Kerik went to the Trump campaign, have them review the materials, and the Trump campaign were told, that look, they were not going to argue privilege over this which suggests that they believe there is not anything too incriminating in these documents. But now the special counsel investigators have these. I mean, this is something that no other investigator has been able to obtain. So this is going to be the first time you are able to see these materials. And it could be some key evidence in their ongoing investigation. Now, Kerik has also scheduled an interview for early August. He will sit down with investigators and face questions, some of which they have likely already written.

But the State Department made clear that that is not a new conversation -- simply acknowledgment from the North Korean side that there was outrage from the United Nation's command, and a desire to speak about King. But it didn't go beyond that. There wasn't a back and forth from what we understand having spoken to U.S. officials. The United States command reached out and said we would like a starting a conversation about Private Travis King or something along those lines. And the North Korean simply acknowledge receipt of that. There was no back and forth so it wasn't much of a conversation in that sense. But there at least was that bit of communication. The State Department made clear on Monday that they have tried repeatedly to reach out to the North Koreans but without success. And that has left the U.S. wondering, what is his condition, where is he detained? And what is North Korea's intent with him. North Korea hasn't actually acknowledged or said anything, made any statement, about detaining Private Travis King. Why they are holding him. Where they're holding him, what condition he is in. Which means the U.S. has very little information to go on here. Simply, that he was supposed to have left the country last Monday. And then instead he got on a tour and ran into North Korea last Tuesday. Since then there hasn't been much more information that has come out. What is North Korea's intent with him? That too very much a mystery. In addition to not making any statements, they haven't put out any information, or really engage with the U.S. in any way. So it is unclear what they are looking to do here, and what his condition is. The U.S. still trying to figure all of that out. If North Korea wanted to, they could use the U.S. Army soldier as a propaganda coup. But again they haven't made any statements. Oren Liebermann, CNN in the pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
