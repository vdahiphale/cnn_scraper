I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And happening right now, swift reaction to the latest anti-immigration rhetoric from former president Donald Trump. The White House labeling the comments as fascist after the former president said this at a rally in New Hampshire Saturday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done. They've poisoned. Mental institutions and prisons all over the world. Not just in South America. Not just at three or four countries that we think about, but all over the world. They're coming into our country from Africa, from Asia, all over the world. They're pouring into our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In a statement to CNN, a White House spokesperson said the following, quote, \"Echoing the grotesque rhetoric of fascist and violent white supremacists and threatening to oppress those who disagree with the government are dangerous attacks on the dignity and rights of all Americans, on our democracy, and on public safety. It's the opposite of everything we stand for as Americans.\"Now President Biden himself has weighed in on his predecessor's rhetoric in private events with donors where he there has always likened the former president's terminology as that to Nazi terminology. And the White House and the campaign have similarly gone after and blasting Trump's controversial immigration proposals that he has released over the last few weeks. And just this month, President Biden releasing a statement through his reelection campaign for the first time to blast Trump's travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries as, quote, \"cruel.\" Now it's clear, though, that this is a delicate issue for the White House and that immigration is a political liability for President Biden going into the 2024 presidential election. And you don't have to look too much further than what's happening on Capitol Hill, where negotiations are ongoing for border policy changes to get supplemental funding to Ukraine and to Israel. So foreign policy here dependent on these domestic policy issues. So the president is having to navigate all of that here in Washington while also keeping the focus on the election, along with his campaign and trying to mark a very stark contrast between his vision of America, his vision on immigration, and that of his predecessor, former president Donald Trump.",

There is already blowback. Some from the right who are concerned that Republicans are giving away too much, not pushing for enough restrictive policies, and then a growing number of critics on the left worried about Joe Biden giving away too much, some flatly warning that it could cost him at the ballot box. Why do you think the president is struggling so much with Hispanic voters compared to last time? SEN. ALEX PADILLA (D-CA): Yes. Well, I'm not as worried about that yet. I think if we do -- if he does go too far in the Trump direction when it comes to this, it's going to be felt at the ballot box next year, no doubt about it. SEN.

That having been said, if you want to just analyze the New Hampshire poll, it seems to me that the imperative for Nikki Haley is to get Chris Christie out of the race. I mean, he's obviously occupying probably 10 percent of the survey there that most likely would go to her. Flip side of it is she does not need Ron DeSantis to drop out because I suspect most of Ron DeSantis' support, although it's lower New Hampshire, if he were to get out after Iowa, it would probably go to Trump.

A senior defense official tells CNN that Secretary Austin will be getting a special update on how the War Cabinet intends -- believes its progress against Hamas is going in this war, and also press for specific milestones that it needs to achieve in order to transition to that next phase in the fighting. All of this of course coming against the backdrop of growing U.S. and international pressure as we have seen mounting civilian casualties in the war in Gaza. We have seen over the last week as a rift between the Israeli prime minister and President Biden has really spilled into public view over civilian casualties over how Israel is prosecuting this war, and also of course over what happens once and if Hamas is destroyed in Gaza. And so this visit tomorrow will be essential to addressing many of those questions.

They go as far as 50 meters underground. And they host a whole range of systems, including electronics, ventilation, and communication systems.Now this tunnel did not cross from Gaza into Israel. It was simply a tunnel under Gaza, but it was about 400 meters away from the Erez Crossing, which was one of the main crossing points between Israel and Gaza. It was also the sight of an attack by Hamas on October 7th as those Hamas militants crossed into Israel to carry out that brutal attack on October 7th.

We both know that politically, the idea of conditions is certainly gaining traction in certain quarters, and it's definitely one of those areas where it does look as if conditions are going to be part of it, either tacitly or deliberately voiced.And that's going to be I think a change in the Israeli-U.S. relationship kind of a change in the dynamic of that relationship. But, yes, it's very possible that Secretary Austin is going to be looking for something like this and is going to in essence tell the Israelis that they're not going to be getting a blank check if this kind of operation that they're currently conducting continues. I think that will be very hard politically for the U.S. to continue to support, and that's the kind of message that Secretary Austin will probably convey in private.",

And, of course, it's been common knowledge that there is quite the, you know, system of tunnels throughout Gaza. How is this going to be instructive for the IDF, particularly as it continues to look for these more than 130 hostages? Because, of course, all throughout this war, we've been hearing that potentially hostages are being held throughout this incredible network of tunnels.But what do you see is the greatest importance that comes with the discovery of this kind of tunnel and the sophistication of it?",

So this is, you know, certainly an engineering feat that Hamas and its sponsors have created in Gaza. And the Israelis are certainly well aware of their capabilities and the fact that they've been able to look now for several weeks and in essence assess the type of construction, the way it was built, the direction it took, and to perhaps how extensive it is.Those kinds of factors will definitely play into how the Israelis are mapping out these tunnel systems. It will also serve to inform them to determine what percentage of tunnels look like this. I would venture to say it's probably less than 50 percent of the tunnels that exist in Gaza look like this. The others are probably a lot less sophisticated. But nonetheless, they are certainly a clear indication of what Hamas capabilities are. And that really makes it a challenge because some of the tunnels will be like this. Others will be, you know, much narrower, much more confined, and they will be tunnels that will be very difficult to get into. Not so hard to penetrate, but very difficult to move about in. And that's the kind of challenge that the Israelis are going to face as if they're going to go after those who have captured their hostages and who are, you know, of course if they're looking to free those hostages. So that's going to be I think part of the new imperative for the Israelis in this case.",
