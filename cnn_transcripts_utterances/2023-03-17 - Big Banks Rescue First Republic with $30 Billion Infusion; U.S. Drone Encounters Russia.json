All stabilizing markets today, news that Credit Suisse will be borrowing 50 billion Francs from the Swiss Central Bank. That sent its shares surging. This is a major development for the larger economy because Credit Suisse is considered a systemically important bank for the global markets and that just means it is too important and too big to fail. Since SVB's troubles began last week, markets have been on a wild ride, posing volatile swings. What is ahead? Brian Levitt, a global market strategist for Invesco, that is an independent investment management firm, tells me, we may not out of the woods with regards to potentially seeing other bank challenges.

Michael Hiltzik in Los Angeles, thank you so much.The U.S. Military is assessing its drone operations in the Black Sea region after the encounter with Russian fighter jets earlier this week. Officials tell CNN Russia has recovered some small debris from the drone which crashed in the waters of Ukraine. U.S. has also released that shows that the Russians are lying about forcing down the aircraft. CNN's Oren Liebermann has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  High over the Black Sea, a U.S. spy drone points its camera backwards towards its own tail. A Russian fighter jet closing fast on a much slower MQ-9 Reaper. The Russian jet then begins dumping fuel as it passes by the drone. The cloud of fuel vapor and crucially spinning propeller clearly visible in the video after the pass. The Russian Sukhoi SU-27 fighter then flies by on another pass. Dumping fuel once again, the jet comes even closer, and the video pixelates when the Russian fighter collides with the U.S. drone. When it comes back online, you can see the propeller with a bent blade, damaged in the impact. In these side-by-side images, you can see the propeller before and after, operating and damaged. GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF:  We know that the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional. We also know it is very unprofessional and very unsafe. The actual contact of the fixed-wing Russian fighter with our UAV, the physical contact of those two, we are not sure yet. That remains to be seen. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  The video undercuts the Russia narrative of what happened during the encounter. The Pentagon says it lasted 30 to 40 minutes in total. Russia claimed there was no physical contact. ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.:  There was no collusion. (INAUDIBLE). The problem is that we did not (INAUDIBLE). We did not start firing. It is very important. LIEBERMANN (voice-over):  And CNN has learned the intercept was at the direction of some of the highest levels of the Russian ministry of defense, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence. But the official said there is no indication Russian President Vladimir Putin knew of the planned aggression in advance. Russia has already reached the crash site, some 80 miles southwest of Crimea, two U.S. officials tell CNN. They've been able to cover some debris from the wreckage, but the U.S. downplayed the significance of the drone remnants, saying that there probably is nothing left of real value. (On camera):  Following the collusion between the Russian jet and the U.S. drone, the military began conducting assessment of U.S. drone operations over the Black Sea. That is according to three officials familiar with the matter. It is a look at what is gained, what is risked, the patterns, the routes, of these drone operations to find out how to continue and where to continue. We have also learned that this is not a pause in any way, shape or form. In fact, at least once, since the collision between the Russian jet and the U.S. drone, U.S. operated the same type of drone. Another MQ-9 Reaper in the same area as the previous flight likely to find out and get a better look at Russians trying to move towards the wreckage site and collect some of that debris.

They are making very gradual advances, but at huge costs. This soldier says that Ukrainian forces have vast amounts of ammunition and are heavily shelling the area.

He is dredging (ph) Russian sports clubs for recruits, and his more experienced units are stretched as they try to encircle Bakhmut. Western analysts think that Prigozhin has fallen into a trap laid by Shoigu, a trap designed to weaken both Wagner and its boss. Just when Wagner most needs the support of the Russian military around Bakhmut, it is curiously absent. Russia's elite piling on the graph (ph) outspoken oligarch. Commentator Alexey Mukhin accused Prigozhin of political ambitions and said that he was an incompetent commander, adding, he has exposed the Wagner fighters to a major risk of encirclement from the expected counterattack. The Kremlin has long tolerated Prigozhin as Vladimir Putin's licensed disruptor. But if Wagner is decimated in an unsuccessful bid to take Bakhmut, he might find himself out in the cold.

And she has been in Florida with him quite a lot, assisting him with his various needs.Margo Martin also worked within the White House at the end of the Trump presidency. She was a deputy communications person there. And so, investigators are very likely to want to ask her about what happened in those chaotic last days of the Trump presidency when there were boxes being packed up, when documents were being handled by various people in the White House, how things may have gotten to Mara- a-Lago. And then also she's one of the few people that stayed with the president -- the former President, when he moved to Florida, so she may be asked about all kinds of things that she could have seen or heard at Mar-a-Lago as well. Now, it's not clear at this time, what she said in the grand jury. We know that she didn't have a marathon day of testimony. She was only there for a few hours this afternoon, but she does become the latest witness in a long line of witnesses.

Two dozen people at least. That includes resort staff working at Mar-a-Lago. It includes people who are very close to Donald Trump himself. It is the type of group that scours the grounds.

And he joins us now from Newcastle, England. Thanks so much for being here with us.So, as we just heard, a growing number of governments around the world banned TikTok on official government devices, the Biden administration threatening a ban from all phones, so you're against this. Obviously, the fear here, as I said is that TikTok would share the user data of millions of Americans with China. Why doesn't that worry you? CHRIS STOKEL-WALKER, AUTHOR, TIKTOK BOOM: Because it hasn't been proven, Kim. And I think this is kind of one of the foundational principles of the United States and of the free world of pretty much everybody but China is that we wait until we have evidence to act. I've been looking at TikTok for you know five plus more years. And I'm not the world's best journalist but I'm far from the world's worst. I've been speaking to lots of my peers who are often better journalists than I am and also to cybersecurity consultants who have been poring through TikTok source code, the details of the app, and how it transmits and user's data. We haven't been able to find that smoking gun yet. We haven't been able to find the bat phone that connects Xi Jinping to TikTok. And I think, absent that evidence, we do have to consider that actually, maybe it doesn't exist all of these things so far, and you play there the UK's government respond to was. This is theoretical. This is a sort of pragmatic approach that they're taking in case of an event like this. But there's no actual evidence yet.",

And you're right. And you're -- it's worth pointing out TikTok do say they've never been asked by the Chinese government to hand over data. They say they wouldn't do so if asked. I think we have to -- you know, your definition of whether or not they will actually tell you that will differ depending on your belief on it. And, you know, I am also quite skeptical about that idea of whether they actually would bake this grandstand against the Chinese government if they were really compelled to. But I think more fundamentally, there is this kind of idea that does the Chinese government really care about our teenagers and what they post on social media particularly given they posted on other platforms that are very easily accessible as well? You know, who's to say that you know, teenagers are posting anything different on TikTok than they are on Facebook, on Instagram, on Twitter, on Snapchat, these things can all be accessed by the Chinese government. I think, potentially what we've got here, Kim, is we've sort of recognized the problem, which is that we overshare on social media and we can be manipulated through that. We've seen wide-scale propaganda threatened through social media platforms, but we've kind of misdiagnosed the problem here. We say it's China when actually it's kind of everybody.",

I've been covering TikTok for many, many years now and so I have seen progression of this app. And we are -- if we had been having this conversation probably about three or four years ago, I would have said absolutely, you know. I have leaked moderation guidelines from 2019. The documentation that content moderators use to try and decipher whether or not something should stay on the platform, which previously said, as you say, any videos on Uyghur Muslims were not allowed. We know that there has been a genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province in China by the Chinese state. That is now allowed. Likewise, Tiananmen Square content used to not be allowed, that is now allowed. It's been a process of kind of westernizing the app because what previously happened with TikTok was they essentially just transplanted Chinese staff members into Western companies. And I think you know what happens there is you get kind of a bit of a culture shock because obviously, these people are encountering the free world for the first time and the opportunity to have free expression. That I -- you know, I think it's not necessarily a bad thing that we're giving people a taste of that and actually saying, you know there is an opportunity outside of your Chinese great firewall for a different way of life. And so, I do worry some ways that actually what we're doing is we're cutting off the opportunity that we had maybe in the late 1980s in Russia with the idea of kind of bringing McDonald's into there.
