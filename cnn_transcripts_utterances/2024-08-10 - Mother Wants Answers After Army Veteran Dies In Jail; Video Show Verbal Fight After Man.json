Ten years ago, this weekend, Michael Brown was shot and killed in the street by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and protests broke out then too, some were destructive, some were violent. But the response from the local law enforcement, that was stark. Do you remember really, what stood out about that? Look back at the headlines.\"Ferguson police's show of force highlights militarization of America's cops.\" \"Militarized police in Ferguson unsettle some: Pentagon gives cities equipment.\" And this is from an op-ed at the time. Let me read this for you. \"There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. The images and scenes we continue to see now to Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.\" And the writer acknowledges racial disparities in the law enforcement and adds this, \"it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them.\" Now the author here is not some left wing activist, it's Republican Senator Rand Paul. The title, \"We Must Demilitarize the Police.\" There were actual bipartisan calls in 2014 to reassess giving military equipment to local police departments and the broader impacts of a military style response. After Philando Castile was shot and killed by a police officer near St Paul, Minnesota, protests broke out again. Tim Walz was a State House member then years before he became governor, commander of the Minnesota National Guard. But it was that tragedy in his state and a little known friendship that grew out of it is what Walz says helped him understand what happened in Minnesota in 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

TANYA HAJ-HASSAN, CO-FOUNDER, GAZA MEDIC VOICES: Thanks, Victor. I mean, we, and I say we as a collective of doctors and surgeons, American doctors and surgeons who are all outraged and who have been trying to get the world's attention about this for months. We have been trained to protect and preserve human life, but that has become absolutely clear that that is utterly impossible to do amidst this military campaign that's destroying life and everything needed to sustain it, including the healthcare system and healthcare workers who are trying to save those lives. As you said, just this morning, over 100 men, women and children and elderly, and these are the reports that we're receiving, I think you mentioned a figure of 93. A colleague of mine working at one of the hospitals received over 70 dead bodies in -- sorry, over -- well-over 70. I think 70 said that they were able to identify, and the rest, they're unable to identify because they are dismembered, so they cannot even see whose body the different extremities belong to. He also received over 60 injured civilians, women, men, children, elderly. He said that they, for the most part, are have amputated upper limbs, lower limbs, and that their bodies are burned anywhere between 40 percent and 100 percent of their body surface areas is burned. So that figure of killed is likely to climb dramatically. And this is not an isolated incident. This is the fifth school bombing of a school in the last 10 days by Israel, the fifth bombing of a school that sheltering displaced families that have fled numerous times seeking safety amongst 10 months of starvation, bombing, deprivation of everything indispensable to human life, including the entry of hygiene products to prevent the spread of illness and disease. And so, I just three days ago, a tent camp was bombed and a pregnant woman who came out of it alive arrived to my colleague, a volunteer American doctor in a hospital in Gaza just three days ago, and she said, this woman asked over and over again, she said they were trying to burn us in tents. They were trying to burn us in tents. She went on to say, I had to see people burning. Where are my kids? Where are my kids? She couldn't find her children. This is a pregnant woman.

The donation comes from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, $175 million each going to Howard University's College of Medicine, Meharry Medical College and Morehouse School of Medicine and Charles Drew University of Science, is getting $75 million.This is great news for the schools and for the students, yes, but even better for the communities they'll serve. The fact is that black Americans face worse health outcomes than other groups, from infant mortality to Alzheimer's disease. One study found, listen to this, that of the 19 top causes of death in the United States, black Americans experienced higher rates in all but one. Prevention care is key, of course, in reducing those deaths. But disparities in treatment, racism can push black Americans away from the doctor's offices. A recent survey found 60 percent of black adults say they expect to be insulted when they go to an employment. And experts believe that a lack of representation in the field is part of the problem. Only 6 percent, six, of U.S. doctors are black. Black Americans make up 13 percent of the population. So there's a lot of ground to gain here. But HBCUs are leading the way. Ten percent of black med school grads in 2019 graduated from historically black medical schools. Students say that they -- they -- the education that they receive there is invaluable, and now they're excited to see that more is becoming accessible. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
