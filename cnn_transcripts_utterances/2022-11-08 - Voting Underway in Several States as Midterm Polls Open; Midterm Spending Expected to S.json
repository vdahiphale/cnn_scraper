Republicans need to get to 51 to control the Senate. Democrats need to get to 50 if they want to maintain control with because the vice president, Kamala Harris, breaks a tie in the Senate. I want to show you how tights this is, how narrow the margins are for each party and how it may not be determined for some time. So, let's say, I don't know that it's going to go this way. I'm not suggesting it will, but if there are these scenarios that play out, it could take a while. Say that Republican Ted Budd wins in North Carolina, J.D. Vance in Ohio, the incumbent Republican, Ron Johnson, wins in Wisconsin, all of a sudden you're a Republican, hey, we're at 49, we're really close. But incumbents in Nevada, in Arizona, incumbent Democrats, what if they win there? Incumbent in New Hampshire, Maggie Hassan, now you have 49-49. And what are these two states left? You have Pennsylvania and you have Georgia. Pennsylvania, I will remind people, in a presidential elections two years ago, that was not projected winner until this Saturday after the election. Georgia, not until the runoff in January. This time, the runoff will be in December. But, you know, look, if Democrats are able to win this, one of these states, it's over, they maintain, control.

And to be clear, Don, it's hard to know sometimes whether it's a game or whether he really just working this out in his head and testing it out with 800 different advisers, which is what he was doing.So, by yesterday morning, it was something of a fire drill. And in the afternoon, it had been walked back and it wasn't happening. And then suddenly he was announcing an announcement, which is what he did. We all know what he's talking about. We all know what's coming. I'm personally of the view that it's more interesting when he actually does something because we will cover it. He's a former president. He is frontrunner in the polls. There're legitimate reasons to cover it. I just don't know that this needs to be that much of a --",

It's not just a thing to get the media spun up. I think he was genuinely, actively talking to people about announcing it yesterday. But it does matter because Mike Pence is looking at this, Mike Pompeo is looking at this, Ron DeSantis is looking at this, all these other 2024 hopefuls are looking to see what he's going to announce.",

We know in that debate with Charlie Crist that he refused to rule out serving his full term, and so Trump doesn't want that.And that makes sense politically.
