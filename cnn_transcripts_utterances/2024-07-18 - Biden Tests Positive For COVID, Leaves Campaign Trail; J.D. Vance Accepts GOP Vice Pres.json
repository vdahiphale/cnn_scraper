Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. President Biden forced off the campaign trail by a case of COVID-19, just as calls for him to leave the race grew only louder. President Biden arrived to his home in Delaware late last night, where he will be self-isolating with a mild case of the virus. That's according to his staff. The president is finding himself isolated in more ways than one with calls to step aside now coming from some of the most senior leaders of the Democratic Party. Sources tell CNN, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently spoke to the president. Her message, the polls show he cannot defeat Donald Trump in November. She also warned Biden's candidacy could sink their chances of winning the House and keeping the Senate. The president reportedly got defensive, saying his own polls show he can win. But remember back to one week ago at NATO when Biden suggested he would only reconsider his campaign under one condition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think you also saw just in case there was a Kamala Harris coming that was part of the strategic thinking of getting a J.D.

And I think he did a nice job of that and I thought he -- I was also struck by the contrast because when you think about his upbringing versus Donald Trumps upbringing, I was looking at that like two completely different people. But in a way, it kind of is an example of American as its greatest, right? That you've got a rich guy like Donald Trump and a guy who grew up certainly very, very poor in the hollows, as he said of Kentucky. And it's quite the contrast.

Again, pretty significant damage here, just so you know, this was an EF2 rated tornado. But for some context, the estimated wind speed was 135. Had it been 136, it would have been an EF3. So this was about as high of an EF2 rating as you can possibly get for that storm. That tornado was one of 23 tornado reports that we've had across the country just since Sunday, over 1,100 damaging wind reports and almost 100 hail reports, some of them the size of tennis balls or even larger. Now, in terms of tornadoes, has been a very active year. Since January 1st, we've had over 1,400 tornado reports. Normally by this point, we would have just under 1,000. So certainly above average there. More severe weather is expected for today, especially across the Carolinas and Virginia. You'll see a lot of those storms beginning thank to ramp up late this afternoon and into the evening hours and continuing overnight. But also notice to this front isn't really moving all that much.
