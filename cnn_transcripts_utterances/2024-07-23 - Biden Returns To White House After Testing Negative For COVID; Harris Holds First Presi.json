And she reiterated a line of attack that is likely to become a familiar refrain in her campaign.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So, as Leah told you, before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States Senator, I was elected Attorney General of the state of California and I was a courtroom prosecutor before then. And in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump's type. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All that is out the window. She knows the assignment here. This campaign is being joined in progress. But she's been largely doing these campaign events. But we haven't been watching as much because we never watch a vice presidential candidates as much as presidential candidates. An entirely new moment for her.But I think her sharpness, her crispness at really framing that argument about we know Donald Trump's type. Who is she going after there? Milwaukee is a great example of it. Trying to energize the Democratic base in the city of Milwaukee and Madison. Some Democrats who really have been without energy. This is the largest rally that the Democratic campaign has had for either Biden or Harris. It's 3,000 people. As Kristen well knows, a 3,000-person Trump rally would be the smallest ever. So the reality here is we're about to see I think some more equalness between both sides. Democrats have not been that enthused. They clearly will be more enthused now. However, the race to define her is beginning anew with both sides. This is still an uphill battle for Democrats and she said that. She said there are 105 days and we have a lot of work to do. She's right about that.",

This - she can energize a crowd. She can be a very good candidate and Republicans saw that in 2010. I saw it in 2010 and 2014.

I just want to be frank with you. I've talked to some of your House lawmaker colleagues, Democrats, and before Biden had stepped aside, in one breath they were saying he needs to step aside, and in the other they were saying we have concerns that Harris is not the person to get the votes that are needed. What do you say to them because those concerns don't evaporate? REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): Well, I love my colleagues, but the people we should be listening to are the people on the ground. And what we have seen in the last 48 hours is an incredible surge of energy around Kamala Harris as our nominee for president of the United States. I listen to what they have to say, 10s of thousands of new volunteers walking into the headquarters. Hundreds of thousands of first-time donors saying they want to chip in and be a part of this. So while people may have had their own predictions about what the reaction to a Kamala Harris candidacy for president might be, those predictions don't match what we're actually seeing among the people who matter, especially young people. And, you know, I love Joe Biden, and I consider him a friend. But I do think we have to acknowledge the reality that the enthusiasm for his candidacy wasn't aligned with the great track record that he had as president. What we're seeing now is enthusiasm around the Biden-Harris agenda, now led by Vice President Harris as our nominee, but a dramatic uptick in enthusiasm, especially among younger people who see this as the passing of the torch, the generational change that so many people were asking for.",

And again, this especially goes to younger voters, people who we were going to have a hard time persuading to participate. Had they participated, they probably would have voted for Joe Biden if he had been on the ballot. But the question was not where their allegiances lie, but where their enthusiasm level is. And what we're seeing there is just a dramatic increase. I know my Republican colleagues are trying to pretend that's not happening. They're petrified.
