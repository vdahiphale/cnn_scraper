His attorneys have contacted the Justice Department of getting necessary security clearances in this classified documents case. That's according to a source familiar with the matter. And it also underscores the sensitive nature of the documents the former president is accused of withholding.This is part of Judge Aileen Cannon's first order here since, of course, the president -- the former president had that not guilty plea entered earlier this week, not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information and to obstruction of justice. So, by June 20th, Judge Cannon said she wants the lawyers to file notice they have complied with her instructions. We are still waiting to learn whether the trial will take place before or after, of course, the 2024 election. But, look, there is a busy calendar already here for Donald Trump, as you can see a lot going on there.

But the Saudis have bought their way into an American sport. And, of course, we know with the Saudis, we have to say this comes terrible baggage. They deny a lot of this, but, of course, 15 of the 19 hijackers in 911 were Saudi. Of course, the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi and the fact of just the human rights abuses, the LGBTQ abuses, a sport like golf that is trying to attract women and trying to attract new people, not just old grandpa and grandma, well, guess what? That sport is now in business with someone who repels or a group of people that could certainly repel your future fan base and your future growth industry. And that is a huge problem for golf moving forward.",

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, two Democrats sent a letter earlier this week to the Justice Department calling for their antitrust division to take a look. We don't know. I mean, it sounds like this was launched before they sent that letter, but they sent it, and in part, it said the deal, quote, enables the Saudi government's efforts to sportswash its egregious human rights record that you just went through. But that, interestingly, is not what DOJ would probe.",

And we know, you know, Poppy and Erica, for covering politics so long, you've got Senator Wyden, who has been on this for a year. I interviewed him a year ago about this. He has been concerned and very has been critical of LIV Golf. You've got Senator Blumenthal, Senator Warren, I imagine others would come in as well. It is something that they want to look at. As you mentioned, of course, that the issue of human rights abuses.And as Senator Wyden said last week, you're allowing the Saudis to potentially take over American real estate. Now, they're not buying the golf courses but they will have business going on on American property. So that is part of it, too. But, yes, they are separate things. And what it means for the golf fan or the casual fan, sports fan, someone who just is kind of looking at this thing, what's going on, is that it will be nothing but chaos and confusion for the next year at least. And that is exactly what any sport does not want right now, certainly the game of golf, especially as Tiger Woods is near the end of his career. So, those T.V. ratings that Tiger had, which were stratospheric, those days are long gone for golf, another problem for the game of men's golf.",
