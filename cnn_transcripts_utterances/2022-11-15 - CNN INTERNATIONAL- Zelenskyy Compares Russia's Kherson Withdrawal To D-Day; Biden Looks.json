Just ahead, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy outlines his peace plan for the G20 leaders while residents in the newly liberated areas of Kherson struggle without basic supplies.Plus, former U.S. President Donald Trump is set to make a special announcement with aides saying he'll run for the White House again when he faced a challenge from a former ally. And crypto crash is the downfall of one of the industry's biggest players, a problem or an opportunity. The war in Ukraine can come to an end in 10 steps. That's the path laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier today in a taped address to the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia. Those steps include food security and nuclear safety, as well as peace treaty with Russia. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): It is like for example D-Day, the landing of the allies in Normandy. It was not yet a final point in the fight against evil, but it already determined the entire further course of events. If the victory will be ours in any case, and we are sure of it, then shouldn't we try to implement our formula for peace to save thousands of lives and protect the world from further destabilization?

Now, they're able to use the new cell phone system the government installed on Monday, connected by those little dishes to the satellite. And everyone here, look at them, come and have a look. Everyone's on their phone now. They're talking on their phone, they're sending messages on their phone.This is what people have been waiting for to be reconnected with the rest of the country. Everyone's out, bringing their dogs out, people still celebrating, wearing their flags. And over here, there's another aid distribution. An aid truck came in Monday, but there's another one here Tuesday, distributing food. We've seen people coming away with bread. But the situation in this city is still a very difficult one. Still no water, no electricity, very cold here at night. But what you're seeing here is aid distribution. This is what people are hoping becomes more regular. They're hoping there's more food in the shops, that the prices of food in the shops comes down. The government here also taken other steps, other measures to ease the situation. They're delivering pensions. Two government post offices are now open, so pensioners can get their money. It's a real effort by the government after President Zelenskyy's visit to reconnect Kherson with the rest of Ukraine. The aid is part of it, the cell service is part of it. But really what people here tell us they want is that electricity, is the running water because it isn't clean drinking water here at the moment. They get their water from pumps near the river, they have to boil it. But what they would really like to feel here is safe and secure. And, of course, not far away big cheer there for one of the soldiers on the back control -- doing crowd control, helping deliver the aid. But I think the thing that's sort of on the back of people's minds here, the back of people's minds, is the fact that this is a frontline city, still at the frontline, is only just across the river. And they hear the outgoing shelling from here over the river. The Ukrainians still seem to have an offensive pushed across the other side of the river. Here we go, look at this. This is crowd control. But this gives you a sense of the need here. And this is going to go on for some time. It's not a quick fix here. But this is what the government is working towards. Sometime, maybe over the next few days, they might get their electricity back. Just not clear yet. Nic Robertson, CNN, Kherson, Ukraine.",

So Max, well, it's not unusual for the FBI to investigate when Americans are killed abroad, something they do often, would be unusual for the FBI to investigate an ally especially if it involves investigating the Israeli military.And essentially defense minister -- Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, confirming Israeli media reports that the U.S. Department of Justice had notified Israeli officials about a potential investigation. Benny Gantz in a tweet calling it a mistake, saying that they will not cooperate with an external investigation and will not enable intervention into internal investigations. Now, keep in mind, internal politics, Defense Minister Benny Gantz is likely on his way out as the Israelis are expecting a new government to come in most likely led by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. So that tone might change in the next few weeks when a new government comes in. Now, the U.S. Department of Justice has declined to comment, but this would be essentially the second American investigation into Shireen Abu Akleh's death. As you noted, she was a well-known across the world, Al Jazeera correspondent killed in May while covering an Israeli military raid. She was wearing a press vest and helmet, identifying signatories of press working in the field. Now, a U.S. State Department's investigation a few months ago that included a forensic analysis of the bullet that killed her, found that while the forensic analysis of the bullet was inconclusive, they came to the conclusion as have American media outlets including CNN, that it was likely the Israeli military that killed Shireen Abu Akleh. And an IDF investigation also found that it was likely an IDF soldier that fired that fatal shot that killed Shireen Abu Akleh. But we -- while the Israelis were cooperating in that State Department investigation, we are hearing from Benny Gantz now that if the FBI does open does go in for with this investigation, that they will not be cooperating. However, this is something that the Abu Akleh family has been calling for for some time. They have wanted the FBI to investigate what they said was an American citizen's death. They say that they were encouraged by the news of the U.S. investigation that they hope that all parties will cooperate. Max?",
