It's wonderful to have you with us. Now, we're going to talk about some pretty serious news to start this morning, because multiple Democratic members of Connecticut's delegation say they were the target of bomb threats it happened yesterday while they were home celebrating with their families. Law enforcement determined there was no evidence of any bombs and members report their families are safe. One of the threats was made against Congressman Jim Himes. He's the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Himes said in a statement, quote, there is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility. Yesterday's flurry of incidents, well, they come just a day after several of Donald Trump's administration picks were also targeted with similar threats. Former FBI director and CNN contributor Andrew McCabe says he's not surprised by the threats, telling CNN earlier this week that they've become commonplace for individuals in high profile positions.

U.S. Capitol police puts out the statistics for every year. So I'm curious to see what the numbers look like in 2024. But we have seen increases in that number in regards to threats against lawmakers.And that's led to a flurry of discussion on Capitol Hill about security for sitting lawmakers. It is a discussion that we have seen. I suspect that we will see it crop up again next week when lawmakers return to Capitol Hill and react to these threats and you know, these bomb threats made not just against the Connecticut Democrats, but also as you mentioned, some of President-elect Trump's picks for his cabinet. I do think part of it is that were in a very polarized environment right now. The partisanship of politics has reached an all-time high in a lot of ways, and we're seeing the residual effects of that, which appears to unfortunately, be these -- these rising threats against lawmakers.",

There have been a lot of consternation about whether and how those would come through.There's still some questions and doubt hanging over the process. Trump has largely rejected a lot of the conventional transition resources or the playbook. You might call it that. Previous transitions have had, and were sort of in uncharted territory a little bit on how this is all going to shake out. You know it's just kind of hanging in the air one thing that we do know is that going forward, there will be more of this formal sharing that hadn't been allowed to happen in the previous few weeks which the administration had sort of been sending alarm bells about and so maybe that will continue to have sort of a more smooth process. And we'll see in the meantime, also, Trump is continuing to sort of roll out his announcements and nominations here we had a flurry of them before the holiday from here in Palm Beach. Some, sort of, you know, tear into the next tier after he sort of rounded out his cabinet, we saw, for instance, National Economic Council director, a U.S. trade representative pick.

But musk continues to have tremendous access to the president. He's consistently, you know, hanging around Mar-a-Lago, showing up in photos. He's really influential person in Trumps orbit right now he's not the only one. We had a surprise visit by Mark Zuckerberg, the Meta executive, and other prominent American billionaire who was spotted at Mar-a-Lago the day before Thanksgiving, for meetings there, had dinner with Trump. And so he continues to sort of have direct access to some of these major figures. And we'll see where Musk's influence goes. But were you talk about I talked about uncharted territory in my last answer. I mean, this is just almost a symbiotic sort of, relationship staff level type of relationship between the president elect and Mr. Musk, who, of course, through his businesses has many ties with government connections with government and with SpaceX. For instance so this is just a quite the setup as you can see where we're going. I don't even know how to describe it beyond that.",

What's extraordinary is to consider that you played that moment when the French president had some had suggested in a slightly foolhardy way, suggested that it would take five years. It took them two years just to secure the structure.That's how fragile it had been after the fire of 2019. You'll remember those flames coming out of the top. The spire collapsing, the crowds gasping, the fears about one of the towers and whether they would hold at all. This had been an extremely damaging fire that raged for many hours before firefighters were able to bring it back under control, so the fear had been even in the months, and the couple of years that had followed the fire, whether the structure would hold either in part or entirely. So the first thing was to consolidate it to large wooden belts were put around the flying buttresses the nave, and then the reconstruction proper could start when they were sure that the structure itself would hold. And what you're seeing today with that visit by the French president, this is his seventh but ultimate visited the construction site ahead of the grand opening that will take place next week, Audie, this is an opportunity for Parisians, but also the world to have a look at what that restoration has brought inside. And the images are quite extraordinary. It had been for anyone who can remember it before, five years ago, quite dark inside no longer there is. It is much cleaner, of course, than it was. And what they did, having taken the original decision that they would rebuild it exactly as it was, rather than try something new it took 2,000 men and women over those five years to get in there with extraordinarily specialized skills gilders, woodworkers stonemasons to get in there and restore that intricacy to the details of Notre Dame. Within that very vast scale, that it's famous for. It is, of course, the world's most famous gothic cathedral, and built, as you mentioned, over 900 years ago, now restored to its former glory. And these are some of the first images of the inside of that cathedral so carefully lovingly restored. And again many had thought that it simply couldn't be done. Audie, one last thing I'd like to point out is the amount of money that was raised for this restoration project. 340,000 individual donors from 150 different countries managed to raise nearly $900 million. And I think that speaks to the place that this cathedral has in the hearts of so many around the world, Audie.",

[05:25:04] Mount Holly, Vermont, topping out at 17 inches. Other areas of New York, Vermont and also Maine. Looking at, at least a foot of snow in just the last 24 hours, we've got more snow on the way, especially near the lakes. You're going to be looking at some pretty significant lake effect snow, not just today, but as we head into the weekend as well. So places like Traverse City, Buffalo, Watertown, New York, Erie, Pennsylvania, and even Cleveland looking at especially once those wind directions begin to shift over the next 12 to 24 hours, could be looking at some pretty substantial snow amounts. So you've got a lot of these winter weather alerts in place just for that very reason, especially this green, the teal color that you see here, those are lake effect specific snow warnings indicating just how much snow is expected to fall. You see some of these dark pink colors here where you could be looking at more than 2 to 3 feet total of snow. Now, granted that's going to be a very narrow path for some of these areas because it has to line up just right with lake effect snow. But yes, for the communities that are in it, they are going to be very hard hit. As for the rest of the country today, especially if you are traveling by the air, were not expecting too many issues whatsoever. Most of these airports expected to have pretty much everything on time, at least from a weather standpoint.
