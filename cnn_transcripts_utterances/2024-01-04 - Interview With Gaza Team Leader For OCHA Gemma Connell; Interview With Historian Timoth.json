Here's what's coming up.On the ground in Gaza, I speak to the woman leading the U.N. humanitarian efforts there about the ever-worsening situation. Then, a turning point for democracy in 2024. My conversation with Yale historian Timothy Snyder, author of \"On Tyranny,\" tells me about his hopes and fears for the year ahead. Also, \"It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over.\" Rock star Lenny Kravitz on being shortlisted for an Oscar, having a new album, and turning 60. Finally, a groundbreaking treatment. Nobel Laureate Jennifer Doudna tells Walter Isaacson how CRISPR is revolutionizing the treatment of diseases like sickle cell anemia. Welcome to the program everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Fears of a wider war are growing in the Middle East. Today, a U.S. strike in Baghdad on a pro-Iranian militia leader. Yesterday, two blasts in Iran killed at least 80 people and injured nearly 300 others near the grave of the military commander Qasem Soleimani. And the day before, a senior Hamas figure was killed in an airstrike on a building in Beirut. These fears have been growing ever since October 7th, when the brutal attack by Hamas inside Israel triggered Israel's massive counteroffensive inside Gaza. More than 22,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, according to the health ministry in Gaza. And right now, both the IDF and Hamas say the current fighting is in the slum city of Khan Younis. A place my next guest has literally just left. Gemma Connell is the Gaza team leader for the U.N.'s humanitarian office known as OCHA. And I reached her in Gaza near the Egyptian border.

And just this evening, we had more people arrive to the area just outside our guest house where they're setting up makeshift tents and shelters in order to try and survive. But every night we hear the shelling, every night we hear the gunfire. And there are many days when it's very close. There was one day, Christiane, when I was about to head out on a convoy and there was naval gunfire, literally just 50 to 100 meters away from us in the cars as we moved out. So, to give you a sense, that's what every day is like for me. And I am one of the most protected people in Gaza. And so, when we say there is no safe place, there truly is no safe place in Gaza.",

So, what I see here every day and what I hear here every day, it's my job to communicate that back to the world. And the first message that every single person that I have met in the month that I have been here in Gaza, the first message they give me is that the war must end. I met a family of women, their entire family killed except for five women. And one of them turned and looked at me, her pregnant daughter had been killed, and she said, we don't need food. We don't need water. We need an end to this war. And so, for me, that's what I communicate back every day, Christiane. I have met children. I have watched children die. I have met a baby who was born in the street because his mother couldn't get to the hospital because of ground forces, that baby died and that family had been trying to have that baby for years. And any person in the world knows how difficult that journey is to have a child to then have it die in the street. And so, we must be emotional about this, to be honest, because that's our humanity. And for me, my biggest fear is that the world doesn't see the people of Gaza as the humans that they are. And yet, every day, that's exactly what I see, is the humans of Gaza and the devastating and catastrophic toll of this war on humans.",

But Christiane, the suffering is everywhere. I mean, absolutely everywhere that I have been. And I have been in the south of the Gaza Strip. I have been up to Gaza City. And when you cross the checkpoint into the north of Gaza, I have never in my humanitarian career seen the level of suffering, desperation and deprivation that the people who are across that checkpoint are suffering. It has driven people to their absolute limit. No food, no water, very little medical supplies. That's what we see in the north. And here in the south where people continue to arrive, just this evening, as I left the office to the guest house, there was still hundreds of people pouring in to Rafah from the middle area where this new offensive is taking place, carrying whatever belongings they have left bearing in mind most people have now been displaced, not once, not twice, but six or seven times. And the people here have nothing as well. And I met with families who are sharing shoes and socks because they don't have those. It's the middle of winter now and the children are exposed. I've met with families who don't have the money to try and put a shelter over their children's head. We see Children who are out in the open with nothing. I've met with mothers who are devastated because they cannot provide their children with diapers. And I've met with women who can't access sanitary pads.

This looks to be going incredibly badly for Ukraine right now, and it's a shock, frankly. It's a shock to the system after we, the public, and we, the press, have been reporting for years that the U.S. and Europe has been saying, for as long as it takes, we will help Ukraine defend itself, and that all seems to be thrown up in smoke right now with the Congress, with the E.U., either not or delaying crucial aid with Russia clearly making some advances on the battlefield.

The first thing to remember is that the Ukrainians, from the beginning of the war tonow, have been doing incredibly well with whatever they've been provided with. And even this last year, and even these last few months and weeks, they've been extracting extraordinary Russian casualties, and they've been doing a very good job at stopping these huge Russian barrages of missiles and drones. They're the reliable piece in all of this. We're the unreliable piece. And as you say, that's the shocking part. It's shocking, not just because Ukrainians are defending democracy and the rule of law, it's also shocking because the people who oppose democracy and the rule of law, not only in Moscow, but also in Beijing and elsewhere, are looking very carefully on what happens. So, what needs to happen is -- from our point of view, is actually very simple, we need to unblock the aid for Ukraine, which will allow the Ukrainians to defend themselves and win this war. The ironic thing here is that this would be very easy for us. It's just not very much money from our point of view. The weapons that we send are largely weapons we wouldn't use anyway and would have to decommission. We won't even notice whether we do this or not from the point of view of domestic politics, but it will change the history of the world. That's the striking thing at the beginning of 2024.",

So, you know, the problem with makingpredictions is that you have to kind of depend upon what your own people are going to do. If we continue, we, the U.S., we, the Germans, we, the E.U., continue to supply Ukraine, they will win this war. The narrative now is that things are going well for Russia, but things are actually going very badly for Russia. They're losing huge numbers of troops. Putin has problems at home. They can't keep this up indefinitely. The question is whether we can. And as you say, this has to do not just with Moscow, but with Beijing. If the Chinese see the Americans and the Europeans choosing to lose in Ukraine for no reason, that is certainly emboldening and certainly increases the risk dramatically of a conflict over Taiwan. Supporting Ukraine is the easy way for us to reduce the risk of a war with China, and that's one more reason why it's so befuddling that we're not doing it.",

It's odd, though that he could be on the ballot at all, because it is clear, the 3rd Section of the 14th Amendment makes it clear that anybody who takes part in or even gives aid and comfort to an insurrection cannot be a candidate for any state or federal office in the U.S. So, I think that has to be taken very seriously. We have rules about who can run and who can't run. And according to these rules, Trump can't. And the decisive part of the Supreme Court says that it takes -- it pays attention to the actual language of the constitution and the intention of those who wrote the provisions and whether you're an intentionalist or, you know, whether you're a textualist, it's very clear that the 14th Amendment makes it impossible for Trump to run.

It's something which is going to happen chiefly, not in the virtual world, but in the real world. And that's why the advice on \"On Tyranny\" begins from things like don't do what everyone else is doing. Don't obey in advance. Don't assume the institutions will protect you. You have to be able to engage yourself and hear other people if we're going to move along. It's not the presence of hate speech that troubles me so much, although it does, it's the absence of the other thing. It's the absence of engagement, of kindness.

I could design a kid that would have blood cells that carried more oxygen, be great sprinters, be wonderful athletes.
