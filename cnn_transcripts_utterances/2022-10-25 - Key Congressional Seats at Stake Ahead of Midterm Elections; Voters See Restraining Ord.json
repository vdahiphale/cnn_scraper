That they're working against history, six decades of election results. The first midterm of a new president and the party in power isn't going to go that route.However, they looked at polling and see that they're within a point or two and even ahead in all of the critical races in the Senate and a lot of the critical races in the House. They believe if they're able to sharpen that message, particularly on the economy, about what Democrats would do versus what Republicans can do, they have a fighting chance. They should get some data that can help them as well. GDP report coming out later this week. Expected to show the economy growing again after two negative months. Gas prices continue to tick downwards. Something White House officials view as critical and its correlation to the president's approval. Will that be enough? Again, history would say probably not.

TODD (voice-over): RSV or respiratory syncytial virus, a common respiratory illness that is occasionally severe in babies and young children. Experts say RSV and the flu are both hitting earlier this year than they normally do. DR. AMY EDWARDS, PEDIATRIC INFECTION CONTROL, UH RAINBOW CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL: If you look in the southern United States, we're already starting to see flu cases take a really big high jump. And so, we're really a little bit concerned about this overlapping of all these different viruses because usually RSV comes a little bit later and then flu comes very nicely after -- they take their turn. TODD (voice-over): The number of RSV cases in the U.S. detected by PCR tests in the second week of October was higher than any other week in the past two years, according to the CDC. And across the country, about three quarters of pediatric hospital beds are currently in use, a larger share than at any time over the past two years. Three states have more than 90 percent of those beds in use right now, Maine, Rhode Island and Delaware. At this high school in Stafford County, Virginia, nearly half the student body was out at one point last week with flu like symptoms.

TODD (voice-over): RSV and the flu have similar symptoms experts say, runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, wheezing, fever, so it's not always easy to tell which illness your child has.
