ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): I do believe that it is in the best interests for Senator Menendez to resign in this moment. As you mentioned, consistency matters. It shouldn't matter whether it's a Republican or a Democrat. SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): This is a very serious charge. There's no question about it. In terms of resignation, that's a decision to be made by Senator Menendez and the people of New Jersey. SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Well, these are serious and shocking charges. Bribery, corruption. I've never seen anything like this. I think Senator Menendez is going to have to think long and hard about the cloud that's going to hang over his service in the United States Senate.

And what prosecutors say is that Menendez had abused his position as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he had a very important role about whether Egypt could get military aid and financing, something that they were needing. And so according to this indictment, Menendez had sent sensitive information to an intermediary that got to the Egyptian government. He held meetings with Egyptian military officials in his office without his staff. And, you know, one of the allegations is that he ghost wrote a letter for Egypt to send to other U.S. senators to try to convince them to lift a hold on $300 million in aid to Egypt. And those are some of the alleged acts that the prosecutors say he took as part of this scheme. And they also say he tried to interfere with two different criminal investigations facing one of these businessmen, who is also indicted alongside him, and then associates of another businessman in this scheme, saying that he was trying to help them, so interfering in Justice Department, in New Jersey attorney general's office investigations.",

Those were just the three plants that were on strike across all three automakers. You had losses of wages totaling $250 million. You had losses to consumers and car dealerships of $470 billion. So that was just before these additional 38 targeted strikes across all of GM and Stellantis' parts and distribution centers.Ford, as you mentioned, not on that list because Shawn Fain said that he felt like there was enough negotiating, there was a good deal so far -- or good offer so far from Ford. Enough progress was made on their front. But what we need to look out for going forward here is, what is the expanded impact on consumers? Because essentially when you take out parts and distribution across two big automakers, that has a ripple effect down to dealerships. Dealerships provide service to everyday Americans who want to go in and get their cars fixed. And when you don't have those parts coming into those dealerships, they can't do repairs. And that's actually a huge part of their income is repairs for everyday Americans. So, they may have to turn people away. And then, in turn, they will turn up the temperature on GM and Stellantis to potentially come to a deal faster or negotiate a little bit better with the union because eventually this is going to hurt the dealership's bottom line.",
