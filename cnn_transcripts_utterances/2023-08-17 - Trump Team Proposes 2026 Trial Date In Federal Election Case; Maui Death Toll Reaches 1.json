To state the obvious, this is years away, and Jack Smith, the special counsel obviously is pushing for the first court date of 2024 just about four months from now, January 2nd. Well, it comes as the FBI is now working with the Fulton County sheriff's office in Georgia and they are investigating threats being made against the ground jurors who voted to indict Trump, along with 18 others. In a statement, writing: We take this matter very seriously and are coordinating with our law enforcement partners to respond quickly to any credible threat and to ensure the safety of the individuals who carried out their civic duty. This is coming after we reported that the purported names, photographs, and even addresses of some of the members of the grand jury are now circulating on far-right websites. Some users on those websites calling for violence against those jurors, American citizens, civilians, doing their civic duty. In a moment, I'm going to speak to Daniel Jones. He's a former FBI investigator who's first spotted these threats. He's going to give us the details, because this is alarming. Right? The context here is we just learned a Texas woman has been charged with threatening to kill Judge Tanya Chutkan, who's overseeing Trump's January 6th federal election interference case. According to court documents, Abigail Jo Shry left the judge a voice mail who threatened to kill anyone who went after former President Trump. And since 2020 election, we know this, right? We've heard this. People come on the program some of them to talk about the threats they've perceived, election officials, mayors, governors, members of Congress, all of them receiving these threats because Trump turned against them. And tonight, the former president is not letting up on the constant veiled threats of violence in one of his first interview since being indicted in Georgia. Trump said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That may not happen at all because sources tell CNN, few of his advisers knew of this event before Trump announced it. Since then, Trump has been told to bail on it. They fear it could complicate his case.

SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, I mean, obviously, it's a huge gap between what the Trump team is asking for and what the Justice Department has proposed, as you pointed out January 2024. In this new court filing, Trump's team says that he needs time to prepare for this trial. There is an enormous amount of discovery. They say the government is essentially asking for the type of timeline that's quicker than you would see in a misdemeanor case that doesn't involve any documents. And, interestingly, they also list Donald Trump's mounting legal problems and point out he is also going to have to prepare for trial in the classified documents case in Florida. He also has to prepare for trial in the Georgia case where he's just been indicted. He also has to prepare for trial in the Manhattan case. So, they sort of lay out all the reasons why they believe this is too tight of a timeframe in 2024, and why the former president is going to take years, apparently, to prepare to go to trial in this case.",

We're also learning, though, that other defendants have begun preliminary hearings with the D.A.'s office.These conversations are supposed to continue early next week in person, and they are going to cover things like what potential bonds would be like for Donald Trump, or other defendants. What the police conditions would be like. And, frankly, the defendants have an incentive to hash this out with the D.A.'s office ahead of time, because as we were talking to attorneys about how this process works, they said if you walk into that jail, and again they have to surrender themselves before noon next Friday, if you walk into the jail without a bond agreements, they are going to book you process you, and they're going to retain you in custody.
