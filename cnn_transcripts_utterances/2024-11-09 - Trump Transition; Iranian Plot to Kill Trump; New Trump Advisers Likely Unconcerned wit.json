Trump's preparations as he heads into his second term also include key meetings. Sources tell CNN that Elon Musk joined Trump on a phone call with Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday. Musk's Starlink satellites have been critical for Ukraine's fight against Russia. Democrats, on the other hand, are looking inward and in many cases playing the blame game in Washington. The former U.S. House Speaker is suggesting that Joe Biden's late exit from the race may have contributed to his party's loss because it didn't allow time for a proper primary. Here she is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, PODCAST HOST:  You had reportedly said you wanted a sort of an open primary when if Joe Biden stepped down. Did you change your mind because you saw all the excitement around Kamala Harris? REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), FORMER U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER:  No, I didn't change my mind. We had an open primary and she won it. Nobody else got in the race. Yes, people could have jumped in. There were some people who were sort of preparing but she just, took off with it. And, actually, it was a blessing because it -- there isn't that much time. There wasn't that much time between then and the election and it sort of saved time. So it wasn't that we didn't have an open process. It's just that nobody got in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He reportedly had a manifesto with anti-Semitic language and the representative's name on it. Moskowitz is Jewish. Police confirmed that they arrested 41 year old John Lipinski on firearms charges. They said evidence suggested he may have been planning some kind of criminal act. All right, now to the latest on the balance of power in the U.S. Senate. CNN projects Nevada Democrat Jacky Rosen will win reelection and retain her Senate seat. Her victory will hold off Republicans from adding to their incoming 52-seat majority. In the hotly contested Senate race in Pennsylvania, Republican candidate David McCormick is suing election officials over how they count provisional ballots in his race. McCormick currently has a narrow lead over Democratic senator Bob Casey. McCormick is seeking a court order that would allow him to challenge large groups of ballots that he thinks should be disqualified, instead of having to file individual challenges. So when the new Senate convenes in January, some Republicans known as conservative firebrands will be in charge of major committees for the first time in their careers. Texas senator Ted Cruz is in line to lead the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, as well as approve more than 100 Senate confirmed positions. Senator Mike Lee of Utah will likely get control of the Energy Committee and senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will chair the Senate Homeland Security Committee. All three have often railed against their leaders and committee chairs over government funding and other hot button issues. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON:  Well, thanks so much for having me, Kim. It's great to be with you. Of course, the Senate is going to be held by Republicans and it looks increasingly like the House is also going to be held by Republicans, which would give Donald Trump a clean sweep combined with a right leaning Supreme Court, essentially conservatives would have full control of Washington. Of course, they wouldn't have 60 votes, which is required to overcome the filibuster. So it's not like Donald Trump could get every single piece of legislative item that he wants through.

I think the big question is what he absolutely wants to prioritize.What's sort of the big legislative item that he wants to get through? Of course, in his first term, it was the 27 tax cuts. I think probably what he'll do is push to make those tax cuts permanent. Obviously, he's talked a lot about the largest scale deportation of immigrants in history. I think that that's very unlikely to get through, just simply because Republicans and Democrats have been talking about bipartisan immigration reform for decades and nothing seems to happen. I think what we have to think about, right at the outset, though, is certainly what Donald Trump will do in terms of executive actions and executive orders and things that he can do that don't require congressional approval. I really think that, at the top of that list, is going to be tariffs. He's talked about 10 percent to 20 percent tariffs on all imports into the United States, upwards of 60 percent imports -- tariffs on imports from China.",

I mean, you saw Trump bumper stickers, Trump flags, F Biden signs that had been up since 2020. We went through the number of fliers that my parents were getting in the mail every single day.

Those planes then landing -- planes landing at Ben-Gurion airport with images now emerging of some of these fans returning to Israel and shouting those anti-Arab, violent messages that we'd heard here in Amsterdam as well. It was because the Maccabi Tel Aviv fans, as they arrived, were seen in videos that were then circulating on social media, showing a Palestinian flag being taken down but also violent and aggressive anti-Arab sentiment being expressed by them on the streets that the authorities here, had by Thursday night. Seeing that the tension around this match was rising to such an extent that they deployed extra police forces, there were some 800 policemen and women on the streets of Amsterdam by the night of the match itself as a result of that mounting tension. And yet it didn't prevent what happened on Thursday night, extremely shocking scenes that have left not just those who were targeted but Jewish communities across Europe extremely worried. And Dutch authorities absolutely clear on what happened Thursday night was not an appropriate political protest but, in fact, anti-Semitic hate that was openly expressed on the streets of this European city. And I think that has led to those calls that we've seen from Jewish leaders here in Europe, that it should be a wakeup call because of what we've seen over the course of the more than a year now that this war has been going on. Anti-Semitism was already on the rise. That has continued still further as a result. And they want something much stronger to be done about it here on the European continent. Kim.",

And it is understood, according to sources, that the stalling status of these negotiations and the killing of Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza has led to the U.S. calling on Qatar to essentially call for Hamas leaders to leave the country. It's understood, according to sources, that that message was issued to the Qataris from the U.S., from the Biden administration around two weeks ago. And that notice was accepted by Qatar a week ago. But as you mentioned, we have been receiving conflicting reports from one senior Hamas official, who has said that these claims are baseless, that this is being used as a pressure tactic as similar messaging has been sent around in the past.

Now top of mind for Defense officials, here is, of course, just how the future president plans to deploy the U.S. military domestically, something that is highly controversial here within the Pentagon. And, you know, Trump has hinted many times -- and he has outright said at times -- that he does intend or that he would support the use of the U.S. military to conduct domestic law enforcement here in the United States. So the U.S. military officials that we have been speaking to say that they are gaming out scenarios under which that would occur and how they would respond. For example, what that chain of command would look like and how they would push back or accommodate other requests made by Trump that were deemed more controversial. Another aspect of this, of course, is Schedule F, which is an executive order that Trump issued during his first term. That essentially would reclassify a huge swath of apolitical government employees to make them easily -- more easily fireable. And that is something that the Pentagon is also bracing for and has been scrambling to try to address before president Trump takes office on January 20th. So the bottom line here is that given the very hostile relationship that the Pentagon had with Donald Trump during the first Trump administration and the fact that so many of Trump's former senior military officials have spoken out against him in recent weeks, months and years. With John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff and a retired general, going as far as to call him a fascist, Pentagon officials, largely at the senior level here, are bracing for a potentially similar relationship with the incoming White House -- Natasha Bertrand, CNN, the Pentagon.

You know, he probably understands that Iran is not going to go away. But that's a separate issue. And by wrapping it up, you could see -- I know we're speculating here, Kim -- but you could see a similarity that will evolve between how Trump treats the Gaza and the south Lebanon war and how he treats the Ukraine war. He's going to tell, respectively, Netanyahu and Putin to wrap it up. He's going to want in both places some kind of a ceasefire and deal. But he's going to be indifferent to and casual about both Israel and Russia continuing a war of attrition. Meaning he's going to say to Netanyahu, I want a ceasefire, I want a hostage deal, I want this done, to which Mr. Netanyahu will say, absolutely, Mr. President. Mr. President, I will accommodate everything you ask, except for one thing. We do reserve the right to launch, you know, targeted operations and very focused, intelligence-driven operations. And Trump is going to wave his hand and said, yes, do whatever you do. But I just want this done. I want a ceasefire and I want a deal. He doesn't want this to disrupt him. He doesn't want this to distract him. But he also wants to be the one who made it happen. But by the way, it's -- this is going to apply in both cases, both the Gaza and Lebanon and in Ukraine. The second thing is, is how he's -- and this is highly speculative of him -- how he is going to go about Iran because he could be very tough on Iran, although he's very war averse from what we've learned about him. On the other hand, he could surprise everyone with his so-called unpredictability. And in the same manner that he approached and engaged Kim Jong-un in North Korea, he's going to call the Iranians to come back to the table and negotiate a new nuclear deal, if not for anything else, Kim, than to prove that I could do what Biden couldn't.",

That's from a U.S. official, who says the Biden administration has lifted its de facto ban on American contractors going to Ukraine. President Biden has so far kept them away, partly to avoid aperception that the U.S. is involved in combat. The new policy is expected to speed up the maintenance of some weapons systems, including Patriot missiles and F-16 fighter jets. The change was approved earlier this month, before the election.

So they were not able to save any of the belongings that they wanted to. The homeowner telling me that she wanted to pass things down to her kids and it's all burned to the ground.
