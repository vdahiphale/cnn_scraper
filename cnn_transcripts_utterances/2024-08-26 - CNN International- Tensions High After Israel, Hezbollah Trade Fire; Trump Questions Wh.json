Plus, Ukraine bombarded, Russia launches major missile and drone attacks at multiple targets. We'll have all the details for you.

And we begin with this weekend's cross-border attacks between Israel and Hezbollah based in Lebanon, as Gaza ceasefire talks sputter on. Israel launched what it called preemptive strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon Sunday. The IDF says it struck and destroyed thousands of Hezbollah rocket launcher barrels across dozens of launch sites. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing that this is not the end of the fighting.

He did say in his speech that Hezbollah achieved what it planned to do. And I think you've got -- both sides are claiming success. I think the truth lies somewhere in between. But certainly, the feeling is that the danger of an all-out war has passed at the moment. Essentially, we're back where we were before the strike on Majdal Shams that killed 12 children back in July, that Israel blamed on Hezbollah. Hezbollah denied it. But that sent off this -- this cycle of events that led to where we are today. So basically, we go back to where we were before that. And what we've seen so far today is almost pretty much what you would expect to be going on on the border between Israel and Lebanon. There have been four Israeli air strikes on Lebanese territory so far. One of them seems to have been a failed attempt to kill a local Hamas leader. Hezbollah has so far not claimed any attacks, but I'm sure we can expect some later in the day. This doesn't fundamentally change anything. There are still more than 100,000 Lebanese civilians who have had to flee their homes in the South. There are more than 60,000 Israelis who have had to flee their homes in the north. Hezbollah has made it clear that it will continue to provide what it's called a support front to Gaza. And basically, until the war in Gaza comes to an end, Hezbollah will continue to fire on Israel, ergo, Israel will continue to fire on Lebanon. Everything hinges on the situation in Gaza. And what we're seeing at the moment is that, despite more than 10 months of American diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict to an end, so far, they've failed. Amara?",

And we have heard from one U.S. official telling CNN that while there haven't been any significant breakthroughs following this weekend's negotiations, there has been forward progress made, that the challenges, the differences in sticking points that currently exist within the deal on the table between Israel and Hamas are seen as being, potentially surmountable, according to this U.S. official. But again, we heard yesterday from Hamas officials, as they departed Cairo, saying that, they continue to wish to see a deal which reflects the proposal put forward by U.S. President Joe Biden in late May, a deal which they say they agreed to in early July. That has been the messaging and position of Hamas for some time now. They continue to call for guarantees that there will be a transition to a permanent lasting ceasefire following an initial six-week pause in fighting. Those are the terms currently on the table and the terms Hamas wishes to see guaranteed. But there have also been questions surrounding the presence of Israeli troops within the Gaza Strip. And we know that the Israeli delegation put forward a revised proposal, which would see a reduced number of Israeli forces stationed on the Philadelphia corridor, the buffer zone separating Gaza, Southern Gaza, from Egypt. Now, that proposal has been put forward to Hamas officials. According to the statement we received from Hamas yesterday evening, they continue to call for a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. But there is a debate around the terms of this particular position, particularly, when it comes to what is considered to be a populated area, whether we see a withdrawal of Israeli forces from areas populated by civilians in the Gaza Strip, and whether or not the Philadelphia corridor would be separate to those areas.

So, we know that Chenoa Nickerson was actually hiking with her husband, and at some point, the two got separated as they were swept away in the waters there along the river and authorities saying that they were able to rescue her husband, and in total, actually 104 people had to be rescued from this area that included some of the hikers and some of the tribal members that were also in this area, people who shared those videos, and shared their stories, saying, essentially one hiker saying, that it was a tribal member who told them to get to higher ground, who was yelling at them. So, these people were scrambling, trying to climb and trying to get to that higher ground. They had to form human chains. They had to cross some of these creeks. So it was just very chaotic there on Thursday and the Governor of Arizona, Katie Hobbs, activating the National Guard. They had to use a Black Hawk helicopter to get people out of this area. I want you to take a listen to how a member of the guard described some of this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
