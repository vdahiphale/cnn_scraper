I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And we are following breaking news out of the Middle East today as Israel welcomes home four hostages rescued this morning from Gaza during a special military operation. All four were kidnapped by Hamas from the NOVA Music Festival during the October 7th attacks. That was eight months ago. They include 22-year-old Almog Meir Jan, 25-year-old Noa Argamani, 27- year-old Andrey Kozlov, and 41-year-old, Shlomi Ziv. Andrey and Shlomi were working as security guards at the music festival and you may remember Noa Argamani from this horrific video from the October 7th attacks, where we saw her screaming as Hamas fighters drove away with her on a motorbike. Israel saying this morning's rescue mission took place at two separate locations in Central Gaza near a refugee camp. Palestinians there describe the raid as hell on earth as heavy shelling and artillery fire bombarded the area. Hospital officials say at least 236 people have been killed and more than 400 injured, including women and children. CNN cannot independently verify those numbers and Gaza's media office does not differentiate between civilians and militants killed in its numbers. We have a team of reporters covering this story from all angles, Ben Wedeman has more on the casualties inside Gaza, but first, were going to go to Paula Hancocks, who is in Tel Aviv for more details on this surprise rescue mission. Paula, how are the hostages tonight?",

Now, we heard from the mother of one of the hostages, Almog Meir Jan, and she said that she can't stop hugging him.

      "sentences": "Well this is beyond a doubt, one of the bloodiest Israeli assaults since the beginning of the war back in October. Now CNN has been in touch throughout the day with doctors in the central part of Gaza where this operation took place and we've been getting regular updates about the death toll. At this point, it is 236, more than 400 wounded. Now, we are talking of course, we can't verify those numbers because neither Israel or Egypt will allow journalists into Gaza.And as far as the breakdown between civilians and fighters go, I can tell you, I went through lots of raw video shot by our freelance cameraman who was in one of those hospitals, and for the most part, there are a lot of children, there are a lot of women. There are some men, but it is not clear whether they are fighters or simply civilians who were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. But we were able to speak with one doctor at the Awda Hospital which is also in Central Gaza and he told us, today was the worst day of his entire career as a doctor and the work made far worse by the fact that they are short on medicine, equipment, the hospitals are working on generators that are barely functioning after basically providing electricity for eight months. And this obviously underscores just how dangerous this sort of operation being conducted in a crowded civilian area can be. Keep in mind that oftentimes, this kind of commando operation takes place at night. This took place at eleven o'clock in the morning on a Saturday when the streets were full of people out trying to buy food; children, and anybody who has been in Gaza knows everywhere you go, there are children. So there were children everywhere, which explains why in the video I went through, I saw so many wounded children. Now, the reaction to this outside of Gaza, we are hearing, for instance, the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas best is calling for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council and Josep Borrell who is the top European Union diplomat said that reports of another civilian massacre are appalling and he called upon all parties to join with President Biden and his three-point plan to bring about a ceasefire and release of the hostages as soon as possible -- Jessica.",

The redemption of Israelis lost on the battlefield, taken prisoner is a core Israeli value, so I think it is a kind of a collective sigh of relief. Obviously, the Palestinian death toll here, even if you don't believe Hamas statistics is a frightful one and it is horrific.I would also point out that in all three cases, the seven hostages rescued and freed by the IDF, they've all been freed aboveground, not from the tunnels. In this particular case, apparently a family or even two families paid by Hamas were guarding with Hamas guards regarding these hostages in two separate locations, which raises the real question, in my mind, I mean, most of the hostages are clearly below ground in tunnels. But you have to wonder if families are guarding hostages, then the information, the information loop on a family holding Israelis in Gaza, that's got to spread very, very quickly and I suspect that may be one of the reasons that the Israelis have had so much more success in freeing hostages above ground, even though the degree of difficulty of this operation is just quite remarkable.",

So I don't think there is any doubt both from a practical and a political and from the standpoint of preserving life of both Israeli lives in Palestinian lives, the best course here, it is the best pathway here, is through a negotiated release.

Hamas will trade tunnels, time, and hostages for what they really want, which is the preservation of the senior leadership and their families and a role for Hamas in some post October 7 environment for Gaza.And the Israelis are determined, it seems to me, I mean, forget destroying Hamas as a military organization, yes, and preventing another October 7th, but the Israelis are concerned, rightly, it seems to me that Hamas will survive as an insurgency and given the weakness of the Palestinian Authority and the complexity of Palestinian national politics, Hamas is going to have a role. Now the Israelis have not helped themselves frankly, this government by not doing a lot of post-war planning, which might over time minimize Hamas' influence, but therein lies the dilemma. If I had to bet where this is going, I think if Hamas could be convinced, I think you're probably talking some point of a phase one release, 30 additional hostages, may be fewer -- the women, the elderly, the infirmed for an undetermined number of Palestinian prisoners, humanitarian assistance, plus a six-week ceasefire. I think the Biden administration could get that if they take it.",

There is no trust to say the least. You have two parties who want to destroy Hamas and Israel and you end up with two speeds, slow and slower. I do believe that if in fact there is an opening, it will have to be a phase one opening. I just don't see this Israeli government and with Hamas, which has no incentive, frankly, for returning all of the hostages until they get what they want and the Israelis are simply not prepared to give them what they want, that you're probably talking about a phase one deal, and that now that Benny Gantz is in the process of deciding whether or not he wants to stay in the War Cabinet, the heavy lift on even a phase one deal with this Israeli government, the most extreme and right-wing in Israel's history is going to get a hell of a lot harder.",

Now, you have Hezbollah, hardened and battle trained as a consequence of its involvement in the Syrian Civil War, possessing anywhere from 150,000 high trajectory weapons, varied ranges and lethality and precision, which cover most of Israel. I don't think Hezbollah wants this for them. I don't think the Israelis want it either. They've gone 18 years since the summer of 2006 without a major escalation, and I think it is a concern, it is a big concern because that war is going to eclipse in ferocity and probably even in destruction especially in the Lebanese and the Israeli side what you watched play out in Gaza. I don't think it is inevitable, but I think the United States is going to have to step up and try to figure out a way to take advantage of the fact perhaps that the Biden administration doesn't want this conflict. I don't think the Iranian's undergoing leadership transition in the wake of Ebrahim Raisi's death wants this. So I guess the real question is whether or not a pathway can be found to de-escalate this before you end up with an escalatory ladder into full and all-out-war.",

Here we see Joe Biden with only a 49-point advantage among African American voters. You know, if you go back through the record books, Jessica, and you look at Democratic performances among Black voters, this is the worst.

Now, you'll see there are other justices on that list who, of course, have received gift amounts. Samuel Alito, north of a hundred thousand, $170,000.00. But the fact is the amount that Clarence Thomas, not just the number of gifts, but the amount of money that he has received. I think these numbers will do nothing to quell the idea that Supreme Court justices have to be much more transparent with the gifts that they've received, perhaps have to step back from issuing or taking part in certain opinions, and more than that, will do nothing to quell the thoughts from a lot of liberals who think that Clarence Thomas should not be on the United States Supreme Court. Now, of course, he is probably not going to listen to them, right? He hasn't listened to them all along. But these types of numbers are something that just puts the political pressure on the United States Supreme Court and that low approval rating that we've seen, that historic low approval rating from the American public, I think this super charges that and it is just something that I think a lot of folks wouldn't necessarily have expected, but a lot of watchdogs on the courts certainly did and these numbers definitely bear that out.",

Now, of course, the two leaders also were excited to talk about the situation in the Middle East, and they did today welcome the news of the rescue of those four hostages. And France, of course, has also expressed their support for the hostage deal that President Biden laid out recently, that three-phase proposal for the exchange of all the hostages for a ceasefire agreement.So all of these issues were expected to come up over the course of these last few days. But again, with democracy and freedom being front and center simply because of the anniversary that they were commemorating this week. Now, tomorrow the president and the first lady will also participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at an American cemetery and then return to the United States. But certainly the President spending these last few days talking about the cherished ties with France and really trying to strengthen this alliance with, again, one of the U.S.'s oldest allies.",

Priscilla Alvarez, thanks so much for that reporting.And I want to talk more about the president's trip with Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian and professor of history at Rice University. He's also a prolific author, including the book \"The Boys of Pointe du Hoc: Ronald Reagan, D-Day, and the U.S. Army 2nd Ranger Battalion.\" Douglas, thanks so much for being here today. I really appreciate it. And you're just the perfect person to talk to, to kind of tie all of this together, the moment that we're seeing presently and then looking back to the history that we're marking as well. Biden calling this trip to France his most remarkable yet. What has stood out to you about these past five days and the President's trip to France?",

You have the problem of invasion of Poland and it just kept going. And there was an isolationist sentiment at home led by people like Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh and others to get out of it. It's a European war we don't want to repeat.And so FDR had a hard time educating the country about the need to stop the Third Reich, to stop their expansion in Europe. Alas, we were bombed on December 7th 1941 and Japan declared war on us, and then Germany declared war on us. And Roosevelt had put a lot of mechanisms in place so we could have a hurry up industrial mobilization economy where we were able to convert, say, a factory that was making women's blouses to suddenly making parachutes or a saxophone company being converted to make ship valves. It was the greatest, most extraordinary innovation and industrial might the world had ever seen. And the United States, in the end, pulled it off. And what we accomplished and won at Utah, Omaha, Gold Sword (ph), Juneau beaches, it was a long slog after winning that Battle of Normandy to the Battle of the Bulge and the march to Berlin. But the - at the end, totalitarianism was stamped out in Western Europe, but now we're seeing a totalitarian rise of Putin's Russia and the moment is here to kind of thwart that. And it's just about convincing enough more Republicans in Congress to fund the Ukraine issue. About half of the Republicans want to help Ukraine and about half don't.

And looking also into the videos, both the body cam, the camera inside of the patrol car and also the witnesses that were around.This video that was released essentially shows that patrol car pull up to the street here behind me and you see the officers getting out of the vehicle trying to help this man who appeared to be in handcuffs. They get those off. And when he comes out to the street, he essentially starts kind of waving his arms. And it appears that he loses his balance and falls on all fours. And then you see those officers get back into the patrol car and leave. You then in the video see this man laying down, belly down, you know. And it was just something that the city council member said didn't know how long it lasted. He said this was a disgrace, said essentially that this man was dumped on the side of the road and said that he was outraged by all of this. Now, Burbank Police releasing a statement essentially changing things a bit and explaining things a bit further. Saying that initially they got this call about a naked man and the officers went to see him, got him to get dressed. Talked to him and told him that they would take him anywhere that he wanted to go. And so here's part of the statement from Burbank Police. They say, \"He voluntarily got into the patrol vehicle and was driven towards the Metro Red Line station. Along the way, the individual asked to be let out of the patrol vehicle to get coffee. The officers complied immediately with his request, pulled over and let the individual out of that patrol car. But overall the big picture here is homelessness and how difficult it is for politicians here in Los Angeles. And really in California to deal with this. It's something that they really haven't figured out, Jessica.",
