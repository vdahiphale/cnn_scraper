Trump is remembered for a series of pro-Israel moves when he was president, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights, and taking a tougher stance on Iran, while the Biden administration, including Vice President Harris, is seen by many here as having sought to restrain Israel's tough military response in the year since the October 7th attacks.(END VIDEO TAPE)",

Of the seven battles ground states, it's the only one he actually won in 2020. It was his narrowest margin of victory. And he spent three days in a row there. I don't think they ever thought that at the end of the campaign they'd need to spend three days in a row in a state that was in his corner four years ago.But look also at Pennsylvania. The fact both candidates, Kate, not just are in the state that many people think is the tipping point state, and obviously it's the biggest electoral prize. Look at where in Pennsylvania they are. These two candidates on this last day of full campaigning will both in Pittsburgh at one point and be in Reading, Pennsylvania. So, obviously, Harris trying to drive up Democratic turnout in Pittsburgh. But Reading, Pennsylvania, is in Berks County, Pennsylvania. This is a county that Donald Trump won twice, in 2016 and 2020, although he won it by less in 2020. So Democrats were able to make a little bit of inroads in that county. But Reading itself is a Latino population in Reading inside Berks County. Donald Trump didn't win a single precinct in Reading there four years ago. So he is clearly going there to try and see if he can make more inroads with Latinos, and Harris is going there to try to capitalize on the fallout from the Madison Square Garden rally and the comments about Puerto Rico and seeing if she can further slow his momentum with Latinos in a critical battleground state.

And so I want to just make this appeal to people. You deserve to have a president where you live rent-free in their mind and not that of their enemies, that they are staying up late at night thinking about how to lighten your load, how to make your life easier, how to make your aspirations real, how to lower costs for housing and grocery and prescription drugs. You deserve to live in a country where you're not under the fear of gun violence, a country where every child has a future, from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania to Haiti to Gaza to Israel. You deserve to live in a country where you're humanity and your dignity are centered, and you have automatically over your body. So the stakes are high, the contrast could not be clearer.
