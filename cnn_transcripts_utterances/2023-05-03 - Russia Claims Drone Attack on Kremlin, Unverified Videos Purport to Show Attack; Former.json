      "sentences": "So, there is breaking news out of Russia this morning, and to be clear, these are claims from Russia. There is new video circulating online that shows what Russia claims is a drone attack on the Kremlin.Now, CNN has not been able to independently verify this video. Russian state media claimed that two Ukrainian drones were flown toward the Kremlin overnight. Russia says this was some kind of an attack on Vladimir Putin's life, an attempt, I should say. Ukraine responded saying they had nothing to do with this incident. They added they have no information on the strike on the Kremlin, if it even happened. A spokesperson for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia's allegation of this assassination attempt, they are calling it, quote, a trick. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Eastern Ukraine, Nick Paton Walsh is in Dnipro, in Ukraine, that's toward the south. Nick Paton Walsh, first to you. You received a detailed response from Ukraine on these Russian claims. What did you hear?",

      "sentences": "Russia does seem to be putting forward a narrative that gives it a number of options by escalating whatever happened here to calling it the potential assassination attempt on the president gives them a roadmap, if you will, to run up another false flag operation, to claim something that proves to be in the end patently untrue, that these perhaps weren't Ukrainian drones, had nothing to do with Ukraine, as you Ukraine says, but gives President Putin a path to perpetrate another act of atrocity on Ukrainian civilians. Is that what this is about?What Ukrainian officials seem to imply is very well aware that in just the couple of days, the 9th of May is the big victory day celebration parades in Red Square right outside the Kremlin, where you see hundreds of military vehicles normally paraded by all of the big generals, all of the president's men are standing there historically, as they do on platforms as a flyby of Russian aircraft. It's a big day. It's a big day coming in. It commemorates the loss of tens of millions of Russians during World War II. It's an important day for President Putin. And the Ukrainians are saying that ahead of this event that commemorates the death of tens of millions of Russians during the Second World War, Putin is essentially going to have a hard time selling a counter-narrative to that when he is losing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands potentially of troops in what he's still calling a special military operation, not a war inside Ukraine. And the Ukrainians were essentially saying that this can be used by the Kremlin as a diversion to the losses that it's having in Ukraine. The concern in Ukraine is what will Putin choose to do off the back of this. And the reality is that there is a potential counteroffensive that's building up. And I think the other piece of the puzzle here that the Ukraine will look at, that Ukraine will be distinctly aware of, are the number of strikes that have occurred or attacks that have occurred inside Russia just beyond the borders of Ukraine at Russian supply lines and supply facilities that help fuel the war in Ukraine that have happened this week. Two attacks on train lines inside Russia leading to Ukraine, 20 carriages destroyed in one attack, and just this morning another fuel depot close to Ukraine's borders that inside Russia blown up unexpectedly. This will be a background narrative Ukrainians don't claim them that this will be something that will sting, sting in the Kremlin. BERMAN:  Again, I think it's fascinating that so far, it seems to be that it is the Ukrainians most rattled by this video and these claims today, not necessarily the Russians. Our Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, please stand by, we'll come back to you in a bit. Thank you so much for your help on this. Sara?",

Russia is claiming that not one but two drones hit the Kremlin on Tuesday night.

And it makes it sort of astounding to even contemplate the possibility that Russia staged this, although they may well have, of course. I'm not ruling anything out. But the fact that you see an explosion literally on top of the grand Kremlin palace, the physical, geographical, spiritual, symbolic center of the Russian state, and that's on videotape, basically, the drone seems to have hit the flag pole carrying the Russian flag in the center of the Kremlin.I mean, that is a remarkably potent image of vulnerability and it's extraordinary to think that the Russians may have sort of put that out themselves as justification for stepping up their campaign in Ukraine. I mean, I'm not even sure that they need a reason to step up their campaign inside Ukraine, never mind having to sort of broadcast images which expose just how sort of -- just what a weakened state the Kremlin is currently in. And so, yes, extraordinary scenes, these will be viewed -- as you can see, they're being viewed with horror in Ukraine to some extent because people are concerned about what the consequences might be, what retribution there may be for this, but there is also going to be people around Russia who are watching these images absolutely astonished that a war that they were told was a special military operation that wasn't going to touch them, that has nothing to do with them, really, has come right into the center of the Russian capital. And that's going to be a very, very potent message indeed from these images.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm hearing the same thing. And that just kind of confirms the fact that not a whole lot of people know what happened, but on the Russian side, the Ukrainian side, the U.S. side. There's only probably a few people that know exactly what was behind this strike.But it's interesting. You said earlier during the last hour, Kate, as you were kind of talking about the May parade on May the 9th, the Mayday Parade. That just doesn't happen on May the 9th. There have been literally tens of thousands of soldiers practicing for that parade right near where this drone strike hit. So, if it was a Ukrainian strike, I don't know why they would do it in the dark of night and allege it to be an assassination attempt on Putin. To me, that's ludicrous. Putin is not going to be in that building at 3:00 in the morning, likely, and one drone strike, unless it has a missile onboard, is not going to kill him. So, all of that is part of what Russia terms maskirovka. I'll introduce you that word. It's the word that Russia always attaches to any kind of operation where it's deception. You never know what's going on in Russia. Every story that comes out of Russia has an element of disbelief to it. So, if they're publicizing this in the afternoon on the day after it occurred or the morning after it occurred, then they're probably working their generation machine of misdirection and miscommunication and misinformation in all of these areas.",

The Eli Lilly drug, Donanemab, significantly slowed cognitive decline by 35 percent, according to a large clinical trial. That is the ability when we're talking about the cognitive ability, the ability to think clearly, remember things and do daily activities, of course.The data is coming from the company did show a risk of brain swelling and bleeding. Three of the more than 1,700 participants in the trial died from side effects. Also, a judge in Utah has blocked the state's ban on abortion clinics. That law was set to take effect today. It was to prohibit Utah from granting licenses to abortion clinics, and it was also to ban all abortion clinics from operating in the state starting next year. It would allow the law, it would allow hospitals to continue to perform the procedure, however. The judge said the ban singles out abortion clinics and is discriminatory. An appeal to that ruling is expected. And in San Francisco, a man has been arrested on a United Airlines flight for attacking an airline employee. Watch this. Everyone was, like, seriously stop. A witness tells CNN it all started when the suspect's wife was sitting in the wrong seat. A crew member insisted that she move and that is when the suspect now having been identified as Cody Lovins became agitated and then very clearly started throwing punches and was violent. He was taken off the plane, charged with battery. Lovins has now been banned from flying with United Airlines again. John? BERMAN:  That is some video.

He's facing charges, including four counts of first- degree murder after authorities say that he shot and killed a woman and three of her children. Police say they're aware of Stenson's whereabouts and they're actively working to take him into custody.Then in California, students and staff at U.C. Davis, they are on edge, and understandably so right now, as police are still searching for clues related to three stabbing attacks. Two of the victims died, as we've been reporting. Authorities say that the attacks were, quote, particularly violent and brazen and they did say that they see similarities in terms of a pattern in the three stabbings. School officials say for now in-person classes are canceled after 6:00 P.M. in light of this. Then officials in Mississippi, they're hunting for one remaining suspect who broke out of a county jail. Four inmates initially escaped from the Raymond Detention Center. That was on April 22nd. Officials say two of those inmates have since died, one captured and one remains on the run this morning. And federal and state law enforcement in Virginia and North Carolina, they're searching for two men who also escaped from jail. One of them was charged with murder for killing a sheriff's deputy. The two escaped from a jail in Farmville, Virginia, this past weekend. With all of that in mind, at least one high-profile manhunt is now over today. In Texas, police arrested Francisco Oropesa yesterday evening. He's accused of shooting and killing five people last week, including a woman and her nine-year-old son. Officials say Oropesa was found hiding in a home roughly ten miles from the crime scene. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
