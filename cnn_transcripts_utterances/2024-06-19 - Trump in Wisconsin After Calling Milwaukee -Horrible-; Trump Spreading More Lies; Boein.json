And then in the end we won. We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again. You have to vote, and watch your vote, watch your vote, because they tend to disappear. We have all the votes we need. We have to guard the vote. We have to stop this deal. If we stop this deal, we win. I don't have to campaign anymore, just stop this deal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

ADAM KINZINGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER MEMBER OF JAN. 6 SELECT COMMITTEE AND FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R-IL):  It is -- I don't know how many times we have to go through this where he says that. And unfortunately, his people just don't want to hear the truth. It's on the internet. All of the evidence is on the internet. Donald Trump, by the way, now that he's in a defensive posture, legally has access to everything that -- he's had it before, even the American public had. And they could call in, they could call any of these witnesses in to testify. But literally, if you Google January 6th evidence, you see every bit of it out there in the government repository. It can be seen, but he continues to repeat this statement and it's just lies.",

The vote counts, right, and the results are counted. That's all. When you convince half of the country that the system is broken, which is what he's doing, violence is the outcome. And we had a whole revolution based on the fact that we felt like we weren't represented by the British.And so, my concern is less about another January 6th at the U.S. Capitol. My concern is what happens at different state capitals when they're there certifying the election. Imagine Arizona, you know, with a Republican legislature and a Biden win, could you imagine that legislature being pressured to maybe switch and just announce that Trump won the state? And you think of the violence and the intimidation that could happen at the state level? That's where my concern is this year.

And that's Donald Trump's advantage.But these videos, I mean, they're blatant lies. And it used to be, Jim, back in the day, it would be kind of the dark corners of the internet that would put out these fake videos and then responsible people like members of Congress and the Senate or the RNC would say, no, we're not going to do that. They're the ones pushing this now. This whole Joe Biden wandering at Normandy, all you had to do was pan out and see that he was talking -- he's doing exactly what I would have done as a military guy, which is go over and talk to them and not the other state leaders. You know him at the fundraiser, if you actually zoom in on his face, he's very mobile. He's motioning. He's smiling at people. He's not frozen. But we're going to see this for the next five months.

And, you know, the aviation industry is so elusive. None of us really know what quite goes on in there. But we trust and hope that the people that say they're doing what they're doing are doing it.
