The judge, at the center of so much controversy, shuts down his attempt, to get rid of the Mar-a-Lago case, while blasting Special Counsel, Jack Smith, after he told her essentially, she doesn't know what she's doing. And President Biden's ultimatum, to Benjamin Netanyahu. Do more immediately to protect civilians in Gaza, or the U.S. could reconsider its support for Israel. The warning coming after the Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers. Is this a tipping point in the war? And a brazen break-in, right out of a scene from \"Ocean's Eleven.\" Thieves stealing $30 million, in one of the largest cash heists in L.A. history. So, whodunit? A former bank robber joins us, to help crack the case. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Just hours after former President Trump sang her praises, on social media, calling her a highly respected judge, Judge Aileen Cannon denied him something that he really wanted, getting that Mar-a-Lago classified documents case dismissed. The former President wanted the whole thing thrown out, based on his repeated argument that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to take what he wanted from the White House, as personal records. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I had every right to under the Presidential Records Act. You have the Presidential Records Act. I was there and I took what I took and it gets declassified. The law that applies to this case is not the Espionage Act, but, very simply, the Presidential Records Act. Everything I did was under the Presidential Records Act. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the judge did leave the door open to the possibility that Trump could still use the argument, to defend himself at trial, whenever that may be. Cannon still has yet to set a date. And that wasn't the only blow. The judge also delivered one, to Special Counsel, Jack Smith, whose office told Judge Cannon, this week, that Trump's central defense here, the Presidential Records Act, that it permitted him to take personal records from his time in the White House, should have no bearing here, because the papers Trump took were clearly official and classified government documents, not personal ones. The Special Counsel wanted Judge Cannon, to decide whether she'll allow Trump to make this argument, so that if she did, Smith could appeal her ruling. But the judge rejected Smith's request to rule promptly on the matter, calling his quote, demand, \"Unprecedented and unjust.\" Now, whether or not the jury will hear this argument, from Trump, it could make or break the case. And we're joined now by an attorney, who used to represent former President Trump, in the classified documents case, Jim Trusty. And Jim, thank you so much, for taking time, to be with us, tonight.",

Even though Bill Clinton had really interesting probably tapes of recordings from the White House? They don't pick that fight. They pick the fight here because they wanted to have criminalization of something that's not criminal, under the PRA. And DOJ was more than happy to jump all over that. So again, today's ruling leaves open the issue of exactly how PRA is going to play out.

ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: So Brianna, I respect Jim. We were colleagues at DOJ. I disagree on the Presidential Records Act itself, as a defense, in this case, for two main reasons. The first reason is the facts. There is zero evidence, from Donald Trump, from anyone around him, that he ever actually designated these records, as personal. And I think, notably, none of his lawyers have ever represented to a court that he actually designated these documents as personal. And I heard Jim say, well, there's not a procedure for that. But you have to do something. There would be some evidence of that. And then separately, I think there's a legal problem with it, which is, first of all, a president cannot designate any records, he wants, as personal. He cannot designate highly sensitive military documents, national security documents, as personal and take them. And finally, even if he could, it doesn't trump, no pun intended, it doesn't overcome the criminal law against retaining sensitive national security information. So, even if this gets to be a defense at trial, I think there's no real merit to it.",

Second of all, there was an important procedural difference, in the Clinton, what they call the, socks case, because reportedly, he stored the tapes in his socks drawer, which is a private outside party was trying to force the Archives, to seize those tapes.

I actually think what the judge did today forecloses that, makes it impossible to do that, because the judge said, well, we're going to decide when the trial happens, and maybe it's something that will go to the jury. You really can't appeal that if you're Jack Smith. And by the way, Bri, this is why I think Jack Smith is concerned, with today's ruling. Although he won, in the sense that the court did not dismiss the charges, if I'm Jack Smith? And I think Smith feels the same way. I'm very worried about this defense going to a jury, because it's confusing, because it's complicated, because it's technical. And prosecutors always want to tell a simple, straightforward story.

What are the plans for that to minimize the loss of innocent lives? That has been an ongoing discussion, between the administration, and the Israeli leadership, and President Netanyahu, and so -- Prime Minister Netanyahu. And so, these are lingering questions. And look, the politics of it are so tough because Israel's an ally. They were brutally attacked. Hamas has sworn to their destruction. They do need to defend themselves. But anyone with a beating heart also looks at those scenes from Gaza, and the things that happened over the weekend, which not only killed seven aid workers, but cut off aid, that because World Central Kitchen withdrew for the time being, and so did other aid groups. I mean, this is an untenable situation. And the President is caught in the middle of it. And it has created problems for him, within the Democratic coalition, increasingly.

I wonder what you think, having seen how quickly this has gone, what you realistically expect to learn. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Yes, not much, actually, Brianna, because it's way too small a timeframe, for there to be an effective investigation, in a situation like this. When an incident of this type occurs, in the U.S. military, and in many other militaries, there's a very thorough investigation that's convened. And that has a lot of different branches and sequels. And in this particular case, it's fine to issue some preliminary statements. But the way the Israelis are doing this, right now is, I think, more of a PR effort really, to get this out of the way.

Wildlife, zoo animals, household pets, they're known to do some pretty weird stuff, when the moon totally blocks out the sun.During the last American eclipse, in 2017, you see them there, flamingos at Nashville Zoo, huddling together super-close, and then the typically lazy lemurs actually paced around their enclosure. Here to get wild tonight, we have veterinary behaviorist at Ohio State's College of Veterinary Medicine, Dr. M. Leanne Lilly. All right, Dr. Lilly, what other weird wild animal behaviors happen, when the moon blocks out the sun? DR. M. LEANNE LILLY, BEHAVIORIST, OHIO STATE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE: Yes, so it depends a lot on the species and certainly on the individuals themselves. There are reports of Galapagos tortoises suddenly mating spontaneously, during eclipses, which is not their normal forte. Giraffes, at least at one zoo, were reported to all become suddenly very much animated, and running around. And giraffes are generally slower-paced animals unless they perceive a threat. The drop in temperature, and possibly the darkness, may trigger some animals, particularly invertebrates, to start nighttime behaviors. So, decreases in bee activity, butterflies decreasing their activity. Conversely, crickets have been recorded, to spike in their vocalizations and sound-making, at this time. So, it's going to be a potentially widespread. Very commonly, birds are reported to roost. And we don't have as much data on dogs and cats. And that may happen to be partially because they're mostly tuned into our schedules, rather than a strict daylight schedule. But that doesn't mean that things might not be different. Also, we know that when we humans act differently, sometimes, our companion animals find that pretty anxiety-producing. So, in those situations, we need to be aware of how we're impacting our pets.",

So, I wonder, can these lions, tigers and bears sense that this is approaching? Or is there something that they might feel that we don't? Because maybe we're a little more tuned out to some of nature's cues?",

And often what we think to measure is what we can sense.Certainly, there are actually groups who do things like study the geomagnetic fields, during eclipses, and it would be fascinating to get those and us in the same room, and see what we can find out. But two, we have to remember that many of these animals, especially prey animals, are very finely-tuned into smells, and sounds, and things like wind patterns that we ignore all the time. And so, what to us might seem like a spooky Sixth Sense might be a phenomenally better sense of hearing, or a better sense of smell. And so, when you get multiple signals that all say something is different, something that's happening, or maybe it's nighttime, crickets, birds, drop in temperature, suddenly dark, or starting to get dark? All of those may make a very different picture, to an animal that has a different sensory set than it does to us. They also haven't spent the last couple of weeks, hyping this up for themselves. So, they don't know that it's coming the same way we are all getting really excited about it. So, I think, any of those range of responses--",
