      "sentences": "Good evening everyone. This is CNN TONIGHT. I'm Alisyn Camerota.We have got news tonight on that congressman-elect who keeps getting caught in flagrant lies. He may be in more hot water. You'll recall George Santos has admitted to lying about key parts of his biography, from his wealth to his education, to his resume, to his family, to his religion. Now the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York is looking into some of his dubious finances. And the Nassau County district attorney has announced she is looking into his, quote, numerous fabrications and inconsistencies. And we have some new lies he has just been caught in. Also, the Southwest Airlines meltdown continues. The airline is still canceling thousands of flights. Passengers are still outraged. And we've learned that Southwest airlines got a $7 billion bailout during the pandemic. So, what did they use all that money for? But let's begin with George Santos and more of his lies getting exposed. The Republican congressman-elect just cannot seem to get his own story straight. He lied about going to college. He lied about graduating from college. He lied about who he's worked for. He's lied about being Jewish. And CNN's KFile just dug up new lies that we'll bring you in a moment. Now, federal prosecutors are looking into his dubious finances. A source tells CNN they're investigating the congressman-elect's financial situation that seems to rapidly swing from being too broke to pay rent to being a multimillionaire. The district attorney of Nassau County, New York, also says she has Santos on her radar. But, wait, there's more. CNN has confirmed that Santos was charged with embezzlement in Brazil. Let's go to CNN's Eva McKend with more on all of this. I barely know where you can begin, Eva. So, let's just try to narrow it down and let's start with the federal investigation now into George Santos. What are prosecutors looking out there and is that different than with the Nassau County D.A. is looking at?",

Well, KFile called Horace Mann and they said that he never attended the school. But he gave sort of this sad story about his family falling on hard times and him being four months shy of graduation and not being able to graduate from this esteemed school. Well, it turns out this entire episode is not true.He also claimed that he stood up at this conference and criticized Goldman Sachs when he was working there at the Salt Private Equity Conference. But, of course, we know that Santos never worked for Goldman Sachs. And we spoke to Anthony Scaramucci, who I know that many folks are familiar with, who runs that conference, and they say not only did Santos not speak on a panel, he didn't even attend.",

Great to have you all of you here. Errol, just to recap for everybody, I just want to put up on the screen some of the lies that George Santos has been caught in. I mean, they are wide-ranging. [22:05:00] He never worked for Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, though he claimed he did. He didn't graduate from Baruch College or MBA from NYU. He didn't go to college at all. He's not Jewish. His grandparents are not Holocaust survivors. He never ran an animal nonprofit. He never owned 13 properties or any that people can find. He was not forced to leave Horace Mann, that's the New York private school, as Eva just reported, because he never went there to begin with. Oh, and by the way, as we've learned, CNN can confirm he was charged with embezzlement in Brazil for forging an elderly man's signature on checks that were not hi. So, I think that you wouldn't want this person to be a lawmaker in your country's Capitol but he is going to be, Errol, so now what?",

And if the law catches up with him, then and possibly only then would his fellow members of Congress decide to take action against him. The last member of Congress to be kicked out was James Traficant. And that was a long time ago. It was a generation ago. And that was after he was convicted on ten federal fraud charges.So, you can be under quite a cloud and still exist in Congress. You can ask Matt Gaetz about that. There are any number of members who are being investigated at any given time facing very, very serious charges. So, that is one distinct possibility that the lies that this man has told and the investigations of those lies are likely to have some consequences. I mean, honestly, while it is very attractive to look at the embellishment and sort of and I think people can kind of understand that, I guess, maybe on some emotional level, wanting to seem like you're more than you are and fake it until you make it, but the ones that involved -- the charges and the lies that involve money are going to get him in a lot of trouble. When you raise money for animal rescue and none of the money makes its way to where it is supposed to be, that's when you get into real trouble.

I mean, it is very tight given the holdouts that are there on the sort of right flank of the Republican conference. And so as a consequence in terms of self-preservation, he is quiet, but I think it is a real mistake. I think that this is where leadership is absolutely essential in stepping out, condemning wrong and saying, this does not fly. We do not want him as a part of our caucus.

Once he does, though, John is exactly right, I mean, he'll be in ensconced and he'll have a couple new privileges that he won't be able -- that we won't be able to sort of pass through or crack through. He even has a relative immunity speaking privilege as long as the statements are made on the floor of the House. So, he can spin all kinds of stories and have relative immunity as a member of Congress. So, we are in a very tough position. This is intended to be self- correcting, though. The system is intended to be self-correcting. I wouldn't like George Santos' chances at re-election or, for example, if the seat were vacated and he tried to run again.

That is basically the stated position of the Trump 2024 campaign. But it is certainly a potential legal matter and certainly is a matter for just our understanding of this moment in history is a really important thing to have preserved in the record like this, that within days of this historic assault on the Capitol, the sitting president of the United States was thinking about potentially issuing essentially an amnesty for the people involved in that. And I think, Alisyn, it helps sort of set the stakes for everything else that we have learned in these transcripts that this was the president's frame of mind when people in his cabinet may or may not have been talking about the 25th Amendment or were talking with each other about how alarming it was that he was still on the job.

He says, the conversations shifted from debating the certification of Arizona and establishing a commission to audit Arizona to impeachment, talk of the 25th Amendment, and the senators thought that any effort to mount a sustained objection to any state had ended.

She is a CNN economics and political commentator and a Washington Post opinion columnist. Catherine, great to see you. So, they had this huge systems failure. I mean, their phone system sounds woefully antiquated. Even the flight attendants couldn't get through on their phone system. Then they had all these other technological failures. They got $7 billion. Let me just give this you some context. So, during the pandemic, this was the PPP relief funds that airlines got. American got 18 billion, Delta got 12 billion, United got close to 11 billion, and Southwest got more than 7 billion. Could they have used any of that PPP money to upgrade their systems?",

You know, they're going to have to reimburse people for that because baggage ended up in completely different cities from where the passengers were supposed to land.

At the Tampa airport one Southwest passenger took action. She had decided to take it into her own hands to help other flyers track down their bags. She was delayed. And while her flight was delayed, she pulled out her phone and started taking pictures of these bags here and any that had phone numbers attached to the handles, she started texting people.

And then we got to the front of the line after waiting, you know, over an hour and they said, no, you need to go down a baggage. So we got in that queue, which was over an hour. Well, over an hour.
