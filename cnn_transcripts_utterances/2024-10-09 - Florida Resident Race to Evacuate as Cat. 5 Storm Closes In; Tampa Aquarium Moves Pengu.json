Here are some of the top stories we're following today.U.S. President Joe Biden has cancelled his overseas trips this week, saying he needs to be in the country when Hurricane Milton makes landfall. Mr. Biden had planned to make his first state visit to Berlin, where he was also due to meet with German, British and French leaders to discuss support for Ukraine. Talks between Boeing and union members have broken down and no more negotiations are scheduled. In part, the union is seeking a pay rise and had been on strike for nearly a month. And Brazil's Supreme Court says X can resume services in the country. X have been suspended since August after not complying with court orders related to hate speech and misinformation moderation. Elon Musk had initially called for the order's censorship but has since bowed to pressure by blocking accounts flagged by the court and paying pending fines.",

It's forecast to weaken before then, likely to Category 3 strength, but forecasters warn the powerful winds and storm surge will still be life- threatening. The city of Tampa is bracing for the worst-case scenario.Officials there say one thing that makes Milton so scary is what it would do with all the debris left behind by Hurricane Helene, which hit the region just two weeks ago. [04:35:00] Another major concern, power outages, which authorities fear could be widespread and very long-lasting, affecting potentially millions of people. Let's head back to Atlanta to check in with Derek Van Dam, who's been looking at the Waffle Index, the House Index.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so there's a restaurant chain in southwestern Florida and across much of the southeastern U.S. called the Waffle House. And it's often an indicator of how severe a storm could be. So they either stay open in a minor, maybe Category 1 hurricane, but they start closing up shop when we start expecting more major impacts and a loss of electricity, that type of thing.So there's actually a map that they have issued where you can track the closures of that particular restaurant, and it's a good indicator to people. I've even seen it in past hurricanes, where people can get an indication of where power has been restored because the Waffle House has been open as well. So it's just kind of an interesting little index here that local people within the United States, particularly hurricane-prone areas, use to determine the severity of a hurricane. By no means is it an official forecast, right? But I want to turn the page here to talk about what we are facing here in southwest Florida. And, you know, Tampa is on knife's edge right now because of the model data that's coming in minute by minute on whether or not this storm will move to the south or whether or not it will keep its initial trajectory towards Tampa Bay. That still needs to be determined. There are so many details about a hurricane of this magnitude, this strength, and this size that can lead to downstream implications, meaning in 24 hours' time, where it exactly makes landfall. One thing we know for sure is that the hurricane has maintained its intensity overnight. And, in fact, there's this bubble of convection or thunderstorm activity. Look at all the lightning in advance of the storm. And then here, this is important as well, a clear eye. You can see all the way down to the ocean. And that little lightning strike on the northern eyewall indicates to me that there's still a lot of maintaining of this Category 5 strength of 160 mph winds. Look, we're 24 hours away from a direct strike from a major hurricane. This is not the place we want to be, but this is the reality that we are facing. So you have got to listen to authorities. If you have not evacuated, time is running out. And I plead with you to leave, especially if you're along the coastline. If you're located in southern Florida, you need to be listening up as well. Southwest Florida, as we get that exact track nailed down here within the next coming hours, this will make all the difference on who receives the worst of the storm surge. Remember, you can hide from the wind, but you cannot hide from the water. This is the concern here, because flooding and coastal storm surge will inundate homes, it will inundate businesses, and certainly many of the coastal barrier islands that are so heavily populated. Now, this forecast track has a Category 4 just before landfall. And that's important. You can see how it weakens because it interacts with the land, the central peninsula of Florida. But we do anticipate this storm to be a major hurricane upon its arrival. In fact, the sheer fact that it maintained its strength overnight means that this storm will have Category 3 or higher winds as it makes landfall along the coast. This is some of the latest data. This is a European model, so we're looking at one set of models. And this is interesting because what we saw yesterday was a southerly shift in that eyewall, the strongest part of the storm, where the most intense surge will be located. Now we're noticing this windshield wiper effect. This is kind of going back and forth, north and south, game of miles, right? Well, now we're starting to see a worst-case scenario again unfold with this particular model for Tampa Bay. So, all of these details need to be ironed out going forward, but one thing's for sure. Catastrophic winds possible from Hillsborough County, Pinellas County southward into Charlotte, Lee County, Sarasota as well, Punta Gorda, Siesta Key. These are the areas that need to be paying very close attention. The eye of the storm now becoming visible on radar. This is the Key West radar. So, really, when you see that on radar, it really, really starts to highlight the amount of time that we have available to us because those radar beams can only stretch so far. Satellite, we're taking it from space. Radar, we're taking it from a beam from the ground. So, what we're looking at now is a storm surge warning map. And I want you to take note that we know the obvious here, right? The western coastline, the Gulf Coast of Florida under storm surge warnings. But also note what's on the east side. That is also a storm surge warning. This will cross over the peninsula and also bring up the seas and the coastal storm surge on the other side of Florida. So, devastating next 24 hours, really, truly.",

It may not cost a lot of life. What is really worrisome is that mound of water being pushed by Category 5 winds less than 500 miles away from this part of Tampa.

Late night notifications that can interrupt teens' sleep.And they claim that TikTok has failed to do enough to address so- called TikTok challenges, these viral video trends where teens try to replicate videos created by other users and can sometimes be encouraged to engage in dangerous behavior, like riding on the outside of a subway train. That's a stunt known as subway surfing, and the New York complaint points out that a New York teen was killed doing this earlier this year, and that his mom found videos on his TikTok feed promoting this kind of activity. Now, TikTok has repeatedly said that its platform is safe for children. This is not the first time that it's faced claims like this. A spokesperson told me today that the company strongly disagrees with the claims, and they pointed to new features that the platform has rolled out in the past few years. Things like a default screen time limit for teens, default privacy protections for teens under the age of 16, and parental oversight tools. But these state attorneys general clearly think that those things are not enough. Claire Duffy, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
