Israel has long said that Hamas uses Al-Shifa to cover up what it says is an extensive terror infrastructure underground. The beating heart of Hamas, as they put it. And that's something that Hamas and the hospital have denied. The IDF also accusing Hamas of killing Army Corporal Noa Marciano at the hospital, refuting a claim by Hamas that she died as a result of an Israeli airstrike. The body of the 19-year-old was recovered last week in Gaza City. CNN's Oren Liebermann entered Gaza with the Israel Defense Forces to see the tunnel shaft at Al-Shifa, and what lies beneath. And, to be transparent, CNN reported from Gaza under IDF escort at all times. As a condition for journalists to join this embed, media outfits had to submit their footage filmed in Gaza to the Israeli military for a review. CNN retained editorial control over the final report. Here's Oren Liebermann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): We go in under cover of darkness. And as we cross the border fence, it's lights out across the Gaza Strip. Escorted by a tank, we switch into an armored personnel carrier for the final stretch. Even through a night vision screen, you can see the magnitude of the destruction on the streets of Gaza City.

The key question, of course, what's behind that door? And either more tunnels? The IDF has control of the Al-Shifa Hospital complex, and they are looking for more tunnels.

(END VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES: Now, the IDF has also released videos and stills that it claims show Hamas bringing hostages into Al-Shifa Hospital on the day of the attack on October 7th. CNN cannot independently confirm the identities of the individuals in the video, nor their affiliations, including those the IDF says are hostages. CNN also cannot independently verify the content of the videos or the series of events the IDF says took place. But, according to the IDF, this CCTV video shows a hostage being brought in through the hospitals main entrance that day. You can see a man is frog-marched through the building. And then, another video also purportedly shows a second hostage you see there, left of the frame. That person has a bandaged hand and is being pushed on a gurney donna hospital hallway. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry is questioning the authenticity of the videos, and stills, but says, if true, they show that hospitals were providing medical care to anyone who needed it. Meanwhile, the 31 neonatal babies evacuated from Al-Shifa Hospital are to be transported to Egypt in the coming hours. They were evacuated on Sunday by the United Nations team, and the Palestinian Red Crescent, and taken to a maternity hospital in Southern Gaza. UNICEF says their condition was, quote, \"rapidly deteriorating\" due to the collapse of medical services at Al-Shifa. According to the World Health Organization, doctors who are treating them now say all the babies are fighting serious infections, and 11 of them are in critical condition. One of the fathers who was reunited with his newborn son after two weeks, says he wasn't sure if his child was still alive. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Thank God we now feel that our son is safe after not seeing him for more than two weeks. We didn't know whether he was dead or alive, especially when communications were disconnected with the doctors. They called us in the beginning to tell us that the child feels better and that we can come to take him, but the Israelis had already cut Salah al-Din (ph) Street, and we were in Nuseirat. We could only pray for his safety. And he is here safe. I'm taking him home, but may God help the rest of the parents. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But so many hospitals and other health facilities are now effectively unable to operate, and the latest numbers of wounded is at more than 30,000. What are your concerns in that regard, the treatment? SARI BASHI, PROGRAM DIRECTOR, HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH: Sure. So the laws of war provide special protections for civilians, in general, and in particular for hospitals and other medical facilities used to treat the sick and the wounded. Israel, both as a warring party, as well as the occupying power in Gaza, has an obligation to protect hospitals and to actively facilitate their -- their good functioning. Even before Shifa and other hospitals were raided, they stopped functioning as hospitals, because the Israeli military had systematically drained Gaza of life-saving humanitarian supplies, including the fuel needed to power those babies' incubators.",

The Israeli military needs to reopen its own commercial crossings with Gaza, as it has done in previous hostilities; lift the ban on fuel, and allow fuel and other lifesaving supplies into Gaza; and actively facilitate the flow of aid from the South to the North.

About 6 percent of ballots remain to be counted.Now, Milei run as an outsider, to say it mildly, promising to break up with the status quo. He's vowed to use the U.S. dollar as Argentina's currency and pursue a raft of right-wing policies. Milei is taking the reins of the country with one of the highest inflation rates in the world.

Because when he came to fame, and gained some traction by literally wielding chainsaws in some of his political rallies, it's also fair to say that, in the last few weeks and months, Milei has remarkably turned down some of his most inflammatory remarks. And -- and really tried to move to the center, trying to move to a more respectable image of what a commander in chief looks like. It's one thing that is beyond doubt, however, Michael, is that he won by a much higher margin than it was previously expected. Much sooner, frankly, than expected. Sergio Massa conceded his defeat even before the first results, preliminary results were even published on the electoral authority's website down in Buenos Aires. And this means that Milei is, right now, a president elected with a strong mandate and with a lot of confidence. And that confidence transpired in his first speech to his supporters, when he painted, once, again a rosy picture for the future of Argentina.
