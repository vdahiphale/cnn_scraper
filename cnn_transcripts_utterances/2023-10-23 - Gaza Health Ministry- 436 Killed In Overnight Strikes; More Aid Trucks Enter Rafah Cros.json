That's apparently one of 320 strikes Israel carried out overnight, with the idea of saying it was targeting tunnels and command centers of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza says more than 400 people were killed overnight Sunday into Monday. Driving the death toll since October 7th past 5000. Residents of Khan Yunis calling the hardest night so far. Now Israel also says it conducted raids along what it calls the contact line with Gaza. It says it has killed or captured 1000 Hamas terrorists in its operations outside of Gaza. A Palestinian NGO says Israel detained dozens of people in the West Bank overnight, and Israel says it -- again struck targets inside Lebanon. This as a third aid convoy was prepared to enter Gaza. Agency said Sunday the territory desperately needs fuel. So, Israel is ramping up its attacks from the air, but there is still no clear sign of when a ground offensive could begin. CNN's getting sent in as Nic Robertson looks at that delay. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voiceover): Bristling with battle ready troops. Farmer's fields north of Gaza churn with a controlled fury of a nation readying for an incursion to strike Hamas. Yet they are waiting with no explanation why. ROBERTSON (on camera): It feels like that early rush for battle readiness has passed. The troops are deployed standing by. The question is how long can they be kept out here?

They can't evacuate their patients, they have children, babies on incubators, the elderly, who are dependent on that health care being provided in those hospitals. And yet, we are hearing those repeated warnings from the IDF telling them to leave, telling them that those airstrikes are going to intensify. We've heard the warnings from the United Nations that this is an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe. The aid that is getting in right now simply isn't enough. There needs to be fuel to get in. There needs to be more water, more medical care, more food as well, for those in need. That is the concern at this current point in time. But of course, as he saw that there is also deep-seated fear that we could be seeing an unfolding crisis when it comes to the evacuation of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Suggestions of Palestinians being evacuated to Egypt, to Jordan, and even further afield. And there is a huge amount of concern here in the Middle East. We've heard that from officials and we've heard that from people on the streets protesting. And the sentiment that we are hearing here and I learned from people in the street is not that they are not willing to take in further refugees. Of course, we know that more than two million Palestinian refugees currently live in Jordan but rather, they are considered this could mark a repeat of history.

These are the kinds of phrases that are being used by Israel's military and political leadership at the moment. So, regardless of how long this delay lasts, it will not be indefinite. And at some point, we will see a significant force of Israeli infantry troops as well as tank and armored divisions going into the Gaza Strip to carry out the task that Israel's political leadership has set out, which is to destroy Hamas and destroy its operatives inside the Gaza Strip. We know that that will be a very, very tall order in part because of how densely packed the Gaza Strip is. And the fact that this is urban combat and guerrilla warfare with Hamas having dug, you know, tons of tunnels underneath the Gaza Strip. In talking to his really commanders in the last several days, they are clear eyed that Hamas has certainly prepared for them to go in with the ground force.

The United States at the same time has different national security understandings. They want to ensure that there isn't a rise in a regional conflict, although there are indicators that some of that is already happening. They want to advise their allies, Israel, as the best way to do it to not fall into some of the traps that Hamas is painting basically.
