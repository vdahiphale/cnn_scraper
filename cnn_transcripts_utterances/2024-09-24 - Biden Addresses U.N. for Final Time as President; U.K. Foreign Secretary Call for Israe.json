      "sentences": "And that was President Biden delivering his final address to the United Nations General Assembly. I'm joined now by Alex Marquardt, Ben Wedeman, our correspondent in the Middle East. He's in Beirut, and General Wesley Clark former supreme allied commander at NATO.Alex, let me go to you first. I mean, I thought there were some pretty notable moments in that speech. Obviously, he touched on the Middle East, saying at one point that full-scale war is not in anybody's interest. He didn't spend a whole lot of time on Ukraine. But I thought perhaps the most striking element of the speech was his warning to the world about artificial intelligence, but what stood out to you?",

      "sentences": "Well, he sort of -- as he started to tick through the different subjects, he started with Ukraine, which will probably go down in terms of his legacy as one of the more positive moments, the finer points of the support for Ukraine, the American -- how the U.S. sort of rallied NATO allies to Ukraine side to get them the weapons, the aid that they need. He said, we must not grow weary.Of course, there are big questions right now about what the path forward is going to look like. We know the President Zelenskyy later this week is going to present President Biden with his plan for victory, although details remain relatively elusive. Jim, in terms of the Middle East section, which is the one that we were sort of listening out for most closely, you know, this is a speech that sort of has broad themes, big ideas. But frankly, we didn't hear too much that was new or how he was going to get not one, but two peace plans forward, both for Gaza and for Southern Lebanon. He talked about his efforts to get that ceasefire deal done with allies, Egypt and Qatari, said that now is the time for the parties, Israel and Hamas, to finalize that ceasefire. It's time to end this war. And then he moved on to the escalating situation in Lebanon, in which he said that it is not inevitable that this war will expand to further consume the region. He said they continue to work feverishly to try to get to a deal, but it is not clear how he is going to accomplish that. Clearly, outside of these big grand speeches at the U.N. General Assembly, there are going to be meetings to try to push that forward. But for now, how that's going to happen remains unclear. Jim.",

      "sentences": "Jim, to me, it sounded like the same old broken record we've heard from American diplomats going back to October. Lots of aspirations, but nothing in terms of concrete action, let alone accomplishments. I mean, he's talking about bringing peace and stability to the Middle East. Nothing could be further from reality in the Middle East at the moment.He talked about a diplomatic solution is still possible. But we've seen Secretary of State Antony Blinken coming to the Middle East 10 times, traveling tens of thousands of miles. And what we've seen going back to October is a war in Gaza that has spread to Lebanon, that has involved Iran, that is involving Yemen, Iraq, militias in Syria. It -- the U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East has been adrift now for 11 months. Now, we have more than 41,000 dead in Gaza, in Lebanon, in the space of 24 hours. You had the highest death toll since the Sabra and Shatila massacres. The United States is spinning its wheels in the Middle East. There's lots of talk, but the war is getting worse. It's spreading. And at what point, you have to ask yourself, does the United States put its interests first and say, this has got to stop because this war in Lebanon, in Gaza is posing a long-term danger to the interests of the United States. Think about the impact of the war in Iraq, it led to ISIS, it led to massive instability. And the problem is that this war, within the space of 11 months, is planting the seeds for future conflicts for generations to come. You know, all the young people who have seen their brothers and sisters and families killed, their homes destroyed here in Lebanon, the same thing. This will have a long-term legacy that impacts the strategic interests of the United States. Jim.",

Today's exchange comes one day after Israel targeted the militant group. This fighting is a key focus, of course, of the United Nations General Assembly. You just heard President Biden speak on this a few moments ago this week as world leaders and diplomats gather.And joining me now is the British foreign secretary, David Lammy. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it. Let's jump right into it. What can world leaders do to keep this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah from escalating into an all-out regional war? It seems to be heading in that direction.",

I think that the International Community is coming together.And I was talking to Secretary Blinken just yesterday evening, we're coming together to urge both the Israelis and Lebanese, Hezbollah to come to the table. This is a political settlement that we need. Amos Hochstein has done a tremendous job talking to both sides to get to a plan, to see Hezbollah move back beyond the Litani River, implement Resolution 1701. And what I'm certainly calling for is an immediate ceasefire so that Israelis can move back to their homes and those in Lebanon could also move back to their homes in Southern Lebanon. That is the only way. None of us want to see a wider escalation that leads to regional war,",

This is not the time for a regional escalation.And of course, we all recognize that rockets have been flying from Hezbollah into Israel since October the 7th, there is tremendous capability in Lebanon. And so, for all of those reasons, the way forward must be a political settlement. ACOSTA:  Well, and that leads me to this, on the northern side of Israel is Hezbollah, on the Southern side is Hamas. There are also the Houthis in Yemen, all backed by Iran. What is being done diplomatically to rein the Iranians?",

We came together, the U.K. and the U.S. to ensure that we did not see a tremendous loss of life across Israel and Jordan when there were missiles fired from Iran. We will act, of course, to protect loss of life in Tel Aviv or indeed in Jordan.But at this time, we are sending all messages using all diplomatic channels across the U.K., Germany, France, particularly with Iran, to urge them to step back and urge them to press their proxies not to act in a way that would lead to a wider regional escalation.",

We've seen more expansion this year than in the last 20 years combined. And what this does is it undermines the two-state solution, which is the only way out.And so, I will continue to talk to close allies here in the United States, across the G7 nations particularly about what more we can do to ensure that we are protecting lives on both sides in the West Bank. Understanding, of course, that Iran is flooding the West Bank with guns and ammunition. And of course, that is also leading to a rise intentions.",
