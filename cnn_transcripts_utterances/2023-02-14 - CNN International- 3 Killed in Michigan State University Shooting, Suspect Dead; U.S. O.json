Including most importantly, whether the special grand jury recommended that anyone should face charges as part of the investigation.But the judge says that the introduction and the conclusion and another potentially important section of this report can be made public, a section about whether any witnesses potentially perjured themselves when they came before the special grand jury. The judge wrote that the special purpose grand jury discusses its concern that some witnesses may have lied under oath during their testimony to the grand jury. Because the grand jury does not identify those witnesses, that conclusion may be publicly disclosed at this time. So, that's coming on Thursday. The judge did not want the meat of this report released because a number of people who went before the grand jury they're not allowed to have their lawyers with them in the grand jury. He mentioned that there could be people named in this report who never appeared before the grand jury, former president Trump would be an example of one of those.

I'll do my best to differentiate between the two because they are indeed two completely different storms.There is the first low pressure kind of trucking through the Four Corners regions, lots of snow throughout the area. And that's going to move towards the upper Midwest through the next 24 hours bringing a rain/snow mix depending on where you are located. The other low pressure and associated cold front kind of entering the equation across the Pacific Northwest. This is the secondary storm that's a little bit more powerful and will bring us a chance of severe weather across nation's midsection come the middle to second half of the workweek. In fact, you can kind of differentiate and separate the two storm systems with our winter weather alerts. The first storm again moving through the Four Corners, it's got its eyes set on the Upper Midwest, that's where we have winter storm watches in place. The secondary storm system, the more powerful storm moving across the Pacific Northwest bringing snowfall with winter weather alerts stretching from Billings to Portland. Lots of energy associated with these two separate systems. We have over 70 million Americans with high wind alerts, this includes St. Louis, Dallas all the way to El Paso and Los Angeles. Lots of rain too. You can see on the warm side of the storm. Showers are possible through the middle the week from Chicago to St. Louis. There is the snow on the cold side of the first storm. And then the snow piles up once again across the Colorado Rockies and throughout the Pacific Northwest. You can see the first kind of storm moving through and then our secondary more powerful storm system that will interact with warm humid air. And we know what happens when that takes place. We get that collision of air masses and the severe weather chances start to go up. We have a slight risk of isolated tornado activity, damaging winds, and large hail Memphis to Shreveport and Little Rock -- this is for Wednesday. But let me point you into the direction of Thursday, more -- several tornadoes, I should say, according to the warnings from the Storm Prediction Center where you see this shading of yellow, that includes the Gulf Coast to the Ohio River Valley as a cold arctic blast of air settles in.
