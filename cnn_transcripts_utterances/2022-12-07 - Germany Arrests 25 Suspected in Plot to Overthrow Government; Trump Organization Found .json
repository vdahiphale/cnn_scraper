UsOver 2 dozen far-right suspects have been arrested in Germany during early morning raids across the country. They are accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Germany considers far-right extremism a major threat to security, following a spate of attacks in recent years. The raids are continuing and German media described the operation as one of the country's largest actions against far-right extremists. Prosecutors say members of the group, called Right Citizens Movement, followed conspiracy myths and QAnon ideology. I want to bring in CNN's Nic Robertson, who has insight. Great to have you with us from London. So a significant number of arrests during this massive raid across almost a dozen German states, plus two other countries.

It believes coming after the Second World War that the country was sort of a construct, a fake construct of the Allies. This is at the root of their ideology. That's what the interior minister describes as violent fantasies and conspiracy ideologies. Their plan was quite simply take down the parliament, take down the bundestag in a violent way. Some members arrested were former members of the German military. Now police are still going after -- and there may be new numbers to come later in the day, they're still going after another 27 members of this group. So it's not done yet.

That had an impact on the committees, that they were evenly split. And now the committees will have the majority, which means they will have the ability to process legislation and nominations and even have stronger subpoena power. When we look at the numbers, Raphael Warnock had 95,000 more votes than his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker did. That means he expanded his lead from the general election in November, where he had a 37,000 vote lead. Also, Lynda, the turnout was quite impressive. On Election Day itself, on Tuesday, 1.6 million Georgians turned out to vote, a total of 3.5 million for this runoff. Compare that to 3.9 million in November, during the general. Yes, it is less but this is notable because, typically, during a runoff election, what you see is interest wane and so there was a lot of enthusiasm when it came to this election. As you said, in the end, Raphael Warnock prevailed, securing a full six-year term. His win really says several things. Number one, Georgia is truly a purple state. It is a swing state. And the Georgia Democrats are watching this closely. Now they will use this as a blueprint to, I'm sure, hopefully win in 2024. And the other thing it highlighted was the Georgia Democrats' ground game. They really wanted to get out the early vote. And we saw early voting surge in that shortened time period. Senator Raphael Warnock was hoping all those votes that came in early would give him that cushion on Election Day. And that is what we saw happen. I do want to toss in some sound from the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who touted the turnout but also reflected on his party's loss. Listen.
