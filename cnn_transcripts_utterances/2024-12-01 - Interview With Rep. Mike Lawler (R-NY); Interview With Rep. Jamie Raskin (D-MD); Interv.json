      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Kasie Hunt, in for Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, in Washington, where the state of our union is watching a new battle brewing.President-elect Donald Trump is closing out his Thanksgiving weekend by setting up another major political fight. He wants longtime loyalist and partisan firebrand Kash Patel to lead the FBI. It's a move that would require firing the current director, Christopher Wray, who Trump appointed after firing his first FBI director in 2017. Patel is a highly divisive figure. He's accused the so-called deep state of targeting Trump and proposed a -- quote -- \"comprehensive house cleaning\" -- end quote -- of the Justice Department, saying that, under Trump, it would go after members of the media. In his memoir, former Attorney General Bill Barr said he had tried to block a move to install Patel as deputy FBI director during Trump's first term. Barr said that he'd allow it -- quote -- \"over my dead body.\" And multiple sources familiar with the Trump transition process had previously told CNN that Patel's rise is deeply concerning. It's not clear that Patel could be confirmed by the Senate, but his pick is another sign that Trump plans to follow through on his promises to disrupt Washington. Joining me now is White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Sir, thanks very much for being on the program. We have so much to get to today, but since you are such a key national security official, I do want to ask you about president-elect Trump's decision to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director. I mean, as you know, he's a fierce Trump loyalist. He is vowed to go after the deep state. You have worked closely with the current FBI director. What do you think it would mean to have Kash Patel in that role? JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  Well, look, I'm not going to speak to president-elect Trump's nominees. I will let him speak for his own rationale. What I will say is how the Biden administration has approached the position of FBI director. We inherited Director Chris Wray, who has done a very good job in the role, from president-elect Trump, who appointed him to a 10-year term. And what makes the FBI director different from most other nominees is, they're not just appointed for one term of a president. They're appointed for enough time to last past two terms of a president because they're supposed to be insulated from politics. President Biden scrupulously adhered to that longstanding bipartisan tradition, and for a good reason, because the FBI director should not be subject to the whims of the tos and fros of politics. But as for the announcement yesterday or the decisions president-elect Trump has made, they will have to speak to that themselves.",

We were not surprised that these rebels would try to take advantage of a new situation, in which the Syrian government's main backers, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, were all distracted and weakened by conflicts and events elsewhere.So the Syrian rebels took a look at that. They took a look at three actors who had been pummeling them for years, Iran, Russia, Hezbollah. They had seen them a weaker and more exposed than before, and they tried to take advantage of it. Now, the speed of this offensive I think very much surprised the Syrian government and other observers in the region. But the fact that we have seen activity in Syria coming off of all the other things we have seen in the Middle East and Ukraine and elsewhere, that is something that is the natural result of those adversaries ending up in a weaker strategic position.",

It's still holding at this hour. But the big question here, what does this all mean for the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza? And Senator Lindsey Graham, who is a very close ally of president- elect Trump, he came right out and he said that Donald Trump wants to see a deal, a cease-fire deal, completed in Gaza before his inauguration.

We are going to work tirelessly to try to produce a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza. The main stumbling block right at the moment is actually Hamas and whether Hamas is prepared to do a deal, to enter a deal in which they begin to release hostages, a cease-fire goes into effect, and humanitarian aid so badly needed can be surged in because there's been a cessation of violence. So I think the calculus or decision-making of Hamas is not really about the tos and fros of American politics. But I think that it is more likely than it was before, because now they are isolated. Hezbollah is no longer fighting with them. And their backers in Iran and elsewhere are preoccupied with other conflicts. So I think we may have a chance to make progress, but I'm not going to predict exactly when it will happen, because we have had -- we have come so close so many times and not gotten across the finish line.",

Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the illicit oil trade has exploded to over $200 billion. That is what has funded Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and other terror networks. Obviously, with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the IDF taking out the leadership of Hezbollah and Hamas, and President Trump coming into office, there is more pressure now on these entities to enter into a cease-fire. I think, obviously, it was welcome news that Hezbollah entered into a cease-fire. We will see how long that lasts. But I think the bottom line with Hamas is very simple.

For him to make the sort of tip of the spear of his argument that he's going to gut one of the institutions in this country that works to keep people safe, I think, is actually going to be a big messaging opening for the Democrats. TIFFANY SMILEY (R), FORMER WASHINGTON SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  Well, there's a lack of trust in the FBI with the American people. And that's exactly what we saw with Donald Trump getting elected. And, with Kash, I mean, he has worked national security roles. In fact, he was a prosecutor at the DOJ with the national security under Obama. He's worked with Democrats.
