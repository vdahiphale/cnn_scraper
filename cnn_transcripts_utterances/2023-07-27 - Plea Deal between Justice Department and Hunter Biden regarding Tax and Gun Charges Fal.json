In a stunning twist the federal judge put their deal on hold right as the president's son was getting ready to plead guilty to tax crimes and avoid prosecution on a felony gun charge. The judge called this plea agreement unusual, and she also questioned if it was even constitutional. She refused to be a rubberstamp, and raised questions about whether the deal gives Hunter Biden immunity from prosecution from other possible crimes, including his business dealings in Ukraine and China.",

She's also a fellow at the College of Commercial Arbiters. It's good to have you with us this morning, Judge. So as we look at how all of this played out, the judge yesterday was very clear she was not going to be a rubber stamp, is it surprising to you, though, how quickly the deal seemed to fall apart and just how far apart the two sides were when they came into that courtroom?SHIRA A. SCHEINDLIN, UNITED STATE DISTRICT ATTORNEY, SDNY (RET):  Yes, it is surprising to me. They seemed not prepared for a judge who questioned parts of this agreement, which was the right thing to do. I think this judge acted completely appropriately. She did not question the deal itself in terms of two misdemeanors and the recommendation of probation and things like that, which are quite typical. But she wanted to be sure there was an agreement. So she asked good questions, and what she got was answers that the two sides did not have the same view as to what the immunity would be going forward, which Elie just spoke about. And that's a very big issue, because if there's a prosecution five years from now or two years from now and one side says but I was given immunity, and the other side says you were not, then that becomes an issue in the next case. So that has to be clarified. And the other thing that upset her was this diversion program. Instead of being prosecuted on the gun charge, the government had agreed that he could go into a diversion for a couple years, and if he behaved and followed the terms of the diversion, there would be no charge. But they said to decide if he violated it, they would come back to her and she would become the fact finder. And she said, now, wait a minute, that shouldn't be my job. That's a prosecutorial decision, and you're turning the court into the executive branch. And I've got to think about that. So I thought she raised really important issues. But I think the deal will be salvaged because there was nothing about the deal itself that troubled her other than that they had a different view of what the immunities were and who would be the decider if he failed in the diversion.",

And from DOJ's point of view, all you want to do is reach a fair disposition. The fact that they're willing to go this far with Hunter Biden tells me they are willing to dispose of this case for probation and the diversionary program. So I think it's more likely we do see a revised plea agreement that meets with the judge's approval.

Hunter Biden being the main character. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Hunter Biden is getting a sweetheart deal that no other American who wasn't rich and had a father as the President, would ever get ever. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you believe the whistleblowers and what they're saying no, this was a sweetheart deal. It was corrupt in terms of how it was handled. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
