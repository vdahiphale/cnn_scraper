Israel's military says it's preparing for a combined and coordinated strike from air, sea, land, in response to the terror attack by Hamas just over a week ago. The IDF says more than 1,400 people have been killed by Hamas since last Saturday. But while we wait on a potential ground incursion into Gaza, Israel has given no indication of when it might begin. Already though, aid workers say the situation in Gaza has descended into, quote, complete catastrophe, as tens of thousands of people flee from terrifying airstrikes. Israel has told more than 1 million Palestinians living in northern Gaza to keep moving south despite the pressing dangers. Palestinian officials say the death toll has passed 2,600 lives. On the global stage, America's top diplomat has been meeting regional leaders in the meantime, including those from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. He insisted the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt will open for aid to be delivered. The U.N. is calling for urgent humanitarian access into Gaza, and for Hamas to immediately release its hostages, saying, quote, we are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East. U.S. President Joe Biden also has a warning for Israel in an interview with \"60 Minutes\". He's calling for restraint. Saying it will be a big mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza, his part of that interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I think the humanitarian crisis, which is now ongoing, probably will not be resolved to satisfaction of any party suggest that the president has ejected a certain sort of cautionary note into how the Israelis do what it is they need to do.So I think this is smart diplomacy on the part of the president. He set a very, very pro-Israeli frame. He's not going to impede or constrain the Israelis with respect to their ground campaign. He's simply I think stating the obvious.

The exit polls suggest that the populace ruling party reign may now be over. It shows the Law and Justice Party will lose its majority in parliament and will lead coalition support in order to retain power. The results of this election were expected to have major ramifications for Poland's political direction, the balance of power in the European Union and the future of the war in Ukraine. And a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Sunday morning, just over a week after another deadly quake hit the same region in the west of the nation. The Taliban government officials estimate that more than 2,000 people were killed in that drummer back on October 7th, most of those were women and children -- as Anna Coren reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Beneath crystal blue skies on the outskirts of Herat in western Afghanistan, the sound of vanished hope fills the air. Under mounds of earth, lie countless bodies, there are no survivors here. Only evidence of Mother Nature's wrath and fury, unleashing further misery on a traumatized country. Last Saturday, around 11:00 a.m., a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the district of Zinda Jan, completely flattening 11 villages. You can see the state of my home, it's now in ruins, say 56-year-old Zahir. There is no need for words. Zahir wasn't home when the earth violently shook for only a few seconds. But when he returned, he found 13 family members crushed to death, including his daughters, sons, and multiple grandchildren. Simple mud brick structures supported by wooden polls, with the homes in villages on these dusty plains. They have already been reduced to rubble, aid agency tents are now their new homes. Thirty-year-old Sha Bibi (ph) lost two daughters when her house collapsed. The only reason she survived was because she was standing under the door framed. My children were buried under the wall, she explains. Everything is gone. Nothing remains for us. The Taliban government and international organizations estimate more than 2,000 people were killed across the region during Saturday's earthquake. [21:55:08] And according to UNICEF, more than 90 percent of the victims were women and children. U.S. charity Too Young to Wed, part of the humanitarian relief effort on the ground says there is a clear reason for this staggering statistic. It's because women and girls are forced to stay at home under Taliban rule, denied their basic rights, banned from education and work, and being part of society. STEPHANIE SINCLAIR, CO-FOUNDER, \"TOO YOUNG TO WED\": They have been systematically stripped of the rights over the last two years. So, instead of being at school and at work on a Saturday, which is when they have their school week and their work week, they were home, confined to their homes, imprisoned in their homes. I mean, it's a whole -- it is a country where half of the population is under house arrest.",
