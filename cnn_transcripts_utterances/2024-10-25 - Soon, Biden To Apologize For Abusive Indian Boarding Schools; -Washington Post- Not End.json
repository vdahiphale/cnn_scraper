This was announced today by the \"Washington Post\" publisher, Will Lewis, saying that we recognize this will be read in a range of ways, saying, \"including as a tacit endorsement of one candidate or the condemnation of another or an abdication of responsibility.\"But he says, \"We don't see it that way. We see it as consistent with the believes \"The Post\" has always stood for.\" As you noted, \"The Post\" has been endorsing for decades, really since the 1970s. In 1998, they sort of did a non-endorsement, but this has been a tradition now that they are breaking for decades. And I now have reporting, according to sources with knowledge, that actually \"The Post\" editorial board did have an endorsement drafted for the vice president, for Vice President Kamala Harris, and that is the endorsement that would now potentially not be running. I'm also told by a source the knowledge that many on the editorial board are surprised and angry with this decision. Some were also questioning the timing of this. I spoke to another source who said, \"It's fine that 'The Post' is not endorsing, but why are they making this -- why are they making this announcement so close to this election. The timing is just terrible,\" I'm told. And we are getting some very harsh criticism from some very high places. This is the former \"Washington Post\" editor, Marty Baron, posting shortly after this announcement was publish saying, \"This is cowardice. With democracy as it's casualty. Donald Trump will see this as an invitation to further intimidate owner, Jeff Bezos, and others. Disturbing, spinelessness at an institution famed for courage.\" I'm still getting a lot of -- doing a lot of reporting on this, talking to people at the \"Washington Post.\" The big question, of course, is going to be the reaction within the NEWSROOM. I'm also told there could be resignations as a result of this non- endorsement decision.",
