Vance, now one of Donald Trump's staunchest advocates, not only trying to help him win the White House, but also in the running to join him this time. He joins us live, in moments. And the former President back on the campaign trail, tonight, after being held in contempt, for violating his gag order, nine times. He's now racing back to New York, just to learn if he just violated it again. Also tonight, we are tracking the clashes and the crackdowns that are happening on college campuses across America. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested. And we'll show you new exclusive police bodycam footage, in moments. One of our sources tonight is former New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, on how his successor is handling it all. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. At long last, there is music to Donald Trump's ears. Macho Man and Y.M.C.A., the hallmarks of his MAGA rallies, blaring again today, as the former President returned to the campaign trail for the first time since his criminal trial began here in New York. Trump held rallies in two critical battleground states that he captured in 2016, but lost in 2020, Michigan and Wisconsin. Yet even out on the campaign trail, the legal cloud was still hovering over him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: As you know, I have come here today from New York City, where I'm being forced to sit for days on end, in a kangaroo courtroom, with a corrupt and conflicted judge, enduring a Biden Sideshow trial.

His claims about the judge being corrupt are baseless. But despite his assertion that he's not allowed to talk about this case, while he is talking about this case, on camera, he is allowed to say everything that you just heard there. Attacks on the judge don't fall under the gag order that Trump is under. And his return to the campaign trail was quite brief. He'll actually be back here in court tomorrow when his hush money trial resumes, and bright and early at that. Before the witness gets back on the stand tomorrow, there will be another hearing on whether Trump violated his gag order again. He was just found to be in contempt of court, and fined $9,000 for violating the order nine different times. The judge, in his finding, warned that Trump could go to jail, if he continues to attack witnesses and jurors. Trump didn't comment on either today though. He did attack President Biden, and take credit for restricting abortion rights. And also, he weighed in on the nationwide protests that we are seeing, on college campuses. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And David Frum, a staff writer for The Atlantic, and a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush. And, David, let me start with you. Because Biden has been quite silent about this.

So, he doesn't have any standing here.But the issue for President Biden is one of whether he is going to seem firm or weak. The great question -- there are two great questions that haunt each of the two parties. The great question, with any Republican leader is, are you uncaring? And Republicans have to constantly reassure people that they can -- they can have humanity, that they care, that they have respect, that they regard -- they have an understanding of the equality of all Americans. The great question, fairly or unfairly over Democrats, is always are they too weak to stand up against the forces of disorder in society? So, President Biden doesn't have an anti-Semitism probably, exactly, because everyone understands that he stood with Israel, he stands with the Jewish people. He's got a long record of that. The question is, will he enforce authority, both against the kind of violent rioters who attacked the Capitol, both -- and against the violent rioters, who are attacking campuses. Not that those are equally important, because obviously attacking the government is worse than attacking a campus. But they are the same psychology.

And he's looking at college campuses, where there are people, who had engaged in violence, who have taken over buildings, where law enforcement has had to respond. But there are moments where you can question how they're responding, when they should respond, who, what else can we do, to prevent these kinds of eruptions of violence? And he's looking across the country, and I suspect that he would much rather not make a bumper-sticker response, or rather, respond thoughtfully, carefully, in a way that's tailored to the place we find ourselves as a country.
