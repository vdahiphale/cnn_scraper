This, of course, highly significant for Sweden, which ends 200 years of neutrality at this point. The Prime Minister saying that the security situation in our region, he said, has not been this serious since the Second World War, and he believes that Russia will stay a threat to Euro-Atlantic security for the foreseeable future. That is why they have now ended that 200 years of neutrality and joined the alliance.In terms of what this brings to NATO, well, obviously we saw with Finland that it doubled the land border with Russia, very significant, but with Sweden, it really allows the alliance to project force. It increases their presence in two key regions. One, the Baltic region went out. It's basically almost a part of Russia and its enclave of Kaliningrad encircled by NATO country that's being dubbed NATO Lake, and also the Arctic region where Russia is now the only one of eight Arctic countries not in the NATO alliance. So, we've had some pretty strident rhetoric from President Putin in the lead up to this. He said that Russia was going to beef up its Western grouping of forces in response to this. There were some very thinly veiled nuclear threats. So, clearly, this is a major problem for Russia. But, it does show this unity that Europe and NATO has been trying to project even if for Ukraine it's been made pretty clear to them that despite the Secretary General saying today that they are closer than ever to the alliance that they would not be able to join while still at war.

A source tells CNN that both the German and EU ambassadors were evacuated on Sunday. The U.S. says it airlifted out all non-essential personnel from the U.S. Embassy. Gangs have increasingly targeted law enforcement and government institutions in the capital. CNN's Patrick Oppmann is tracking all of this for us. Patrick, hi there.

They have used them as reparative military organizations over the years. But, the gangs have just gone too strong with their businesses of illegal drug trade, gun trade, kidnapping, extortion. And so, essentially, they've created a monster here that is out of control.And they feel strong enough now that they can try to depose the Prime Minister of Haiti, Ariel Henry, and actually prevent him from returning to his country. We believe at the moment, yeah, he remains in Puerto Rico, unable to return to Haiti. The airport is closed because it is one of those places that has come under attacks by gangs, actually damaged planes with gunfire. And so, there really is a sense that there is no safe place, even for foreign diplomatic missions that are operating out of heavily guarded compounds. The people there are essentially sequestered right now, and talking to some of those diplomats, who are, of course, much more fortunate and better guarded than the Haitian people. But, they say that their supplies of food and water are beginning to run low after a week now where they are essentially on lockdown. So, for anyone trying to carry out the dangerous work of diplomacy of delivering aid to the Haitian people is becoming impossible to work in Haiti, and that, of course, has a major impact on the Haitian people who are suffering so much.",

But, this is really the concern and what they're having to navigate here at the White House as they push Israel to take care of with what is happening in Gaza, but as Israel dismisses that and moves forward. Now, this, of course, happening against the backdrop of the negotiations for a ceasefire deal. That negotiation would include, for example, a temporary ceasefire that would allow aid into Gaza and also allow for the release of some hostages, particularly those who are most vulnerable. Now, negotiators have been working around the clock to try to reach a deal before the holy month of Ramadan began. It has started. The negotiators are still talking. But, the President recognizing Ramadan in a statement yesterday where he went in great lengths to discuss the suffering that is happening in Gaza, the deaths of Palestinians, and saying the following, \"As Muslims gathered around the world over the coming days and weeks to break their fast, the suffering of the Palestinian people will be front of mind for many. It is front of mine for me.\" So, there you have it, the President saying that this is a priority for him.

But, these severe turbulence incidents keep making headlines over and over again, and we'll likely see more with climate change if this was in fact one of the seven hurt on a flight last March on a Lufthansa flight, 11 hurt on a Delta flight in August, 36 on a Hawaiian Airlines flight December before last. This one is the most significant of those in recent memory. First responders say they've treated 50 people in total on board this flight, 12 taken to the hospital, one patient in serious condition.This happened on LATAM Flight 800 between Sydney, Australia, Auckland, New Zealand. The flight ultimately goes on to Santiago, Chile. This is a Boeing 787, not to be conflated, though, with the 737 MAX issues and the door plug blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight back on January 5. This flight apparently at 41,000 feet, a lot of risk there to passengers because that's when they're at the cruising altitude and the seat belt sign can typically be off.

So, the airline not calling this turbulence, even though that's typically what causes these type of in-flight injuries. Sometimes, turbulence can be caused by weather, such as up and down drafts from thunderstorms, sometimes wind shear where there are two rows or columns of air moving at different speeds.Turbulence can also be associated with no weather phenomenon all, called clear air turbulence, meaning, it can be invisible to pilots. Airlines have gotten a lot better at forecasting turbulence, but the National Transportation Safety Board says turbulence is still the number one cause of injuries on commercial flights, technical event or turbulence or whatever. The big bottom line here is that even when the seat belt sign is off, it is important to keep it on. You never know what can happen, and especially to not let your guard down as a passenger as we've seen, not only on this incident, but also on the Alaska Airlines incident back on January 6, if that happened, which happened only at 16,000 feet, at 41,000 feet like this incident, there could have been an entirely different outcome.

This is how we combine those strong winds, you mentioned, but with a new moon that exaggerates tidal levels and also manmade sea level rise, human- induced sea level rise. Yeah. This is just the resulting factor. And of course, Hampton Beach, no stranger to flooding. But, this is not what you want to see when water completely inundates homes and communities right along this coastal area, which by the way is located right about here.We have a storm system that's departing the East Coast, and this created a lot of wind. Yesterday, it was more on shore. Now, it's off shore. So, helping push water away. But, nonetheless, it's going to be a very gusty day. So, double check your flight plans for any of the major East Coast cities, LaGuardia, all the way to Boston Logan, southward towards the nation's capital. This is where we could see some cumulative delays because of the winds. That is going to be a major factor, not only for the skies, but also on the ground if you're traveling in a truck or a high profile SUV, very difficult to navigate winds that strong. So, there is a storm system departing. There was some snow squalls this weekend as well that reduced visibilities across northern New England. We still have winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings in place where some locations in Vermont, New Hampshire, and in two other states have already topped over a foot of snow. Yeah. A couple of additional inches possible with this departing storm system, but the sting is gone from the storm for the most part because it is exiting quickly, and then will melt that snow rather quickly as well because a big warming trend is coming. Amara, I know you'll enjoy this. Look at that. Temperatures in the 70s. That's also the fire risk we're worried about today across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandle. Remember, we had wildfires that broke out across the Texas Panhandle a couple of weeks ago, and we don't want to see this critical fire danger, but there it is, in place again, the combination of strong winds, dry relative humidities, and above average temperatures, all adding to that. Here is a look at the extreme fire outlook as we head into Tuesday, some moderation but still elevated fire concerns for the Texas Panhandle. So, we will keep -- WALKER: Yeah. A lot to look out for. Yeah. But, you know what? It's warmer here in Atlanta, Georgia, which means that things are starting to bloom, high pollen count.",

That's if a new bill that is steaming through the House ultimately becomes law. That piece of legislation would force the Chinese firm ByteDance to sell it. If it doesn't sell, TikTok then, the popular app, would no longer be allowed in the United States.This has wide support in the House, in fact, passing overwhelmingly 50 to zero in the House Energy and Commerce Committee just last week. That is unusual. You rarely see that level of bipartisan support, and quickly after the House majority leader Steve Scalise announced it would be on the floor of the House this week. So, it could certainly pass. Then it would go to the United States Senate which would have to take up the bill, pass it, see if it passes the same version, ultimately see if it goes to the President's desk and whether are the President will sign the final version of that legislation into law, which the White House has indicated it does support this measure. Now, that doesn't mean that TikTok isn't trying to stop this legislation. In fact, they are trying to kill it. That's what the top Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee told me on Friday that her office is being flooded with phone calls. REP. CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS (R-WA): Yes. We've been flooded with calls, record amounts of calls. Any member of the Energy and Commerce Committee that voted yesterday has been flooded. TikTok actually put up a notice where they blocked an individual to actually get on TikTok unless you called your member of Congress and told them not to vote for this legislation. But, that's just an example of how they can manipulate data and influence Americans for their agenda.",
