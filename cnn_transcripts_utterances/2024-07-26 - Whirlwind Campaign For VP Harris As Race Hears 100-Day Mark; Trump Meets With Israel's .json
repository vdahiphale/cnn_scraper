Democrats enthusiasm in response, undeniable. Thousands of new TikToks, the campaign seizing on the Gen Z brat summer -- brat summer trend, some even calling stars like Taylor Swift and hopes that she will endorse Harris. Zooms for Harris filling up fast, too. Hundreds of thousands joining calls to offer their support. Last night, more than 150,000 joining Zoom with lawmakers and celebrities, including soccer icon Megan Rapinoe, Sue Bird, and also actress Connie Britton. It ended with more than $2 million raised. But as all this money rolls in, reality is setting in after seeing so much change in just the past five days, much more can we expect with a little over 100 days to go until the election?

But had that falling out over Netanyahu congratulating Joe Biden on winning the election. But the other thing that I asked about was these remarks that were made by Kamala Harris. I know that you played them with MJ earlier. Netanyahu saying he hopes they didn't hurt the ceasefire conversations and then on top of that, Donald Trump really using the opportunity to go after Kamala Harris unsurprising, of course now, his likely opponent, but saying that she was a California liberal and saying that these remarks were insulting to not only Israel, but to Jews everywhere. Now, one other thing I want to point out here is that they appear to still be meeting. This has been much longer than we had originally no anticipated. We have not seen Netanyahu's motorcade departing from Mar-a-Lago.

He issued a medical statement about him. Obviously, he is not currently his doctor.But it's not surprising that Ronny Jackson is coming to a full throated defense of Donald Trump. Here is what he said in a statement. He said: FBI Director Christopher Wray suggested it could be a bullet, shrapnel or glass. There is absolutely no evidence. It was anything other than a bullet. Director Wray is wrong and inappropriate to suggest anything else. Of course, Christopher Wray has said that they believed it was either a bullet or some shrapnel that had hit his ear, but this was an ongoing investigation. And, Erica, I will note that Donald Trump himself has now pushed back on that. It clearly this got underneath his skin and all of his allies' skin. A lot of pushback saying these are all conspiracy theories, again, reiterating the Donald Trump himself said that he was hit by a bullet and that's what the hospital records show. But of course, Erica, no one has seen those hospital records. In the same statement, Ronny Jackson says he has seen the hospital records, but outside of that, none of us have seen them.

France has government acknowledging the threat level for Israeli athletes is extremely high. I proposed to the president of the republic that the Israeli delegation be fully protected by the French police 24 hours a day, the interior minister said. Security forces are on high alert. French and international police patrolling the area around the Olympics, trying to prevent mistakes made in the past. We took this decision because the Israeli athletes and we've known this since the Munich Games, of course, but more recently again, are particularly targeted by attacks. Munich, West Germany at the Summer Games, 1972, Palestinians from a militant group named Black September stormed the dormitory housing the Israeli team. They immediately shoot and kill two athletes and take nine more team members hostage. The games continue as the hostage crisis drags on, the gunman often seen on the balcony of the Olympic dormitory. German police finally, attempt and completely botch a rescue mission, leaving all of the Israeli hostages, a German cop, and five of the terrorists dead. Esther Roth-Shahamorov was on Israel's 1972 track and field team.

That campaign actually clarified to say that she did not support defunding the police. They said it was a lie to suggest that she did.Now, we reached out to the Harris campaign to ask about all of this, and here's what they told CNN. They said whether as a district attorney, attorney general, senator, or Vice President Kamala Harris has led the way to keep our community safe, take on violent crime, and helped lead the nation to historic drop in violent crime to a 50 year low.",

And in fact, you know, Mayor Eric Adams of New York City was elected as a police officer and as somebody who talked about being tough on crime. That's going to be a challenge, right, is getting out of the rhetoric that has developed over time and getting back to what are the policy decisions that have actually been made and what are the conversations that America still needs to have.

And I think what J.D. Vance is talking about is some extreme positions in the Democratic Party, on the environmental front and others, they say, look, maybe a world's not -- we shouldn't have kids. The world is not fit for children. We shouldn't have children in the future. The American population growth is declining rapidly. We have less and less children each year, and I think if you listen to the whole interview, go back and led to it and you have -- I don't think what he was saying was taken accurately are fairly.

He seemed to have very clear and very negative viewpoints about President Trump before he decided to seek elected office, and that is the part of his evolution on Trump coincided with him becoming this national political figure. So it's not that he can't evolve. We've seen politicians evolve particularly on things like LGBTQ rights, for example. That's been evolving. Quite frankly, a lot of conservatives have evolved on how they approach abortion, for example, and they haven't necessarily been told you know, this evolution is not sincere, but for J.D.

According to a law enforcement official that's been briefed on the investigation and the takedown from yesterday afternoon, it seems that one of the sons of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, a 38-year-old by the name of Joaquin Guzman Lopez, who again was on that flight, this is him, reportedly worked with U.S. authorities and provided them with that inside help to lead to lead to the arrest of this massive narco boss, El Mayo Zambadia, a man who had been on the run for decades from authorities here. According to what we've heard from federal sources, they tell us that Mayo was led to believe that he would be flying out to see a property to purchase a plane. I heard from Mexican officials today, actually left from Mexico yesterday morning. However, it landed near El Paso. These are some pictures from the scene in the air perhaps that they were flying in and it was greeted by U.S. authorities that Mayo was led to believe that he would be flying out to a property and definitely did not expect U.S. authorities to be greeting that flight. He's in custody. He has entered a plea of not guilty. Joaquin Guzman Lopez is the 38-year-old son of Chapo. It is still unclear at least sources have not confirmed any sort of deal that they may or may not have actually worked out with them. And like Mayo, he too is accused and multiple indictments in various jurisdictions, Erica, accusing him.
