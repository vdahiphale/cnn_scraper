Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko says Wagner Chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is currently in Russia and not Belarus. Prigozhin was reportedly exiled to Belarus last month after his army of mercenaries captured one Russian town, then marched towards Moscow. Meanwhile, Russia may be trying to discredit the Wagner boss. State media aired footage of what it claims was a Russian police raid of Prigozhin's home and office in St Petersburg where gold, guns, cash and wigs were allegedly found.

Meanwhile, in Russia, on state television, we've been seeing these extraordinary images of what they say is Yevgeny Prigozhin's house, one of his houses in St. Petersburg, where police have raided and they have seized gold bars, cash, passports, some with false names with Yevgeny Prigozhin's photographs, and wigs, strangely, which could be obviously used as disguised weapons, as well. And, you know, it all implies that Russia is sort of moving to discredit the Wagner leader, possibly ahead of arrest, although that's not been confirmed yet. I spoke to the Kremlin earlier today and they said at the moment they're not commenting on it. But clearly, the deal for Wagner and its leader to be exiled in Belarus is at the least being renegotiated and that could end very badly indeed for Yevgeny Prigozhin.

The Pentagon released dramatic video of the incident showing the Russian jets flying around and sometimes in front of the drones which were monitoring ISIS targets at the time. At one point the Russians released parachute flares in front of the drones forcing the drone operator to conduct evasive maneuvers. And the Israeli army says it conducted strikes on southern Lebanon in response to rockets fired from there earlier. A Lebanese security source says the shelling has stopped after Israel fired at least 15 projectiles into Lebanon. Video shows plumes of white smoke rising from one village in the hilly south. It comes just days after Israel conducted a massive incursion into the occupied West Bank town of Jenin. One official who visited the site of a poisonous gas leak, meanwhile, in South Africa describes the scene as quote, heart breaking. Authorities say 17 people have died after nitrate gas leaked from a cylinder at a squatter camp on the outskirts of Johannesburg. Forensic workers in hazmat suits combed the area in the city of Boksburg. Officials say initial investigations indicate the leak could be linked to illegal mining.

Now, this is also part of a bigger problem here in Johannesburg and South Africa in particular of illegal miners. Now, the accusation is that this was linked to illegal miners that operate with impunity in many of the disused gold mines that surround Johannesburg. That nitrate is used in the processing of the soil and of the gold that they bring out illegally.

I mean, all the AI tools that we have developed over the past, let's say in reality 25 years, are useless if we do not have the data to operate them. And now if you look in the past, data what was called was structured. That means on the forehand we already knew what kind of questions we wanted to ask and then we started to collect that kind of data. Cloud computing, for example, has helped to make storage costs drive down tremendously and such organizations can basically store all the data that they want at fairly low cost. Now, much of this data is unstructured and we know that there are plots of gold or what you would call a needle in a haystack to actually -- are in that data. And the best way, in my eyes, to find a needle in a haystack is to use a magnet. And machine learning and AI is actually the magnet to find these unique capabilities in these haystacks. And especially when it comes to, for example, you just mentioned food programs, there's for example, a young company called Acrobyte that is looking at sort of how to grow a sufficient number of fish in a sustainable manner so that they can actually feed the growing population of this world. You know, 20 percent of the world is of our protein intake at the moment comes from fish. But fishing is an extremely damaging industry. You know, what we have, the great Pacific garbage patch is all about three times the size of France, which is all full of fishing nets and things like that. So, we need to find more sustainable ways in actually growing protein if you want to feed the world. And this company is making use of computer vision and IOT sensing and things like that to make sure that these big pens which hold hundreds of thousands of salmon actually remain healthy and grow the way that they want to. You have to remember that one kilo of fish feed goes one kilo of fish. For cattle, it means you need to feed them seven kilos of feed before you get one kilo of protein. And as such, you know, fish-farming, aquaculture, is really the future of growing proteins for us.",

I think someone described it recently to me as the ability to make all our digital experiences more human in a way, too. And that sort of plays into, I think, the Amazon hand that you hold here. Do we also have to acknowledge though that when you're creating labor efficiencies like this and saving devices that there will be some cost to jobs? We're already hearing CEOs of companies say that today, that actually they're not making hiring decisions because they know that they can do some of these jobs and automate some of these jobs.

Now, for areas where there are no risks, you mentioned, you talk about, think about how we can support healthcare, how we can support inequalities, where we make sure that we can double down and accelerate at the same time. So, I believe there is no Armageddon in the future, that's in the first place.

While driving to the ceremony, a flash flood in China's central Henan province washed away the car. Their only salvation, scrambling to the roof of the vehicle. Rescuers used a drone to drop a rope and life jackets to the pair before they were dragged to the riverbank by a crane. The extreme flooding comes as several parts of China have been hit with torrential rain over the past month, killing at least 15 people in the southwestern city of Chongqing, according to local authorities and state media, and prompting four counties in the city to issue the highest red alert warnings.",

Now 59, Montminy is one of millions of Americans living with Alzheimer's disease. But this year, new hope emerged. A drug aiming to slow down the disease's progression got accelerated FDA approval in January, based on the fact that it clears amyloid plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's. But Medicare declined to cover it until the FDA granted a fuller traditional approval based on a bigger clinical trial proving the drug has benefits for thinking clearly and being able to function in daily life.
