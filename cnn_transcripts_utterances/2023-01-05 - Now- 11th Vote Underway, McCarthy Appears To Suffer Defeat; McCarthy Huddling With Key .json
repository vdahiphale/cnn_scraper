Despite, now the longest speaker contest in generations, and as we're watching this, we're told that McCarthy supporters and his critics are at least talking. They've been behind closed doors trying to hammer out a deal in an attempt to show some progress.But what might that deal look like? Because McCarthy has already essentially given them everything that they want. He is promising votes on term limits, allowing just one member to force a vote to oust him, just one. And there are four in the never Kevin camp, so I guess they could raise their hand any day. I mean, if there's just one more Republican that McCarthy can't get the gavel without help from Democrats. So, there is so much to get to tonight. Let's begin, though, with Manu Raju, because he's there on Capitol Hill. Manu, we know there has been this deal circulating around. There was a change in this round and nominations. Yet, it appears yet again McCarthy's failed. So what do you know to be happening right now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. This is actually a very key moment. Kevin McCarthy is behind closed doors with some of the main holdouts that have denied him to the speakership, as they're trying to hammer out an agreement. I'm told by number of those members who have gone in and out of that room that they're close. They believe that they can reach an agreement as soon as tonight.Now, that would not assure him the speakership. In fact, it would still be 208 -- short of the necessary 218 votes to get the speakership. But what it could do is it could essentially allow the House to adjourn, adjourn for the night. Let them finish up the negotiations and then potentially get back. If they get back tomorrow and continue the voting then, and that is the challenge right now. If the house does not adjourn, they need to keep voting one ballot after the other. That is the rule. This is the first order of business of the 118th Congress that came into session on Tuesday, is to elect a speaker. They weren't able to do it on Tuesday. They were unable to do it on Wednesday. They've been unable to do it on Thursday, which is why we are now on the 11th ballot in which Kevin McCarthy will suffer a loss, the only other option is to vote to adjourn. Kevin McCarthy wants to adjourn this house, but a number of the holdouts have not agreed to do that because they are pushing for other changes, changes that would give them more power over the speakership. They have won a number of key concessions giving them more say on the legislative process, more efforts, ability to oust a sitting speaker but they want others, other key committee assignments and the like. And those negotiations have been furious going on all day long, and now at a critical juncture in as McCarthy is meeting with these key holdouts, including Byron Donalds who's been nominated multiple times to run for speaker. He is part of these negotiations. The question is, does he sign up? Does Congressman Chip Roy of Texas who is also part of these negotiations, does he sign up? As well as Scott Perry, another key holdout. So all major questions as Kevin McCarthy trying to get the votes still won't get there tonight. But they hope they can get closer -- Erin.",

Because obviously they don't have the math to get this and tomorrow, we understand from your reporting, there's going to be several McCarthy backing Republicans who are not there because they have to go for family issues or whatever back home.

Perhaps they would try to get -- show progress on the next speaker vote. And then come back in the next week, essentially adjourn up until Monday.[19:05:06] They really hope that they can get enough agreement among the Republicans. They can adjourn tonight until Monday. That seems unlikely. It's still possible. But that is one thing that is being discussed. But the other idea is to come back tomorrow, maybe for a briefer session and then let members go home for the weekend. Let these negotiations finalize and deal with the fact that, yes, several of the members are gone dealing with some family issues. So they won't be there. This was why all these things are very complicated at the moment because of these razor thin majority, 222 seats. You can't lose more than four Republican votes on any vote, and Democrats don't want to vote to adjourn. They want to have this vote over and over again and embarrass Kevin McCarthy. So, it is up to the Republicans to adjourn this House, to finish their negotiations. And that's where we're at this moment, Erin.",

And he said he and some others were invited into one of these meetings to review the offer. When he came out, he did offer a few details about what is in there.He said mostly revolves around rules changes including having 72 hours to read bills before they come to the floor. There is also promises about votes on term limits for members of Congress. That is something that Ralph Norman was pushing for, and also a more open amendment process. But he did say that what was not in the deal is promises about committee assignments. However, it doesn't mean that Kevin McCarthy is not making promises. They may not be on paper form. That is something in a rules package, all these rules things. So committees may not be in the actual rules package. But as you noted, Erin, he said this is just round one. So, you know, right now, what they're really trying to do is get an agreement to they can adjourn. That's what they're pushing for right now. So even if they get an agreement on this deal, it doesn't mean Kevin McCarthy is going to have the votes tonight or even tomorrow. There is also an incentive to wrap up the work pretty quickly because there are four members who might be out tomorrow on the Republican side. That's what we're hearing. It may be more difficult to get work done tomorrow. So that's why you're seeing them work furiously tonight with negotiations. Kevin McCarthy has been all over the Capitol. He's been in the speaker suite and the ceremonial office and meetings on the floor, meetings in the dining room. Just to give you a sense of how many moving pieces there are right now.

There is another Kevin on the board now. They're voting against him.And, of course, Trump has been looming over all of this. But not in the way he wants. He had urged other Republicans to vote for Kevin McCarthy. It changed nothing. And so this seems to be a way for these hard-liners who are not voting for Kevin McCarthy to get back in his good graces after they ignored his advice, which was to vote for Kevin McCarthy. Trump predicted that this would end today. That's what he wrote on Truth Social, late last night or early this morning. That has not happened obviously. This is not anywhere close as you heard from Melanie's reporting. I think what strikes me is to see from the back room negotiations happening we're not getting details of exactly what they're agreeing on is how frantic all of this is and it speaks to the fact that this majority is so slim, a year ago, Kevin McCarthy was predicting they could flip 60 seats in the House.

But one thing that so striking is when you contrast the drama on Capitol Hill in that House chamber with what you're hearing from White House officials here.There's a sense of normalcy to some degree. That is very, very noticeable given how things are playing out on Capitol Hill. When you talk to advisors, they make very clear they don't want to weigh in on what's happening on Capitol Hill. They are certainly watching. The president has tuned in at various points throughout the course of the last three days. He's been briefed on how this process is playing out or to some degree not playing out over the course of the last three days. And they're keenly aware of the dynamics at play here. But they also had the view when you talk to White House officials that their job at this point to some degree at least according to one official I spoke to was to show that they're the adults in the room. This official said we're going to keep showing that we're here to get stuff done. There was obviously a very noticeable split screen when he appeared with Mitch McConnell in Kentucky to talk about his infrastructure law. But today, to some degree, was no different at all. The president holding a meeting with his entire cabinet. Talking about the implementation of the major laws he passed in the first two years and also holding a notable immigration speech on a very difficult issue for this administration to grapple with before heading over to sign a condolence book for Pope Benedict earlier tonight. It is just a regular schedule to some degree. And that is intentional. When you talk to officials leading into this house Republican majority, they continue to reiterate that they wanted to show that contrast as much as they possibly could, the political sense of things but also on the policy side. And that was what the president was going to be continuing to focus on throughout the weeks and months ahead. To some degree, it will be central focus of his state of the union when that occurs. The speaker needs to actually invite him to do that. I don't think anybody thought it was going to be this acute, this dramatic this early on. One final thing I would note, Wolf, the president talking about immigration, giving a speech about immigration, deciding to go to the border on Sunday, something Republicans have called for for the better part two of years and something the president resisted because he's viewed it primarily as political theater, this is a moment that Republicans have an opportunity to engage on an issue they have attacked the president and his team on relentlessly over the course of the last two years. They're nowhere to be found. And that wasn't necessary intentional. White House officials made clear they've been planning these immigration related items for several weeks now. But the fact that they are engaging on this, the president is confronting this issue at the border and going to physically go down there and House Republicans are battling among themselves who knows what this is going to mean weeks or months from now. But there is a dominance of the message right now when it comes to the day-to-day policy aspects of what's happening in Washington, what's happening in the country and House Republicans are not even in the game to some degree.

I think there was initial concern when Democrats were amused enjoyed certain aspects of things.It demonstrated the U.S. government once again was having problems with just the basic function, something he long raised concerns about in terms of how that looks to foreign leaders, how it looks to countries around the world. But earlier today after those immigration remarks, he was asked if he was still monitoring things and the president said I've been monitoring them with great -- and then paused and looked at Kamala Harris and said -- attention.

And you would need Democratic help to lift the debt ceiling, all those things are going to require working across the aisle as much as Republicans might hate to admit it.

One Democratic congressman now suggesting he could support a moderate Republican for speaker with some conditions, as we're now actually these kind of scenarios are possibly on the table. Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California is with me now. Congressman, let's just first start with this vote. This is a huge vote, whether Kevin McCarthy can succeed in getting Congress to adjourn until tomorrow. This actually is a huge vote. Obviously, do you think he's got the votes from what you understand on the floor? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  I haven't been able to predict anything this week. So I don't know if they have the votes. But I'll tell you, I voted no. I think we ought to stay here in the People's House until we have a speaker. If we have to stay here all night, if we have to stay here all weekend, I don't understand why we're adjourning. In other workplaces, if you don't get the job done, you stay at work. You don't just get to go home. BURNETT:  So we're in a situation where this is happening because the Republicans are not able to get the votes together to pick a speaker. You have come out, Congressman, and said something early. You were bold in saying it, that you are open to crossing party lines to support specifically a moderate Republican for speaker.

And here is my question to them. Would they rather have a Kevin McCarthy or whoever make deals with the far right, which is going to mean two years of utter division, possible default on the debt ceiling, or should we look to have someone who is going to work cooperatively with this president?

And one of those alternatives is can we get some key concessions from a Republican and have a coalition that way? That is far preferable to what's going on today, which is that Kevin McCarthy is moving further and further to the right, and basically, if he does succeed, is going to sell the House to the farthest right part of the Republican Party, where you have some members saying, we want to default on the debt. That's the only way we're going to vote for Kevin McCarthy. I just don't understand how that is a good outcome for this president, for the country, or the Democratic Party.",
