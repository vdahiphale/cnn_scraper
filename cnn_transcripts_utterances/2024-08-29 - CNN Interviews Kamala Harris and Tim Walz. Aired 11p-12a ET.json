Vice President Kamala Harris sitting down for her very first interview since becoming the Democratic nominee. We're going to break it all down for you this hour, the key moments, the new reaction we're getting in, and what it all means for the race moving forward with just 68 days to go until the general election, and by the way, just 12 days until the expected debate.In a moment, I'll be joined by the Harris campaign's co-chair, Mitch Landrieu, and one of Trump's top allies, Republican Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida. My colleague, Dana Bash, covered a lot of ground in this interview with Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz. It was about 27 minutes long, and she dove right into one of the main criticisms that Harris has been facing ever since she got to the top of the ticket. How she explains her shifts, or as her critics would say, her flip- flops on some very key issues. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I don't think it answered any of the policy questions that -- or sort of where does she stand now. I think the one question that she sorts of delved into was fracking, and we learned after the fact that she made this declarative statement: I made my position known in 2020 during the debate of where I stand. Well, that position in 2020, that debate was not actually her position that she was stating, she was stating Joe Biden's position on fracking, that he wouldn't switch on it.

We've heard other things that she has pushed.And, obviously, Ashley knows quite well some of the other initiatives where she has leaned in in terms of different issues.

And now, he understands why every woman has a very different health situation and we can't just do a one size fits all.Now, the difference being, here's what I think is really important in this. She actually twice in the interview talked very specifically about the value and the goal in terms of, is it about limiting climate emissions? What is the value? What is it we're trying to accomplish? And what did we do in a number of different policy pieces of the policy agenda where investments were made, where you address those issues, where you set time limits? That's very different than someone like former President Trump who said, hey, I'm real proud of what I did to overturn Roe v. Wade by appointing these judges.

It is true that the Biden- Harris administration has had the largest investment in creating a clean energy economy, but we have to do it in a way that is not more hurtful than has to be given the time that we have.And so, it's not really dishonorable to say, listen, I've changed because I've learned more. That's actually a good thing. I want to juxtapose that to, for example, Donald Trump jettisoning the border bill because he thought that it was good for political gain, or how well President Biden brought together a very narrow House in the Senate to pass more -- bigot the four pieces of legislation that was seen in the last 30 years. That's a good thing. It's not a bad thing. Secondly, there should be no doubt that as the vice president, she basically has to take the position of the president, and Tim Walz will do that with her when they're fighting behind closed doors. But to be clear, in case anybody is not clear by now, Kamala Harris is her own person, and she will develop her own positions going forward that you should just expect will not always be the same as what President Biden might have done.",

I think that photo was insanely moving, insanely touching. And I think what they did, the job that was so -- hats off to Mignon Moore and others that ran the convention. It was such an affirmation, it was so affirming for women, but especially for Black women. The notion that Fannie Lou Hamer came to the convention 60 years ago, to the day that Kamala Harris accepted the nomination, arguing to be seated, and now 60 years later, you have a Black woman that's accepting. So, the fact that, you know, the convention focused on the effort of Black women to make the party realize and the country realize and live up to its ideals was very powerful.
