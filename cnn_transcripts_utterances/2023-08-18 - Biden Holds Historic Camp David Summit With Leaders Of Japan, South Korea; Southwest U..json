There hasn't been that kind of invasion since World War II.And so as for peace, we all want that, of course. Ukrainians want it most of all, and my team has been working very closely with President Zelenskyy's team and further peace formula, noting that nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. But nonetheless, we're meeting with them constantly, constantly. And your other two questions about China, I'll just say this. This summit was not about China. That was not the purpose of the meeting, but it did come -- China obviously came up. Not to say we don't share concerns about the economic coercion or heightened tensions caused by China, but this summit was really about our relationship with each other and deepening cooperation across an entire range of issues that went well beyond just the immediate issues we raised. It was about a more peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a region quite frankly that would benefit everyone living there and around the world if we get it right. It's not just here. It has a phenomenal impact. Think about what's -- anyway, I won't get going. It'll take too long. But as you've seen from initiatives we're announcing here, today is just how committed we are to see this vision take place. And I think this relationship that we put together, and I think you're going to see it expand. It's not really what we did today. This is a historic meeting, but we're about to lay in place a long-term structure for a relationship that will last and have a phenomenal impact not just in Asia but around the world.

In this meeting, the leaders agreed to a commitment to conduct annual military exercises and to continue their conversations by holding a summit together every year. Let's bring in CNN's Arlette Saenz who is live from Camp David, CNN's chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto, and CNN's Paula Hancocks reporting from Seoul, South Korea. Jim, let's start with you. So, in addition to those agreements, they also agreed to establish a new crisis hot line and tighter economic cooperation. To quote the president, this was a big deal.",

It's not a popular thing to say here inside South Korea, in fact similar situation in Japan. There are decades of tension and mistrust between these two nations stemming from Japan's colonial past. And there are historical grievances which have not been resolved. They are still ongoing, and there is a very deep felt and often emotional feeling here in South Korea that this should not go ahead.When you look at public opinion polls, there is still a sizable amount of people that do not support this. They do not believe that this should be going ahead. So for both President Yoon and also Prime Minister Kishida, they have spent significant political capital in even getting to this point. But as Jim said they do share common threats. When you look at North Korea, the increasing launches and missile tests we have seen, some of those even going over Japan's territory. So certainly, they shared these common threats. They both felt the economic and military might of the rise of China's threat as well, so this is why they are there today -- Brianna.",

Of course the president talked about their need to work together when it comes to addressing concerns about North Korea. He noted that they will have those intelligence sharing agreements when it comes to both missile threats as well as cyber security. The president also noting that the summit wasn't about China, but that is the underpinning of so much of his efforts in the Indo-Pacific, as he's trying to bring allies together as there is that rising concern about China's economic and military power.

They just were singing after a press conference the community leaders called to make their demands for the recovery right now.Number one, they want time to grieve. They're asking Governor Josh Green not to rush the reopening. Number two, put community first in rebuilding this place. Fast tracking this cannot come at the expense of community involvement, they're insisting. And number three, there's a Chapter 92 Sunshine Law in Hawaii that mandates transparency in these big decisions when it comes to building. And you've got to understand the context, not just the trauma these folks are going through right now, but generationally since Captain Cook who was the first outsider ended up trying to kidnap the king of Hawaii and a skirmish was killed in the surf. Generation after generation of outsiders have come in here and changed this place often for the worst, plantation, sugar cane owners changed the ecology of the land around Lahaina, and that's a water fight still ongoing. They said here the water in this place is controlled 75 percent of it by private interests. There's a fight now about whether or not water rights had something to do with fire hydrants not having enough pressure as firefighters are trying to put out their own neighborhoods. So there's that piece of it, but they're really worried that they'll be pushed out again as has been the case in so much of Hawaii's history of native lands getting the short end of the deal right now. As for search and rescue, I spoke with some dog teams from L.A. County fire. The dogs are actually burning their paws because there's so many hot spots still in this 3 1/2 square mile area they're trying to sift through almost on a granular level. The fact they've only identified 6 of 111 tells you the forensic challenge of this and how long it will take and the missing number. The governor last told us this many people missing at this point so many days after, and so much of the communications have been restored, you would think you get contact, you get confirmation especially those kids are alive.

He's really using that same excuse for all of the cases. And this one really is the most simple and straightforward. There's only one defendant, right? It's not like Mar-a-Lago where there's three defendants and three defense attorneys and three different lawyers making issue. You don't have a morass of classed documents.

Instead, though, we hear that he may be sitting down for an interview with Tucker Carlson. Who knows if that changes by Thursday. He pulled this stunt before in a 2016 primary debate. But it didn't hurt him then. Do you think that he will be impacted by primary voters if he skips next week's?",

He can have a one on one with Tucker Carlson. This is long from over.

Let me read this, one person close to DeSantis' political operation was surprised that a person that never backed down would even write a memo or think it was appropriate to give the campaign advice a week out from the debate.
