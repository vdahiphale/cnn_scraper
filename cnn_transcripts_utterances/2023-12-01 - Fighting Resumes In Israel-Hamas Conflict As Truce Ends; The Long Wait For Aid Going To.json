The top Red Cross officials tells CNN the nightmare for civilians on both sides is back. And the U.S. Congress expels one of its own in a historic vote. Live from New York, it's the first day of December. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Tonight, violence flares in Gaza as a fragile truce between Israel and Hamas breaks down. Now, strikes began just after the pause expired. You see the video there. It shows a strike actually in Rafah which, a reminder, is in the southern part of Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces is telling people to evacuate towards Rafah. They dropped leaflets in Khan Younis telling residents the city is a, quote, \"fighting zone.\" The leaflets include a QR code that connects to a map. Now, remember, you actually need an Internet connection for -- to be able to use that. The IDF says it will help residents avoid harm if they actually tune into that map you're looking at right now. But with no power and little access to the Internet, not sure what help that is going to be. Now, the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, meantime, says 178 people have been killed. That's just since the truce expired. Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot -- Israel for us. And, Jeremy, I'm sure from your position, you have seen firsthand that this truce has indeed collapsed. Tell me the impact right now in Israel and also, of course, on civilians in Gaza.",

Within minutes of the truce expiring this morning at 7barrages of rockets being fired by Hamas towards towns and cities in Israel, but also, of course, Israeli jets resuming their bombing campaign in the Gaza Strip. Throughout the day, there have been active air, ground, and sea and naval operations throughout Gaza, including in the southern part of the Gaza Strip. And that is the first day that we have seen significant ground operations carried out by the Israeli military in the south of Gaza. Now, just moments ago, we actually saw a very significant barrage of rockets coming from northern Gaza right behind me. We -- I counted at least 19 rockets being fired from a position near Beit Hanoun, which is the northeastern most city in Gaza. Those rockets were intercepted right over our position, multiple loud booms, probably the most significant barrage of rockets that I have seen from this position in weeks now. And, of course, that's significant for two reasons. First of all, it comes after a weeklong pause in fighting, which military analysts have said would give Hamas time to regroup and reposition itself. But it's also significant because the Israeli military has now been carrying out ground operations inside the northern part of the Gaza Strip for weeks now. They have even claimed that they are in control of northern Gaza. But if this barrage of rockets showed us anything, it's that Hamas still has the ability to carry out military operations, to carry out its -- to target Israeli cities from positions in northern Gaza, including those positions where the Israeli military has carried out operations for weeks now. That city of Beit Hanoun, if you look at it in the daytime, it has effectively been reduced to rubble or -- and the buildings that remain are skeletons of themselves and yet still, the ability to fire rockets from that area. Now, in terms of the civilian casualties in Gaza, we've already seen from several strikes in Khan Younis, as well as Rafah, several hundred people being killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, among them, many women and children. The Red Cross today warning of a devastating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. And again, amid all of this still, negotiations still continuing to see if that pause in fighting can be renewed in order for more hostages to get out, more hundreds of trucks of aids to get into Gaza and, of course, that much needed respite for the people of Gaza from the bombings.",

And you're hearing booms behind me right now, and the fighting is still continuing tonight. But the negotiations are as well. We know that, yesterday, Hamas made several proposals that were considered completely unacceptable to Israelis, not offering up a list of ten women and children to be released, which was the conditions that Israel set. Instead, offering several dead bodies, effectively, of former -- of one- time Israeli hostages in exchange for the Palestinian prisoners that Israel has to release as part of this agreement. But the question now is, does Hamas have more women and children that they can release? Hamas seems to indicate that they have limited ability on that front. Israel says they believe Hamas still has more women and children to release. And then, of course, the negotiations are also beginning to turn to the question of men, as well as Israeli soldiers. Those will come at a much, much higher price. And the Israeli political leadership has signaled they believe a military operation in Gaza will be one way to pressure Hamas and to reduce that price at the negotiating table.",

Now, despite the renewed fighting, Qatar, as we were saying, says the two sides are still negotiating to get back to that all-important truce. Now, the Qatar foreign ministry said the bombing of the Gaza Strip complicates its mediation efforts. It's called on the international community though to move quickly to stop the violence. Nabil Fahmy used to be Egypt's foreign minister, as well as Egypt's ambassador to the United States, and he joins me now. And good to have you given Egypt's important role in all of this.

And that's going to be a much more complicated situation. What we're trying to achieve is not a truce. What we're trying to achieve a ceasefire because the collateral damage against Palestinian civilians during this armed conflict is really extremely significant and far beyond anything that's acceptable.

So there's a bit of contradiction here.

And we do not want to participate in a process of ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Palestinian territory, because we know that they won't be let back. That's the real problem. It's not a matter of humanitarian support, we have said we will provide health services and hospital facilities to anybody who is injured and needs that kind of service, irrespective of nationality, but to be the host country of a forced displacement of Palestinians, when we know that they will not be allowed back. And don't ignore the Israeli statements. They have said, after bombing the north, we will go to the center and then go to the south.

We are -- we want -- we need a ceasefire because you can't negotiate under this carnage. We need to have a support for the civilians there. That's the second component. Thirdly, we definitely need to deal with the hostage situation and talk about what happens after the weapons stop firing at each other. But to deal with each of these issues, we actually need to have some indication of where the endgame is because nobody wants to be caught with an endless status quo. And the endgame can be addressed by dealing with or providing a stronger recognition of a Palestinian state under occupation, and then also embracing the Arab Peace Initiative of 2000 to, which says, ending occupation means normal relations between Israel and all the Arab states.

So there was this last-minute momentum that possibly George Santos might stay in Congress. But in the end, it was a very convincing vote. It was 311 to 114. That's far more than what was needed, two-thirds majority, to oust him. It was a very convincing vote to send him back and to send him out of Congress. And that happens immediately. George Santos on his way in, he walked in, he did not know whether he was going to remain a Congressman. He did not stay in the House chamber for the vote.

So, that's that Goldilocks phenomenon that you're going to, I think, hear more about.
