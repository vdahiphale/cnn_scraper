      "sentences": "-- for some sort of saw or something. That area, where you see the two trucks, that's exactly where that helicopter came down. We were able to speak to an eyewitness a couple minutes ago.That eyewitness said the helicopter was coming in low. To that eyewitness, it didn't necessarily seem as though it was having problems but certainly it was losing altitude. It hit a nursery, a kindergarten. Tragically, one child died. Apparently this happened around the time people were dropping their children off. There were several people injured and killed on the ground. The helicopter then hit that nursery, then fell forward and came and crashed down near the entrance to a residential building, where that chopper then apparently completely exploded. There was a huge fire afterwards, as people are describing. All the people inside that chopper, all were killed. Of course, we have to point out, this was the leadership of the interior ministry of Ukraine. It was the interior minister himself, who was very close to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, also someone active here in politics in Ukraine and very active in the defense of this country as well. A lot of the units of the interior ministry, like the national police, are hugely active in the defense of Ukraine. He was definitely a rising star, almost, if you will, in Ukrainian politics. I got to spend time with him last year after the Russians came out of the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. He certainly seemed like someone who was really on board with the defense of this country. The deputy interior minister also among those killed and the state secretary as well. And a large part of the rest of the leadership of this country. What we are hearing is that the chopper was apparently on its way to the northeast, to Kharkiv, when it came down. And it's still unclear why the helicopter crashed, Kate.",

How close to a nuclear battle do you want? How many more lives do you want to lose? And it was a powerful message from the first lady. Now you're going to have Zelenskyy himself. His message, I'm pretty certain, once he's dealt with the awfulness of today's events, will be this:  that helicopter -- yes, helicopter crashes but that helicopter was only in the air on this mission because of the war. Those people would be alive now if it wasn't for the war. I'm pretty certain as well he's going to make the strong argument:  send tanks, send heavy armaments. This is what we need. I've already heard from the German chancellor, who says, we'll do whatever they want, we'll send what they need. But at the same time he's refusing to send the German Leopard 2 tanks. The Polish prime minister said we will send them and we want France and Germany to send them, too. What you're looking at, Kate, is a very complex situation. This helicopter crash is a touchstone in a way that allows Zelenskyy today to say to these people here, put your money where your mouth is. Don't just keep telling me you support me. You've sent me a lot, it's not enough.",

We saw what happened in Dnipro.But the fighting in many different places right now is close combat. That's why they need tanks, to really go in and get close to the enemy and be able to attack. And attacking not just defense but actually having attack in the spring. They're going to have another offensive, Ukraine. And they need the tanks. So it's a very specific thing. In Europe it's political. But the key would have to be Germany, both for Germany to provide the Leopard 2 tanks and for Germany to give the green light to other NATO allies to provide them as well.",

The U.K. has announced it's sending 10, a dozen tanks over -- I have also heard from retired generals, like Wesley Clark was on yesterday, who said, 10 tanks, OK; they need 300 to 500 to make a difference. DOUGHERTY:  Think about this:  you're in the middle of Europe. And this war, that began in such an unexpected way at the very beginning, that now has morphed into this giant battle, almost like a World War I battle in the middle of Europe. So I think each country, especially Germany looking at that, is saying, boy, this is RAY:  escalating to the point we now have to go back to war on the European land mass. So I think, you know, there's part of that is really difficult. And then it's the old debate, how much do you put in there without starting a war directly with Russia? I think that debate is diminishing, because Putin is not showing any sign of stopping or even be willing to talk at this point. But that has been the debate, you know, the danger of escalation to the point that you actually could have a war. But I think the first lady of Ukraine really drove it home:  this war could escalate, it could spread, it may not be just Ukraine involved. So you, Europeans, are very much on the line. You have to show that you support Ukraine, because it's in your own interest. I think that's potent. (CROSSTALK)",

I think -- the war doesn't look good, it has not been good since the beginning. And really in wintertime it slows down for long understandable reasons. Everyone gets tired. The nature is the people and thank God the enemy, too. How it looks, it looks as follows. Daily are those fights in the east of our country. We are standing strongly, resolutely. I'm thankful to all of our (INAUDIBLE), the living ones, the ones that we unfortunately lost for their bravery. It's important to know that we are strong (INAUDIBLE) our country but it's really hard but we are also strong inside the nation, inside our state. We are united, we are organized because we are motivated. It was not us who started the war but it is us who will have to end it. End it, our lands, having it deoccupied do respect for our people and our sovereignty. As for the other parts of our nation, the south, the north parts, we don't control the situation and definitely processes have slowed down a bit for a variety of reasons. And it is not just about us keeping united inside the country. We need to have the whole world united and our joint values. And because of that, we truly need to continue that support of Ukraine, to continue with supplies of necessary, a mission that is required to (INAUDIBLE) enemy on the battlefield. We also need intervention support of this. I would like to thank all the nations, the European Union for the support of our budget deficit and continuing to support us this year. I also think it is really important that, you know, given the energy challenges that we are seeing, and these are surely related to disrespect of the human kind, you know, attacks against our grid, against our energy sector, with Iranian drones, with Russian missiles (INAUDIBLE) inside the country. Because of that, we definitely need assistance from our partners with air defense system, lots of these (INAUDIBLE) this deficit. But I would like to all, many countries worldwide for their assistance, also with alternative energy connectivity solutions. From what it looks like now, Russia intends to get this revenge and we think that they will succeed because they're fighting with just Ukraine but a whole civilized approach toward life. Thank you.",

I think that Russia has already earned a place among terrorists. And this no longer depends on their leadership. Now I think their leaders are no longer affecting the developments. The Russian Federation, its culture and so on, everything depends on the strength of Ukraine, its support by the partners, the political support from abroad as well as from the Russian society. They have to open their eyes if they want to see the future of their Russian Federation with their eyes. They have to recognize their own mistakes. They will have to recognize their statutes. They will have to really respect our territorial integrity. I am really glad to hear that Mr. Kissinger changed his mind. Our priority today, our political task today is see the different political leaders and figures, those who are still very relevant or have been relevant until recently, for them to be able to recognize the great mistake that Putin has committed. For them to recognize this is Russia's aggression. These moments, it is very important for them as well to politically pressure on Russia to stop this bloody aggression. As regards NATO, we clearly understand that security guarantees are among the top priorities for us. Speaking of our formula (ph) for peace, it is a (INAUDIBLE) priorities. We understand that, at the moment, we are not (INAUDIBLE). Unfortunately, Russia does understand this as well and they do their damnedest to not make it easy for us to join (ph). But we are on the wait list NATO because that is the best security guarantee for us, for our country, for our kids, for our country.
