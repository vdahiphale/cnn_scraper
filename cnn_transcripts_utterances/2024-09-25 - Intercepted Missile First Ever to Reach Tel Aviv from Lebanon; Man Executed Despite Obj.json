This marks the first time a missile fired by Hezbollah got this close to the city. Hezbollah says it was targeting the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency Mossad. There are no reports of damage or casualties. Tropical storm Helene is expected to become a hurricane in the coming hours. Thousands of Florida residents have been told to evacuate their homes. And a flash or a flood watch rather has been issued for more than 20 million people in the region. And a massive wildfire is raging on the outskirts of Ecuador's capital. Authorities are trying to get the flames under control. But an historic drought isn't helping. No deaths or injuries have been reported. What's thought to be the first time ever Hezbollah has fired a missile from Lebanon towards the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Israel intercepted the missile as it approached. Hezbollah says it was targeting the headquarters of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency. The IDF described the ballistic missile as heavy and long range. There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is delaying his trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly due to the ongoing fighting. His office says he'll fly to New York on Thursday and is expected to speak at the U.N. on Friday. Let's bring in CNN senior international correspondent Ivan Watson. We're going to talk about the situation on the ground for people in just a moment. But first of all, what did you make of that image of that interception near Tel Aviv, which is the commercial capital, isn't it, of Israel?",

Federal prosecutors on Tuesday filed the charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate against Ryan Routh. Prosecutors say Routh stalked Trump for more than a month with cell phone data, placing him outside Trump's Florida residence and golf club. Authorities say on September 15th, Routh, armed with a rifle, waited for hours with a view of the Trump International Golf Club, where the Republican presidential nominee was golfing at the time. Routh is set to be arraigned on Monday. Meanwhile, the Trump campaign says there are threats from Iran to assassinate the former president. And that U.S. intelligence officials briefed him about those real and specific threats on Tuesday. The Trump campaign said Iran's goal is to, quote, destabilize and sow chaos in the United States. Trump posted on social media about the threats, saying, quote: Our moves were already made by Iran that didn't work out, but they'll try again, end quote. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the director of national intelligence acknowledged the briefing but declined to address any specifics. Amid the rising threats, the U.S. Congress unanimously passed a new bill this week, guaranteeing Trump and Kamala Harris the same level of Secret Service protection as a sitting U.S. president. The measure sailed through both the House and the Senate, though Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said he believes the extra funds won't change the way the agency assesses threats. Senate Republican Rick Scott praised the bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): Passing the Enhanced Presidential Security Act today with unanimous consent of the Senate sends an important message to the American public and the world that we will not ignore these threats, which are truly an attack on our democratic process and have rightly shocked the world.

You know, the real question, Max, is what message China is trying to deliver with its first announced ICBM launch since 1980. And you know, Max, we could pose that question a different way and pose it like this.You know, China does launch a lot of missiles, but it doesn't announce them. It doesn't talk about them. So when we're thinking about what has happened here, we could ask, why has China announced this launch and why is it talking about it now? So to think about the greater context, to try to answer that question, let's look at what has been going on in the past couple days and months. As you mentioned at the top of this segment, Max, Russia and China are engaging in naval military exercises in seas very close to Japan, certainly drawing Japan's ire. But the flip side of the diplomatic and military coin, you know, of course, as we've reported here extensively, the United States just wrapped up its latest meeting of the Quad security partnership between the U.S., India, Australia, and Japan a few days ago in Wilmington, Delaware, President Biden hosting it to try to shore up that security partnership. Of course, China is no fan of that partnership. So could this be a message to the Quad trying to discourage further cooperation? Unclear. And of course, Max, when we're looking to try to decode the message from China, tone and specifics matter. And at this hour, we don't have a lot of either. Listen to the latest comments that have come in from Beijing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZHANG XIAOGANG, SPOKESPERSON, CHINESE MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE (through translator): At 8:44 on September 25th, the rocket force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile carrying a dummy warhead into the high seas of the Pacific Ocean, which accurately fell into the expected sea area. This missile launch is a routine arrangement of the annual military training plan in line with international law and international practice and is not directed at any specific country or target.

But of course, this is very notable, Max.We have to go back all the way to the rule of Deng Xiaoping in 1980, May of 1980, to look at the last time that an ICBM launch was announced by China. That missile, notably, it was a huge leap for China at the time, launching from the western desert regions all the way into the South Pacific. So bringing us back to this morning, we do not have any kind of flight path for where this missile went other than Beijing saying that it fell into the open seas of the Pacific Ocean, which essentially means when you're talking in diplo or military speak, open seas, it's ocean that's not in any country's territory. It's not controlled by anybody. Beijing, though, Max, did notably say that relevant countries were notified of this launch. We don't know what those relevant countries were, but as the rest of the world, aside from Europe, as we're looking at the United States, begins to wake up, we'll be acutely paying attention to the Pentagon to see what, if any, message they received, how they are interpreting this, as well as U.S. allies in the region -- Max.",

The pandas have been in Finland since January 2018. Zoo officials say fewer tourists following the pandemic and inflation led to mounting debts and they can't afford the pandas' 1.5 million euro annual upkeep. Last year, the zoo asked Finland's government for state funding, but those requests were rejected. Since 1949, China has loaned pandas to zoos to help international relations.
