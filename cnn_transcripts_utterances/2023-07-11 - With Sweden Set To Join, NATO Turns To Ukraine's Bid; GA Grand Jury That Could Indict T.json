Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy, wants his country to be admitted as a member as soon as possible. President Biden has already made it clear with the position of the Alliance that is not happening now while Ukraine is at war with Russia. All of NATO seems to be on agreement on that point.Zelenskyy is at the summit now. He will meet Biden face to face tomorrow in an effort, perhaps, change some minds over time. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is there in Lithuania. Natasha, it's clear the Ukrainian president could not have expected a vow to come into NATO at this summit. Is he leaving with something? Is he leaving with an assurance it's going to happen, perhaps, sooner than expected or at least given some sort of path for how it will happen?",

So President Zelenskyy had said himself that he did not expect that NATO would extend a formal invitation to Ukraine at this point to join the Alliance because, of course, he recognizes that they are in the middle of a war with Russia. But he does leave with somewhat of a concession by NATO, which is that they will be dropping a key hurdle in the process to becoming a NATO member, which is that Membership Action Plan, essentially a series of steps that any country that wants to join NATO has to take before they're actually allowed into the Alliance.Ukraine has already completed many of those steps, which include diplomatic, political, legal, economic reforms that other countries have to carry out before they join. But still, there is no clear timeline on when Ukraine will actually be able to join the Alliance, something that President Zelenskyy had wanted, if not a formal invitation now, he at least wanted a signal from the Alliance that he would be invited, Ukraine to be invited into the Alliance once the war with Russia ends. They did not get that commitment. Actually, NATO said that there are still conditions that Ukraine needs to fulfill before it can join the Alliance. They did not specify what those conditions actually are. But still, when President Biden meets with Zelenskyy tomorrow, we are expecting him to reiterate the U.S.'s enduring support for Ukraine, militarily, financially and of course, morally, reiterating that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was both illegal.",

You've had this job, right? This sort of tough job of being the top diplomat from the U.S. to NATO and dealing with some of these sensitivities. Knowing that, what are those sensitivities of communicating with Ukraine right now about its desire to be a member of NATO?IVO DAALDER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: So there are really two sensitivities, Bianna, that are important here. One is what Natasha mentioned. The reality is that there is not a single NATO country that today wants Ukraine into NATO, because if Ukraine were to be a member of NATO today, then NATO would be obliged to defend every inch of Ukrainian territory, and it isn't prepared to do that. It hasn't been prepared since the beginning of the full scale invasion and it's not prepared to do so now, so that's one problem. If you lay out a timeline that says the NATO will be inviting Ukraine once the war is over, you actually give an incentive to the Russians to continue fighting for as long as they can, therefore, prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. So that's the dilemma that they are playing with. The second piece is that there is disagreement among allies about whether Ukraine even if there was not a war is today ready to join the Alliance. As Natasha said, great step forward, NATO - by NATO, Ukraine no longer needs a Membership Action Plan, but it does need to demonstrate that its democracy is strong and vibrant, that it has dealt with corruption in the way that has a defined the state for so long. And those are areas that need to be worked out. And NATO is prepared and the leader said they were prepared to help Ukraine move along. That's where we are, an absence of agreement within the Alliance about how far Ukraine has come and the reality that a country at war is not necessarily a great ally to bring into an alliance at this point in time.",

And there will be agreements on long term security support for Ukraine and ultimately for NATO membership.So I think what he's mentioning is we need to continue to fight. But he also needs a signal from NATO that NATO continues to be with them, including the ultimate price, membership of the Alliance, which again, the leaders reiterated will happen that NATO's - Ukraine's place is in NATO.

The idea that you could invade a country take it over and that the rest of the world would stand by and let it happen, which clearly was what Putin was banking on, has proven to be an utterly disastrous calculation.First of all, they weren't able to take over Ukraine. The Russian military has suffered incredible losses, both in personnel and, of course, in the capabilities. It is a much diminished army. Secondly, it now faces a Ukraine that is united, completely united behind the idea of Ukraine as an independent nation that belongs to the west. And third, they face a NATO that is bigger, larger, with a stronger capability along Russian borders. And that is committed to remaining the defensive alliance dominance with the kinds of military spending that is now forthcoming for the long term.

We know that a number of people in this investigation have been told that they are targets or under scrutiny, people like Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, all facing potential legal jeopardy as part of this case. But again, you still face the possibility that if this case is presented to the grand jury that they still will not hand up an indictment. She still has to go in, she has to convince this panel to go her way. And again, we still have a couple of weeks until we expect a big announcement on this.

He suggested taking this case before a jury in December which given the complexity of all these issues. That would be speedy indeed. But last night, we got a preview of how the Trump team intends to challenge this. They're going to raise a lot of different legal issues. There's going to be a lot of litigation questions, including whether these materials actually classified, does the special counsel have the authority to bring these charges. Look, I'm not sure they're going to win on the merits of any of those questions, but it has the effect of delaying this further. We know the former president wants to push this back until after the election. They've also questioned whether you can get an impartial jury leading up to a presidential election. But the longer you delay this into next year, you are once again in an uncharted territory, right? You have a potential criminal prosecution of a presidential candidate. So this is going to continue to raise a lot of interesting legal questions, a lot of litigation and it's unclear exactly when this will go to trial. But what's so significant about next Tuesday in the hearing is this is the first time there'll be before Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump- appointed judge who's really going to be the referee here and all eyes will be on her.
