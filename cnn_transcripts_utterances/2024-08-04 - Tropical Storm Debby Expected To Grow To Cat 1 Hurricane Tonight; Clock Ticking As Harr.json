Debby is forecast to rapidly strengthen over the next few hours becoming a category one hurricane. That storm is about 125 miles west by southwest off Tampa. It's forecast to make landfall tomorrow morning near the Big Bend region of the state. And flooding has already begun. Officials there urging people to prepare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There will be a new hurricane hunter aircraft in the storm soon that will probably give us a good update at the 8We're already seeing that almost what an eye like feature here that we haven't seen all day. Something else that's going on. The potential for tornadoes, really more like waterspouts coming on shore, but that just happened here, not that far from Treasure Island and moving on up toward Seminole. That rotation is still there on radar and I think some people actually did see that waterspout. Seeing the water here, Fort Myers Beach, while two to three feet of surge and more to come for the northern part of the state, too, with eight to 10 feet of saltwater surge. And then you just heard the hurricane center talk about how much rain is going to come down with this. It's going to be a very slow mover. This is not going to get out of here. It's still going to be raining Wednesday and Thursday in places here across the southeast and then picking up the moisture off the gulf stream in the Atlantic, causing significant possibilities of flash flooding. Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and there could be six to 10 inches of rainfall all the way up even toward the I-95 corridor up into the northeast. That's how long this storm is just going to linger around. Everywhere that you see purple on that map, the radar is forecasting, the models are forecasting 10 inches of rain or more. When you put that much rain over that big of an area, you are going to get flooding because it just can't run down someplace else because it's where it would have been running. It's still raining there, too. So, yes, this is going to be a significant flood event far away from where we're going to have landfall later tonight, tomorrow morning, somewhere could be 82, could be 90-mile-per-hour storm. So certainly I'm forecasting a hurricane before landfall -- Jessica.",

They see an opening, you know, as a result of the midterms, for instance, in places like Georgia where a Trump-backed candidates did not fare as well.They think that they can appeal to those voters. And the strategy through this initiative that they rolled out today is essentially to have high-profile Republicans act as surrogates and give other Republicans a permission structure to support the vice president by arguing that this election is principally one about protecting the Constitution and democracy, and they say that they're prepared to make investments on this front. They have digital ad out now, a unity, and it's aimed to appeal directly to those Nikki Haley voters. So they don't want to leave these Republicans on the table, Jess.

Somebody like Martin Beshear, who Scott I'm sure knows well, is doing very well in that capacity, or she needs somebody who's going to help her expand her map, extend her map, in which case of course Josh Shapiro and Senator Kelly are probably the two who are strongest positioned to do that.And so from her perspective, we don't know what her own internal polls are showing. But whatever they are, I suspect that's where she's going to hone down because either she needs somebody to help her deliver the strong message against Trump that she's been delivering since she's become the nominee or she needs somebody who's going to just help her shore up those electoral votes in places like Pennsylvania, which she desperately needs to win in order to win this election.",

Vance, as is somebody like Tim Walz in Minnesota, who really is unlike J.D. Vance representative of western values, as is somebody like a Mark Kelly who actually has had a role in the military and as an astronaut that can contrast very well with somebody like a Donald Trump.

And I suppose it's -- the timing is perhaps a little embarrassing for the local member of parliament who's from the Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party when just last week, she said in parliament that the local people in Tamworth wanted their Holiday Inn back. They didn't want it to continue housing asylum seekers, and some of those people perhaps may have taken those words and taken matters into their own hands.

Officers there with riot shields seemingly pinned against the wall of the hotel. There is the rioters threw projectiles at them. They smashed their way into the hotel.
