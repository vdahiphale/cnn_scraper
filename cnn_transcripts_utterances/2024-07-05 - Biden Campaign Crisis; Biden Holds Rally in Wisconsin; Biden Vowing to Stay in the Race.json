The new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer appoints his cabinet following Labour's landslide victory. And Spain and France through to the semifinals of the Euros as hosts Germany crash out all that and much more coming up. But first, U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to reset his campaign as some Democrats consider throwing their support for Trump. Behind Vice President Kamala Harris. Now, the president sat down in Wisconsin for his first TV interview since last week's debate. It's set to air in about a couple of hours from now. He was in the key swing state to rally supporters and he told them he's not going anywhere. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We had a little debate last week. Can't say it was my best performance. But ever since then, there's been a lot of speculation. What's Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out? What's he going to do? Well, here's my answer, I am running and going to win again. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, President Biden is also going to travel to the battleground state of Pennsylvania. He has a number of other events slated for next week. And the president himself has privately acknowledged that how he performs or appears at those events is going to be very important as he kind of faces this make-or-break moment in his campaign. And you saw him speak with a lot more vigor, embraced his performance in -- his lackluster performance in the debate and kind of try to turn the page, focus on the fact that, you know, that was 90 minutes, not reflective of his 3.5 years in office. So if he can kind of keep up with that same energy, and I think that same tone and message, then maybe he could, you know, prevent some of these Democratic Party -- well, Democratic lawmakers from more defections in public. So he -- you know, it just remains to be seen how he does in these upcoming events, as well as this highly anticipated televised interview this evening with George Stephanopoulos on ABC.",

And I think what you've heard a lot from President Biden and histeam is that he's been counted out many times before, including when he was seeking the Democratic nomination back in 2020 only to bounce back and to comfortably do so. But, you know, I think one key point that you mentioned is there's a difference between when he's standing in front of a teleprompter and delivering his lines versus in these more unscripted moments, which is why, you know, the interview will be very important because, you know, there's not going to be a prompter for him to read from, certainly if he participates, as he plans to, in another debate with Former President Trump in September, that would be a critical test just before the election. So, I really do think that, you know, yes, there is the totality of his record. But at the same time, the challenge for President Biden is that he had probably one of the largest audiences he has had in the course of this campaign at last Thursday's debate. And they saw him, you know, in an unscripted environment where he was really struggling. So, that's really what they have to come back from. But I think, you know, at the same time, you know, you are seeing a lot of Democratic voters still kind of rally behind him if he is ultimately at the top of the ticket. The question will be whether, you know, he potentially loses support from independents or just other Democrats, you know, key coalitions who constitute the Democratic base who already were not particularly enthusiastic about his campaign in an election where, you know, as we know, battleground states are often separated by tens of thousands of votes.",

So, we're not talking just little records here, we're talking big heat waves out here, and fires to boot. Here's what Beryl looks like right now. And I know you're saying, wait, which one? Well, this one down here. This little one is Beryl. That up there is not a circulating system. The Hurricane Hunter was just in it. They found no rotation whatsoever. That's good because we don't need something that far in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. So, we'll keep watching this that actually does have a spin. And where does it go? Into some very warm water. Into temperatures in the middle 80s Fahrenheit here. Well, warm enough to cause the storm to get stronger. In fact, it forecast to be all the way to 90. I could easily see a 100 miles per hour, 160 kph with this. No problem whatsoever if it stays in the water any longer. What we've been dealing with over the past couple of days is a forecast when it was, you know, over by Jamaica all the way into Mexico. That does not look likely now because the storm is beginning to turn to the right -- to the north as they typically always do. But now all of the models, especially the European model, even east of Corpus Christi, and possibly just west of Houston on some type of landfall, these are all different models of the same model, but they're just different little perturbations that they put into every model to see what happens. And you look for the cluster. And so, kind of, here's the cluster, right through here, and that would be right along the Texas Coast with rip currents. This going to be a dangerous day for rip currents. Also, storm surge. With all of that wind blowing the water on land, three to five feet, one to two meters, without a doubt, if the storm gets stronger, as I expect, those numbers will in fact go up. There's a lot to talk about here. A lot of precipitation. People in Houston have this fear of something called Harvey. Harvey putting down more than -- well, it was two meters of rainfall over about five days. That's not going to happen. This storm is going to continue to move, and in fact, it will put down maybe 10 inches of rainfall. So, somewhere in the ballpark of 250 to 300 millimeters, but this not Harvey. This a wind and a surge event, Paula.",

And we're expecting a preview of that interview soon. I'm joined now by White House correspondent Arlette Saenz, who's really been by the president's side for most of the afternoon there in Madison.

He didn't say specifically who was calling on him to step aside, but it does come as there have been some concerns both publicly and privately expressed by top Democratic officials and also some donors to his campaign, who simply say the president needs to leave this race after that debate performance last Thursday. Now, President Biden did sit down for that high stakes interview with ABC News. A critical test as he's trying to show voters that he is up for serving a second term in office. We expect the first clips of that interview to air at any moment. But the president really used his speech here before a crowd in Madison, Wisconsin to make the case that he will remain this race, that he is up for a second term and also tried to frame the debate and the talk about his age in a different way.

It's part of the effort by the campaign to try to put Biden in situations where he is engaging in more off the cuff moments. So, you have him there in that overflow room. You have him answering questions from reporters on the tarmac before he departed here from Madison. You have this unscripted interview with ABC News. It comes as many of the Democratic allies have really essentially told Biden to step up his game, saying that he needs to have these impromptu moments, needs to do these interviews, needs to travel more all in order to make the case to American voters that he can serve a full term as president and also make it through this campaign. Now, it all comes at a very critical time within the Democratic Party, as there are some who believe that it is the moment for President Biden to step aside.

But you have to -- one of the thing you have to know about President Biden, he really does dismiss the political class. He really does dismiss the media behind closed doors. And he likes to be -- he's someone who likes to be the underdog and loves to talk about how he was counted out. The difference here is this was a very self-inflicted wound. That's what happened at that debate. I don't think anyone expected it, particularly in the president's camp, expected it to be that bad. And there was a very deep hole from which to dig out of.

We understand that there were 20 or more specialists involved in the exam, including a neurologist. What we obtained as reporters was a six-page sort of summary of that. And that's typically what we get, Paula. You know, I've been doing this job for a long time. Only one candidate ever has released all of their medical records, and that was Senator McCain, who at that time was the oldest person running for president ever. But we got the six-page summary on President Biden. It was mostly about ruling certain things out that we saw. No evidence of stroke, for example. No evidence of multiple sclerosis, for example. No evidence of Parkinson's disease, they said as well. That was notable because Parkinson's disease is something that is the most likely cause of Parkinsonism. But there are other things that can cause Parkinsonism as well, which they didn't make any mention of that. They did say that he had neuropathy. Which is a sort of an inflammation and problem with the nerves, and that could be potentially causing his stiffness of gait and things like that when you walk. You see him holding himself very stiff, they sort of attributed that to the neuropathy. No mention, Paula, of a cognitive exam.
