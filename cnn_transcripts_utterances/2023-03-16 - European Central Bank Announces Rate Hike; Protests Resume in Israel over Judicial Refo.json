Here's how Europe's trading on the news. The ECB, the first major central bank to make a rates decision, since market turmoil kicked off with last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. It's the Feds turn next week. Investors also watching Credit Suisse, of course. Shares of the troubled banking giant surging after it grabbed a lifeline from the Swiss central bank. Let's get right to CNN's Clare Sebastian. Let's start with ECB, going ahead with a half point rate hike at a time when markets are jittery; not least the global banking sector. Why that decision and why, now?",

The ECB making it very clear that they intend to continue to tackle that, regardless of what's happening in the financial markets. But inflation is high, it's 8.5 percent in the euro area; it's 6 percent in the United States, that is four times their 2 percent target. So they do need to keep doing that. A week ago, of course, this would have been fully priced in. The ECB made it clear they intended to do another half point, rate rise at this meeting. But of course, given the turmoil in the financial market, given the worries about the pressure that interest rates higher rates, are putting on banks' balance sheets. There was some thinking out there they might moderate this, perhaps, coming in with a quarter point rate rise or something like that. But they are sticking to their guns. They haven't ignored the issues in the financial markets. The statement also said the bank stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability. They talked about the banking center being resilient and the fact that the ECB has a policy tool kit available to provide liquidity as needed. Now we might hear more about that in this press conference that is currently ongoing, particularly as Christine Lagarde starts to answer questions. This is, of course, front and center, the balancing act that the ECB will now face, to try to preserve, at the same access, both price stability with inflation and financial stability -- Becky.",

Now the calls from Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, are dire. He also put out his own compromise  proposal over these performs. They're too lengthy to get into here but they do address some of the coalition's concerns over the supreme court being able to overturn legislation, kind of narrowing the type of legislation as people will be able to overturn and changing the way judges are appointed.

That was extremely dangerous. The U.S. has said and that could have caused injury or damage to the Russians and the pilots of the Russian jets as well. And so the U.S. now releasing this new video to kind of directly contradict what the Russians have been saying, because the Russians have been saying in recent days that their jet did not act recklessly. It did not make direct contact with the drone. Now we are seeing in this video that, in fact, it did. And of course, when we look at the video, we can see that moment of impact kind where the video cuts out. And you see it all pixelated. That is the moment of collision. When the video reemerges, you can see the propeller on the back of the drone has actually been damaged. And that is the key proof that U.S. officials are pointing to, noting that the fighter jet made direct content with that drone. Now this is all very significant because it is the first time a Russian jet and an American drone have made direct physical contact with each other over the course of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And it is important, because the Russians and the Americans are operating in this space very closely, in this region, on a regular basis. So while the Russian jets have tried to intercept American systems like these drones in the past, flying alongside, them never before have we actually seen this level of aggression by a Russian pilot. I should note that we are told by the Russian defense ministry, the officials in the Russian defense ministry, actually did explicitly task these pilots with harassing this drone, making it clear that this was not just the behavior of a rogue pilot here. This was a deliberate tasking by the Russian ministry of defense. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As you said, that leadership of the Donetsk self-declared republic, they are saying it is complex, there is very, very heavy fighting ongoing. Also, Ukrainian officials are saying pretty much the same thing. What is happening is that Wagner mercenaries and regular Russian forces have been absolutely hammering the Ukrainian positions in and around that city. And they have, for some time, had the ability to fire on with, some level of precision, the incoming main resupply lines of the Ukrainians from the West into the city. That has made, according to Ukrainian officials, the resupply of both men and materiel extremely difficult into that zone. Russian soldiers are fighting, in some cases, inch by inch, it seems, taking very heavy losses, according to several different sources. This is important, largely at this point, symbolically. Bakhmut has taken on this kind of legendary status, even though several weeks ago, even U.S. officials were saying it isn't necessarily the most strategically important zone of this conflict. There does appear to be a digging-in over very many months and a reluctance by the Ukrainian commander in chief, Zelenskyy, to give up ground in that zone. A large part of the western part of the city appears to be still controlled by the Ukrainians. But that control, just looking at the various sources, appears somewhat tenuous. And it really is the focus, because of the intense fighting. As many anticipate, as the spring comes -- and not on a day like this, it's very cold here in Kyiv -- but as spring approaches and summer, there this anticipation of a possible Ukrainian fightback. Where that will happen is unclear. But just today, the chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, is saying that the need for basic ammunition and other materiel to come in for the Ukrainians is very great and has to be accelerated -- Becky.",

They submitted aresolution on Wednesday that would tie U.S. security assistance to a report on Saudi human rights. It comes as the kingdom seems to be moving away from the U.S., recently embracing a Chinese brokered deal to improve relations with Iran, although that's not the position of the kingdom. It says it's not moving away from anybody; they're just trying to provide some easing of tensions. One of the senators behind the measure is Democrat Chris Murphy of Connecticut. He is concerned about the Saudis cozying up to China, tweeting, \"Political repression is critical to the Saudi government and China will back their capitalizing of crushing political dissent.\" U.S. Senator Chris Murphy joins us now live. Senator Murphy, let's just talk about this resolution submitted on Wednesday that would tie U.S. security assistance to a report in Saudi human rights. Is your aim through this law to stop U.S. security assistance altogether for Saudi Arabia? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT), MEMBER, FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE:  We already have a law on the book that does not allow U.S. security assistance to go to countries that don't respect basic human rights. We have waived that requirement repeatedly for Saudi Arabia. And I think it's come at great cost to our country. I think the world watches when we continue to be very cozy with brutal dictators like Mohammed bin Salman or president al-Sisi in Egypt. It makes it hard for us to press the case for democracy and human rights around the world when we are selling record levels of arms to these countries. So I'm not suggesting that we cut off arms sales; what I am suggesting is that we raise the bar in terms of what we expect from the Saudis. I don't think it's unrealistic that they would meet that bar, if we were just a little more serious about expecting human rights progress in exchange for the security relationship.",

And the tweet that you referenced was just, I think, my effort to point out that one of the reasons that Saudi Arabia is drawing closer to China, is that China just doesn't give them a very hard time when it comes to their human rights record. In fact, gives them technology as they do other countries that facilitate that campaign of repression.

So this notion that we should only make decisions about energy policy based on how much money we make, belies the fact that it is energy policy that determines as to whether Russia can continue its illegal brutal campaign, in Ukraine.

In May of 2022, less than three months into the war, two-thirds of U.S. adults said that they were in favor of sending Ukraine weapons.
