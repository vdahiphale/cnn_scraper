Security Council approved a resolution for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza on Monday. The U.S. abstained from the vote clearing the way for the measure to pass, but American officials say they're perplexed by Netanyahu's decision.Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is in Washington meeting with senior U.S. officials. He met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday where Blinken repeated that the U.S. is opposed to a major ground operation in Rafah. Gallant is expected to meet U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon in the coming hours where officials say he's expected to ask for more weapons and equipment to support Israel's war in Gaza.

And Elliot, the U.S. is perplexed by Benjamin Netanyahu's abrupt cancellation of a delegation to Washington after the UNSC resolution for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza passed.

For that reason, we were unfortunately not able to vote yes. However, as I've said before, we fully support some of the critical objectives in this non-binding resolution.

I think the judges evaluated the equities and said listen, let's extend 10 days, you know, certainly the ability for him to get any type of bond and let's reduce it. And so, I think that that, in this particular case is a significant win for him considering that he went to 30, three-o, insurance companies to attempt to get a bond and all said no, perhaps he will have better luck getting it now that it's significantly been reduced.",

And so, ultimately, that's what we're going to do, right? Meaning the judicial system.And so, you know, it's not really a surprise, Rosemary, that the judge said, listen, no, as to the issue of a further delay. And no as to the issue of a dismissal. Right? We know that there were delays in discovery with respect to what prosecutors turned over to his defense team. But the judge considering that said, listen, if I extend the trial for a couple of weeks that will give you as defense lawyers, the ability to digest read, review this material, otherwise support and defend your client. And therefore, that German is, you know, is appropriate. And I think that the matter will move forward. In terms of the risk, Rosemary, listen, he could face incarceration in the case. You know, certainly it's an E felony, the way felonies work in New York state, it goes from a felony most severe 25 to life, the E felonies where you, you know, certainly can do steal jail time.

Now, the relevance of that is that defense lawyers continually in a trial winnable way and try to create doubt and spin the facts and tell their own story.And if you do that successfully, that's a big deal. In the event, your client testifies it goes from the burden of proof and you whittling away to do we believe your client? Is your client credible? Is your client's testimony compelling? In this case, of course, it's the president of the United States, a little bit different. I think his attorneys would want to keep him off the witness stand. But you know what, I think Trump keeps his own counsel. He's indicated he wants to testify, and perhaps he will testify. But it's a documentary case, meaning it's a paper case. And to the extent that prosecutors can establish that there were payments that were made, and they were not retainer payments paying back his lawyer who's fixing Michael Cohen, but instead they were going to pay off Stormy Daniels, who of course is the centerpiece of the case, then I think it creates significant problems.

And since every professional sports league has begun to partner with illegal gambling platforms. There are security systems that are setup. These security systems are in many cases being run by third-party contractors. And they can monitor wagering traffic in real time through all the legal gambling channels. In other words, if a player or someone close to him were to place a bet through legal channels, they can flag it potentially within minutes, certainly within hours, you know, and there's a reason for that, as you say, Rosemary, and that is the integrity of the game. You know, when gambling legal or illegal gets too close to the game itself, the danger is that the players who are supposed to be trying to win may not do that.
