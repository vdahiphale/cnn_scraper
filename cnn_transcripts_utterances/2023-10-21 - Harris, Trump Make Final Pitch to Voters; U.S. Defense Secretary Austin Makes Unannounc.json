It is Monday, October 21st, even, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will spend their respective Mondays with 15 days left to go before the election.It's the start of an all-out final blitz for support in a razor-thin race that could easily go either way. Already, more than 13 million ballots have been cast, with many states allowing for some sort of early voting. But ultimately, the election is expected to come down to just a handful of key swing states. And that's where Harris and Trump campaigns will be focusing their attention over this very busy week. Harris will be joined by former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney on a swing through the key states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as the vice president looks to pick up the support of some Republican-leaning voters disenchanted with Donald Trump. Harris and Donald Trump both hit the campaign trail hard over the weekend. The two traded barbs and exchanged sometimes personal attacks as they spoke with supporters. The vice president had several events in Georgia, including a stop at a suburban Atlanta church where she celebrated her 60th birthday and urged people to cast their ballots as early as possible. Harris talked to the crowd about her view of good leadership. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: In this moment, across our nation, what we do see are some who try to deepen division among us, spread hate, sow fear and cause chaos. There are those who suggest that the measure of the strength of a leader instead of what we know, which is the true measure of the strength of a leader, is based on who you lift up.

They think that 1,500 have already been sent across the border for training.So in the grand scheme, obviously, of this war where Russia has, you know, several hundred thousand in the field at any given time, that's not a huge number. But I think why this is being seen is such a big problem. One is because, you know, the size of North Korea, North Korea's army in general, 1.2 million. It's one of the most militarized countries in the world. If this ends up being a pipeline, this is a serious problem for Ukraine facing its own manpower shortages. And we now have evidence two videos. One was sent to CNN by the Ukrainian government. One has emerged on social media showing these troops at a -- you can see one of them there at a Russian training ground just across the border from China. So in the far east. So we've not seen any evidence they're actually in Ukraine yet. But there appears to be some evidence that they're already training. And this doesn't just sort of play into Russia's strategy of attrition. Right. Extending the war, trying to outlast Ukraine and its allies. But this sort of this expands the geopolitical sort of ripple effects of this war. We now have South Korea summoning the Russian ambassador to Seoul this morning, saying that this, you know, would be a major security risk for South Korea as well. The secretary general of NATO just spoke to the South Korean president. He posted on X in the last hour saying this would be a significant escalation. Neither the U.S. nor NATO have confirmed that they have their own evidence of this as yet. But, of course, it is being very closely watched. And for Ukraine, this presents a major argument in favor of crossing the next Rubicon in terms of weapons. Right. They're going to be arguing, certainly with this meeting with Austin today, that the West needs to lift restrictions on using long range missiles inside Russia now that there may be another national army being deployed by Russia in this war.",

The Israeli military says it's targeting financial institutions linked to Hezbollah. The Lebanese health ministry says more than 1,800 people have been killed since Israel ramped up attacks on the Iran-backed militant group last month. But the IDF is vowing to continue defending the Israeli people, saying Hezbollah fired about 200 projectiles into Israel on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced that the missile defense system sent to Israel is now in place and ready to go, as Israel prepares to retaliate against Iran after its attack on October 1st. New video from inside a central Gaza hospital shows devastating scenes in the aftermath of an Israeli strike on Sunday. Medical teams are treating the wounded on the floor, some covered in blood, including young boys. Sources say the attack killed at least six people in a refugee camp. It comes after Gaza's health ministry says at least 87 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on northern Gaza on Saturday. Graphic footage showed the bodies of several children amongst the dead, many with extensive injuries. As the war rages on, more than 140,000 children received their second dose of the polio vaccine on Saturday. It's part of a massive campaign led by the U.N. hoping to immunize more than 90 percent of the children in Gaza. Salma joins us now.

For President, the incumbent, Maia Sandu, receiving just under 42 percent of the vote. Her opponent, the former prosecutor general of the country, got just over 26 percent. Since neither reached 50 percent, the vote goes to a run-off, and that'll be on November 3rd. There have been allegations of Russian-backed interference in that election.
