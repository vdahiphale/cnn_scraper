Right now, top officials of the Biden administration are in Mexico looking for help in slowing the surge of migrants at the southern U.S. border.The pictures from the border show how urgent the crisis has become. Border authorities apprehended around 6,000 migrants along the U.S.- Mexico border yesterday. That's a drop from what we have been seeing. Earlier this month, there were 10,000 apprehensions in a single day. Right, now 11,000 migrants are waiting just across the border in Mexico, 3,800 in Tijuana. And another 7,000 near the southern tip of Texas. And that's why Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas are in Mexico City as we speak. Let's start the hour with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who's at the White House for us. And, Priscilla, U.S. officials are essentially trying to play every lever they can to ease the migrant surge. What specific requests are they making?",

The president deploying some of his highest ranking officials to talk with the Mexican president and some members of his cabinet about what more can be done to stem the flow of migration.Now, officials tell me these asks include, for example, moving migrants who were in the northern part of Mexico further south, sort of decongesting that area of the border. Also controlling railways, which are often used by migrants to more quickly get to the U.S. southern border, and providing incentives like visas, so that migrants stay in Mexico and avoid turning to the U.S. southern border. Now, all of this is an extension of a call that occurred last week between President Biden and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who both agreed that additional enforcement is urgently needed. Now, we know that numbers have dropped slightly along the U.S.-Mexico border. Homeland security official telling me that yesterday, encounters were around 6,000, down from a few days ago, when they were surpassing 10,000 arrests. But that's not sustainable. That still raises alarm bells and is overwhelming federal, state and city resources as we have heard from border towns. So, the president, under increasing pressure here to try to get some solutions with Mexico to stem this flow.",

They would like for the president to see with his own eyes the impact to border communities.And that's what I hear over and over. And that's why some of these officials tell me that, even though they don't agree with everything that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is doing here in his state, taking border security into his own hands, deploying those controversial border buoys, deploying the concertina wire, the containers that you might see behind me, too, that sometimes line the river, the busing of migrants and now the flying of migrants from Texas to blue states -- a lot of officials have told me that they don't agree with everything that Governor Greg Abbott is doing, but they always say, Rosa, he's at least doing something. He's trying something. He's trying to help border communities. And these individuals appreciate that. Now, has Texas actually stop illegal immigration? The answer is no. Have these border buoys actually stopped migrants from crossing the Rio Grande? Absolutely not. I've watched it with my own eyes. They simply walk around the border buoys. But again, individuals here in the state of Texas are appreciative that the governor is doing something. Now, this, the governor's effort, is called Operation Lone Star. It is costing Texas taxpayers billions of dollars. And now, even some of the individuals who supported the governor say that his promises have fallen short. Take a listen.

So, when Congress returns, perhaps we can get that done, but as well as coordinating resources are a little better. Look, it's a really tough issue.

How concerned are you about those trends?HOLTZ-EAKIN: As I said, the household sector kept the economy afloat in the second half of this year. So, that's a concern, whether they can keep it. The flip side for that is that the business community has not. One of my real concerns is that, in every postwar recession except the pandemic, the one we had most recently and that's what we tend to look at, every other recession begins with a downturn of spending. We saw business fixed investment in the third quarter dead flat, not strong at all. That's a concern for me. The Fed continued to tighten, the financial conditions tighten. What is a business community look like in the second half of this year and early next year? If they really give up and sort of cut back sharply, that's usually the trigger for households to get nervous and cut back as well. So, I'm looking at this as a bit of a horse race, business community that is weak and a household section that is strong. All the business community come up to the household or the reverse? That's the key.",

I think it is more intense when Republicans are the out-party. And Biden does have some legitimate accomplishments, as you alluded to. Tremendous job, growth low unemployment and an absolute investment boom in semiconductors, clean energy, electric vehicles, tied to the big bills that he passed in the first two years. But inflation, Bianna, has been a cloud just kind of obscuring all of that. You know, I -- the pollster Stan Greenberg, who's been doing this since the '80s, Democratic pollster, polls for parties all over the world, center-left parties, and often says that the ruling party just always underestimates how disruptive inflation is to people and how disorienting it can be. Now, as you pointed out, wages are now rising faster than prices. The Fed has signaled that it is going to cut interest rates next year. University of Michigan and the conference board and the Quinnipiac University all found a notable uptick in consumer confidence in December. So Biden may have wind and sails to improve his position but he is starting in a deep hole and how people perceive the economy while he's been in office.",

You can see the pull and tug within the Democratic Party as he talks.I think where they are going, and where much of the strategists of the party want them to go, is to talk less about the macro economy, you know, the $600 billion in private sector investment that they generated under for semiconductors and EVs and clean energy, and more about specific measures that can help families with their bottom line. For example, Biden is performing, holdings his vote among seniors compared to '20 much better than he is among young people. One reason is he has a lot of really tangible things that have come out of the Inflation Reduction Act that helped them. Medicare negotiating for prescription drugs, you know, $2,000 a year spending caps, $35 insulin, et cetera. So, there is a lot of argument that the Democratic Party says talk more about what you're helping -- doing to help families make ends meet each week, and less about a debate about the stewardship of the macro economy.",
