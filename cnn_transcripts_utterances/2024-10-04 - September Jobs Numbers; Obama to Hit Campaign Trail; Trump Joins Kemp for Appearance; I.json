And that's right too. In fact, the data this week that we got showed that the level of hiring, the hiring rate is at the lowest level it's been in 11 years. The quit rate, people willing to give up their job and look for another one at a nine-year low. So, there's still softness within that, but I can't take away from what is a h-o-t report.

      "sentences": "All right, and just in a bit we're going to hear from the acting labor secretary as well.All right, former President Barack Obama is now on the campaign trail with Kamala Harris for a highly critical battleground blitz. This big push happening as new data finds more than a million people have already cast pre-election votes with just over a month left to go until Election Day. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is closely watching team Harris as Harris begins her day in Michigan. Priscilla, what more are you hearing about all this and how this will all work together? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Look, Harris advisers keenly aware. We're in the final stretch now to Election Day. So, they will take all the help they can get. And that includes former President Barack Obama, who is one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party. So, next week he's going to be in Pittsburgh. This will be his first public campaign appearance since the Democratic National Convention. Now, what this is going to look like over the next 20 plus days is rallies in battleground states recorded as, as well as lending his name to email solicitations for campaign cash. Aides saying that this is a, quote, all hands on deck moment. Let me also read you a statement from Obama's senior advisor, Eric Schultz. He said, quote, \"now that voting has begun, our focus is on persuading and mobilizing voters, especially in states with key races. Many of these races are likely to go down to the wire and nothing should be taken for granted.\" So, the former president not only helping here with the presidential race, but also with those down ballot races. And again, this is just one part of a big strategy by the Harris campaign. I also talked to aides who told me what we saw yesterday in Ripon, Wisconsin, we're going to see more of that. The vice president going to these red rural counties, maybe because she can't win them, but she can lose them by less. And when you have a race that is going to be this close, that might just be enough. Today, though, she will be in Michigan. She will be in Flint, where she's going to have a rally. So certainly there is a play here to continue to focus on the Democratic areas, mobilize those voters, but also try to get some of those undecideds away from former President Donald Trump.",

If you look at the polls, the vice president is ahead of former President Donald Trump among this growing electorate. But she still lags behind other Democratic nominees in recent history. And when you look down at the numbers in those polls, you go a littledeeper. She has an advantage with Hispanic women, but she's about evenly split with Hispanic men. And I have talked to multiple sources who say, that's an area that they really need to focus on. So, they are launching a new ad today. Take a listen to that. Oh, it doesn't seem like we have the sound, but that ad is going to be focused on the vice president and the fight that she brings, not to lowering costs and housing affordability among other issues. Also part of a $3 million investment into Spanish-language radio. So, all of this to say that clearly big focus on Latino voters in this final stretch.",

But then you also have to reach out to those voters you don't yet have.Now, the way to do that is with what President Clinton used to say, they have wedge issues. We need web issues that stitch together our base and those swing voters. Look at what Kamala Harris is doing. She's - she has electrified her base. I mean they were very depressed when Biden was a candidate. They're very excited now that Kamala is. And she's reaching out - even getting Liz Cheney, for goodness sakes. She's holding together a coalition from AOC to Liz Cheney. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump, well, he fires up the base. But the things he does that fire up his base alienates those voters he does not yet have. I mean, I haven't met a single swing voter who said, you know, I'm really concerned about those people in Ohio eating each others cats. You know, I mean, he's just so off putting. And so he's, I think, not doing what he needs to do, candidly. He's fired up his base. We always talk about that. But, you know, nothing moves Trump's vote down because that base is so solid. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. He was convicted of 34 felonies and he went up one point. OK. I mean, and by the way, nothing moves it up very much. Thank God he survived an assassination attempt. He moved up 1.2 percent. So, he trades in such a narrow band. This is a race for Trump where everything has happened and nothing has changed his vote.",
