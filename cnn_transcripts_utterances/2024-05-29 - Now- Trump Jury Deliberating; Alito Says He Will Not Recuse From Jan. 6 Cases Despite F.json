Although this kind of charge exactly is really unprecedented.But I mean, with the underlying facts here, it was a relatively long case. So the jury heard it. I think in an emotional case like this, with sort of sexy evidence and that sort of thing, you know, jurors make up their mind often on a gut level. And they either think, you know, they don't like Donald Trump and, therefore, he's guilty with whatever he's charged with. Or they want to parse through things, or they think there's no crime that's been charged here. That's -- that's my view, at least.",

I think there's a significant part of the public that feels these are politically motivated prosecutions. So that part of it is upbeat. But of course, he doesn't like to be in this position. I don't know how he felt. I didn't talk to him in the last day or two. I don't know how he felt about how the lawyers did. I'm not a fan of the performance that I saw on the closing.

I don't think the kind of time either side took should have been necessary to do a hard-hitting close.I think that if Michael Cohen is the centerpiece of your close, you come in not with thank you, mumbling a little bit and all that. You come in with a compendium of Michael's -- Michael Cohen's prior inconsistent statements in one form after another. If that's going to be your centerpiece. I think this case though can be won in closing on the less sexy issues. That is the nature of the crimes charged. You had some evidence you could pull from, why they might be reasonably called legal expenses, why you don't even get to the misdemeanor. You have a pull-down menu, things that might resonate with them. But I would have done it, I think, in a shorter timeframe. I don't like the idea of a 10-point checklist. If I'm on the other side, I'm just going to go right through it and check them off. And as clever as it sounds, I personally -- this is just my gut, my reaction -- I don't like this idea of gloat, greatest liar of all time. Cohen is a liar. He lied on many occasions. But it doesn't -- it's not hard to come up with a more offensive liar, like Goebbels, as I've said before, someone like that. And the other side of it is, the prosecution should affectively made him Trump's liar. And that's the way you're going to go with the thing.

And we've had a tremendous number of Israeli soldiers killed by their own fire.Because this is an immensely complex war in a densely built-up area where terrorists do not wear uniforms. They dress as civilians. They mix in with civilian populations. So, yes, terrible, terrible mistakes do occur. And the victims of those other mistakes are not just aid workers and civilians, but also is Israeli soldiers themselves. And as you mentioned, hostages who managed to escape. It's brutal affair war in any conditions. And in Gaza, it's almost indescribable. I think that the Biden administration was very express in saying to Israel what its expectations were regarding the Rafah operation, that it not be a major incursion. Certainly as rockets continued to fire on Tel Aviv, fired from Rafah, Rafah. Any other army, any other country would simply go in there and level the place. Israel's not doing that. It's going in, in a very measured way, and using these small-caliber precision munitions, which the Biden administration requested that Israel use. So Israel is abiding by all of the requests of the Biden administration. So if there's a red line out there, the red line would be, I would imagine, a major incursion into Rafah using much larger caliber weapons.",

Israel has hundreds and hundreds of tanks.And while there may be a buildup of forces around Rafah and other -- and other places in Gaza, I think there's a deep desire on the part of the Israelis to conclude the Rafah campaign generally, as soon as possible. Because Hezbollah continues to fire dozens of rockets at the north every single day. And 60,000 Israelis remain displace. The entire northern part of the country is uninhabitable. And Hezbollah is a much greater threat than Hamas'. Hezbollah is a strategic threat that really could threaten Israel's fundamental security. So Israel wants to conclude that Rafah operation as soon as possible. But also wants to stay on the right side with the Biden administration. And I think there's tremendous pressure on the Israeli government to actually ordered a much larger operation into Gaza -- into Rafah as those missiles continue to fall on Tel Aviv, shot from Rafah.

I don't think that's changed at all.I think there are differences of opinion about the morning-after scenario. And I think -- I think Israel could do much more to meeting the Biden administion's expectation there. Either disagreements about the long-term peace process, I think, again, Israel could go up further to meeting the Biden administrations wishes there. But the fundamental goals of the war remain unchanged. And this is not Netanyahu's war. Hamas didn't attack (INAUDIBLE). Hamas attacked the people of Israel. And the people of Israel are very firmly behind the continuation of the war to remove the threat of Hamas. Again, as rockets continue to fall on our communities. It's not as if Hamas has been limited in any way. There will be debate in Israel over whether Israel should agree to a temporary ceasefire, not a permanent ceasefire, in return for the release of a certain number of hostages. There's going to be debate about the number of hostages that we would accept, the number of Palestinian terrorists, prisoners to be released from our jails in exchange for those hostages. There'll be debated. I believe -- and I'm not a spokesman for the government, Boris. I believe that if Hamas were to put a realistic proposal on the table for the release of hostages in return for a temporary ceasefire, I think that Israel would accept it.",
