You know, taking a step back and like thinking about what Naziism is, you know, Naziism isn't just white supremacy, it's white supremacy and the elimination of black, brown, gay, LGBTQ, Jewish people. You know, eliminate them from earth. Like, this is such a radical, dangerous thought. It is anti-American. And people that are pursuing, you know, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, Naziism is anti-American because it eliminates 70 percent of America.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, we are learning a little bit more about just what this missile was. According to multiple officials that we have spoken to, this was a medium range, intermediate range ballistic missile that was carrying multiple warheads. And it is potentially the first use of this kind of ballistic missile outside of testing. So, it is significant for that reason.And we just got some information from Ukraine's defense intelligence agency. And they also assessed that this ballistic missile was carrying six warheads and six submunitions. Essentially, this missile was designed during the Cold War to allow it to deliver multiple nuclear warheads during a conflict. And while this missile in particular carried conventional warheads, not nuclear warheads, it is an example of the kind of nuclear saber rattling that Russia is doing right now in response to that decision by President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use long range weapons and missile systems to launch - to attack inside Russia itself. Now, with all of that said, even given that this is a fairly new capability that the Russians are basically trying out here, the U.S. has said that they do not believe that Russia has a large supply of these kinds of missiles. In fact, they only have a couple, according to a U.S. official. They don't carry particularly large warheads, or at least this one that attacked Ukraine yesterday did not. And, importantly, the U.S. does not believe at this point that this kind of missile would be a game changer for the conflict in Ukraine. So, while they are assessing the implications of the use of this missile very closely, including for NATO's deterrence and its own posture, they are not overly concerned by this at the moment, saying that it's more just an attempt by the Russians to garner international attention and intimidate the Ukrainians instead of actually changing the course of the war, Sara.",

You know, it is very rare for a president to lose a Senate vote on confirmation of a cabinet nominee when his party controls the Senate. I think the last time it happened was roughly a century ago. Usually when a president with his party in control of the Senate is forced to back off, it's exactly what happened here, the nominee withdraws without a vote.And I think that, you know, any senator, no matter Republican senator, no matter how resistant to Trump's gravitational pull, they have a - probably a number in their head about how often they can publicly oppose him without, you know, kind of provoking the kind of consequences that you talk about. So, I would think this leaves them with more freedom, not less, to vote against one of the other nominees that many of them consider, you know, by historic measures, entirely unfit for these positions. Tulsi Gabbard, after the broadside that Nikki Haley delivered against her this week, I think would be vulnerable. RFK Jr., obviously. Pete Hegseth.

Donald Trump just won a stunning comeback victory. They don't want to oppose him very often. But, you know, I think what Haley - particularly the kind of arguments that Haley leveled against Tulsi Gabbard, which shows how you could oppose her from the right, or Mike Pence's arguments against RFK Jr. on abortion, which shows how you could oppose him from the right. No guarantee. But I think that creates more space potentially for a few Republicans to say no. You know, they've established a boundary, right? The - Trump's nominations of Gaetz in particular, I think, was meant to send the message that there is nothing he could do that - that Senate Republicans would kind of stiffen their backs against and resist.

To go to a licensed bar, a licensed hotel, and to avoid homemade beverages. And that leads to this other question, was this something that happened deliberately, or was this an accident? It's not uncommon for people to drink homemade drinks. Perhaps something went wrong. We just don't know at this point. It's also mysterious when we look at methanol because this is a substance that you can't necessarily see. It's clear. So, if it's in a drink, you really don't know. But it can do a lot of damage.
