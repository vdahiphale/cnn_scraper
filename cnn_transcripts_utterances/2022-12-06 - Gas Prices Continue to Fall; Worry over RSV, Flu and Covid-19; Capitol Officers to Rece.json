We would have expected them to be sky high. That has not been the case for a variety of reasons, including concerns about the health of the world economy and the U.S. economy. So far energy markets taking the latest moves from the west and Europe in stride because it's not just this embargo by Europe, it's also a $60 price cap being imposed on Russian oil by the west and the United States.The goal, of course, is to punish Vladimir Putin, right? Deprive him of some of the revenue from oil that he's using to finance the war in Ukraine. But it's a delicate balance because they don't want to punish him so much that he takes his ball and goes home by slashing oil production because that would hurt everyone, including U.S. consumers by reducing supply. So far, though, so good. And so this does mean that we've seen gas prices continue to go down. The national average, as we mentioned, $3.38 a gallon. Down not just 42 cents in the last month but also almost back to exactly where prices were a year ago. Look at that, just two cent higher than 12 months ago.",

They're leveling off, but still very high.Let's take a look at flu and RSV. If you compare hospitalization rates for those viruses compared to other points in the year, in previous years, so this time but in previous years, the flu has the highest hospitalization rate in 13 years. RSV has the highest hospitalization rate in at least five years. Let's take a look at flu. You see a very red United States. This is not a political map. This is a flu map. That means that nearly the entire country has very high or very high levels of flu. And then throw Covid into the mix. Covid rates are going up, unfortunately. If you look at the week of November 26th, there were nearly 33,000 hospital admissions in the U.S. for Covid. That's up 27 percent from the week before. And, Jim, you asked a great question, how worried should we be as we think about holiday gatherings. I would say that depends who you are. If you're immune compromised, if you have someone in your family who is or someone who's very elderly, you should keep this in mind. Thankfully for the rest of us, it's not as big of a deal, but do keep it in mind for the most vulnerable people.",

From a constitutional perspective, what's the difference between a baker, the previous case refusing to bake a cake, design one for a same-sex couple, or in this case a web designer refusing to design a website for a same-sex couple.

We don't answer cases in the abstract.If you look back at the case Jim referred to regarding the bake shop in Colorado, there was actually a couple that wanted a cake made. Here, there's no such thing. This web designer has come in and asked for essentially a preemptive ruling saying, I may want to expand my business to get into the wedding industry. However, I would like a ruling that I'm OK to do that first. And the liberal justices objected to that.
