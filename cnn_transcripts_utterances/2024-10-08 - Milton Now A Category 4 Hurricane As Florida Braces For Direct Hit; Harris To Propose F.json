Today really is the last day people have to get out and still have time before the conditions begin to deteriorate here.We are also seeing bumper-to-bumper traffic on highways leaving Tampa. Florida, we know, has suspended tolls on these major highways to assist with these evacuations. They're also allowing drivers to use the shoulders on highways in order to make traffic flow a little bit faster. But for the last 24 hours traffic has really been jam-packed across this Tampa Bay area region. We are also paying close attention to the cleanup of debris across this area. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis says that crews are going to be working until it's no longer safe to do so to try and clean up all the debris that's been left behind after Hurricane Helene came through. Just to drive here where we are in front of this boat ramp, neighborhoods that we drove by are still seen with piles of debris in front of homes and in front of apartment complexes. And that could be very dangerous because when Milton does make its landfall we could see projectiles or those debris begin to turn into projectiles. If not, they could clog a lot of the sewers or just get in front and inside of those roads, not allowing crews to be able to access them. So it's going to be working here around the clock to try and get that debris out -- John.",

So we are prepared for this. We plan for this.

We're prepositioning resources, like search and rescue teams, health care assessment teams. The Army Corps of Engineers for power assessment and generator support.

To put it into context,\" they write, \"over the previous five years, one-quarter of the agency's staff was available for deployment at this point in the hurricane season.\" Just nine percent versus a quarter of the staff.
