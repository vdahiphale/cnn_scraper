It saw the defense move for mistrial over some of what she said and then launched into their cross-examination which is expected to continue on Thursday when the trial resumes.But before getting into the nuts and bolts of what transpired today, it's hard not to stop and consider that this is happening at all. A former president of the United States running for president again confronted in court by the porn star whose silence he's accused of buying and covering up so that he could become president the first time around. Tonight, we'll bring you her testimony in great detail to the relationship she says they had. The effect prosecutors hope it will have on the case and defense attempts to undermine it, which began early on with the following exchange she had with Trump attorney Susan Necheles who asked her, \"Am I correct that you hate President Trump?\" To which Daniels replied, \"Yes.\" As for the former president, he did not have a single word to say about Stormy Daniels at the end of the day, but had plenty to say about the case itself.

      "sentences": "I mean, I thought there were so many different moments because so many different things happened today. There was Stormy Daniels when being questioned by the prosecutors and she was almost gossiping with her friends, telling her story, looking at the jury a lot, engaging - and we - I saw a number of jurors taking notes, flipping through their pad of paper, writing down a lot of what was said, even though a lot of what she testified has nothing to do with the falsified documents in this case.And then, there was Trump reacting to that. He was nudging his attorney repeatedly, trying to get them to object. They did. And the judge agreed with a lot of those objections because they had to do with Stormy Daniels kind of going a little beyond the bounds of what the judge had said would be an acceptable testimony. And then, the cross-examination, Susan Necheles, came in there peppering her. So Daniels' demeanor changed. She was sitting with her arms crossed. She just was a lot more defensive in that mode. And we heard Stormy Daniels tell the story of how she met Donald Trump, how she ended up in his hotel room - suite, how she came out of the bathroom and saw him lying on the bed. So bringing the jury into the room in that detail and then also saying both when questioned by the prosecutors and the defense that she did want to make money from this, that's why she was telling her story and at least initially looking to sell her story. And then she said she wanted to get it done before the election because essentially she thought that's when she had the most leverage, that Donald Trump wasn't going to pay her after the election. I mean, Jeff Toobin and I were talking about this just a minute ago. Another key thing that happened today that is kind of lost in this is that the prosecution had showed a number of excerpts from Trump's books from 20 years ago.",

And she actually did it, she said, and kind of acted it out in court. At that moment, we saw Trump mouthed a word. You couldn't exactly tell what it was. But when now when you look at the transcript, there was a really tense moment right after that when they took a break. And now when you look at the transcript, the judge asked the two sides to approach the bench. And he said to Trump's team, I understand your client is upset at this point, but he is cursing audibly and he is shaking his head visually and that's contentious. It has potential to intimidate the witness and the jury can see that. And Blanche said he would talk to him. And the judge said, \"I'm speaking to you here at the bench because I don't want to embarrass him.\" Blanche said he would talk to him. And the judge said, \"You need to speak to him. I won't tolerate that. One time I noticed when Ms. Daniels was testifying about rolling up the magazine, and presumably smacking your client, and after that point he shook his head and looked down. And later, I think he was looking at you, Mr. Blanche, when we were talking about The Apprentice, and at that point he again uttered a vulgarity and looked at you. Please talk to him at the break.\" Jury is not in the room. Witness isn't in the room, but the judge is saying you need to control your client while she's telling these very salacious details.",

And I think there is some chance that some of what she said might generate a little sympathy for Trump, because for all today was fascinating and I'm sure everybody's fascinated, as was I. Most of it is just not relevant to the case. I mean, this is a case about the money that was paid to her and it almost doesn't matter whether they actually had sex.The argument is that Trump was so worried about the report of the sex that the underlying truth of it doesn't really matter. I understand why the defense moved for a mistrial. I think the judge was right not to grant it.

It was - I mean, maybe it's nothing ventured, nothing gained. I don't know if maybe there's some kind of Hail Mary at play here. But it seems like a huge risk to put someone on the stand who is not necessarily the most sympathetic witness. She has a very specific part of the story to tell. But she was asked to tell way more of it than I think even people who don't like Donald Trump would care to hear. And how that will play with the jury is anyone's guess. But it just - I'm with Jeffrey - it just seemed to me we learned way too much about the silk pajamas and whatnot of Donald Trump today.

Saying that Jack Smith shouldn't be appointed, that's a silly motion. It's frivolous. So, some of these she could have disposed of and then she could say, I have four left and I can set a trial date for July. But as it turns out, I have eight pending motions. I can't possibly try this. Maybe July, maybe August, but we all know that means September and it's going to be too late if that --",
