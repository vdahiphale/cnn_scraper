And I'm Jessica Dean in New York.Very soon Michelle Obama will be introducing Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan, where early voting is now underway statewide. The former first lady joining a roster of A-listers who've stumped for Harris this week, including Beyonce, who appeared last night in Texas, as well as Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama earlier this week in Georgia. Also happening, at any moment former president Donald Trump will take the stage in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. He was also in Michigan earlier today, his second event in the state in as many days. Trump also sitting for a marathon three-hour interview with Joe Rogan of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast yesterday. Now tomorrow Trump will hold a rally in New York City at Madison Square Garden, where he'll be joined by running mate J.D. Vance, as well as Elon Musk and Robert Kennedy. In this exhaustive final push, could iconic venues, celebrity endorsements, and more influence move the needle in this razor tight race? We're 10 days away from election day in America. And a new CNN poll shows a dead heat between the two candidates among likely voters. We're on the ground with both campaigns this afternoon. Let's start first with CNN's Eva McKend, who is with the Harris campaign in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Danny Freeman with team Trump in State College, Pennsylvania. Eva, what are we expecting to hear from Michelle Obama, perhaps one of the most sought-after Democratic surrogates?",

And with so much on the line, our freedoms, our future, our progress, it's easy to get a little nervous. But I want you all to listen to me. In this final stretch, we have to give it everything we've got. We need to vote like our lives depend on it, and show up in numbers that cannot be denied. Look, Kamala Harris is putting in the work. We see it every day, but she can't win this thing alone. She needs our help. So don't just sit around and look at the polls or wait to be called. It's time to do something. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I will note, though, that interview with Joe Rogan, according to YouTube, has already been viewed over 16 million times, and going on that podcast really was an attempt by the campaign to reach a large number of voters, specifically perhaps younger men who might not otherwise be inclined to either get a vote or be plugged that much into politics. That's pretty much what we're going to see today here in State Collegeas well. We're on Penn State's campus. We're going to see former president Trump here really any moment now. And the goal here is to try and chip away at some of the support that Vice President Kamala Harris might have in a college town. Centre County is where we are, Jessica, you know the commonwealth well. This has been a blue county over the past several democratic -- excuse me, over the past several presidential election cycles.

We're now just 10 days out, and this week you wrote an op-ed for \"The New York Times\" giving your three reasons why you said you're certain that Vice President Kamala Harris will win. \"America, it will all be OK,\" you wrote.

They said that these were precise strikes and that they did not go after those energy targets like oil or nuclear, which we know the Israeli government had initially been considering before the United States effectively talked Israel off of that ledge.We understand that the Israeli military struck both missile production sites, as well as air defense systems. I was just told by an Israeli official that multiple S-300 air defense systems located in strategic locations inside of Iran were struck by the Israeli military and that official believes that this, quote, \"directly translates\" into giving the Israeli air force increased ability to maneuver over Iranian skies should it decide to carry out additional strikes, and crucially, should Iran choose to retaliate. And that is indeed the question at this moment is to what extent is -- what kind of calculations really is Iran going to make here? Will they choose to retaliate which carries with it the risk of escalating the situation further, perhaps drawing it into all-out war directly with Israel or will it choose not to? And that also carries the risk of course of Iran looking weak in the eyes of its population, but also among hardliners inside of Iran as well as among its proxies and allies in the region which have been significantly weakened themselves already by the Israeli military over the course of the last few months. And I'm told by an Israeli source familiar with the thinking that the Israeli government wanted to make sure that they actually did damage in these strikes last night, demonstrating its intelligence and military capabilities to strike deep inside of Iran. But now we've heard relatively little from the Israeli government about the specific nature of these targets. And also the extent of the damage. And that is intentional I'm told to give Iran the opportunity to downplay these strikes and perhaps to head towards de-escalation. For now that appears to be the path that Iran is choosing, but that doesn't mean that that's ultimately their final decision -- Jessica.",

So let's just say that the polls were exactly 100 percent correct, and so the results match the polls and Harris wins Pennsylvania up here in blue. What does that mean?Well, it means Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes. Of course, you need 270 to win. Hence, the road to 270. So she just gets over that mark. But it's so simple, so simple to give the election to Donald Trump. So I mentioned Pennsylvania. What happens if the results match the polls exactly but Trump wins Pennsylvania? We turn Pennsylvania light, red or pink. Then we get Donald Trump at 281 electoral votes. When just one state, flipping one state could turn a loser into a winner and vice versa, I'm not quite sure that there's any way else to put it than what I said at the very top.

You know, you go back to July, you know, what is that, three months ago, she was at minus 10 points.Then you just sort of saw this upward trajectory, minus two, then plus one. She was becoming more popular. Then all of a sudden, the popularity trend has reversed, and now she's back in a negative territory. Compare that to Donald Trump, where, if you compare where his net favorability is. Look, Harris is still more popular than he is, but his trend compared 2016 at this point to 2020, at this point to 2024, minus 25, minus 12, minus 7. Donald Trump has never gone into a general election as popular as he is today, whether or not that's enough, given that Harris is still slightly more popular than he is, only time will tell, Jessica.",

I believe the latest average of his approval rating was below 40 percent.Now, he did go to Pittsburgh on his own today, in that critical state of Pennsylvania. The other thing is, you know, to Marc's point, this is about rallying the base. I was in Atlanta for Barack Obama's rally with Harris, and it was very clear this is one of the most diverse counties in all of Georgia. And they -- it was very clearly geared towards black men. Not only did you have Barack Obama but you had Samuel Jackson, Spike Lee, Tyler Perry. The intent was, as polling has shown, a drift of some black men to Donald Trump, they wanted to double down and make sure that they can stop any of that bleeding.",

He looked across the river. He saw Madison Square Garden. He always wanted to be there. And according to some of the sources and confidants with whom I've spoken for a piece I did in the Bulwark, he was \"obsessed\" with this. He has an obsession. He's always wanted to do it. He's told people, I'm going to fill the Garden. I'm going to fill the Garden. All indications are that he will tomorrow. Now, will he have a different message in closing than he has had during the campaign? You know, Donald Trump, when you start talking about message discipline, that's not his strong suit, that's not what he does. So I'm not quite sure what his closing message is going to be beyond what he always says, which is a lots of things. But in the end, the important thing is the actual forum. That's the message for Donald Trump. I'm in New York. I'm doing it, and everyone watch me.",
