Still, it's a very remarkably large tsunami. We'll see what the actual effects of that have been. Again, the visual images as you -- and visual images are coming in, trickling in.We haven't seen a lot. We've seen some fires, particularly on the Noto Peninsula, which is the area of the highest risk. It's a peninsula north of Ishikawa Prefecture, jetting out into the ocean. So, that was very alarming. All of us were very, very concerned about that. Hopefully, in terms of power plants, nuclear power plants, the damages won't be too big, but we expect to see a lot of damage to coastal structures and communities. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He is Secretary General of the IUGG, an organization responsible for international coordination of tsunami-related research. Thank you so much for joining us through the morning, giving your expertise on this. We have had the most severe warnings downgraded now, but we are still seeing tsunamis hit over a meter. Just explain how concerned you are about that.DR. MOHAMMAD HEIDARZADEH, SECRETARY GENERAL, JOINT TSUNAMI COMMISSION OF IUGG: Yeah. Obviously, Max, this is a very concerning moment in terms of the earthquake and tsunami worldwide, because we are having a big earthquake, magnitude 7.5. And some agencies, they reported the magnitude of 7.6, and at the very shallow depths of only 10 kilometers, which means a massive tsunami is expected. And this is already confirmed by instrumentation, equipment data that we have from -- along the Japanese coast. The height of the earthquake is more than a meter offshore, which means the final height of the tsunami is going to be five, six meters. And we are unfortunately expecting that some damage along the coastal area. And we have to also keep in mind that Japan is having nine nuclear power plants along that segment of the coast, because the Japan government moved many of their nuclear power plants to the Japan Sea side because they thought that that area is safer, but obviously is not very much safe because we are having large earthquakes, like the one today.",

This is also a very vulnerable in terms of the tsunami because the Sea of Japan is an enclosed basin, which means that if we had a tsunami, that is the one today, that tsunami would be oscillating for a long time, for maybe 24 hours or 48 hours, which means we are going to have very long time-flooding, and the impacts of the waves, this wave would be back and forth hitting to the north coast and to the north -- to the coast of the North Korea and then back to Japan. And this is going to be a problem because if it's open coast, i.e., the east side of Japan, the tsunami wave would be dissipating quickly. But, here we are having a situation that is not great. It's kind of chopped, and distract wave is going to oscillate for maybe two days.And I believe that the Japan government is already aware of that, and that's why they asked local people to evacuate and to stay away from the coast at least half the day.",

Usually, the large waves -- the largest waves are the fifth or the sixth or the 10th wave, I mean, based on experience from many earthquakes worldwide. The largest wave, sometimes it's coming like two, three or four, sometimes six hours after the tsunami beginning, after the earthquake.So, I think that's why we have to stay away from the coasts and we have to be prepared. I mean, especially, for example, if we come back to the 2011, Japan, big tsunami in 2010, March 2011, the major incident, the major problem was the Fukushima nuclear disaster. And that's why we have to be very cautious regarding the nine nuclear power plants that we have at the coast of the Sea of Japan.",

They are helpful for storms. Japan is having lots of typhoons, lots of storms every year, maybe like 10 storms every year. And these sea walls are very helpful.

They look not a big problem. And that's why many local people, I mean, all over the world, they are distant on the coast, and they watch the waves. But, tsunami waves are very small when -- at far distance from the coast. But, near the coast, they become large, and they become very -- they are actually a very energetic wave. They are very fast. And they can easily inundate like 500 or one kilometer off the coastal area.So, I think this is very important. And Max, you are showing these kind of waves. And -- I mean, I want to tell all of the citizens of the local people that, I mean, don't be misled by the -- by these kind of videos, and evacuate, stay away from the course at least half a day.

We're hearing reports that six cases of people being trapped under their homes. We also know that bullet trains have been suspended. Large cracks in roads making it very difficult for some of these doctors and emergency forces to just get to the people.

      "sentences": "I would say that the fact that this earthquake struck on the west coast of Japan versus the east coast poses a larger tsunami threat. And we're hearing this from some of the experts as well just because of the nature of the geography that surround that area. We've got the Korean Peninsula to the west. We've got Russia to the west. So, a smaller body of water means that ability for this displacement of water that was caused by the earthquake to slosh back and forth. So, I don't believe that we are going to see the tsunami threat actually minimize to nothing anytime soon. I think we're going to have at least another couple of hours of the tsunami threat, just by the pure nature of where the earthquake actually struck.So, here are some of the latest video of one of the tsunami waves that reached the western shoreline of Japan. This is the Seki River in Joetsu, Japan. This is just outside of Ishikawa Prefecture. And what I want you to note about this is just the height of the water. By the way, this brings back a lot of memories from 2011. I covered that earthquake and subsequent tsunami. We don't like to see this. This has a lot of energy and a lot of water being forced inland, and also working its way into the habited areas of western Japan. But, this video really confirmed some of the observed wave heights that we've had over this area. Just going back on that geography reference, you could see, there is Russia, there is a Korean Peninsula, not much here to stop that water from bouncing back and forth. That's why this area is very susceptible versus if it was on the East Coast, we would have the entire Pacific Ocean to absorb that energy. That's not the case. We have tsunami warnings, which have been downgraded from a major tsunami warning. That difference being no longer five meter tsunami waves anticipated, but up to three meters anticipated with this -- within this particular area. The Ishikawa Prefecture is right there. That band of land that sticks out from the west coast. But, notice, the advisories go as far north as Hokkaido, right? So, that's significant. So, that video you saw a moment ago fits the narrative of some of the wave heights that we have seen, observed. Remember, there is a lack of communication. There is downed power lines. So, it's very difficult to get information out of this area. But, what we do have confirms and fits that narrative of the video that you saw just a moment ago of wave heights, roughly about one meter. So, this earthquake was significant. We know that it occurred offshore under the ocean floor. And what that did, because it was so large and so shallow, is that it displaced the water at the surface of the ocean. And that forces a wave to form on the surface. In fact, one buoy off the coast of western Japan measured a tsunami wave of one meter. Now, just because of the basics of bathymetry, the natural shape of the shoreline and the coastline, how it gets shallower and shallower up until it reaches the population density where you and I live, that water has to go somewhere. So, we see the water move up, and that is why the potential here exists for a larger wave. That's why the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its initial warning of a five -- up to five meter tsunami wave. They've downgraded that to a three meter, but it's significant because it was this was the culprit, the 7.5 magnitude with that type of energy, with that type of depth structure. It is going to displace a significant amount of water. And that means that transpires into a larger wave at the surface really, ultimately, when you look at it. Max, there was a lot of shaking felt. Over 50 million people felt this earthquake as far east as Tokyo. Look at these numbers. I mean, this just really paints a picture here. People waking up on New Year's Day or going about their New Year's festivities, and 44 million people just feeling shaking within their house, that's terrifying. FOSTER: Yeah, and then getting the warning to get to higher land.",

Now, of course, New Year's Eve, New Year in general is the biggest holiday of all for this season, certainly in Russia and in parts of Ukraine as well. So, that is significant.We don't have to read between the lines. President Putin has come out in the last few hours and promised to step up strikes on Ukrainian military targets. So, even with the actions of these stepping up attacks, he is now saying it out loud as well. So, I think we can expect these strikes to continue.

The military statement coming after Hamas' military wing claimed it launched a barrage of rocks over Tel Aviv right as the New Year started. At least 12 of them were intercepted by Israel, according to a CNN team on the ground. Elliott Gotkine joins us from Tel Aviv, a very depressing start to the year, much as it was in Ukraine.

So, ordinarily, there wouldn't be much celebrations. But clearly, this year, there is even less to celebrate with the war in Gaza, and of course, the aftermath of the worst day in Israel's history on October 7 with that terrorist attack from Hamas that killed at least 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 200, more than 100 of whom are still being held in the Gaza Strip.As far as the military campaign goes, and we just heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu the other day talking about this war going to take months, and what the IDF is saying in terms of these 20,000 soldiers or so who are being allowed to go home, to return to their families, to return to their work and businesses, it is more about allowing them to rest, to replenish, to retrain and get ready for this prolonged conflict. So, I don't think we should really look at it in terms of Israel kind of winding things down in any shape or form. From Israel's perspective, it's still very much a case of mission not accomplished yet, namely, destroy Hamas militarily and get those hostages back home. And of course, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry, we know that death toll continues to rise. And I'm afraid on January 1, it's almost inevitable that death toll, which doesn't distinguish between competence and civilians, will inevitably rise. And it's all a question of just how much longer this war continues, and if there is hopes of some kind of conversations leading to maybe some kind of truce may come to fruition. Max.",

So if you're just getting shaking, it's not -- that's not going to create or trigger a tsunami. You have to actually have the sea floor has to go up or down. That's what triggers the tsunami.

So now we've got to analyze what types of building structures they have within this part of Japan. And from what we have found is it's a mixture of concrete reinforced buildings and apartments and businesses, but also a mixture of wood homes, for instance.So with aftershocks ongoing, and an initial powerful earthquake of 7.5, that has really compromised those structures. So the potential for aftershocks to take down, buildings and homes still exists. We already had 19 aftershocks of 2.5 or greater and we anticipate those aftershocks to continue. But in terms Max of that GDP, the USGS the US Geological Survey has a really clever way of analyzing earthquakes in real time. What they do is they compare this particular earthquake with previous earthquakes of similar magnitude and of similar depth and they say, hey, okay, from previous events, we know that this caused roughly 1 percent or lower of the GDP of Japan as a whole. That's not to say that that's what happened with this particular event. Of course, we're still getting some of the first information from -- on the ground where communication is extremely limited. Electricity is limited, but based on previous events of similar magnitude, according to the USGS, the estimated economic losses, less than 1 percent of GDP but this is a major economic powerhouse of the world.
