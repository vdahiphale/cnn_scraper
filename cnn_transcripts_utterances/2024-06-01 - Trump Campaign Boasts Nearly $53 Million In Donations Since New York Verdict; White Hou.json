The Trump campaign saying it's raised nearly $53 million since he was found guilty by a Manhattan jury of falsifying business records in order to influence the 2016 election.His sentencing date now set for July 11th, and that's just days before the Republican National Convention where Trump is expected to be picked as the party's official nominee. Trump is planning to appeal. Yesterday, he gave a glimpse of how he intends to forge ahead with his campaign, falsely calling the trial rigged and attacking the judge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We had a conflicted judge, highly conflicted. There's never been a more conflicted judge. You saw what happened to some of the witnesses that were on our side, they were literally crucified by this man who looks like an angel, but he's really a devil. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now we have heard that it could be as early as Tuesday when they make that announcement, but certainly they are spending the weekend trying to bring border mayors to the White House, to announce this action.Now, this would essentially clamp down on unlawful border crossings. It has been talked about within the White House and within the administration for weeks now, especially kicking into gear after that failed bipartisan border bill, which failed because Republicans walked away from it after, or at the asking or request of former president Donald Trump. So essentially, if you look at this through the political lens, the White House is trying to claim the narrative on border security. They've clearly tried to be more aggressive since that bipartisan border bill failed, which they were a part of those discussions. And this is also going to happen potentially before the first presidential debate. So in some ways it's also preempting President Biden's Republican rival who has made immigration and border security a key campaign issue. So we'll be watching to see if they do indeed make this announcement on Tuesday as we're hearing. But clearly the White House is at least laying the groundwork for that to happen and trying to really make a pivot here and turn the tables on Republicans when it comes to border security. DEAN: It'll be interesting to see it all unfold. Priscilla Alvarez, great to see you. Thanks so much. And in the history of America, not one president, not one former president even has ever been tried or convicted in criminal court. Let's talk to someone with a unique perspective on all of this, John Dean, who was President Nixon's White House counsel and is now a CNN contributor. John, it's great to see you on this Saturday afternoon. The only precedent we have that's close as you well know was President Richard Nixon who chose to resign, and not only is Trump not stepping back, he's actively running for president. It's a very close race. What do you think it could mean for a convicted felon to be elected president of the United States?",

He's a recidivist and has done it many times now. So it's very problematic.

I think the objective, I'm not going to vote for either Trump or Biden, but I certainly think one objective here should be to make sure Donald Trump is not president again, and I don't want the lawfare advocates in their zeal just to feel good and signal their virtue to get jail time if it helps elect him.

I a few years ago read the probation report for my former co-conspirators in Watergate, former chief of staff Bob Haldeman, former attorney general John Ehrlichman, or excuse me, John Mitchell, and then former domestic adviser John Ehrlichman. They were the three most powerful men in the Nixon White House and Nixon administration. When they went to jail after Watergate, they were innocent men. The probation officer visited with them about eight months into their serving their sentence. They were then guilty and very remorseful about what they had done. As a result of that, the judge ended up shortening their sentences. But somehow the reality of going to jail can make people think if they don't admit their wrongs and their misbehavior, they can come to understand it. So I think Trump needs some jail time. He is just totally unrepentant. He'll do it again. He'll do it again worse. He's on a revenge campaign. And so I hope this judge sends him to jail.",

He treated in a very transactional fashion like he was just moving into another business. It is not. The government is a very different creature.

I mean, he has a hold on a certain segment of the population it seems no matter what.J. DEAN: He has about 30 percent apparently of voters. And there are people who just don't even want to know the facts. I have some friends who are very deeply supportive of Donald Trump. And when we talk, they say, don't give us any information, they don't really want to know what's happening. They just want to believe and it's mythical if you will. I think that it wouldn't hurt if they saw what was really going on. And the criminal justice system does apply to everybody.

DEAN: I think we're in one of the early chapters of this piece of history because he's got three more cases he's going to be confronted with. If he is not elected, he certainly got two federal cases that are very important. The January 6th case and the District of Columbia, the documents theft problem, and the obstruction case in Florida, as well as the Georgia case. So he's got a lot more litigation to face. And the only case he could get rid of you if he were elected would be the two federal cases. I think there'll be a certain outrage if he did that, so they could be put on on a stay but to just make them go away we'll have to see what the Supreme Court says about presidential immunity.

That's a little fuzzy for criminal law, and that could -- it's the way the statute provides for it. It's the way he was convicted.

To that end, the secretary did in fact meet face to face just the other day with his Chinese counterpart for the first time since 2022. And importantly, Secretary Austin reiterated to the Chinese that there are going to be consequences not only for their actions potentially in the South China Sea and in the region around Taiwan but also for their support in their ongoing support for Russia's defense sector and how that is fueling the war in Ukraine. Secretary Austin said that if China continues to provide that kind of support for the Russians then the U.S. and its allies will be forced to take further measures. Now that is undoubtedly going to be on the agenda for Secretary Austin's meeting with a surprise guest here at the Shangri-La Forum, which is President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.

So the hardware actually performed just fine and was ready for launch. The issue frustratingly had to do with the ground computers that sit right near the base of the launchpad. They require all three computers to tell the rocket that it is essentially go for launch. They call it triple redundancy. On Saturday, two of those computers gave it the greenlight, the third computer did not, or perhaps it was just too slow in getting there. That's what triggered the automatic hold. And because this was an instantaneous launch window, meaning that they had to launch the exact precise moment that then meant that there was a scrub.

And suddenly, one day these people wake up and there are tanks 30 miles outside of their city.What's interesting about Kharkiv as well, a lot of the people in there, they speak Russian. Culturally, they are very Russian. They have family members in Russia. And I said, why don't you just accept occupation? Like is it really that bad? And they've said, no way.

The Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of these women says that they will continue to pursue other legal avenues.
