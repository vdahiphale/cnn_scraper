Alaska Airlines says the plane was scheduled to be taken out of service for maintenance on the same night -- the same night of the blowout back in January. This comes as a series of problems have called Boeing's standards into question.Our Aviation Correspondent Pete Muntean is here with us right now. Pete, first of all, what can you tell us about the scheduled maintenance of this Boeing 737?",

      "sentences": "The bottom line here is that this plane should never have left the Boeing factory without the critical four-door plug bolts that hold that door plug onto the airplane. But now, investigators have this new question to ask. When this scheduled maintenance check, the night of the blowout, have caught that omission by Boeing? Would previous pressurization system warnings in the cockpit have led to a check on the door plug?The NTSB has said those warnings were unrelated to the blowout but it's something no doubt the NTSB will dig into. They have the maintenance records from this airplane. Let's look at the timeline here in the preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board. This plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines October 31, Halloween Day, 2023. On December seven, there was the first pressurization warning in the cockpit. And then two days before the door plug blew out. And the day before the door plug blew out, there was another pressurization system warning. And then on January 5, that is one the door plug blew out of this flight, Alaska Airlines flight 1182. Now, Alaska Airlines is disclosing this for the first time after this reporting by the New York Times. In a statement, Alaska Airlines says we remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident. We look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB to ensure something like this can never happen again. This is only the start of what will be a huge probe by the NTSB. And just yesterday, it announced what it called an investigative hearing. That will be held publicly in August. That means the NTSB can subpoena parties to testify. That could include officials from Boeing. This is very, very rare, typically reserved for the biggest incidents that have been in the public eye like the East Palestine rail disaster, like the Miracle on the Hudson. No doubt, Wolf, a lot of interest in this, and a lot of people will be watching this hearing on August six and seven.",

He says Russia is ready to use nuclear weapons if there's a threat as Ukraine carries out its biggest series of drone attacks overnight. Stay with us. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [11:40:55] BLITZER: A very alarming new warning from Vladimir Putin to the West over Ukraine. He is saying that Russia is prepared to use a nuclear weapon if Russian state -- the Russian state is at stake. Those comments coming just ahead of the Russian elections that begin Friday. CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen is following these developments for us. Fred, what's the significance of Putin even raising this issue of possibly using nuclear weapons?",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Wolf. I think first and foremost, this is a message for Russia's domestic audience -- for Putin's domestic audience. And he did say this in an interview with Kremlin-controlled T.V. And I think part of it is due to the fact that right now for the Russians on the battlefield, while they feel that they do have the initiative on the battlefield and they certainly have made some territorial gains over the past couple of weeks, even the past couple of months, still the war is dragging on a lot longer than many Russians would have hoped.And a lot of Russians at home are also feeling the economic pinch of the sanctions that have been placed on Russia by the U.S. and its allies. So essentially, what Vladimir Putin is trying to portray is saying look, there are some hardships, but Russia is still a grand nation and one with a massive nuclear-armed arsenal rivaling the United States. And he even claimed one that is more modern than the nuclear arsenal of the United States. I want to listen to some of what Vladimir Putin had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through a translator): Our triad and the whole nuclear element is more modern. In general, if we talk about the carriers and numbers of warheads, we are more or less equal. But ours are more modern. Everybody knows this. All experts know this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, we've seen a lot of those Russian drones launch towards Ukrainian territory, but now things apparently going in the other direction. The Ukrainians saying that they hit some key and large oil refineries of the Russians, including some very far away from Ukrainian-controlled territory.One of them is in the area around a town called Ryazan, which is southeast of Moscow. Another one they say was in the Leningrad Oblast, which of course, is the area around St. Petersburg. That is extremely far away from Ukrainian-controlled territory. And it goes to show apparently, the Ukrainians do have some long- distance strike capabilities with those unmanned aerial vehicles. Of course, this is something where the Ukrainians say this is part of a larger strategy that they have. The Russians, of course, are very angry about all of this, Wolf.",

Haiti is in a state of emergency as criminal gangs are terrorizing the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Prime Minister Ariel Henry has announced he will resign amid intense international pressure. Let's discuss what's going on in Haiti with Jacqueline Charles, Caribbean Correspondent for The Miami Herald. She has been reporting on the region for more than a decade.

And talking to locals who have been coming here since the 60s, they say their kids used to play at the -- at the shoreline, way in the distance there. But year by year, the tides have crept up as a result of about nine inches of sea level rise.In Massachusetts, you -- if you own a beach house, you own the beach technically. And so, you split it with the state you know the line is somewhere around here. And the state does not put sand on private property. So, it was -- really became incumbent on the folks here to protect themselves from freakish storms that have been coming more frequently, more back-to-back. And so, they pulled together about 600,000 bucks. They brought in 15,000 tons of sand. If you get a sense of it, it came out and filled up the bottom of this staircase here. And in that one storm -- so this stand historically would have lasted them for three years. Would have protected their home. But just days after completing it, half of it washed away. $300,000 worth of sand washed away in a single storm, which is obviously very troubling for these folks. Some neighbors opted not to buy into the -- to the fortification project like this home here. And you can see what happened. The waves went right into the living room. It is really the haves versus the have-nots. But this is, Wolf, only one of 79 towns and cities in Massachusetts that are in this coastal surge zone. And so, protecting all of them would cost tens of billions of dollars right now. So, these very hard conversations are taking place, even along here, where the head of the community organization that raises money doesn't -- he told me he doesn't believe in climate change. He thinks that this is just bad luck and that it'll be clear sailing from here on. Other neighbors aren't so sure and are thinking about the long-term prospects of at this current rate. You can see waves going up over and across this very thin little island into the wetlands on the other side.",

They're really hopeful that the state helps them out because a lot of their sand ended up on the state side of the beach there.
