I'm Jake Tapper.In Des Moines, Iowa, our breaking news this hour, at any moment we're going to hear from President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Ukrainian leader today's in the nation's capital to try and secure additional aid for his war torn country, which is badly needed to fend off the attack by Russia. It's a tall order, billions of dollars in aid are tied up in Congress with lawmakers at something at an impasse over funding for border security, which Republicans have insisted be added to the package. Zelenskyy today met with top lawmakers from both sides of the aisle including the brand new House speaker, Mike Johnson from Louisiana. Many Republican holdouts who met with Zelenskyy say a deal remains unlikely in their minds were not changed. Let's go straight to CNN's MJ Lee who was at the White House for us. And MJ, what are we expecting here from the two leaders beyond just a pitch to get this money from Congress to Ukraine?",

I think White House officials and U.S. officials have made the point that this visit is about so much more than the issue of U.S. funding for Ukraine, which clearly on Capitol Hill right now stands at an impasse.They are saying that the world is watching right now, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that this is a kind of visit that can send a message to the world at such a critical moment in this conflict about the U.S. is continuing steadfast support for Ukraine, and that there is another -- I'm going to toss it back to you Jake.",

Russia has failed, failed thus far in trying to erase Ukraine from the map, and subsume it into Russia. Ukraine has taken back more than 50 percent of his territory seized since February of '22.And it's pushed back Russian -- the Russian Navy, so Ukraine can export grain and steel to the world through the Black Sea. And thanks to the incredible courage of the Ukrainian people and the bipartisan support from our Congress, but it's not just American support, there are more than 50 countries, 50 countries helping Ukraine with military, economic and humanitarian assistance, 50. The burden sharing, the U.S. has put up $75 billion and our allies and partners have put up $100 billion. And more than 90 percent of our security assistance to Ukraine is being spent in the United States to provide weapons for Ukraine, and replenish our stockpiles and build our industrial base.

In this, we gain victory on the sea. We've destroyed ships of the Russian Federation, we throw the remnants of their plate to Russian territorial waters. Yes, they have some scene in the Black Sea, in the vicinity of our temporarily occupied Crimea, but we are going to proceed this activity. Our guys destroyed 20,000s of Wagner mercenaries. These are serious terrorists who were messing everywhere on African continent in Syria. In Ukraine, there were a lot of mass and nucleus of these touristic organization is not existing anymore. Yes, we had a lot of problems, but nonetheless, we were able to do this. Moreover, Russia, were not able to seize any part of our territory, any village, any town, I'm not talking about large cities, and we are going to proceed with it. It is goes without saying that we have objectively have clear plan, but if you allow me, I am not able to tell you (inaudible) on the details of 2024 operations.
