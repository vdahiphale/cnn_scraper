I'm Phil Matting with Poppy Harlow in New York. It's the top of the hour. And right now, we are tracking a monster winter storm as it pummeled the northeast with heavy snow, powerful wind and coastal flooding. More than 30 million people are in its path.

      "sentences": "Yes, good morning, Poppy. Well, the landscape here in Manhattan in New York City is being transformed right before our eyes. It's a winter snow globe.We are at Columbus Circle and I want to just have my cameraman look down. This is normally a very busy exit and entrance to Columbus Circle and the subway underground. And that is just not the case, assuming that people here are just listening to the advice of the mayor, stay at home, perhaps work remotely if they can. You know, I get the sense that people are almost yearning for a snowstorm because it has been so long since New York City and many of the East Coast cities have had a significant storm. We're contending with one of the warmest winters on record. And you have to go back to January 2022 since the last time that a winter storm warning was issued here where I'm located in New York City. This is extremely heavy, wet snow. You don't have to look hard. You can just squeeze out the available water. We call this a one to eight- inch liquid to snow ratio. Basically what that means is it's very, very heavy, difficult to plow, exhausting to shovel. So, be very careful. There have been 700 salt trucks deployed across the city already before that first snowflake even fell this morning. I want to get straight to the graphics, talk about what has happened and what's to come. We believe that the snow actually came a little earlier than anticipated. We expected a little bit of rain to start off this forecast this morning, but that was not the case. I stepped outside my hotel this morning and it was already snowing those big chunky, chunky wet snowflakes. And as we zoom in a little closer, that I-95 corridor from New York all the way down to Philadelphia, seeing that transition already take place. So, that could increase our snowfall totals. And we could see more snow today alone than we have seen in the past couple of years on any given day here in New York City. Five to eight inches, that's the official forecast for the New York City area, Central New Jersey and into Long Island as well. This storm will enter and peak during rush hour, as you can see directly behind me here in Columbus Circle, but it will exit just as quickly as it entered into the equation. So, you know, a lot of the public schools here have been canceled, actually changed over to remote learning. I guess, Poppy and Phil, if I was a child, I think I'd feel a little bit cheated this morning because, you know, you still have to learn today and don't --",

If you look in the Senate at who supported this, you know, they fundamentally believe that in terms of America's national security, what happens in Ukraine matters to the United States.People like Senator Joni Ernst, for instance, of Iowa with a military background, that is some of whom supported this bill. And then also at play is the Trump factor. Many of these lawmakers, they're weighing how much they want to distance themselves from Trump. We know that Trump has been a vocal opponent for a long time of foreign aid. So, here's what's in the bill, $60 billion to Ukraine, $14 billion to Israel, $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, over $4 billion to the Indo-Pacific. Now, Speaker Mike Johnson, he already said that this is dead on arrival in the Senate. He said he won't put this foreign aid supplemental on the floor, because it is silent, those are his words, silent on provisions on the southern border. But as you all well know, there was a bipartisan border deal on the table that House Republicans could have adopted. They rejected that. And so, you know, we are really now in uncharted territory here. He argues that America has to secure its own border before sending additional foreign aid around the world. He rejected Democrats' significant concession. So, all that to say right now, $95 billion in foreign aid, we don't know what the state of that will be. We do know, of course, that at their disposal, Republicans could band together with Democrats in the House in a procedural fashion in order to advance this bill, but that could take quite a deal of time. And, really, these -- Israel, Ukraine, they would argue they don't have time at this stage, Phil and Poppy.",

And, of course, one of the things that we know is that Ukrainians obviously have been watching all of this meticulously, because for them, they say that all this is obviously about survival.I want to read you some of what President Zelenskyy just tweeted relatively a couple minutes ago after this news came out, he says, for us in Ukraine, continued U.S. assistance helps to save human lives from Russian terror, as he puts it. It means that life will continue in our cities and will triumph over war, is what he says. So, obviously, the Ukrainians very happy with this. They, of course, also understand that there is still a long way to go. And in the House of Representatives, there could be some serious issues. And, you know, I've been traveling the frontlines in Ukraine over the past month, month and a half or so. And the thing is that U.S. assistance is absolutely key in so many of those places. It's about weapons, of course. We did a lot of reporting about the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle playing a huge role in defending some of those Ukrainian cities where the Russians are pushing. But the other thing, of course, is also ammunition as well for the Ukrainians. They face a big deficit. And, of course, now that's already become even worse with some of that U.S. aid being delayed. I was actually yesterday able to speak to both a German chancellor and the prime minister of Denmark about this issue, about U.S. assistance. And the German Chancellor, he told me, look, there's absolutely no two ways about it. U.S. assistance to Ukraine is indispensable. The Europeans are saying that they are ramping up, for instance, their ammo production. They're looking to get the Ukrainians more tanks and other weapons as well. But, of course, they also say that assistance from the U.S. has been so key so far and they hope will be in the future. Of course, a lot of them also still reeling from some of those remarks that former President Trump made about possibly not helping NATO allies and, in fact, possibly encouraging Russia to take it to NATO allies. And Olaf Scholz, I can tell you, was not very happy with those comments. He said that NATO is absolutely indispensable for Europe.

They have been really vocal, Senator Hawley, Senator Vance, Senator Lee, many others, they've been really vocally opposing him. Traditionally, senators that went up against Mitch McConnell, who, to be clear, still holds the purse strings in terms of fundraising for Republicans, they've been sort of quiet about their disagreements. But in recent days, they've really been vocally against this foreign aid. But McConnell and the other Republicans that supported this, they say, listen, this is a matter of national security.

Then they're going to have to make the big decisions.First, do they issue a stay, meaning a pause, putting everything on hold, and if so, for how long? And then the real big decision, does the Supreme Court take the case? If they reject this case, or if they summarily dismiss it, then, in all likelihood, we will see this case go to trial late spring, early summer. But if the Supreme Court takes this case, Phil, all bets are off and there's a fairly good chance we don't see this case tried until after the election.

He's going to say, well, we've now heard from the trial court judge and then three court of appeals judges, all of them agreed. All of them were very strong on the fact that Donald Trump does not have immunity. What Donald Trump says in his brief yesterday, first of all is, this is why we have you, Supreme Court, because this is a massive issue. It goes to presidential powers. It goes to the functioning of the government. One thing that Donald Trump does is he actually quotes Jack Smith. Because remember, two months ago, Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to take this case directly. And Jack Smith in that brief said, hey, Supreme Court, only you can resolve this case.
