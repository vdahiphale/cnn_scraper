A source tells CNN that investigators in New York are looking into his finances as well amid real questions about the more than $700,000 in loans he extended to his 2020 campaign -- 2022 campaign. He is now being labeled as a con man in a new piece published by a former congressman who represented his district in Long Island, the same district that has now elected Santos. Democrat Steve Israel writes, quote, \"Politicians embellish resumes. If that were a crime, every candidate in America would be in prison. But Santos' lies are an assault on democratic norms. The Republicans should have vetted Santos. The Democrats should have checked him out more thoroughly. The media should have as well.\" So, Steve Israel joins us now. He is the director of the Cornell Institute of Politics and Global Affairs. Good morning, Congressman. Thank you for being with us. STEVE ISRAEL, (D) FORMER NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN, SANTOS ELECTED IN DISTRICT HE ONCE SERVED, DIRECTOR, CORNELL INSTITUTE OF POLITICAL AND GLOBAL AFFAIRS (via Webex by Cisco):  Thank you.",

There will be a congressional Ethics Committee investigation. There is likely to be an Office of Congressional Ethics investigation in the independent professional office. The real tragedy here is that the people of Long Island and, honestly, the American people expect that a member of Congress will be sworn in and immediately begin thinking about constituents' problems. This guy is going to be sworn in and the focus on his legal problems -- he'll be focused on a Nassau County district attorney's investigation, New York State attorney general investigation, federal investigations. And that, ultimately, is such a disservice to the people who voted for him and even those who didn't.

Then you have the issue -- your very good point -- about whether deficiencies in Democratic opposition research. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which I chaired for four years -- they did the opposition research. They found the red flags. They turned it over to Mr. Santos' opponent, Robert Zimmerman. He did try and raise those red flags with many in the local media, and that's where complacency comes in. The judgment was we're not going to report on this guy because he can't win. This is a Democratic district. Biden would have won it by eight points. So he's just not a story.

They say parents' resistance to vaccinating their children not just for COVID, for other deadly diseases could be triggering the spread of measles. Columbus has seen the largest measles outbreak in 20 years. They have 82 cases there and all of them involve those younger than 18. A majority of cases are in children under the age of three. Forty percent of the children infected are currently in the hospital. So I'm glad to be joined this morning by the Columbus public health commissioner, Dr. Mysheika Roberts. Dr. Roberts, thank you. I wanted to do this story because as a parent of little ones, I was terrified when I saw these numbers. Why is this happening there? DR. MYSHEIKA ROBERTS, HEALTH COMMISSIONER, COLUMBUS PUBLIC HEALTH (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, we've always had a population, or a segment of our population that has been resistant to vaccine -- childhood vaccines. Many of them just don't want to put chemical -- or what they are concerned about chemicals in their children's body. But a lot of them feel like it's not needed because they don't see those infections in our community. But what they don't understand that we don't see those infections in our community because our vaccine efforts have been so successful. And so, when one family chooses not to vaccinate their children, they put the rest of the community at risk.",

And from 2019 to now, the amount of people who are saying children should be required to get the MMR vaccine -- for example, who go to school -- is down 11 percent.Do you believe, Doctor, this is tied to mandates for the COVID vaccination for many or just fear, in general -- unfounded, but fear of the COVID vaccination among some? Is that making this worse?",
