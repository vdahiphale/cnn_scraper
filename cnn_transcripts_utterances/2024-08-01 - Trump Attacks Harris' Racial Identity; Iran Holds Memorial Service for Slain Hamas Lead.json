And Kamala Harris, being a woman of color, particularly a black woman, is going to receive an overwhelming amount of support from black voters.Now, right when Donald Trump wanted you to believe that this was a genuine effort by his campaign and Republicans to try to court black men, what you saw today at the NABJ showed you his true colors. He is not focused on garnering enough support. He went there and disrespected a black woman. And that is the worst thing you can do if you want black men to support you. So what the campaign for Harris, for president, has got to continue to do is to talk about her record, talk about her commitments, and talk about the results that the Biden-Harris administration has delivered, particularly to black men. As we hear, Rosemary, we're dealing with a country where unemployment in this country is at an all-time low, particularly for black voters and especially black men. Black men in this country are creating more small businesses at a faster rate than they ever have. And then black men are direct recipients at historically black colleges and universities because of the money that Biden and the Harris administration has delivered. So ultimately, it all comes down to the economy. And I think the economy for black men in this country is moving in the right direction. And we're going to have a very robust discussion about that very soon. CHURCH: So what is Trump saying to black men that has some of them convinced they want to vote for him and do you think they may reconsider that, given what they heard him say about Harris, insulting Kamala Harris, attacking her black identity?

When Kamala Harris goes and talks to sororities and goes to talk to black churches and black leaders, she's respectful. She answers a tough question. Donald Trump today did the opposite. He disrespected these black journalists. He cut the time short from the onset. He was very combative. But it all comes down to the economy. And I know there's a black man talking to you today, Rosemary. We want to make sure that we do everything we can to protect and provide for our families. And so I think it's got to be an economic message that the Democrats have got to focus on, because that's what Donald Trump wants us to believe. But the Trump economy was not better than the Biden economy.

And this is a case that stretches out over more than two decades. KSM was captured in Pakistan in 2003, along with several co- defendants, and then held in CIA black sites, and then in Guantanamo Bay for years. He was arraigned and charged back in 2008 with a number of charges, including conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, and much more. But from that point on, the case itself began to drag out, first in a debate over whether it should be a military trial or in U.S. civilian courts, and then questions about torture that Mohammed faced as he was held at those CIA secret prisons in the early 2000s, and whether evidence obtained during that time would be admissible in court. All of that delayed the trial that was finally set to begin in 2021 before it was delayed once again with the resignation of two judges, and then the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. And that brings us to where we are now. For two years now, the U.S. has been pursuing the possibility of a plea deal with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his two co-defendants, that announcement coming now. The plea deal itself allows the U.S. to avoid what would have been a very long and complicated death penalty trial, and it makes sure that KSM will remain in prison for the rest of his life. One open question is, where will he serve out that term along with his co-defendants? It has been a major point of the Biden administration to try to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. They have repatriated over the past several years a number of the detainees held there, but there are still dozens left, and that process seems to be a long way out. So at least for now, it seems a possibility that KSM will remain at that facility. But long term, that's certainly one question we'll look to have answered. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon.

Similar language was used before the April 13 historic overt and direct missile and drone attack by Iran against Israel.

The authoritarian leader filed an appeal on Wednesday as he looks to extend his grip on power. Speaking to reporters, he warned against what he called North American imperialism and vowed to keep fighting.The opposition is calling for supporters to mobilize over the declared results. They claim their candidate roundly defeated Maduro at the ballot box. But the country's electoral body has not released the full tallies from Sunday's vote. More than a thousand people have been detained in the nationwide protests since then. Still to come, a record-breaking night for Leon Marchand, the French swimmer, winning gold not once but twice and quickly becoming the talk of the Paris Games. We're back in just a moment.

It's been a really thunderstormy start to day six here in Paris, but I have to say that was nothing compared to the tidal wave of talent we saw hit the swimming pool last night.So often in sport, we overuse the word legend, don't we? But it is a word that is more than apt when it comes to talking about Katie Ledecky, the U.S. swimmer. She said she was disappointed with her showing in the 400 meters freestyle, but she more than made up for it in the 1,500 last night, the event that she has made her own. She set a new Olympic record. She finished seven seconds faster than the time she posted to win gold in Tokyo three years ago, her eighth Olympic gold medal in all. I mean, so far ahead of the rest of the field that they almost had to adjust the camera settings to get the rest of the swimmers in. And this is what she had to say afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATIE LEDECKY, U.S. SWIMMER: You know, any gold medal is, it's not easy to win. So just, I'm just trying to appreciate it, appreciate the moment. And I mean, I don't mean to celebrate that much, but it comes out, you know, just the happiness and the joy, it just comes out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That is exactly what France's newest superstar, Leon Marchand, did, something that even Michael Phelps never tried. In the space of two hours, he took gold in the 200 meter fly, had the medal ceremony, got the medal around his neck, went back in the pool and he did exactly the same in the 200 meters breaststroke as well. The atmosphere inside that pool was absolutely incredible.And he and Ledecky both hoping for even more success before the end of the Games. That's something, though, that is not going to happen for Rafa Nadal. Of course, the tennis legend, he and his Spanish teammate, Carlos Alcaraz, were beaten by the U.S. pair of Krychek and Rahm last night. But Nadal has said he hasn't confirmed that that was definitely his last match here in Paris. He has left the door open potentially for more action to come. Just as you rightly mentioned, though, the other thing to bring you up to date with, with what is happening today, Simone Biles back in action in the all around event. It's the first time actually that two former Olympic champions are going head-to-head. Biles, who won gold in 2016. Suni Lee, you rightly mentioned, who took the gold in Tokyo. But both of those two very much the favorites in terms of taking home another top prize for Team USA.",

Emergency crews worked for 20 minutes to free the boy named Bentley using a makeshift catch pole similar to those used to wrangle dogs that allowed them to lift the boy out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BLAKE, BENTLEY'S FATHER: I can't imagine what she thought whenever she saw him fall because for all she knew it was a sewer line, it was full of water or it was 50 feet deep. I mean, she had no idea. By the grace of God, that boy was carried down that hole by an angel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
