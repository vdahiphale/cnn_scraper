And adding to the drama of today, as you mentioned, John, is that this will be broadcast live. Unlike past hearings for Trump, his federal hearings and his New York charges, this will be broadcast. And, initially, Wednesday was expected to be a really busy day, with several hours of arraignment hearings. But as of 1:30 yesterday, all of these 19 co-defendants had waived their arraignment and pleaded not guilty. So, instead, today's main event will go down at 1:00 p.m., with Judge Scott McAfee considering motions from former pro-Trump attorney Ken Chesebro and former campaign attorney Sidney Powell in their efforts to sever not only their case from the other co-defendants, but from each other. It was last week that Chesebro's attorneys filed a motion saying that he should not have to be tried alongside Sidney Powell. Both are asking for a speedy trial, by the way, that he should not be -- have to -- tried next to Sidney Powell because they're not accused of operating the same scheme. Meanwhile, Powell's attorneys are arguing that Powell, the only way that -- for her to receive a fair trial is for her to be charged alone, so both of these individuals asking for speedy trials. You know that the former president, along with Ray Smith and John Eastman, former Trump attorneys, they're asking for a delay in their trial. The judge also today will consider and will be expected to ask, I should say, Fani Willis, how long it will take prosecutors to try all of these defendants together, or if their cases are divided. So, a big test today for Fulton County's district attorney, Fani Willis -- John.",

They -- the DA certainly can go. Whether the defendants are going to be ready to go and have time to analyze the two terabytes of evidence is going to be a different story. I know that the DA filed a motion a week or two ago saying that she really had no obligation to give it to them until 10 days before trial. But Judge McAfee has entered a scheduling order, at least for Mr. Chesebro, making the discovery disclosures due within a couple of weeks, on September the 20th. So they will have some time to analyze it, but at least two defendants think they will have ample time and can go to trial before the November 3 deadline.",

The parties will likely come up with jury questionnaires that are sent out in writing where they can do some selection of jurors, they can automatically bounce out people or do some investigation, just social media posts, if they're public, and see if they have come out on one side or the other. That can be a pretty effective tool to weed out people that are just automatically disqualified because they have strong feelings one way or the other.
