This hour as vice president Kamala Harris campaigns in a key battleground state, I'll be joined by one of her possible vice presidential contenders. Plus a tech billionaire going all in for the Harris campaign who is suggesting she should make a major change if she wins in November. Plus new exclusive reporting on what happened behind the scenes as the U.S. Supreme Court debated whether Donald Trump could be immune from criminal prosecution.And leading this hour, a failure on multiple levels, that's how the acting head of the U.S. Secret Service detail what happened with security protocol calls and the hours and minutes before the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. Ronald Rowe testified during a contentious hearing before Senate lawmakers earlier today. He admitted that even though local officers warned about a man with a gun on a nearby roof, that information never made it to the U.S. Secret Service or to Trump's personal security detail. Rowe also promised that people will be held accountable once the multiple investigations into what happened had been completed. CNN's Whitney Wild starts off our coverage of this hour with more details on how the U.S. Secret Service is working to try to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RONALD ROWE JR., ACTING SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR: You're asking me, senator, to completely make a rush to judgment about somebody failing. I acknowledge this was a failure of the Secret Service -- SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Is it not prima facie that somebody has failed. The former president was shot. WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A fierce exchange between Senator Josh Hawley and Acting Secret Service Director Ron Rowe as Hawley pushed for more accountability after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.",
