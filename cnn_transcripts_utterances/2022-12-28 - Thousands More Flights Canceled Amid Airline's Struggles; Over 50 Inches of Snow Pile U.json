The blizzard has already claimed more than 30 lives in Erie County and that number is likely to grow as emergency crews reach people they couldn't get to before. One of those victims is a 22-year-old woman who was found dead over the weekend after getting trapped in her car. This is the last known video that Anndel Taylor recorded while still alive.

That is a significant decrease from $3.99 this year. To put this in real terms, if they're right, this would translate to families spending almost $300 less on fuel than they did in 2022.The bad news though is that gas prices could get back above the dreaded $4 level this spring and summer as people drive more and refineries switch over to summer fuel. That summer gas is better for air quality but it also costs more to produce. And GasBuddy is projecting that the national average will climb from $3.10 a gallon today to as high as $4.05 a gallon in May and could even hit $4.25 in August. That is uncomfortably high.

For example, if Russia's oil flows gets interrupted, or a hurricane knocked out key facilities, gas prices could surge. On the other hand, if the economy stumbles and ends up going into a recession, you could see gas prices stay low.Thankfully GasBuddy is not expecting a return to the $5 gas that we saw in June. Patrick De Haan from GasBuddy he told me that $5 gas, that is improbable, though he conceded it's not impossible. Remember, five dollars gas crushed consumers and it set off recession fears. Of course, since then prices have plunged and they're currently sitting at 18-month lows which is pretty incredible given everything that's happened. Hopefully after a year of painfully high prices at the gas pump and at the grocery store, 2023 brings some lasting relief to consumers -- Bianca. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And now we have the decree from President Putin. I wouldn't say it quite lives up to the rhetoric. There's not a lot of teeth in this one.The actual wording if you read it says, any contract where the sale is directly or indirectly provided for the use could affect price maybe suggests you could have a contract where it doesn't mention it even if the price is under the limit. Plus, it's temporary, it comes into force in February and expires in July of next year. And there's a clause in the decree that the president any time he wants potentially can grant a waiver, can allow a sale to go through. You know, even if it violates the terms of the decree and goes under the price cap. So clearly, I think Russia does not want to shoot itself in the foot and cut off its oil exports at a time when it is ramping up its military spending. I think that's clear. And it also shows that perhaps the G7 and the EU plan is working the way they set the price cap at the level in which they set it.

For example, he says, I have a problem with my spine. It is clear what one has to do to make the problem worse, keep me immobile as much as possible.
