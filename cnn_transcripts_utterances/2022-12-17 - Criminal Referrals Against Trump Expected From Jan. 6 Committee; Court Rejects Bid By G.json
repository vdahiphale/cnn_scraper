And we begin this hour with a former president of the United States facing the prospect of what could be unprecedented criminal charges.The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol is expected to refer at least three criminal charges against Donald Trump. And they'll be making those referrals to the Justice Department including -- among the charges, insurrection. We will hear the panel's final recommendations during its last hearing on Monday. And in a statement a spokesman for Trump criticized the committee calling it a kangaroo court and saying the hearings are \"a stain on this country's history.\" CNN's Annie Grayer joining us now. So, Annie, what more are you learning about these referrals?",

We're cities are bracing for what's expected to be a huge surge of migrants. A federal appeals court rejecting a republican-led challenge to keep Title 42 intact. That policy was enacted by the Trump administration citing health concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. If the U.S. Supreme Court does not act the policy will expire on Wednesday. Meaning, many of the migrants waiting and makeshift campsites in Mexico along the border could attempt to enter the U.S. would attempt to be processed at the border crossings. Well, CNN's Ed Lavandera has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It's 39 degrees and getting colder. This is Roberto Cordoba's first night sleeping on the El Paso streets. He says he's never experienced anything close to homelessness. He left Cuba last month and is hoping to get to Miami soon. He says this is the first time in his life he's ever had to spend the night on the street and he feels completely lost. A thin pair of New York Giants socks and unlaced shoes won't be enough to get through the frigid night. Everything that he's wearing now, the jackets and the heavy clothing was donated people who have dropped it off here. Roberto hopes there's something else to keep him warm.

Of course, officials here have been preparing for some time knowing that this Trump era policy that was set during the pandemic would end at some point.But it took on new meaning after that judge last month said that the program needed to end by December 21st. Now, as mentioned earlier last night and appeals court blocked this GOP-led effort from several states to try to keep the program in place. And a White House spokesperson reacted after that decision saying that they are planning these robust efforts to try to manage the border when Title 42 is lifted. The spokesperson said to be clear the lifting of Title 42 Public Health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading misinformation to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants. We will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws and work to expand illegal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration. Now for some time now, the Department of Homeland Security has been preparing for this possibility. They released a bit of their plan earlier this week which includes surging personnel and resources down to the border to help with some of this processing. They are also creating some temporary facilities that would help process those migrants in addition to trying to ramp up ground and air transportation as Ed mentioned, to try to transport and process and remove these migrants. But right now, the Biden administration is certainly facing a challenge in the coming days. And one thing that they have asked congress for is more than $3 billion of border security funding in preparation for Title 42. But ultimately, when you talk to officials here, they feel that the answer to fixing these problems is comprehensive immigration reform and they've urged congress to act on that. Of course, over the years there have been many efforts to try to get immigration reform done, but it hasn't quite gotten across the finish line. But certainly, this administration is staring down a very steep challenge coming this Wednesday and, in the weeks, ahead.",

Yes, the first week of winter this week as the astronomical winter season kicks off, and it's going to feel like it for a lot of people.You have that cold air already in place across portions of the northern tier. And we're still dealing with some of the lingering snow showers that don't want to seem to leave, especially across areas of Maine and New Hampshire and Massachusetts. You also have some lake-effect snow for portions of Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan as that wind continues to remain strong. Now, in most of these areas, widespread snowfalls likely still to pick up an additional two to six inches. But the heaviest amounts going forward are going to be in those lake-effect bands across Upstate New York and Pennsylvania where even as much as a foot of additional snow is still possible in the coming hours. We talked about that cold air in place across the northern tier, but it's really going to spread out and south in the coming days. Really, by the time we get to the end of the week at some point, about 80 percent of the population is looking at temperatures at or below the freezing mark. So that just goes to show you how many people will likely be impacted. Now we talked about it starts in the north. Take Fargo, for example. The high temperature on Sunday, four degrees. But it gets even colder than that. Look at Tuesday. The high temperature is only expected to be  minus-five. When you factor in the wind, that windchill will likely be around that minus-25 range, so very bitter cold. Frostbite at those kinds of temperatures can set in in less than 30 minutes. Once it starts here, it will continue to spread off to the east. So even some southern cities, say, like Atlanta, for example, into the 50s on Thursday. But then the bottom drops out. By the time we get to Friday, those high temperatures are only expected to be into the mid-20s. And then it begins to stretch even farther south. Florida also being impacted once we get toward next weekend. So, again, those colder temperatures, Fred, will start to filter in, not just for the usual places but also some other areas as well.",

It's those types of events that remind us, regardless of what the calendar says, December, January, February, that these tornados can occur in December. In fact, we get about 30 to 35 tornados across the United States on average in December. And we've already exceeded that number this December.

And that's exactly what climate change is doing. It's helping to alter the probability that we see these severe weather events like tornados. Now, it's not the only factor, right. We could still roll a 12 if we didn't change a five to a six. But it's changing that. And it's also a change in what we humans do. Our cities are growing larger, right?
