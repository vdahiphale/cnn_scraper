I can also imagine it being more potent in Senate races because they have the critical role of confirming judges playing a big role in this. So it may be that there are certain types of races where this issue plays a bigger effect than others.

I promise you, if it's a state where there isn't abortion on the ballot and abortion is legal, it'll be all about what could happen if control changes in Congress. If it's a state like Arizona, where there's a ballot initiative and a restrictive law, it's going to be as much about what's happening in the state as what's happening nationally.

But in talking to political consultants, strategists, all folks who consult celebrities, they say, look, there's a lot of wariness and trepidation because of the hyper polarized political landscape and because of the disapproval over the Israel-Hamas war. I mean, in December, Mariah Carey, who just had a pit stop at the White House for a Christmas celebration, her post was flooded with comments on the Israel-Hamas war and the fact that she was even affiliated with the president at all. And it is that type of risk that some celebrities just don't want to take. Now, will they mobilize around issues? Many of them say sure they're going to mobilize around abortion and climate change.

I mean, all -- right now, Biden is having issues with young voters, as Priscilla said. And black voters and Hispanic voters. So if he's able to get that type of permission structure created by getting these celebrities out, it could influence some of them. I think that some of that influence is a bit overstated when it comes to, you know, these voters.

There's actually been a number of academic like longitudinal studies on this believe it or not. And like the answer is, nobody really does. Celebrity endorsements make a big difference we know in brands like for products, for consumer products, they do make a difference on issues advocacy, if you're talking about climate change, if you're talking about abortion, if you're talking about AI.
