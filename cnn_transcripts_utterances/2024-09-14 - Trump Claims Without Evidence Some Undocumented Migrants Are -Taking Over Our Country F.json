I'm Fredricka Whitfield.With just over 50 days until the election, the race for the White House is entering a critical phase. Today, former President Trump and his running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, are campaigning in key battleground states. In the last 24 hours, Trump has spent his time lashing out at the Nasdaq, promoting another baseless claim that Harris had an earpiece in at their debate. Trump continues to claim with zero evidence that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio are eating people's pets, and, he said, migrants are taking over the country from within. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm angry about Venezuelan gangs taking over Aurora, Colorado. And I'm angry about illegal Haitian migrants taking over Springfield, Ohio. You see that mess, don't you? The Venezuelans have big AK-47 Supremes. There's a Supreme. Where the hell do they get these guns? Our soldiers can't get these guns. They're taking over our country from within. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Instead, though, Donald Trump veered off script repeatedly. He spent a lot of time rehashing Tuesday night's debate. And part of that, as part of that, he went on this whole discussion about whether or not Kamala Harris was wearing an earpiece. Now, this is a baseless claim that has been kind of percolating on the far-right corners of the internet and something that Donald Trump had been promoting.

But the reason that this is so notable is because this is the latest in a string of conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been promoting really ever since Harris replace Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.It also comes as many Republicans and people close to Donald Trump are telling me that they are concerned about his relationship with the far-right conspiracy theorist, Laura Loomer. She's someone who has promoted conspiracies about 9/11. She once called it an inside job. And she traveled with Donald Trump this week from Florida to New York to Philadelphia for the debate. She also went with him to New York. And the reason I'm bringing this up is because when I talk to people close to Trump, his allies, people even within his campaign, they argue that she is behind some of these conspiracy theories. Now, we actually did hear Donald Trump address some of this yesterday in a social media post. He tried to distance himself a bit from Loomer's positions. I'm going to read for you just very quickly some of what he wrote. He said, quote, \"Laura Loomer doesn't work for the campaign. She's a private citizen and longtime supporter. I disagree with the statement she made, but like many millions of people who support me, she is tired of watching the radical left Marxist and fascist violently attack and spear me.\" So there you see, it's unclear which statements he was saying he disagrees with, but trying to distance himself a bit from Laura Loomer, although, of course, he continues to say that she's a strong supporter and that he likes her.

All right, so let's talk about the Harris campaign right now. Going to be planning more stops in red and rural counties to attract swing voters. What do you make of that strategy? LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, CHICAGO SUN-TIMES: What I make of the strategy is that the Harris campaign has the resources, both cash and volunteers, to go everywhere with still some 50 days left to the campaign. They don't have to make a lot of super hard choices in dealing with the battleground states. And the voter segments are reaching out to, because at this point, they could do everything on their checklist. Reach out to Latinos, do more reaching out to black voters, do more with women, do more with students. They have this strategic advantage right now. And as we can see, they're using it.",

According to a lot of reports, the Russians have moved a lot of their aircraft away from the range of the missiles that we're talking about. And that range is basically about 200 miles from launch. So that would mean that any area that the Ukrainians would be able to cover with this may or may not have the aircraft that President Zelenskyy was talking about, but it certainly has the airfields that he wants to, in essence, attack. So that would be one area that would be positive to go, you know, after this, you know, use these missiles and have that range of attack capability.

And it's very clear that the Ukrainians were not only able to capture some Russian territory, but they did force the Russians to really reposition some of their troops.Now, the main Ukrainian goal in terms of tactical military issues of forcing Russian soldiers from the eastern front to the Kursk region to defend that area, that has not been achieved at this particular point. But there are other things that the Ukrainians did achieve, the fact that they were able to come in, they've set up what amounts to a civil military government in these areas. All of that is very positive for Ukraine, and that can certainly show that the Ukrainians have the capability to do some incursions like this and potentially leverage these gains when it comes to future peace or ceasefire negotiations. WHITFIELD: And, you know, Colonel, I don't know if you saw any of Christiane Amanpour's interviews with some of the Ukrainian soldiers who were being treated in the medic on, you know, the train and many of them were saying they don't have enough arsenal. Is it your concern that more arsenal, whether it be from the U.S. or the U.K., can get there soon enough?",

And that is that, you know, when you look at the resources compare them between Ukraine and Russia, it's very clear that the Russians have far more resources in terms of troops, in terms of munitions, and that is what Ukraine is fighting against.So the U.S. and its NATO allies have to really ramp up the logistical support and make sure that every single thing that they promised Ukraine gets to Ukraine so that it can be used very quickly. That also not only includes the munitions, it includes the training to use those munitions, because one thing that the Ukrainians have to do is save their manpower. It's essential that they save their manpower in order to survive as a country.",

Many of them saying that Colonel Patterson bragged about beating past investigations that he'd been investigated as many as six or seven times and -- and had beaten every single one. So it really impacted the trust they had in leadership and taking this seriously.

The units report to their state's governor, but they also report to the National Guard Bureau and the Pentagon back in D.C., and so there seems to be some lack of clarity over who really is responsible for overseeing these and enforcing accountability in these organizations.",
