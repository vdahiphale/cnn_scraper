In a court filing, Trump's attorneys said he can't find an insurance company to underwrite the nearly half-billion-dollar bond. He needs to pay the bond as part of a New York civil fraud judgment against him. Trump and his organization, you might recall, were found liable for fraud, conspiracy, and issuing false business records. Trump's attorneys quoted an insurance broker saying the bond was a, quote, practical impossibility. CNN's Kara Scannell. She joins us now live with the story. So, Kara, Trump's attorneys are revealing that this is a real significant challenge for them. This as he tries to appeal that decision. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENTThey only want Trump to put up cash or stocks. And that is something that Trump is unable to do. So one of his attorneys said that that limitation, that inability to take any real estate, is a major obstacle that they faced in trying to get a bond. So as you say, though, this is as Trump is trying to persuade an appeals court judge to say he doesn't have to post the bond because he has the properties that he could ultimately turn over or sell to satisfy this judgment. We're expecting a decision by the appeals court by the end of this month. The New York attorney general's office has opposed. Trump's request, and they have said that they're ready to move forward to seize assets if Trump does not come up with this money. Ultimately, the next step here, though, is for the appeals court to rule on whether they will give Trump breathing room. Boris.",

And one thing I really want to point out here is that this is the kind of rhetoric that Donald Trump has been using during his campaign for the last several years, talking about bloodbath, talking about revenge. Not necessarily all about political violence, but just the way he talks in general, talking, he talks in a dark manner. But now people are starting to pay attention because now he is the Republican nominee.So what we heard was an actual clarification of the remarks, which is not something that we usually get from the former president. He posted to True Social, once again, saying that these comments were about the auto industry, saying that the media fully understood that he was simply referring to imports allowed by, quote, crooked Joe Biden, which are killing the automobile industry. Then he went on to say the United Auto Workers, who, of course, we know he has been courting the rank and file for their votes, but not their leadership, fully understand what I mean. Talking about the word bloodbath, I want to bring up here is when I'm talking to his campaign, they know they've entered a new cycle now. All of the things that Donald Trump used to say and has been saying are under the microscope. This is how Donald Trump talks. And they're going to have to figure out how to deal with that. I want to play another moment for you in which he essentially said or praised those who have been charged for their actions on January 6th. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Donald Trump is in a general election and he is the Republican nominee. So he is showing what he is giving voters as a choice. If he were to be elected. The other thing that he talked about was how he doesn't view migrants and people coming to this country, specifically criminals, as people. Again, language that we have heard or at least similar language that we have heard from Donald Trump before. But this is all changing given the fact that he is now the Republican nominee. We are setting up a general election. As you said, he is giving essentially sound bites to the Biden campaign. To say, is this who you want to vote for? And his campaign is going to have to contend with that now. Because it is no longer him talking about this stuff in a silo.

It's something that he's worked on in the past. And his life as a politico. But as you mentioned, since then, a lot has happened. He was charged with several financial crimes and pardoned by former President Trump.Now, part of this stems from the fact that Donald Trump himself likes Paul Manafort. And he has talked about him a number of occasions. But sources would not get into specifics as to what exactly he would do. I had one source float to me it might be around fundraising with the convention, trying to raise money, trying to separate him from the campaign. But multiple sources saying nothing had been finally decided yet. All that they would really double down on is the fact that he is in fact in conversations about how to help Trump's reelection campaign.",

While they were running to their safe house, to their safe area, to their secure areas, we were fighting for our lives, especially myself in the tunnel, where roughly 30 to 40 officers held the line against thousands and thousands of people who were trying to breach the entrance, where they normally go to be safe. And that's very disappointing. As I mentioned, they continue to support somebody who continue to flirt with political violence, continue to say things that are outrageous, that any other political official would be disqualified for. Somebody who talks about bedlam (ph), somebody who talks about American carnage, just like he started with his inaugural speech, that's how he ended his, four-year term with American violence and the Capitol, the doorstep, where those political officials were running for their lives.

      "sentences": "Boris, it's incredibly unpredictable. And one of the things that stood out to us over the weekend is it seemed to be a bit of a calming state. You know, things quieted down and we were able to get out and to see different aspects of the city within the curfew time and once curfew hit, of course, we had to get back. It all changed though in the early morning hours today. We got a call from a security source who warned us of gangs attacking two affluent neighborhoods and we're making our way closer to where we are. So it's about three miles right now, those gunshots now. It sounds like just a few gunshots we're hearing just off from where we are.And that's actually where those clashes are still happening. You may be able to hear them, but they're faint right now. And those clashes are between gangs and police. And not only police, but also community members who are supporting police in all of this. And they have created barricades in some of their neighborhoods to try to push back these gangs. What's so terrifying though is you have to think about the folks who are in that community. It was around 5 a.m. that the attack started, that the gangs were coming through on motorbikes and in cars and just wreaking chaos through their neighborhoods. You don't have the opportunity to pick up the phone and call 911. So they're on WhatsApp, they're calling loved ones. They're absolutely terrified, reporting what they're seeing. And police are so strained. They're of course trying to respond. But again, it falls on the community to have to step up and to play a role in stopping the gangs from encroaching even further into their territory. As of now, they've been able to push back a good number of these gang members. But one of the things that is quite striking is how the communities then take justice into their own hands. And we've heard several who have explained to us how that plays out. They will often capture after cornering some of these gang members. And then they will execute them essentially. They will either kill them with machetes, set them on fire. It is quite gruesome. I've seen some of the videos. Very, very disturbing. And the community members are split on this. You have some who say, we don't want to be doing this. We want peace. We want to find some sort of stability. And you have others who say, this is our only way. It's either kill or be killed. They have to feel some sort of line of defense here that would even maybe send a message to some of the gang members not to come near their communities. It's interesting as we were even trying to go through some of those neighborhoods over the weekend. You have to really reach out in advance through locals. Make sure they know who you are and why you're coming. Because if they see somebody who they don't recognize or they feel might be suspicious for us. They won't hold back. And it's for them a matter of life and death.",

We know choppers have been going even as of the past few hours back and forth from Santo Domingo with much needed medical supplies. Getting food in is another situation because folks are quickly running out of the limited supply that they've been able to stock up on. Of all the food that is consumed in this country, 90 percent is imported. And when imports halt, that poses a very, very dangerous situation for the folks living here. When you get the supplies here, Boris, that's one thing.Then you've got to figure out how to navigate it through to the areas where it's most needed. Those areas are blocked by gangs and not just one gang. You have several that are blocking off different roads. And basically making logistics next to impossible when it comes to trying to transport those goods. The folks, though, who have been displaced, you talked about refugees within their own city, more than 300,000 as of today, the latest numbers. And these are people who have then found any sort of facility they can to take over. Schools are obviously not open. So yesterday we found in one school with about a dozen classrooms, you had more than 1,500 people, families, kids cramming into these classrooms, sleeping under the chalkboards trying to find any sort of shade to protect themselves from the sun and making that their home. They have no food coming in. One woman held up a bag of rice that basically fit in the palm of her hand and she said this is our meal for today for seven people. They're desperate and we do know that one local non-profit is stepping up to try to help with that. I was touching base with that non-profit director today, and they told me that they were trying to empty the septic tanks in that school. And the trucks that normally would empty them are all full and backed up because they can't empty them at the dumping site because gangs have blocked it off. What does that mean then Boris, you're talking about sanitation issues, but you're also then saying if these folks are consuming water that is potentially tainted, we have already seen cholera numbers surging. So you're talking about the gangs not only going after people when it comes to physical violence, killing them, starving them out, and in this case even potentially leading to a lot of harm to the community, to disease and death.",
