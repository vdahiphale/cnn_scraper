There's more than 155,000 migrants, according to U.S. federal government estimates that are on the northern Mexico border. That means they're just sitting across from the U.S. southern border. Now, what we know anecdotally from some of the migrants who are there is that they want to cross.In other cases, they are waiting for a CBP one appointment to present at a port of entry. And frankly, they're also at the whim of smugglers, which is something that the Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas recognized today. But here are some other numbers I'll tell you about. A Homeland Security official tells me there was more than 10,000 encounters of migrants just yesterday. I was reporting earlier this week it was 8,000. So that just gives you a sense of how quickly it's climbing. And there are more than 28,000 migrants in Border Patrol custody, so that strains their resources and capacity. Put all this together, it is a logistical and political challenge for this administration. Now, when you talk to officials, they say that they're bolstering their capacity, CBP is opening up two facilities. You also have -- you know, they're trying to send federal agents down to assist, but the reality here is that they're going back to decades old protocols when this goes away, and it's at a time of unprecedented mass migration. Processing is going to take longer, there's more people that they have to work with. And all of that together just puts the entire system under strain.",

What does the Republican frontrunner think about his competitors as heads into 2024? We're going to go live to New Hampshire.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [17:11:47] TAPPER: In our politics lead fewer than three hours from now, former President Donald Trump will come face to face with voters in New Hampshire, as well as CNN's Kaitlin Collins. Mr. Trump, we expect, will face some questions, tough questions perhaps, in this New Hampshire town hall just one day after a federal grand jury -- federal jury, rather, found that Trump had sexually abused E. Jean Carroll in 1996. Let's discuss this with the \"New York Times\" Maggie Haberman and CNN's Political Director David Chalian, who's at the scene of tonight's town hall in the beautiful Granite State. Maggie, so, the timing for this not optimal for Mr. Trump. Just yesterday, the jury found him liable for the sexual assault of E. Jean Carroll, ordered him to give her $5 million for the battery as well as for the defamation. Seems like something of a risk for him to appear in the town hall tonight. MAGGIE HABERMAN, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Of all of the questions, Jake, that he is going to face tonight, potentially, and there are a lot of subjects to cover with him both by CNN and by the audience, this is clearly the most fraught one and it's the one that he would rather not be talking about. It's not just what the verdict was, he's been talking about the verdict on Truth Social, his social media website, they put out a statement, he said he's going to appeal. He's arguing this means he can't get a fair trial in New York. I think there's another issue, which is his deposition in this case in which he doubled down on his comments on that Access Hollywood tape. And I think that is going to come back as a fraud issue for him as well.",

He's polling, on average north of 50 percent in national polls of likely GOP primary voters, also in state polls. His nearest potential challenger, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has not yet declared that he's going to run, is earning slightly more than 20 percent of the Republican primary vote on average, nationally.

Wade.But I have to say, with the possible exception of Mitch McConnell, there is no human being on this planet more responsible for Roe v. Wade being overturned than Donald Trump.

He has been saying since the initial Dobbs decision that undid Roe v. Wade leaked before it was actually voted on by the justices or ruled on by the justices, he has been telling people privately this was bad for Republicans. He has continued saying that. I actually think he is going to try to calibrate a remark to make social conservatives happier. I don't think you're going to hear him say this is bad for Republicans. I think you will hear him say Republicans didn't, conservatives didn't campaign hard enough in 2022 and try to triangulate that way, but he is still going to get pushed on this issue. You know, he did have a meeting with a leading antiabortion activist at Mar-a-Lago earlier this week. He emerged feeling more supported from that, she issued a positive statement.

Some deflecting Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, both of them refusing to weigh in. And then others basically defending Trump, including his somewhat estranged former vice president, Mike Pence.

The document is a classified dissent cable, and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee believes it is key to its committee -- his committee's investigation into the chaotic withdrawal. The cable apparently detailed a stark warning from some U.S. diplomats in Kabul to Biden administration officials that a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was imminent if the August 2021 U.S. troop withdrawal went as planned. Blinken believes sharing that cable means that the protected channel for U.S. diplomats to voice concerns with the administration would be forever tarnished. We're also told that they are afraid of diplomats becoming embroiled in politics. The Republican congressman and chair of the House Foreign Relations Committee, Michael McCaul, joins us now to discuss. Chairman McCaul, good to see you. So you say the State Department's summary of the dissent cable, the summary of its official response, and the classified briefing on this document that they did give to your committee were not enough? Why not? What information is missing? REP.

This is not a political stunt on my part, I'm doing this for the veterans and the gold star families who are entitled to know why did 23 members in the embassy dissent from the policy of the administration as to what was going on a month before Afghanistan fell? And we've given him three extensions of time. We have till tomorrow, that's a deadline. And if he doesn't comply, I'll have no other alternative but to proceed with contempt proceedings.

They're going to learn about Hitler was actually fighting the same people that we're trying to take down today. Again, history is written by, quote, unquote, the winners. These people are so elusive and slippery and cunning and capable that we ended up having World War II. Afterwards, you know, the Nazis won the war. The Khazarian mob won the war.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also scheduled to appear at the Reawaken America tour at Trump Dural, again, this is, according to the event's website, is another Jew hating host of a Rumble show, this one's named Charlie Ward. Ward has posted on social media praise for Hitler for, quote, warning us about Judaism and Jews, also blaming Jews insanely for creating viruses such as AIDS and COVID. Now, we reached out to Eric Trump. He's an executive at the Trump organization and the president's son scheduled to speak at the conference. And Eric told us this afternoon that when he learned about McKay and Ward and the anti-Semitic comments they have made, he told the organizers of the Reawakened American tour to uninvite those two individuals. And Eric says he had been told that they have been uninvited. Now we reached out to Reawaken America, and we heard back from them just minutes ago.Clay Clark, the organizer of the conference. Clark told us he could not confirm if Wards and McKay's appearances had been canceled. We checked the event's website just a few minutes ago. They are still listed on the speaker schedule, despite Eric Trump asking the organizers to uninvite those two bigots. Turning to our Health Lead today, advisors to the Food and Drug Administration took groundbreaking action to make women's access to birth control easier. Two advisory groups to the FDA voted unanimously in support of making a birth control pill called Opill available over the counter. Doctors overwhelmingly agreed the pill is safe for most women and is in fact, safer than other common medicines on the market, such as Benadryl, Tylenol, ibuprofen. The FDA is expected to make a final decision on the pill this summer. Usually it does follow its advisors recommendations. In our Pop Culture Lead, it does not look as though either side, as of now, is close to budging as the Hollywood writers' strike enters its second week, late night shows sadly remain dark. Production is halted for popular series such as Apple, \"Severance\" and Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" Oh, man. Adam I'm sorry. Disney's, creator of the \"Star Wars\" series \"Andor\" said he stopped all non-writing producing duties for the show. Now the Writers Guild of America is arguing that streaming services plus other radical changes in the entertainment industry have transformed how writers are paid, leaving them struggling to make ends meet. And the talks with major production studios are still at a standstill. And joining us from the picket lines outside Paramount Studios in Los Angeles are actors Niecy Nash and Nathan Fillion and the executive producer and showrunner of ABC's \"The Rookie\" and \"The Rookie: Feds,\" Alexi Hawley. Fillion currently stars in \"The Rookie.\" Nash is leading the way in the spinoff series \"The Rookie: Feds.\" Full disclosure, full disclosure, my son Jack and I absolutely adore the series. And these kind people were nice enough to let us have a cameo for last year's Halloween episode. So just so you know that. NATHAN FILLION, ACTOR, \"THE ROOKIE\": You did an excellent job too. You did an great job.",
