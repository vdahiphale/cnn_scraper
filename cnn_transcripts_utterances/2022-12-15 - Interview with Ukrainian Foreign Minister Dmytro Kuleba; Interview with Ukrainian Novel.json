This week, yet more billions have been pledged by the E.U. and many other countries to help get Ukraine through this winter. And across the pond, the Biden administration is finalizing plans to send Patriot missiles, its most advanced air defense system, to help Kyiv counter Moscow's relentless missile attacks which have pounded Ukraine's power grid and other civilian infrastructure. The Russian embassy in Washington says, sending the patriots would, \"Lead to unpredictable consequences.\" Joining me now from Kyiv to assess where a cold winter or war could lead is Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Foreign Minister, welcome back to the program. Can I start by asking you, where you think and how soon, you think, you will get the Patriots, and how much of a difference it will make to the war effort?",

To prevent a Russian offensive, you have to keep them busy with countering our offensive, our liberating offensive. And we should not allow Russia to dictate the situation on the battlefield. And to do that, we need more heavy weapons. As I said howitzers, tanks, a lot of ammunition, multiple launch rocket systems. We should change the optics.

So, absolutely. But what happened in the last 10 months is something that is beyond tragic. I mean -- and from my vantage point, you know, Kyiv is an invaded country. Russia is an invader. As an invader, it will have to answer for this for decades, if not centuries, to come. And that absolutely breaks my heart. Also, because there is absolutely zero recognition on the part of many, many not Russians, but Russian officials that it needs to -- Russia needs to answer for this. So, in fact here in the month that I've been here, you know I've been here for some time now, it's just getting horribly ossified.
