It's number one that is the really big sticking point here divestment, which is they are asking for all financial ties between the university and tech or weapons companies with Israeli ties be completely cut.If you look back through history, you will find that there have been many other calls for divestment. Some have actually been successful, including in 1968. That's when Columbia students occupied several buildings, including Hamilton Hall that you see often the distance by doing so raising awareness of the Vietnam War. In 2015, a year-long campaign made Columbia University the first to divest from private prisons. And then a few years later, on those very steps that you see off in the distance in front of the library. That's where a group of climate activist students staged the hunger strike to divest from coal and fossil fuels. But perhaps the most successful calls for divestment came in the 80s when students called for the cutting off of financial ties between the university and South African companies during the apartheid and that is when once again and Hamilton Hall we saw this occupation of students that eventually led to a trustee vote that would make Columbia University the first Ivy League to cut said ties. And that is the kind of legacy that is certainly not lost on all of the young people that we have seen in this encampment and is really why the reason why they are reluctant to pack up and leave. Now in terms of Columbia University, they are certainly still under pressure. What will the administration do? Well, they once again turn to the NYPD for assistance in clearing out this encampment, which was previously made them the subject of investigation from the Columbia University Senate, or do they allow them to remain as the big graduation commencement ceremony nears, and this very spot in a matter of weeks.

It also accuses Israeli settlers of assaulting, even torturing Palestinians along with stealing their belongings and livestock and threatening to kill them if they refuse to leave their homes. The U.N. has recorded more than 700 settler attacks and at least 17 Palestinian deaths and 400 wounded between October 7 and April 3rd.

And let's be clear, this is not an example of a few bad apples, as you noted in your introduction, in many cases, Israeli forces have been present. In some cases they have participated in these attacks. These settlers have been armed by the Israeli government, the U.S. State Department is almost certainly this includes U.S. arms. They are held systematically not accountable for their actions. They have been egged on by Israeli officials.

SHAKIR: I mean this particular government has directly told them, many senior officials telling them, go ahead, commit violence. We'll ensure you're not held to account. Look, these are not happening in random locations. You open a map of the West Bank and you realize that they're taking place in strategic areas that the Israeli government has long sought to expand settlements to grow their presence, to force out Palestinian communities. Palestinians have been under occupation for more than half a century, but coercive policies, home demolitions, denying them access to water, electricity have not done what these months of settler violence have done, which is to force them out of their homes. When you take away a family's means of livelihood, their livestock; when you threaten them, when you threaten their children, when you destroy their schools and homes, you leave them with no choice but to leave.

We're talking about settlements and have continued to grow and expand, Palestinians forced off their land for decades. But I think there's been so much focus on a potential solution that we forget the problem that necessitates a solution. Human rights abuse structural oppression, apartheid.
