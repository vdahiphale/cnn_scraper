      "sentences": "Well, look, Bianca, Max, as the search and rescue effort now begins to come to a close, only two out of those 11 affected provinces still seeing those ongoing rescue efforts taking place. At this stage, the focus is certainly shifting now to providing humanitarian support to those who have been impacted.And we are talking about thousands and thousands of people across southeast Turkey who have been left homeless. Many of them, of course, have lost -- they lost loved ones and they've been left with absolutely nothing. And there is a real emphasis now, a real sense of urgency here in Turkey when it comes to providing that humanitarian support. And we've seen a groundswell support in Turkey across the country. Donations coming in, aid groups working on the ground. And there's also, of course, been a huge amount of international support for Turkey. And as you laid out there, Secretary of State Antony Blinken now in this hour expected to meet with the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They will continue to discuss that response effort as well as a whole host of other issues on the agenda. Blinken met with his counterpart, the Turkish Foreign Minister, over the weekend, and once again today. And in fact, over the weekend, Blinken toured some of the affected areas, including the province of Hatay, which was perhaps hardest hit by the earthquake, as well as meeting with the U.S. aid teams on the ground and search and rescue teams who've been supporting in that effort. And his message has been very clear. The United States will stand behind Turkey for as long as it takes, not only through the search and rescue operation, but also now with the humanitarian response effort and of course the rebuilding effort, which could take months, if not years. Now, as you said that the United States has pledged further funding and will continue to stand behind Turkey, according to Secretary Blinken. But this is going to take a long while, Bianca, Max. And, of course, the pressure that is mounting on Turkey is one that is going to emphasize that need for further international support.",

CNN's Polo Sandoval has the story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a dramatic end to what police describe as a nearly yearlong cross-country kidnapping. The woman seen running into this New Jersey service station in early February is escaping her suspected captor, who is close behind a man later identified as James Perillo Jr. The yearlong ordeal started in New Mexico, where the couple first met last February. The woman says she agreed to give Perillo a ride to Arizona. They eventually made their way to California, where she says their relationship took a violent turn. That's where police say Perillo physically assaulted the woman, taken away her phone and debit cards. Eventually, the pair made their way cross country in what New Jersey State police describe as a yearlong nightmare. Cameras inside the store captured the moment the bare footed woman dead bolts the door, preventing her alleged kidnapper from entering.",
