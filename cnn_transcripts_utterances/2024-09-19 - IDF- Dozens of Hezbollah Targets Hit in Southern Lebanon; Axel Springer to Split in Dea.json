So definitely escalation is well underway. This, as Lebanon continues to reel from all the deaths and injuries caused by hundreds, perhaps thousands of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies. (Begin VT) WEDEMAN (voice over): Final prayers for a Hezbollah militant, one of many killed in the spate of pager and walkie-talkie blasts across Lebanon linked to Israel. Outside, others pay respects to the family. The blast killed dozens, including children, and wounded thousands. WEDEMAN (on camera): This is a memorial and graveyard for Hezbollah fighters killed in action and what the group has seen since the beginning of this week is its highest death toll since the start of hostilities with Israel last October. WEDEMAN (voice over): The group supporters, however, are putting on a brave face. (MERIAM speaking in foreign language.) WEDEMAN (voice over): \"The enemy is terrified of us,\" Beirut resident, Meriam (ph) tells me. \"They're afraid. They attack us with planes. We fire back with rockets and bullets.\" But there is no denying the attacks have taken a serious toll.

Today, we've seen for instance the Israelis are moving their 98th Division, which was active in Gaza to Israel's northern front. On the other hand, we are not seeing others sort of preparations that one might expect from the Israeli side if there was going to be a full-on ground offensive. I suspect that what Israel is going to do is intensify its airstrikes not only along the border with Lebanon, but deeper inside the country. And as many people here are worried, Israel may have more surprises up its sleeves. The likes of which we saw Tuesday and Wednesday and therefore, I think their ultimate goal at this point is probably to convince Hezbollah to stop firing on Israel and essentially calm the border down completely. But what we heard from Nasrallah is that is not his intention. He made it clear Hezbollah will continue to fire upon Israel until the war in Gaza comes to an end and that doesn't seem like it is going to be happening any time soon -- Richard.",

How do you see it? FADI NICHOLAS NASSAR, US-LEBANON FELLOW, THE MIDDLE EAST INSTITUTE: Look, thank you so much for inviting me and putting a spotlight on an increasingly concerning situation. As Hezbollah's secretary general delivered his speech, Israeli planes breaking the sound barrier over Lebanon sent a loud message, actions speak louder than words. Hezbollah finds itself in an extremely difficult position. Nasrallah tried to reassure his audience that Hezbollah remains a formidable force despite those massive attacks you referred to that took place this week. But his speech wasn't just directed to Hezbollah's base. It meant to hit home, Hezbollah's main talking point since the start of this conflict, that it has effectively turned Northern Israel into a de-facto buffer zone. And that this week's attack, according to him, won't change that. He shows no sign of backing down or recalibrating Hezbollah's strategy to open a limited front with Israel in support of Hamas, a war that the vast majority of Lebanese do not want.",

Recently, for example, Bill Ackman was written about by Business Insider, Ackman didn't like it, and he targeted KKR. So this is essentially a split that might be a win-win, KKR taking the classifieds business also, when we think classifieds, we also mean real estate ads, automotive ads, some really valuable a marketing businesses but now Dopfner can go out and spend some money investing and buying more publications. I've had some meetings with these folks from Axel Springer. They've established a company here in the United States, an office here in New York.

To that extent, maybe that is some strategy, there is some logic there. There's also been some recent investments in some AI startups, some AI platforms, but you know what I often hear from media bankers is that there is not a lot to buy out there right now. So that is why I am so intrigued about what Dopfner's next move will be, what will he try to acquire? How will he try to expand in the United States?

That's a possibility. We're not sure if that's 100 percent correct.

That is the first time that has ever happened. In fact, usually during this cycle, one of the candidates leads by five points or more for at least three weeks. In this particular cycle even when it was Trump versus Biden, no one has led for at least five points more. So the bottom line is this, my dear friend, is that you better hitch up, you better put on your helmet, because the next, what is it, 45 plus days, are going to be absolutely nuts.

Now you will note in that Pennsylvania poll, the margin of error is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points and Kamala Harris' lead is four, so, you know, it's right sort of on that margin of error.
