I'm Jessica Dean in New York, and we begin with breaking news.More than 20 million people are under tropical storm alerts tonight as Debby is rapidly picking up power. The storm is forecast to reach hurricane status in the next few hours and make landfall near the Big Bend area of Florida in the morning. Flooding has already begun and more is on the way. Forecasters are saying historic heavy rain will pose the biggest danger with the storm. Officials warning people in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina about floods, power outages, and even tornadoes. Meteorologist Chad Myers is tracking Debby in the CNN Weather Center. CNN's Rafael Romo is following the storm preps. Chad, talk to us first about the latest on Debby.",

It is now considerable flash flood event here all the way from Clearwater, all the way down toward Naples and Venice, there's so much water falling out of the sky. You can begin to see the purple right there along the coast.Those are the highest cloud tops, the most moisture laden storms right now. Be careful if you're going to be out and I recommend don't even go out in the area of western parts of Florida there. And there's the center of the circulation, more and more developed every single hour that I look at it on the radar. And this will certainly be a hurricane by landfall. Not that it matters because there's going to be so many other things going on, including the potential for landfalling waterspouts, small tornadoes on land here in parts of Florida. Every time a big storm comes on shore, that is going to have the potential to put down obviously rain. But also if it's spinning a tornado or two, not big ones, but big enough that they can do damage. Remember, all the tornadoes that Beryl put down, like more than 50, but the surge, the saltwater surge into the Big Bend area. Cedar Key, Steinhatchee, all the way up here to St. Marks. That's going to be the dangerous area you need to be away from the water here. If that water surge is 10 feet higher and you're only four feet above sea level I don't have to tell you, I'd do the math there. So yes, it will be an 85 maybe even 95 mile per hour hurricane as it makes landfall. 12 to 16 hours from right now. The slower it goes, the longer it stays over waters. So the bigger and stronger it will get. We do know that there's going to be a tremendous amount of rainfall, 10 to 15 in some spots. The models were putting out 20 inches of rain over the next two to three days. And this is even Tuesday where it's still raining so heavily that flash flood watches will likely be issued. Flash flood warnings will certainly be issued. Ten to 15 inches of rainfall in a wide swath like this. Jessica, this is going to be a flood event. Yes, there'll be wind, but this is kind of the same place that we had a big hurricane go in last year. So this is going to be a storm surge push that water in. It's not going to be a knock every tree down type of storm. But boy, when you see this kind of rainfall, this widespread all the way up the East Coast, that's going to be the story.",

Governor Brian Kemp here in Georgia declared a state of emergency Saturday because the state is expected to get potentially historic rainfall according to the National Weather service.And also in South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster has done the same in his state. Charleston is expecting up to 18 inches of rain which could cause life-threatening floodwaters and flash flooding. And in Florida, several coastal counties from St. Petersburg and Tampa all the way up to Panama City and Panama City Beach are under either mandatory or voluntary evacuation orders, especially those people who live in coastal or low-lying areas. In the last hour, we heard from Charleston Mayor William Cogswell, who said that this storm may bring historic levels of rain to his city with predictions ranging between 10 to 20 inches over the course of the next few days with the potential to reach up to 30 inches in specific areas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR WILLIAM COGSWELL, CITY OF CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA: This unprecedented amount of rainfall poses a real risk of life-threatening flash flooding across Charleston. Residents must take immediate precautions. Please remain indoors and avoid any unnecessary travel. Roads and areas that do not typically flood are expected to be impacted, perhaps severely so.

We are less than 48 hours away from Vice President Kamala Harris introducing a running mate for the very first time at a campaign event in Philadelphia. As she prepares to make this critical decision, she's meeting with at least three top VP contenders today, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. CNN's Eva McKend has been keeping an eye on all the comings and goings outside the vice president's residence there in Washington, D.C. Eva, what have you seen today and what are you learning?",

You know, today, we believe that we saw Governor Shapiro's motorcade. We saw a motorcade passed by here with Pennsylvania plates and was similar to what we saw when he left Pennsylvania earlier today, though we're not entirely sure.Then we all so saw Eric Holder. He of course is the former Obama era attorney general and he is involved in this vetting process. He is overseeing a team of attorneys that are briefing the vice president that have been engaged in this vigorous vetting process of these finalists. You know, Jess, this all comes as a CBS poll released today shows that Harris and former president Donald Trump are in a statistical tie with Harris at 50 percent and Trump at 49 percent. And that really illustrates how this Democratic shake-up of the ticket has changed the race entirely. You have Democrats feeling extremely motivated to vote for Harris, not just against Trump.",

And I know the Harris team wants us all to be focused on her search for a governing partner, which assumes that she would win the election. But the fact is right now she's looking for someone who can help her win the election, and that's really what we see in the pool that we believe to be either the three finalists or at least among the three finalists, whether it's Governor Shapiro from Pennsylvania, Governor Walz from Minnesota, or Senator Mark Kelly from Arizona.And you're looking in those cases and then a couple other folks who made the finalist list at people who in Shapiro's case is very popular in Pennsylvania. It's a must-win state for Harris with 19 electoral votes. But there are questions about whether as much as he could help in Pennsylvania, could he be a liability if you add Michigan and Wisconsin together. That's more than 19 electoral votes. Senator Kelly and Governor Walz both have military experience. Senator Kelly has been to space. He's married to Gabby Giffords, who of course has been sort of this couple, this power couple in terms of leading gun regulation efforts in the U.S. And then Walz is sort of come from behind in recent days because his charisma, his background as a high school teacher and football coach, and his Midwestern appeal when Harris is going to have to be running against Republican monikers of San Francisco liberal, we've heard all the talking points, Walz offers a really clear counterpoint to that. So in the end, and it does matter who she feels most comfortable with also, in the end tells us that their running mate may not make a huge difference, but we really are in unchartered territory in so many ways with this campaign. They're trying to get it right on a pretty tough deadline.",

We see \"Politico\" reporting that Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman has expressed concerns about Josh Shapiro. There was actually -- I can read you a bit of it. Fetterman's advisers suggested to Harris' his team that the senator believes that Shapiro is he excessively focused on his own personal ambitions. His reservations about Shapiro reflect a long-running rivalry between the two ambitious Democrats. It is interesting to see someone from Pennsylvania, but, look, there are all these things at play, right? Like all of these, what does it mean to each of these politicians for their future.

We don't want unemployment to get even higher given that it's been rising for each of the past four months. We don't want job growth to slow more or let alone, of course, turn into job losses.

So, when the Fed met this week, Chairman Jay Powell basically said he needed to see more data before another interest rate cut would be justified.Well, we got the data right after they finished meeting, now it does look like a cut is in the cards. So, the Fed met, decided to keep things as they were and strongly signaled that they were going to cut interest rates at their subsequent meeting, which is in September. Now, that looks all but a certainty and the only question really about their next meeting is not -- if they will cut, but rather how much they will cut. Will they make a more aggressive decision and cut interest rates, for example, by a full, half a percentage point rather than the usual quarter of a percentage point.

Powell needs to cancel his summer vacation and cut rates now, not six weeks.It's worth noting, the Fed is independent of politics and doesn't take any orders from any sort of elected officials.

Whereas, the usual criticism of the Fed is that maybe they waited too long to raise interest rates.That said, I do think it's reasonable to be concerned that they waited too long to raise them when inflation was high and maybe they've waited a little bit too long to go back to cutting them. And I think that there are a lot of voices out there, not just Senator Warren's that are saying, look guys, the economy is cooling. It's time to take your foot off the brake. Just start cutting interest rates to start stimulating the economy a little bit. And my guess is that the officials at the Federal Reserve also believe they're a little bit behind the curve, at least if you just look at this Jobs Report, that said they will get more data between now and September. There will be another Jobs Report, among other indicators on inflation for example. And so again, I think another cut is coming and they may be playing catch-up at their next meeting because maybe they agree that they should have restarted stimulating the economy earlier.",

Here's CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, with more on what you need to know about this summer surge.DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: This week we asked viewers what questions they had about this summer's COVID-19 wave and you had a lot of them. Specifically, about the shots and when you should get your next one. So first of all, we don't know exactly when the most updated shots are going to be available. But you can probably expect them sometime this fall. There are a few things to keep in mind. The new COVID shot is going to target the JN.1 variant, which incidentally is a descendant of the Omicron variant. Remember that that? Now, the predominant strain that's circulating right now is KP.3, which is a descendant of both of those Omicron and JN.1. So, the bottom line is the new COVID shot should be pretty protective against the currently circulating strains. Also, remember this, immunity, we're learning lasts around four to six months. So keep that number in the back of your mind. That is probably the reason that we're seeing a summer surge as the protection wears off from the last set of shots. Also, there has been a lot of discussion recently about a combination shot COVID and flu in the same shot. Moderna, the pharma company, had some positive trial results with that combination earlier this summer but we're learning it's not going to be ready for this fall. You can however, remember get both the flu and COVID shots at the same time and try and do that sometime before Halloween.",
