So, in that months, April of 2020, the Border Patrol had about 16,000 encounters with migrants in between ports of entry at the southern border.And then after April 2020, with Trump still in office, the number of encounters rose each and every month, so for more than eight months, going up to more than 75,000 encounters, when he actually left office in January of 2021. Now, it is true that the number of encounters continue to increase when President Biden and Vice President Harris took over, but what this arrow falsely claims and what the former president himself is falsely claiming is that the low point occurred when he left and then it suddenly began increasing. When, in fact, Biden and Harris took over when the number was actually on an upward trend for about three- quarters of a year before they were sworn in. So, a classic example of how you can lie, how you can deceive using so-called statistics. Sara.",

It's like crossing streams in \"Ghostbusters.\" Who knows what happens if you touch it.All right, this morning, more than 200 Republicans who previously worked for former Presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and/or former Senators John McCain and Mitt Romney, they signed a letter backing Vice President Harris for president. The list includes former chiefs of staff, press secretaries, campaign managers, interns. There are some interns on the list as well. With me now is Rosario Marin, former U.S. treasurer under George W. Bush. We saw your name on the dollar bill. Mice to see you in person this morning. Now, your name is not on this list, but you are supporting Vice President Harris. Why? ROSARIO MARIN, FORMER U.S. TREASURER: Yes. So, back on July 31st, I put out a statement saying that I support Vice President Kamala Harris because we have seen what 40 out of 44 cabinet members of Donald Trump have warned us. We have seen what they have said. I don't know him. I have never been in the room with him. But I have been with President Bush, with Senator McCain, with Mitt Romney. These are honorable men. Donald Trump is not. And we -- and I have seen, and I have heard people who have worked with him saying he's going to be a danger. If he was a danger before, he's even more dangerous now. And the fact that he has said that he would be a dictator from day one, that should scare all of us. So, back on July 31st, I said, I am voting for Kamala Harris. I am really tired of all the things that they have said against her. And she's a very accomplished woman. Of course, I'm from California, so I'm a little bit biased. But I understand that we can no longer have another four years of chaos, four years of, we don't know what he's going to do or - we don't know what he's going to say every day. I'm exhausted. Every day, when he was in office, I was just exhausted. We don't need four more years of that.",

The spokesman, Daniel Hagari, saying that the hostage, al- Qaid, was rescued from a tunnel based on what the IDF describes as an exact piece of intelligence.We also know that among the special forces units involved in what the IDF is calling a rescue operation was an elite combat engineering unit which has been tasked with operations just like this one, going after this network of tunnels under Gaza, primarily, of course, to go after Hamas fighters, but also involved in, and you would expect them to be involved, in a rescue operation such as this one. If those details turn out to be accurate, then this would be the first hostage rescued from those tunnels. And that's significant because that is extreme dangerous territory to operate in Gaza. It is proven so for Israeli forces going back to October 7th, as they've attempted to go after Hamas, but rescue hostages alive. We've seen images, and I believe you've shared some on the air so far, but images of his family. Kaid Farhan al-Qadi's family meeting with him in the hospital. He was immediately taken by helicopter to a hospital in Beersheba, in southern Israel, where they are saying he is in stable condition, though they continue to carry out medical tests. I just want to also add, Sara, if I can, and highlight the statement from the hostages forum following this rescue. This is, of course, the forum representing the families of the many hostages that still remain in Gaza. The number now stands at 108. They said the following. They said, Qadi's return home is nothing short of miraculous. But the statement went on to say that military operations alone cannot free the 108 remaining hostages. A negotiated deal is the only way forward. And that speaks to the larger pressure felt here in this country. Not - and not just by the hostage families, because, of course, there are members of the Israeli public pushing for this as well, that those families of remaining hostages do not believe that military operations alone will bring their loved ones home. They believe there needs to be a deal, a ceasefire and hostage negotiation deal that will get a large number of hostages, or perhaps all the hostages home, and home quickly, because they fear that the longer we wait, the longer the Israeli government waits, the less likely it is that they're going to see their family members alive. Israeli officials have already they acknowledged that many of those hundred eight are not still alive. And we got a reminder of that just in the last week when another Israeli operation brought back the bodies of six hostages held - held in Gaza. Of course, they will not be having tearful reunions like the ones we're seeing now with al- Qadi's family. You have to go back to June to the last time that hostages were rescued alive from Gaza.",

Ken Paxton says this investigation has to do with voter harvesting and organized electoral fraud. And that is what this investigation goes. We've reached out to Ken Paxton. He has not responded to any of our requests for an interview regarding this investigation. But LULAC officials, as you mentioned, John, have reached out to the Department of Justice, calling for a civil rights investigation. LULAC essentially saying that this is a serious violation of the civil rights of Latino citizens. That this is a direct attempt to suppress Latino vote through intimidation and harassment.
