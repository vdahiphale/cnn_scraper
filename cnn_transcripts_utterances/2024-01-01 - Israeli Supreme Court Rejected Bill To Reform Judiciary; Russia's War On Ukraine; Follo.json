He has said that, look, now's not the time. This goes completely against the unity that is required right now while Israel is engaged with this war with Hamas, but that the government would continue to act with restraint and responsibility. But on that point, it's actually not the Supreme Court's choice, or indeed its decision to do it right now. It had no choice but to issue the ruling now because two of the justices were officially resigning three months ago. They got a three-month extension. They can't extend it anymore. This ruling had to come before they stepped away, and the justice minister, one assumes, knows that. So, the timing may seem a bit bizarre given that Israel is in the middle of the war and those divisions of the past 12 months seem to be a lifetime away, but the Supreme Court had no choice. but to issue that ruling roundabout now. The ruling is eight to seven against the government's passage of this legislation, it has been struck down, so the Supreme Court can, once again, strike down government decisions on the grounds of reasonableness.

They have this sort of color- coded graph. You can see the purple is the absolute worst. So down in the southeast, but really, it's getting bad, even stretching out into California. And as you said, a majority of states are seeing high or very high levels of the flu right now. Now, if we want to compare this with previous seasons, we're still in this weird period where we're sort of shaking out after the pandemic, where COVID wiped out everything. So, what we're showing you here is this season, which is in the blue, you can see it's starting off to a slower start than the previous season which is in the orange. The purple there is the last season before COVID came along and wiped-out flu. And so, what we don't know is that where the peak is going to be. Is it going to go up and be worse than last season, or are we heading toward a peak? What we do know, of course, is it's January. This is one of the worst months for respiratory viruses.

The product tested positive for bacteria that can induce rare, but potentially fatal infections in newborns.

The Queen's son, Crown Prince Frederik, will take over. The 83-year-old says that her decision was influenced by a back surgery she had last year. Queen Margrethe II took over the throne in 1972 following the death of King Frederik IX. And how about this one? Mickey Mouse, the iconic character symbolizing Disney for almost a century, well, it's now available to other creators. Starting this month, an early version of Mickey Mouse from 1920, Disney's 1928 \"Steamboat Willie\" is out of Disney's exclusive copyright grasp.

And it starts Peter Capaldi, who you might remember from \"Dr. Who\". She plays a young detective. It's in set in Britain, a British police detective who suspects that a black man may have been put in jail unjustly, and that Peter Capaldi may have led the task force that put him there.

People seem to really love it. There's strong word of mouth. Fantasia Barrino, the star, has a wonderful story about having survived, you know, financial troubles after winning \"American Idol\" and then coming back to star in \"The Color Purple\" on Broadway and now in this movie. \"American Fiction\" is a wonderful movie starring Jeffrey Wright as a black author who gets disenchanted with the literary business, and he writes this really stereotypical novel and then it takes off. And suddenly he has to contend with having created this thing that he thought was a joke but it becomes super successful. There's a lot of great movies in contention. Some movies that we thought would be in contention like \"Napoleon\" starring Joaquin Phoenix, getting really terrible buzz. Not getting great reviews. It may not be in the conversation the way that people thought -- might have thought when they heard about the project and they saw it on paper.
