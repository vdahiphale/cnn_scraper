Well, the Biden administration is making another major change to its policy, sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine for the first time since Russia's invasion. Two officials say the U.S. intends for Kyiv to deploy the mines for defensive purposes only in eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces have made slow but steady progress. That decision comes days after the White House approved the use of longer-range weapons by Ukraine to strike inside Russian territory.Moscow says Kyiv fired U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles at a weapons arsenal in the Bryansk region on Tuesday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not confirm the attack, but said now that his military has long range capabilities, it will use them. In apparent response, Vladimir Putin updated Russia's nuclear doctrine. The Kremlin says Russia now has the right to use nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks. More now from CNN's Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgin in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukraine not wasting any time striking deep into Russian territory using U.S.-supplied ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles only days after getting the go ahead from the Biden administration, the U.S. confirms. Ukraine's president koi when asked about the strikes. We now have attack him and we will use them, he said. Moscow up in arms claiming Ukraine-targeted military installations in Southwestern Russia overnight, the foreign minister ripping into the Biden administration. The fact that ATACMS were used repeatedly tonight in the Briansk region is of course, a signal that they want escalation. And it's impossible to use these high-tech missiles without the Americans and Putin has spoken about this many times. And now, Putin has reacted. Breaking news on Kremlin-controlled T.V. after the Russian president signed an order changing the country's nuclear doctrine. The use of Western missiles for strikes into the strategic depths of Russia means direct involvement of NATO in the war, the host says. And now Moscow's hands are untied. Among the changes, the Russians now consider attacks by non-nuclear nations, like Ukraine, with the help of nuclear nations, like the U.S., worthy of a nuclear response, at least on paper. PLEITGEN (on camera): The spokesman for the Kremlin says the reason why the Russians decided to update their nuclear doctrine is so potential adversaries of Russia know that retaliation will be inevitable if Russia is attacked. PLEITGEN (text): We're with American channel CNN. Can we? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): OK? PLEITGEN (text): This morning, your president Vladimir Putin signed an update to Russia's nuclear doctrine. What do you think about it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): What is there to think about? What kind of response can there be? Only this kind. PLEITGEN (text): He has greatly expanded the possibility of using nuclear weapons. Do you think this is a good idea? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (text): What should our president do? He has to think of something.  We need to scare someone. PLEITGEN (on camera): Do you think that the threat of the use of nuclear weapons has increased now?",

To put that in perspective for everybody at home, North Korea has a fighting force of just over a million men. So, to think about 100,000 North Korean troops potentially being ready to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, that's about a tenth of North Korea's fighting force being prepared or being sent over far, far away from North Korea.What would that do, potentially, to the stability of the regime? It's certainly, on that level, a fascinating and disturbing train of thought. Now, as for the new details that came out from Seoul just a few hours ago, we're talking about South Korea's spy agency, Rosemary. It has helped to answer the question of what exactly is happening with the North Korean troops. And what is North Korea doing to make Russia's war fight easier for Russia? So, with the troops, according to the spy agency here in Seoul, we now know that these North Korean special forces service members are engaging in training in two ways. First of all, tactics of how to deal with modern warfare, and second of all, drone response. Why both of those things are important is because even though we have this fighting force of north of a million people, they're still, Rosemary, coming from this hermit nation, where they do not have experience evading drones, dealing with drones. Dealing with militaries from the modern world. We also know the firepower that North Korea, according to South Korea's National Intelligence Service, is being delivered to the battle lines. We're talking about 170mm self-propelled guns and 240-millimeter multiple rocket launchers. And when we think about what those pieces of artillery look like, we're talking about long range artillery, we're talking about big pieces of artillery that you would usually see in military parades in Pyongyang or Red Square in Moscow. So significant ways that North Korea is helping out. Finally, Rosemary. We want to end on the spy agency in Seoul. They were asked, what about these videos that we have seen on TikTok, YouTube, et cetera purporting to show North Koreans surrendering already? Well, the spy agency said the jury is still out on whether or not those videos are legitimate. And when we news gather here in Seoul, talk to former generals on the American and South Korean side, they're saying that these Special Forces service members from north of the DMZ, they are the least likely to surrender. So, it is uncertain whether these videos are authentic, but many people are saying it's doubtful. So, new details. We're keeping our eye on this situation, Rosemary.",

He's chosen Dr. Mehmet Oz, a surgeon and T.V. personality, to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Oz lost the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania in 2022. Trump also named Linda McMahon to be the next Secretary of Education. She's been the co-chair of his transition team and formerly led the Small Business Administration in Trump's first term. McMahon also is a former T.V. personality from her time with World Wrestling Entertainment. The President elect has also revealed his pick for Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick.

However, there are still several candidates, as Donald Trump had expanded the field in recent days. All of them have met with Donald Trump and the transition team and I am told no decisions have been made, however, again, they are hoping to get this out as quickly as possible, specifically given that so many of Donald Trump's policies on day one that he has said are related to the economy. So, we'll see if they're able to make that goal of Wednesday night. They are obviously trying to tick through a number of these cabinet positions as we inch through this transition process.

We also have the Loss In Damage Fund, which wants to provide specific funding for developing countries to deal with extreme weather disasters that are really, you know, causing so much devastation.
