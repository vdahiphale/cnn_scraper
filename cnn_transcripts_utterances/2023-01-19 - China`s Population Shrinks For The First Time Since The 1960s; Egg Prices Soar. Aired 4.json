      "sentences": "The headline is significant. China`s population shrank last year, the first time this hashappened in more than 60 years, a decline of about 850,000 people. Let`s break this down and look at some of the reasons why. First, priorities are changing. We`re getting married later and some young people are not having children at all. In addition, Beijing held a controversial one-child policy until 2015, but it was relaxed because of concerns about the population. In 2021, three children were then allowed, and a plan was released to strengthen maternity leave and to offer tax deductions. In addition to all of this, the cost of living in China is high, so is education. And then there`s just general economic uncertainty, that can all impact decision making. So, what are the takeaways from this? The United Nations is predicting India will surpass China to become the most populated country this year. And then there are the economic implications. This means an aging workforce without a pipeline into the future that could impact productivity and in turn economic success. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has raised these demographic challenges saying boosting birth rates and addressing the cost of raising a child will be part of future policy. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It can be traced all the way back to a Latin word avis meaning bird. Did you know there`s currently an egg shortage and now the prices of eggs are no yolk? One of the culprits is an outbreak of the avian flu, a virus mostly affecting birds. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average price for a dozen eggs in California is more than seven bucks. It was just $2.35 a year ago. And one of my CNN teammates Maya in New York City, she spent $12 on a dozen eggs yesterday. That`s a dollar per egg y`all. At these prices, I`m not sure those omelettes are all they`re cracked up to be. Here`s CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich who tells us exactly what`s causing the shortage and these super high prices.
