Israeli police boosting forces in Jerusalem ahead of the prayers and other religious events, among them Easter mass, Christians packing the church of the Holy Sepulcher on Sunday to mark the holiest day on their calendar. Some believe the church sits on the site where Jesus was crucified. At the same time, Muslims gathered at the Al-Aqsa Mosque for prayers amid the holy month of Ramadan. Tensions there remain heightened nearly a week after Israeli forces twice stormed one of Islam's holiest sites, claiming hundreds of rioters had barricaded themselves inside. Meanwhile in the West Bank, a funeral was held for two British Israeli sisters killed amid rising tensions in the region. Mourners gathered to remember the two, who died in a shooting attack on Friday. Their mother was seriously wounded and remains hospitalized in critical condition. A funeral also held for a Palestinian man shot and killed by Israeli forces. The Palestinian health ministry says the incident happened during a confrontation between soldiers and a group of Palestinians in a town in the occupied West Bank. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is following developments as tensions have flared in the region and has more now from Jerusalem. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Over the course of the weekend, dozens of warplanes have been detected over the Taiwan Strait, with many crossing over into the island's air defense identification zone.

      "sentences": "Yes, Michael, you know, the message has always been the same. That is that the Chinese trying to highlight their sovereign claim over the self-governing Taiwan and to showcase their determination and the capability to take control of the island by force, if necessary.But of course, since Xi Jinping took power here, we have seen Beijing really hardening its stance on this issue with that added urgency in terms of, quote unquote, \"reunification with Taiwan.\" Xi Jinping himself last week told the visiting European Commission President Van der Leyen that Taiwan is the core of China's core interests and saying anyone who hopes China to compromise on this issue is, quote unquote, \"delusional\" and will only end up shooting themselves in the foot. So this kind of war games not surprising. The Chinese have been furious, as you mentioned, over President Tsai's House visit to Central America and the U.S., where she met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and they had long promised to take resolute actions to defend China's national sovereignty. But it is worth noting that, in terms of scale and intensity, this is still, certainly, not at the level in terms of what we saw last year, when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. After that trip, the Chinese military launched its biggest war games around the island in decades, firing missiles over Taiwan and conducting a mock blockade. So that relative restraint, if you will, this time, according to analysts, because President Tsai's visit, coinciding with several very important visits here in China, including a trip by a former Taiwan president, whose party is considered to be more friendly to Beijing. And there, of course, is a Taiwanese presidential election going on next year. So the leadership here is mindful of its actions and implications there. And then, of course, French President Macron and Von der Leyen both here last week. The E.U. foreign policy chief is coming here. Brazilian President Lula is coming here. So the Chinese are increasingly trying to present themselves as a global hub of diplomacy, especially on the heels of that, you know, deal brokered by them between the Iranians and the Saudis, so they are mindful of this kind of optics and implications in terms of what they do over Taiwan. But the worry here, Michael, is as they continue to normalize this kind of war games around the island, especially with their assets, as you mentioned, crossing the median line, that there is this added element of new danger and instability, especially with not just a Taiwanese, but the Americans and its allies continued their military operations in the region, as well, to assert their claims and navigational and overflight freedom. So any miscalculation can lead to real confrontation. And that is really the worry in the minds of many people -- Michael.",

It depends on the job and material well-being.

Of course, they are not considered collaborators. They need to get to a third country and address a local Ukrainian consulate. It will issue them Ukrainian documents to return to Ukraine.\" But for those who remain in Russia long-term, the future is less clear. By Ukrainian law, people who publicly deny occupation or who call for support for Russian actions are considered collaborators. International law prohibits forcible transfers of people. Russia says more than five million Ukrainians have arrived in Russia since the full-scale war began. And while Ukraine says many were forcibly deported, some, like Oksana, said they went willingly.
