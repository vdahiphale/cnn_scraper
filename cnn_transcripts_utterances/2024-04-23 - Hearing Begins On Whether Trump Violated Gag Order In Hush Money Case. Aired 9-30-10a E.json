The second batch included a whole string of Truth Social posts where Donald Trump, again primarily focused on Michael Cohen. The judge will, probably, I would imagine, just stand up today and say, I'll here quick argument from both sides. D.A., I have your brief. Anything you want to ask? Donald Trump, your team, Todd Blanche, is there anything you want to say in your defense? I'm not sure exactly I think the interesting part is going to be two here.

Now that is not one of the ones that had enlisted so far, but, hey, they may add its the list.Now, when it comes to the other instances, you have to go, you have to kind of go post or attack him by attack.

On the left side of the screen, you'll be seeing live updates from our reporters who were inside the courthouse because, of course, cameras are not allowed in court.But you'll see a play by play of the proceedings as they are happening. Right now, Donald Trump is sitting alone in this courtroom at the -- at the defense table because his attorneys are in the middle of a chat with the judge, a sidebar in which he is not involved. So, a strange scene for a former president sitting in the middle of that courtroom. This is all going on, of course, in the backdrop of the ongoing criminal trial that is happening but the battle in another case, over the $175 million bond that Donald Trump was ordered to pay in the civil fraud trial that he lost has now been resolved. New York attorney general and Trump reached an agreement on the terms of that bond finally. Joining me now, Russ Buettner, Pulitzer Prize winning investigative reporter for \"The New York Times\". He's been breaking in stories on Donald Trump's personal finances since 2016, including incredible investigation into two decades of Donald Trump's tax information that you and several porters got to hold up and went through. I want to talk to you about what has happened here. Yesterday, one of the things that we heard from Donald Trump was him railing against this $175 million bond and the confusion or the questions over whether or not it was done properly by the state attorney general. What does that tell you as you've looked into his finances for so long, what does that tell you about where he is in his finances now? RUSS BUETTNER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Well, I think first it tells you that his finances are the most important thing in his life in the perception of that, right? The perception that he is in mostly wealthy &amp; that everything that he has is worth billions of dollars is what matters most to him and his identity. I think that that number is so important to him, as you said, that he's like really wrestling with to make clear that he's got that money and that its all there. Tells you just how close it is to the line. When we looked at his finances since \"The Apprentice\", it's sort of dwindled off in popularity. That money had cut off. The money from licensing fees had really dropped with the popularity of \"The Apprentice\". His finances had really diminished over the last few years. He sold some assets. So, we had for the first time a little more cash. He was really low in cash.",

Those -- that produced a little bit of a windfall, not quite covering as tall investment in those things, but still, he's got a little bit of cash but that's about it. And this puts him right on the line. And if he gets more below that much, he starts to have a difficulty, maybe even making payroll. He's going to be living off of the cash flow of those businesses.So I think this is really an existential moment for him that decision, if you lose the 475, he has a major problem. He will no doubt have to unload some assets and probably into a market and a situation that's not going to be good for him.",

Now, just before that, the judge said what were here for today in this hearing is to find out if Donald Trump will be held in contempt for any of these alleged violations of the gag order. I am here, not far from the court with CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, and, of course, Kaitlan Collins, as well. This hearing is on. The judge by the end of this could hold Donald Trump in contempt. REID:  Yeah, it's totally possible. And we heard a right that you can see on your screens, as prosecutors are talking about how these posts pose a very real threat to these proceedings. He goes on to say that these posts both intimidate both the defendant's direct targets and others who may be called to testify during this trial. And the point of the gag order its to protect witnesses, protect the jury, protect prosecutors, people who are just either doing their job are complying with their civic duty so that they are not intimidated, that they are not harm first and foremost, but also that they are not afraid to participate in these proceedings.
