And they're saying that a lot of these failures were ultimately preventable and have not been resolved in the months since the assassination attempt occurred.And look, one of the biggest and most shocking revelations in here, according to lawmakers, is that nobody that they interviewed from the U.S. secret service or local police law enforcement could tell them who was actually in charge --",

Take a listen to what Senator Gary Peters -- obviously, he is the chairman of the committee that put this report together -- what he said when they asked that simple question to these witnesses.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. GARY PETERS, (D-MI) CHAIRMAN, HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE:  We could not find one point of contact who said this is the person in charge of making sure the plan was adequate and making sure there were supervision that it was being implemented properly. So, we found a lot of finger-pointing of saying, well, it was a collaborative plan. Many people worked on it, but no one individual. We had local law enforcement saying they weren't being told. We had secret service saying they were telling them. It was clearly not what you would expect to see when it comes to securing a principal like the former president.",

They lacked a plan to secure that building that the shooter ultimately climbed on the roof of and fired those shots at the former president.And then there's also ineffective communication, radios were not working, people forgetting to pick up their radios that would have allowed them to hear warnings about a suspicious person prior to the shooting. There was also a breakdown in intelligence sharing before the rally happened. And specifically this relates to that threat from Iran.",

There was credible and clear intelligence passed along to the secret service before the rally on July 13 about that threat. There were some additional security assets provided, but not the entire presidential-level package that the acting director says that Trump now receives. So, there are some questions as to why more assets weren't provided given that heightened threat level there.And then of course, there was the unclear chain of command and inadequate surveillance resources. The surveillance resources couple along with that entire package that Trump didn't get until after the rally. So ,ultimately look, you have lawmakers, Republicans Rand Paul, Democrats like Senator Blumenthal, all agreeing that something has to change at the service and Senator Blumenthal said very clearly today that he thinks that those changes have to happen that the top of the secret service leadership.",

I covered the White House years ago. It's not just the president who relies on the secret service and their talents and remarkable dedication. It's people who work for the president. It's the press who covers the White House.And yet, they are historically very -- I mean, they follow the rules and they're very, very cautious about speaking out. It takes a lot for them to want to speak out about frustrations internally and your new reporting reveals that -- reveals a lot because they are speaking out. [12:35:00] BETSY KLEIN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRODUCER:  Exactly. I mean, this is a notoriously tight-lipped agency. People don't want to talk about exactly what you just laid out and yet, now they are talking. And one former agent I spoke with, he suggested that the assassination attempts on Former President Trump really are symptomatic of a deeper- rooted problem at the agency. And they also just underscore the strain that this really unprecedented threat environment and the high- intensity, high-stress workplace has really placed on these agents. And just talking to our sources, current and former agents, we are getting of a picture of this agency with low morale, burnout, staffing and retention issues, and also poor management. And just to walk you through a little bit of that on staffing, the Former Director Kimberly Cheatle, she said that they need 9,500 employees at the secret service. Right now, they have about 8,100. So there are some gaps there and they're having a hard time keeping the agents they do have. There are retirement -- retention issues, attrition is a huge problem. Just think about the long hours, the enormous amount of travel, little work-life balance, and a lot of frustration with management. And then another issue that consistently comes up is pay caps. A lot of these senior agents are subjected to a federally-mandated pay cap, so they are working overtime and once they hit that cap, they're working without pay.",

Voters under the age of 35, what have we got? We got Kamala Harris up by 12 points. Now, if we thin ourselves down a little bit, let's go under the age of 30. What do we have? We have an even larger lead for Kamala Harris. She's up by 17 points. But I think it's really important, Dana, to put this in a historical perspective as well as a perspective of what the other polls are showing. So let's do that right here.Let's take a look. All right. Democrat versus Trump, under the age of 30, if you go back to September of 2020, look at this lead that Joe Biden had. He had a 28 point advantage, but Joe Biden was really struggling among younger voters when he dropped out of the race in July. Look at this, he was only up by seven. Now, look at the average right now, this includes our CNN poll, which is actually very close to the average, includes some other polls as well. What do we have? We have Kamala Harris up by 18 points. So she's doing significantly better than Joe Biden was when he dropped out of the race, but ten points worse than he was doing back at this point in the 2020 cycle. So it's sort of a half empty, half full type of glass if you're kind of looking at it. But let's dig down a little bit deeper. OK, let's go into those swing states and I want to look at what I think is one of the most interesting nuggets. This is not from our CNN poll. This is from The New York Times/Siena College, but I really think it gives you an indication that voters under the age of 30 are not a monolith (ph). Let's look at men voters, and let's look at female voters, women voters. Look at this, among women voters, look at this lead for Kamala Harris in the key swing states for voters under the age of 30, a 38 point advantage. Male voters, men voters, Donald Trump was actually leading them by ten points. That is a 48 point gender gap, woof -- but of course, are these voters going to actually turn out and vote? Extremely motivated to vote in the 2024 election? Overall voters, look at this, 64 percent for voters under the age of 30, it's just 49 percent. I think the key question isn't just who they're going to vote for, it's whether they'll turn out and vote.",

The manosphere is not that important compared to real bread and butter issues. We call them meat and potato issues when we are talking about male voters. On the economy, on prices, on health care, on social security and Medicare, it turns out men are not too far gone and most of them care about normal economic things and their dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party on some those economic things.
