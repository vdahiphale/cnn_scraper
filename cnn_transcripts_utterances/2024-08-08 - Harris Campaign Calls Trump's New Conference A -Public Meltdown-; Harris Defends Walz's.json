As you can see, it reads: Donald Trump took a break from taking a break to put on some pants and host a press conference. You see there that they actually did cross out press conference and then followed it with public meltdown. The statement goes on to say, quote, he hasn't campaigned all week. He isn't going to a single swing state this week, but he sure is mad Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are getting big crowds across the battlegrounds. Democrats clearly not shy in their assessment of what they saw this afternoon, but was it really a public meltdown? Donald Trump at the podium arguing that his news conference was more important than campaigning. You can judge for yourself. Here's some of this afternoon's event.

And the matter of 15 in days, Kamala Harris picked a vice presidential running mate, got the DNC to vote for her by ballot, virtually, which is also unprecedented, to make sure that she was going to be at the top of that ticket and is now going into a big convention, and is now moving around the country, having massive rallies with constituents. At this point, there's a lot on her plate and so, it is not surprising to me and I'm not disappointed that she didn't decide that her top priority was to sit down with the press. Now, of course, she needs to be asked questions and she should come prepared to the answer tough questions and have the press be able to have that forum with her.

I mean, you just talked with Aisha about why the Vice President hasn't really sit with any journalist.

If you constantly bring that message before journalists, eventually, the journalists going to say, you know what? [19:15:02] That's a good question. We probably should ask the vice president, why are you changed your position? Why are you moderating? What's different now compared to before?

In fact, he took these allegations so seriously that he responded in both local papers. And I'm going to read what he said in both instances.And here's what he said in July 2006. He said: On Saturday, the free press printed a letter which implied, I embellish my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by the free pass and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that this letter is meant to slander my good name. And for the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard, and retired as a command sergeant major. In May of 2005, I served in three NATO missions, the Arctic, deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving Italy in 2003 and 2004. Using innuendo to defame candidate's character has no place in this debate. This nation must do better because we have many important issues to face. That was how he responded to one of those editorials. And then in November of 2006, there was another editorial that made a similar claim and he responded by saying, if you were confused about my service, you could have checked. My website simply had the decency to call me and ask. And when you dishonor a veteran, you dishonor all soldiers and veterans, you own apology to all those who served honorably. And I think something that is important for us to note here, too, is people sort -- even if people took away from those ads that they thought he was leaving open, that he served in Iraq or Afghanistan, in interviews that we looked he did describe his service accurately, including saying in one, I did ten months with Operation Enduring Freedom where by the luck of the draw, I served in Italy.",
