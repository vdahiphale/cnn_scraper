But that's not stopping him from announcing new policies and cajoling foreign leaders, including a back and forth last night with the new Mexican president.Plus, I go one on one with Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat who lost his race for reelection this month. His blunt message to his party, win back working-class voters, or face years in the electoral wilderness. In Palm Beach, Florida, home to Mar-a-Lago was once a Democratic stronghold, now it's the center of the MAGA universe. We'll look at how Donald Trump's reelection has changed the lives of the people who live there. I'm Manu Raju in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Two very different Thanksgiving messages this morning from the president the United States and the president-elect as they prepare for the transfer of power. President-elect Trump posted this message on Truth Social early this morning, saying, happy Thanksgiving to all, including the radical left lunatics who have worked so hard to destroy our country, but who have miserably failed and will always fail. Don't worry, our country will soon be respected, productive, fair and strong, and you will be more than ever before, proud to be an American. And moments ago, we heard from President Biden. He was visiting a firehouse on Nantucket, where he's spending the holiday. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These comments are significant for President Biden, who was really refrained from weighing in or criticizing any of Trump's policies since the election earlier this month.

He's expected in a short while to make some calls to troops who are serving overseas, away from their families on this Thanksgiving holiday. For President Biden, it's a family tradition to spend the year -- the Thanksgiving holiday here on Nantucket, and this will be the final time he is here as president, as his time in office is starting to wind up.",

What we have seen from him is just trying to calm everyone's nerves at this point and telegraph that he is fully going to participate in a peaceful transition of power, something, of course, that he was not afforded four years ago.But listen on this issue, I think Democrats are hoping that if the former president pushes too far, once he is in office, that he is going to confront some of the very same challenges that Democrats had. And that is in terms of the cost of living. You don't want to do anything to make Americans' lives more expensive. That was part of the message that we received in this election.",

And he's much more comfortable into the role that he's inheriting once again.So, he is eager to contrast himself with the outgoing administration and really install the policies that he promised, and he feels are going to catapult the country like a rocket, he would say, economically, in during his administration.

It's kind of unclear whether he's going to follow through on these tariffs right away.So what Republicans are going to say as well, he's just using this for a negotiating position. He's just using this for leverage to stem border crossings, stem fentanyl coming into the country, but we also know he'll follow through on that. And I don't think Republicans want him to, because that's probably the biggest opening for Democrats politically. Is if Trump, like Eva was talking about, his actions end up raising prices, start to wreck the economy and things like that.

A spokesman for the senator-elect told me in a statement, quote, Sherrod Brown is a bitter career politician who's lashing out because he has to find a real job for the first time in his life and work for his paycheck like everyone else.All right, Burgess, you are in the Capitol. You talked to Sherrod Brown. You were down in Ohio covering this race. Could he have done anything differently to change what happened here and is his rest is -- can Ohio ever come back in the Democratic column?",

He was dragging him down. He over performed, as you just saw in that graphic. You all put up significantly, the second highest over performer.And in the end, he did a little better than Tim Ryan did in 2022, but clearly there's a little bit of a lid on Democrats performance there. But if you're looking ahead to the next election, and there's already some pressure on Sherrod Brown to run again, right? Because he's going to be one of the -- even if he lost, he's still one of the -- one of -- if not the strongest candidate they could possibly put up in the special election to replace J. D. Vance. I think Democrats should take that race seriously. That's been a more competitive state in these Senate races than like Florida has, which is hard to imagine, 10, 12, 14 years ago.",
