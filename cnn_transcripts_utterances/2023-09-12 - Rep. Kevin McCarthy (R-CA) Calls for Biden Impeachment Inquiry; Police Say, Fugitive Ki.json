His own Republican members have said so. He vowed to hold a vote to open impeachment, now he flip- flopped because he doesn't have support. This is extreme politics at its worst. The Biden campaign also piling on. A statement from the campaign says that Kevin McCarthy cemented his role as the Trump campaign super surrogate by turning the House of Representatives into an arm of his presidential campaign. And a new statement out just moments ago tries to double down on that message, that ties McCarthy to Trump and saying that this inquiry has echoes of the 2020 campaign in which former President Donald Trump sought to bring the Hunter Biden business issues into primetime. Now, it remains to be seen exactly how the White House takes the messaging from here. We had expected from our reporting with senior Biden aides that there would be a coordinated messaging effort with senior Democratic allies on the Hill, that a playbook was being built and that there were several dozen aides in the White House counsel's office that have been hired specifically for an effort that would see an impeachment inquiry as a crescendo of sorts.

It's a possibility it would be a suicide by cop.(END VIDEOTAPE) [18:30:06] TODD (on camera): One of the possible advantages that Danelo Cavalcante may have tonight, police say, he has been in this area and is familiar with at least part of it. One of the possible disadvantages, he could be on the move shirtless. Police say that he ditched a green hoodie and white T-shirt at the foot of the driveway of that house where he was fired upon by that home owner. And at last word, they have no reason to believe that he had other clothing on him. Wolf?",

He has absolutely nothing to lose.He's already sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. And if he wanted to surrender, he would have done it a couple of weeks ago.

However, they also haven't gotten any lucky breaks, right?This guy has been able to slip through their perimeter a couple of times. He's gotten lucky breaking into homes, stealing the things that he needs to survive. Now, he's been able to arm himself. But he continues to hide out in a fairly large, very heavily wooded, remote, hard place to search. So, the job for the state police is not getting any easier. It's, in fact, gotten a lot harder, for all the reasons that Chief Ramsey said. This guy is now armed, and that is going to have an impact on the searchers and how careful they need to be, how alert they need to be and how they go about their business. They just need to start getting lucky. BLITZER: Yes. This is such a dangerous situation. Chief Ramsey, you're the former Philadelphia police commissioner. You know this area, the perimeter, well.

And so time is critical. But at the same time, he can't be sloppy. They have to be careful trying to find this guy. He's extremely dangerous to everyone. And if they do find him, again, he doesn't surrender peacefully, then there's only one thing that the officers are going to be able to do to resolve this issue.",

Just a few short years ago, this moment would have been unthinkable, the Russian president asking a North Korean leader for help to resupply Moscow's once-mighty, now-broken army?

The House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's announcement today directing congressional committees to formally launch an impeachment inquiry into President Biden.Let's discuss this and more with Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California. He's a key member of the Judiciary Committee. He's also a candidate for the U.S. Senate. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. As all of our viewers will remember, you led the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump back in 2019, which was also started without a full House vote. What do you make of Speaker McCarthy's move today to launch a new inquiry into President Biden without a full House vote? REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Well, this is really based on two things. It's based on the weakness of Kevin McCarthy's speakership, the fact that he doesn't have the moral authority with his members, doesn't have good control over his conference. And is beholden to the most extreme elements who want an impeachment of Joe Biden, an impeachment without evidence. And second, this is, again, Kevin McCarthy doing the bidding of Donald Trump. Donald Trump wants to somehow dilute the stain of his impeachments. He wants to try to weaken Joe Biden going into the presidential election. So, this is Kevin McCarthy doing what Donald Trump says, once again. And I'll tell you what it's not. It's not impeachment based on high crimes or misdemeanors or any evidence of such things. This is essentially evidence-free impeachment, and it is purely politically motivated by McCarthy and Donald Trump.",

The conservatives want him to renege even further. And as a sop, this appears to be the bargain, I will give you impeachment.Now, an impeachment is a serious thing.
