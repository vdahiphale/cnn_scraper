After months of calling Biden incompetent, Trump making fun of Biden on a regular basis, saying he can't string two sentences together, they are now singing a very different tune. They say they know that Biden can show up. They are expecting him to show up. They say that he has been at a week of debate prep, and they are preparing for him to be on his A game. This again is very different from what we have heard. Now, obviously Biden and Trump have had a very different kind of debate preparation. In fact, his advisers won't even use the word preparation when it comes to talking to Trump about what they do ahead of the debate. Now, interestingly, Trump himself has said that it's been difficult to prepare for the debate, they are quoting several interviews that Trump has done, as well as the fact that he has taken questions at various events. But I will remind you, at these events, and as well as those interviews, these questions have all come from supporters as well as friendly interviewers.However, they say that Donald Trump is ready and will be focused on three main topics, that being inflation and the economy, immigration, as well as crime rates. They believe that Donald Trump polls better than Biden, according to recent polling they have seen, in these topics, and they have urged him to stay on message, to focus on this, even when it comes to other questions, to pivot away from topics like abortion, as well as democracy, and to go back to those three key issues, which they believe are core to voters.",

But I can tell you from hearing from a number of people close to him, which is they actually believe the format, which they have relentlessly complained about might help Donald Trump in the long run. One of the things that they had complained about was the fact that there was no audience, because Donald Trump gains energy from an audience. Now, I have heard from advisers that they are hoping this actually helps Donald Trump,Ttat maybe gaining energy and going on those rants that he believes make his base excited or something that they don't want him to do, that instead this will keep him on message.The other thing that was pointed out to me was this idea of muting the mics that, as you saw there, Donald Trump himself, and he has said this privately as well, that he was a little bit too aggressive, almost badgering, according to some of his allies, this idea that the mics are going to be cut off, while they complained about it. Now, there are several advisers and allies who say, maybe this is a good idea. If you can't hear Donald Trump badgering or going after Biden relentlessly. Again, just to stress this, they want him to focus on three things, all of this contrasting to President Biden's current administration.

They don't think that it serves the president and they don't think that it's been moving voters. Polls have persistently shown that the economy and inflation are among their top issues and that they side with the Donald Trump on those issues by a varying margin. And so they want him to move away from that.And the Biden campaign, in ads that have come out in recent weeks, appears to be doing that.

He wasn't out there campaigning every day during the primary season. He too lives in a bit of a bubble of being a former president.

Given your experience in helping these other presidential candidates prepare for debates, what's your recommendation to the two current candidates? FMR. SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): Stick to the issues and be on offense. You know, whoever has the best command of the issues and has a message to get out, keep it succinct. And who sticks to that and talks about the positive aspects of what they want to do I think wins. In this case, I think if you're Donald Trump, you talk about immigration, we talked about this earlier inflation, crime, and be sure that whatever the question is, you know, you're sort of coming back to those issues. And then a general theme of this is a change election, people want change. And one thing I disagree with is that early analysis, I think the last election was a change election too in a different context. But this time I think that's an advantage for him.

So, again, this gives him just a little bit more leeway, particularly heading into the debate in just a couple of days.What it doesn't allow him to do is to talk about the prosecutors in this case, the court staff members, any of their family members or the jurors. The judge, Juan Merchan, in this case saying, listen, while the trial is over, there is still proceedings that have to happen, pointing to July 11th.

So, I don't think any of the evidence will be thrown out on that challenge.With respect to Defendant Trump's additional challenges of spoliation of evidence, attacking the evidence, because -- alleging that it was mixed up in the boxes in its original order, was not maintained, I think all those claims are likely to fall short.

They have been exempted from this conscription really since the foundation of Israel, so since 1948. Now, we know that the Haredi are planning to carry out some protests and it's not good news for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, because he has two ultra orthodox parties within his ruling coalition. And if they now pull out, that could put his future in jeopardy.Recent polls, though, do suggest the majority of Israelis polled do support the exemption for the Haredi Jews to be part of this mandatory military service to be lifted. And they do support that everybody should have to be part of this conscription. Wolf?",

Iran's supreme leader urging people to go to the polls.Every time there's low turnout in elections, the enemies of the Islamic Republic and the envious denounce the Islamic Republic, he said. With the Middle East in turmoil and Iran recently close to an all-out war against Israel, people here have many issues on their minds. We will defend Gaza and Palestine through massive turnout in the election, this woman says, all people will take part in the election, and we will prove that the Islamic Republic of Iran has a word to say in the world. We should all take part in this election, this man says, to have a good choice, so the country will come out of this difficult situation. I will not vote, this woman says, I want the country to be strong, but I have not seen much action on their part. There are six candidates remaining in this presidential race and their posters are plastered all across cities and towns around Iran. People are also handing out leaflets like this one. Most of the candidates that are still in the race are conservatives, but there is also still one moderate up for the vote. Masoud Pezeshkian is a former health minister and heart surgeon by training. He calls for improving relations with countries across the region. Just the way we can talk each other, we can also learn to talk to our neighbors and the rest of the world, he says. But Saeed Jalili, conservative candidate and Iran's former chief nuclear negotiator, ripped into moderates and the nuclear agreement they negotiated with President Obama, but then President Trump walked away from. Not only did the economic situation of the country not succeed, that the economic growth became zero and negative. As Iranians celebrate in streets of Tehran, their eyes are set on the near future and who will govern the Islamic Republic in very challenging times. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And, Wolf, while this country will be getting a new president, one thing that's unlikely to change is Iran's foreign policy. The country's leadership having made clear that they will continue their hard line towards the United States, and, of course, towards Israel as well -- Wolf.",
