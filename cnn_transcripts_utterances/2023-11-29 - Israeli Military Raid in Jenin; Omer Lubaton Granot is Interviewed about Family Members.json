As we've been discussing, this is the sixth and potentially final day of the six-day truce agreement to get hostages freed from Hamas as they're being held in Gaza. Just this morning the Qataris telling CNN's Kaitlan Collins that they are optimistic, hopeful that they can soon announce this truce will be extended further. Now, that is huge news for the families of the 161 Israeli hostages still being held captive in Gaza. And even before then we are standing by right now for the release of ten more hostages today. Joining me now is Omer Lubaton Granot, he's the founder of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. His cousin, Chen Goldstein Almog, and her three children - and three of her children were held hostage by Hamas for more than 50 days, just released on Sunday, though her husband and her eldest daughter were murdered by Hamas terrorists in the October 7th attack. Omer, thank you for coming back on. I told you in the break it's so wonderful since the last time we spoke to hear the news that your cousin and her children have been released. How are they doing since they were released Sunday?",

They've lost their home. I mean, they've lost almost everything. GRANOTthey've been through. And we need to understand, like you said, on this horrible day, October 7th, Chen know - Chen knowed before that Nadav was shot, her husband. She was hoping for a miracle that he is still alive but she understand that chances are low. She saw the body of her eldest daughter, Yam, and she has been through this hell of 50 long days. And now she's coming back and she doesn't have a home to return to. Their parents, Chen's parents and Nadav's parents are also from the same kibbutz. They also are - they're displaced for almost two months. So, rebuilding would be very, very hard and they don't even know where will it be? How will it be? You know, how will they do it? Those people who were returning from captivity don't have homes to return to. It's a huge tragedy that it's only starting and it can -- there are wounds that will never heal and there is stuff that will take years to rebuild. So, we give them time. They get the professional support they need. They have a very supportive family in Israel. I sit here in New York, but we send the help and the support that we can from here. And I think that they need, you know, time and space and do it step by step.",

But what we hear from the stories and from children, that the captivity is harsh, the reality is -- it's unbelievable.There was a story about Emily. She was only nine years old. She was so scared, she only whispers still till today because she's -- and she saw that she was spent (ph) in (ph) jail. Atan Halomi (ph), the child that you mentioned, had to watch horrific videos and was threatened if he would cry, with a gun, you know, to his head. Sisters of other children told them that Hamas have told the children that their whole family has died, that nobody's wanted them back, that they don't have a home to go to. They tried to scare the children. They suffered from malnutrition. They lost weight. Sunlight was -- they didn't have sunlight or hope. But we do know that some of them are exposed to the media and sometimes can hear radio. And we do know that some of them sent messages -- messages to the other family through the one who was released. And we get signs of life, which is -- give us some hope. And if they hear us I think our mission is to tell them that we are fighting very, very, very hard to bring them home because I don't think we, as a forum, and Israel as a whole, and the whole of the Jewish community all over the world, and we do hope the international community and the U.S. will keep and help us because we won't stop until we will see all of them coming home because there are still more than 160 people in there. It is the biggest hostages crisis ever. It's unbelievable. And we need the support of everyone who can, of every stakeholder in the area.",

George Santos is expected to hold a press conference tomorrow morning ahead of this potential vote to expel him. And there's still a question whether or not there will be enough Republican support to eject him from Congress. But, obviously, this is a huge moment for the Republican Party, a huge moment for the new speaker, Mike Johnson, who has yet to say publicly whether he personally supports trying to expel George Santos.But there were resolutions that were introduced yesterday, one from Democrats, one from Republicans, both of them now privileged, which essentially sets the clock for when Congress has to vote on them. So that is why we believe this could come up tomorrow. And it's going to be a huge moment for Republicans. So far leadership has made clear that they want members to vote their conscience. They are not planning on whipping this vote against George Santos or for George Santos. They want members to make their minds up individually. But, obviously, Sara, a huge moment. And this isn't the first time that they have tried to expel George Santos from Congress. There have been past efforts. What makes this one so different is the fact you now have that ethics report that so many Republicans say was so troubling and really helped them change their minds about now wanting to try to expel George Santos after maybe in the past voting against that resolution.",
