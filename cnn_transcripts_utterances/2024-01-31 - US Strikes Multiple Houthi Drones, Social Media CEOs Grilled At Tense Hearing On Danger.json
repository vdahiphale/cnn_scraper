But also in the past the US has targeted anti-ship ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles. The goal here is to target these before they can be launched. That is before they pose a security threat to ships operating in the region. We have seen recently, the Houthi successfully strike a number of ships, including an oil tanker that burned for quite some time issuing a distress call that the US and other warships responded to, so you see the threat the US is trying to get at here.",

It was picked off or intercepted or shot down by the close-in weapon system, CIWS, that is effectively an automated gun that intercepted this, tracked it, and was able to shoot it down. The question, of course, how did it get to within a mile? There was a successful interception there, but experts and analysts tell us the fact that it got that close is a cause for some concern here. They will have to look at how that happened. Again, that's the closest the Houthis have got successfully to a warship.

Today, Senate Republicans met behind closed doors, debating whether to shelve a bipartisan -- bipartisan border security deal being negotiated by one of their most conservative members and said to be the toughest in generations, one that once upon a time, their House colleagues were demanding or else they would not even start considering aid to Ukraine and Israel.That is until the former president came out against it or any border legislation several weeks ago, at first privately, but once word got out, loudly and publicly. No bill needed, he said, which then drove House Republicans to start trashing the very thing they originally said they wanted, criticizing it, as Anderson pointed out last night, by mischaracterizing what is reportedly in it. Despite not having seen the actual text of it, but also crucially disregarding assurances by the lead Republican negotiator, the staunchly conservative James Lankford, that what they're objecting to is not part of the deal. Namely, that it would somehow let 5,000 migrants a day into the country before the president could take serious action. This is what Donald Trump said today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That's a terrible bill. 5,000 people a day, that's a lot. That's like record-setting stuff. No, I want to see a great bill. If we get a great bill, we should do it. If we don't get a great bill, but I don't think you're going to get a great bill, and if you're starting at 5,000 people a day, it's insane. It's insane. (END VIDEO CLIP) BERMAN: So, that has been the refrain. House Speaker Mike Johnson and many House Republicans have been saying it today. Republican Senator Ron Johnson said it.
