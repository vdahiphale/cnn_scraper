He is in Egypt trying to make his way to Gaza to assist healthcare workers there. It's good to have you on, sir. You are trying to get to Gaza. How? DR. MADS GILBERT, CLINICAL DIRECTOR, EMERGENCY MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OF N. NORWAY:  Good evening, Becky. I am trying to get to Gaza together with a small emergency medical team from Norway. To get to Gaza, you have to travel through the Sinai Desert, which is closed military Egyptian territory. So, you need a number of permissions and we have not obtained these permissions. Actually, nobody is allowed to access the Rafah Border to send in teams. So, it's a very difficult situation. And the complete siege of Gaza is now the main medical problem in addition to the bombing, because there is lack of fuel, water, food, medical supplies, in particular water and fuel, because the hospitals cannot run without water and fuel for the generators. But of course, the overwhelming problem now are the 20,000 plus wounded and the main medical advice now it's to stop the bombing and to stop the production of more wounded and more killed.",

Just how important is it that the world agrees that there should be a humanitarian pause, ceasefire, call it what you will at this point, to allow for support for the people of Gaza at this point?DR. GILBERT:  Let's put politics aside to the extent that that is possible. For the current moment, tonight, on this very dark night, there will be hundreds dying who could have been saved because of lack of capacity, lack of medication, lack of operating rooms, ventilators, incubators for the newborns and lack of security for the ambulance teams. It is mandatory now for the world to say 6,000 killed children is enough. 19,000 wounded civilians is enough. Now, let us take a break. Let us stop this insane bombing and let us protect the hospitals. Get water, food, drugs, medicines and foreign staff in, not because they can't do it in Gaza because they're very clever medical staff, but because there are simply completely overloaded. Only in Shifa hospital, they have 100 patients with more than 40 percent burns and the majority of them are children. They will die if we don't solve this now.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday that Israel was starting the next phase of the war. CNN's Jeremy Diamond joining me now from Ashkelon. And it's clear that this phase of the war has at least been successful on the part of the Israelis as far as their strategy is concerned. They say, at least, that they have had success in taking out 150 underground tunnels, that was yesterday, and then with more targeted attacks today. Do we understand -- is it clear at this point just how much of the Hamas military infrastructure -- they talk about government as well, but military infrastructure has actually been taken out, Jeremy?",

The American Canadian star made his name with his witty portrayal of Chandler Bing on the sitcom \"Friends,\" which became a television phenomenon. The people who came up with the show are remembering Perry as a brilliant talent and someone with a giving and selfless heart, they said. He was found dead this weekend at his Los Angeles home. Perry was just 54. Authorities say there was no foul play. Sources quoted in the \"L.A. Times\" said that he died in an apparent drowning accident. Tributes are pouring in from around the world and we'll have more on that reaction, plus what the actor and writer hope that he'd be remembered for, and that is coming up a little later on this hour for you.

He believed that people were talking badly about him at these locations that he targeted.They say they also found a note. And in that note, they didn't describe it as a suicide note, but certainly what this shooter talked about and what he was telling family members sort of gave the impressions that when this was found that the shooter thought that he'd be dead. And in that note, he talked about bank accounts, information for his bank accounts. He talked about a cell phone, the passcode for his cell phone that family members would be able to access. And all of this is happening as law enforcement, the FBI and other law enforcement officials are continuing to pour over the crime scene, gather evidence. They say that's going to go on for several more days.

There are growing cries in the International Community for Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and ease the humanitarian crisis. The Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli airstrikes are causing damage to the al-Quds Hospital, one of the biggest in Gaza City.Israel has told the Red Crescent to evacuate that facility and has warned that Hamas fighters are hiding in and around the hospital. Meanwhile, Israel pushing into Northern Gaza. CNN has seen evidence of Israeli ground troops at least two miles inside the Gaza Strip. Israel also says it killed several Hamas fighters who popped out of a hidden tunnel near Gaza's Erez's crossing. And just moments ago, the Israeli military revised the number of hostages being held in Gaza. It now says 239 hostages were taken from Israel on October the 7th. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today, for the first time since Israel expanded its war against Gaza. It comes as the Israeli prime minister is facing political backlash at home for comments he made on X, formerly known as Twitter, in a now deleted post. The prime minister said, Israel's intelligence and security services failed to anticipate or warn against the October 7th mass attack. And said he never received a warning. Mr. Netanyahu has since issued a rare apology. That apology starting with, I was wrong, which is very rare coming from Benjamin Netanyahu. Let's talk about more on this. Ronen Bergman is a senior correspondent for Military and Intelligence Affairs from \"Yedioth Ahronoth,\" Israel's largest daily paid newspaper. He's a contributing writer at the \"New York Times.\" And he joins me now from Tel Aviv. When I read Benjamin Netanyahu's tweet, which was an apology, it did start with the three words, I was wrong, which isn't something you generally hear from the Israeli prime minister.

This horrific massacre and after all the other seniors in the defense and the intelligence leadership already said we take responsibility and gave the impression that they will resign after the war and the inquiry (INAUDIBLE). At the end of the day -- and he didn't. But this one, because he needs the two opposition leaders, Eisenkot and Gantz, the former -- two of the former chief of staff. Both of them turned so aggressively against him. Why did he defame the leaders of Israeli intelligence during war?

But at the core of this, there's a T junction between two roads and the prime minister. And for that sake, it's not about Netanyahu. Netanyahu is trying to save his neck from the inquiry, basically says everybody ought to be blamed except me. We should not put any blames, his people and followers are saying, but they're blaming everybody.But the T junction is there for any prime minister, not just Netanyahu. You can take a right turn and follow the line of the government and the military since the disaster and say, we will eradicate Hamas or dismantle the military and organizational infrastructure under Sinwar, basically saying this because of revenge, but also because the psyche, the mindset of Israeli leadership and most of the Israeli public is that if Israel doesn't do that, doesn't dismantle Hamas, then Israel is doomed to lose any kind of deterrence in the Middle East. And Hezbollah will be next trying to do to Israel the same. The left turn represents, I would say, the same kind of holy value for Israelis. The Maimonides said there is no bigger mitzvah, no bigger religious edict than the redemption of prisoners. And for years, this was the upper sign of friendship, of common values. And now, it's not one Gilad Shalit soldier that was taken in 2006 in return for 1,027 by Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011, we're talking about their own 150. And once you take the road, once he took the road after many hesitation of ground offensive, it's almost at least as long as the ground offensive takes place, it's almost a probable end to any kind of negotiation.",

The U.S. was one of 14 countries that voted against that resolution, with 45 abstaining.

Perry once said what he really wanted was to help others who were going through the same pain.I want to bring in CNN's Camila Bernal. Camila, Perry spoke about addiction at a time when it was more difficult to do so. And obviously, unlike some other mental health issues, it can have a bigger impact on an actor's career to be outspoken about substance abuse and alcoholism. It was very important for him to make sure that that story was out there.",

And he was very open about his struggles and not just, you know, in interviews as he got emotional talking about this, but he detailed it all in his memoir that was released in November of 2022. And like you said, he wanted to help other people. He said, whether it was, you know, one on one or with a group, he wanted his struggles to be something relatable, something you could share with other people.He also, you know, said he wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well, loved well, and who was a seeker. Of course, so many of us remember him from his acting career. He started out with very small roles and then got more prominent roles. And of course, \"Friends\" is really the one that made him famous. Chandler just bringing so much joy and laughter to many, many people around the world. So, it's part of the reason why many are just expressing their love for him on social media, saying that they're shocked and that they are heartbroken. A lot of people just wanting to understand exactly what happened, and this is all now in the hands of the Los Angeles Police Department. They say that this is a death investigation. The 911 call came in on Saturday at 4:07 p.m. for a water rescue emergency. And the \"Los Angeles Times\" saying that he was found unresponsive in his hot tub. The cause of death has not been revealed yet, but we do know that his body is now with the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office. Normally, a complete toxicology, a complete autopsy take several weeks. So, we may not have those details anytime soon, but we do know that it is the LAPD investigating and sources telling CNN that no foul play was suspected here. So, as we wait for those details, we continue to get tributes and just heartfelt messages from many of the fans as they say, this is going to be a big loss or is a big loss for Hollywood and for the fans.
