And the Ukrainians were absolutely furious. I spoke to them over the weekend. The FIFA had rejected or rebuffed their offer to put out a video -- a recorded message from Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, talking about that general urging of peace to these millions of fans that would have been watching the final around the world. The FIFA haven't rejected -- haven't responded to that at the moment. But what the Ukrainians told me is that they were told by FIFA that the message was too political. It's something that the leadership of FIFA didn't want to put across on the World Cup final. And the Ukrainians, though, pushing back, saying look FIFA shouldn't be frightened about putting a message of peace out in what is meant to be a celebration of peace through the World Cup. Nations can prove that their -- who's the strongest on the -- on the playing field instead of on the battlefield. That was the general message of Zelensky's address. And so, yes, the game has happened now -- it's all over. It was an amazing game.

This could be, perhaps, because of the influence of the AP Stylebook or maybe multiple dictionaries spelling it that way, but Chanukah with a c has one thing going for it. Limited polling of Jewish Americans show they actually prefer Chanukah with a c. And all the local synagogues that I searched actually do spell it with a c. Bottom line, it's a transliteration. There is no one way to spell it. Now, why is Hanukkah a U.S. holiday? Well, it -- this is very unique. It's a very unique holiday for American Jews. It wasn't really celebrated before the 1800s. Then rabbis -- get this -- rabbis in Cincinnati connected a gift with Hanukkah because they wanted to be part -- they wanted American Jews to be, sort of, part of the American holiday season without having to celebrate Christmas. Now, get this. Hanukkah is important to American Jews in more -- in more ways than just that, right? More Jews own a Hanukkah menorah -- 81 percent -- than any other Jewish item polled. It is the rare holiday that about as many Americans as Israeli Jews -- of as many American Jews as Israeli Jews always celebrate by lighting the menorah. And one last little nugget for you.
