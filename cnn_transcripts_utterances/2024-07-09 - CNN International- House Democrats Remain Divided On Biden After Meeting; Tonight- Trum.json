Why doesn't anybody in the president's family urge him just to go to get checked out to say the coast is clear?KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Okay. So, just to step back just a little so bad because I think you weren't in a briefing room last week. I don't want to go backwards, but just to share a little bit about that night, the president said it was a bad night. He talked about it. He had a cold, right? He talked about his schedule, right, being abroad. And so we spoke about what that night was like for him and we understand what the American people saw, what you all saw. We've spoken to that. And I also would say and I think you know this, Peter, you've covered a couple of administration at this point -- administrations at this point that the president, every president has a White House medical unit that is with him 24/7, that is available to him 24/7. That is unlike any other American, right? That is not the norm. That is uncommon. Just down on the other side of the colonnade is where the medical unit is, and I did share in -- that the president checks in while he's exercising with his doctor on a couple of times a week. And so, he has that. He has something that most majority of Americans all Americans, I would probably argue, don't have, which is a full medical unit that is with him at all times and he gets a full, full, full physical annual physical that we share with all of you and that is very different. Very different than an everyday American who sometimes they're lucky if they can go get a physical. They have to get into a car. They have to take public transportation. The president has, again, a medical unit that's with him here at the White House and travels.",

One of them Steve Cohen said today, not only is they're not on the same page, but they're not even in the same book. How does the White House -- is the White House concerned about that?JEAN-PIERRE: Look, we -- I've said before. We respect congressional -- congressional members. They have their opinions, we respect their opinions. Many of them that we've got -- we had to opportunities to deliver really, really good results on behalf of the American people. But there is the whole Congressional Black Caucus, they support the president, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus support the president. Those are pretty impressive numbers. Senator Coons, Senator Fetterman support the president. There's also another list here that shows support for the president. You're going to have some congressional members who feel differently. It is -- that is -- that is up to them, right? The president wants to continue. He's going to have those conversations. He's going to engage were congressional members, he's going to continue to do that as he has. That's not going to stop. Obviously, the campaign is doing their work. We're doing -- continuing our engagement with congressional members, as we do pretty much all the time on whatever issue we want to work with them on. So that's not going to change. You heard from AOC, the congresswoman from New York. She said the matter is closed and I support him, right? You heard from Maxwell Frost, who was on CNN today, gave -- was very supportive on CNN. So you do have others out there just today -- just today or yesterday, giving support to the president. I can't your mentioning one person, but there are others as well.",

He then went to a watch party afterwards, which you have brought up. I was at that watch party. If he did have a cold, why then pushed into another event where he spent some 45 minutes along the rope line?JEAN-PIERRE: And not just -- and I would add to that, it wasn't just a watch party. We landed at 2:00 a.m. in the morning in North Carolina, he greeted hundreds of North Carolinians in North Carolina. He woke up the next day in North Carolina, gave a speech in front of, in front of thousands of North Carolinians. No, no, no. I'm just -- I'm just trying to lay your give you gave me an opportunity and I'm just using that opportunity, obviously to lay out what the president did in those two-and-a-half days. Look, you know, one of the reasons that we shared that he had a cold is because during the debate in real time, everybody heard his hoarse voice and folks asked, and we were able to we were able to confirm right away that he had a cold, and that -- and that he was also tested negative for COVID. So we were able to share that in real time. So just also want to share that. Look, he pushed forward, right? Many of us have colds and we still pushed forward. He's the president of the United States. He understands how important it is to continue to get up every morning, regardless of how you feel, right, to get things done. That's how this president is. I'm sure that's how many presidents before him were as well when it comes to really not letting a cold get you down. And I think that's also why he pushed forward in the debate also on that night. So, look, he pushed forward, try to get things done, wanted to make sure that he had an opportunity. People who watched him do a debate, who were waiting for him, people at 2:00 in the morning in North Carolina who will waiting for him. He wanted to make sure that he engaged with Americans.",

Americans out there, folks who are watching, who would not normally in the day-to-day of what's happening in this world, there's a comprehensive medical, full comprehensive medical report on the website, whitehouse.gov. I would encourage them to take a look, to take a look, read, read that report and they can also read for themselves what his -- his specialist, a group of specialists of coming out of the medical unit, decided on what they examine, what they saw, what they reported on. I think that matters as well. It is a group of them that come together when it comes to doing their physical, it is extensive physical. And so there's something there for them. It's transparent, it's out there. It's for them to read. It's for the American -- not just for you, for the American people to take a look.

Today on Capitol Hill, there was a series of huddles of House Democrats, Senate Democrats, and where, of course this was the main topic and Senate Democrats met for an extended period today and were somewhat tight-lipped following that meeting, calling it constructive.But we know according to a source that a whole wide range of views on the path forward was talked about during that meeting, and that some stood up and he said that they have deep concerns about the path forward and potentially, Joe Biden's drag on the down-ballot races. But the path forward very clearly, not settled on. And you heard that as you referenced from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who emerge there and has just been a broken record repeating the same phase, \"I'm with Joe here\". Now, earlier today, the House Democrats huddled outside of Capitol Hill and notably they said that meeting carried a sense of sadness according to one lawmaker, he says the sadness that comes with talking about someone you love who is in an obvious decline. There is a very real struggle and House Democrats specifically worried about potentially losing the house, losing their seats not been able to flip black the houses, which is their ultimate quest if Joe Biden stays on the ticket. Here's just a little but what how some House Democrats told my colleague Manu Raju this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JASMINE CROCKETT (D-TX): Biden has one before when people thought that he couldn't win. If you'll remember, he wasn't the guy that was running ahead of everyone. He can do this. REP.

As we have reported, there are three names that I've continued to float to the top of the list. That is Senators Marco Rubio and JD Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Of those three, only one of them is here tonight, Senator Marco Rubio. Now that's not that surprising. He's from Miami. This is hometown. It would seem strange that while he's in the running for vice president, that he wouldn't show up and speak at a rally that Donald Trump is giving in his hometown. But obviously, we're reading all of the tea leaves, trying to figure out who exactly he is going to choose, and when exactly he is going to make that announcement. Donald Trump, not really doing any favors to any of us journalists because he seems to be the openly pondering. In a recent interview last night, he said he might be waiting to see what happens with Joe Biden, he might not. That could impact his choice. It could not, very Trumpian kind of remarks. But one thing we do know is that this list keeps shifting. Every person you ask will tell you a different order among those three men. That's all because Donald Trump changes as his own opinion and his own decision-making by every person he talks to, and every person he talks to influences who they talked to in terms of reporters. [15:35:02] But, of course, we are keeping a close eye on this. Here's the one thing we do know. He is going to announce before Monday. That could mean he announces on Monday morning, but that is the deadline. So, right now, we're looking at a lead up to that. He has this rally tonight also on Saturday, he has a rally in Pennsylvania, obviously, battleground state, very important state, could be an announcement there. But, right now, it's really a big question mark, not just to us, but even some of the people who are closest to him.",
