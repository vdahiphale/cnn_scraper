For me from the state of Iowa, what's their opinion on biofuels and on environment and energy? Where do they want to go with health care? Where are they on reducing prescription drug prices?

The president needs to make a national address on why we need to be involved in Ukraine. This comes from the president. It should come from the administration. They're in the capacity to do that, and they have failed to do so. They have also moved slowly. They were slow to apply sanctions. Slow to respond. So, the American people deserve to know what our involvement is in Ukraine, whether we're into when, what the oversight is for Ukraine, especially given the president's previous dealings with Ukraine when he was vice president.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Kate. Well, we were actually on the battlefield here in Eastern Ukraine earlier today, and we asked the troops down there about all this. And they said they're absolutely concerned about what's going on in the House right now. Whether or not there could be delays in U.S. funding, which of course, then would most probably translate into delays of weapons and ammunition for Ukraine as well.And, first of all, just to set the scene. I think people who would come down here find remarkable how much American gear is already on the ground here, how many weapons, how many vehicles, and then of course, also ammunition as well. But the troops that we spoke to on the ground there who were using American weapons, they told us that they were already running short on ammo for those weapons. Howitzer ammo, 105-millimeter, and 155-millimeter ammo is something they really need. And they understand that you know, if there is some sort of hold-up in some sort of delay with certain types of ammunition, maybe some European partners could step in and bridge that gap for a while. But there are things here in Ukraine that the Ukrainians are constantly using here on the front line that only the United States can supply. If you look at, for instance, the ammunition for multiple rocket launchers which is being used to a great deal here. Those HIMARS rocket launchers, that's something they can only get from the U.S. So, right now, a great deal of concern, I have to say, from frontline troops about what's going on in the United States. And all this comes, Kate, as Ukrainians are trying to press an offensive here in the east of the country as well, where they need more ammunition anyway. And now that uncertainty certainly makes things a lot more difficult for them. They say in any case, whether or not more aid comes, they're going to have to keep fighting because they believe, for them, everything is at stake. But the big question for them is, can they keep winning if there are holdups in U.S. aid? Kate.",
