He'll be sworn into office, marking the end of weeks of protests and deadly government crackdowns.Yunus is an 84-year-old banker who was awarded the Peace Prize for his pioneering work on microfinance, developing small microloans designed to lift people in Bangladesh out of poverty. Student protesters have called for him to be temporarily the leader of the nation.

Well, now he has his opportunity to run this interim government.As you say, he has just arrived in Dhaka. We're showing you those pictures we saw moments ago of him greeting military officials, dignitaries, and we are expecting him to address the media very shortly. There is so much hope and expectation that the 84-year-old will be able to form a stable interim government, restore law and order, and return Bangladesh to democratic rule. He's a Nobel Peace Prize winner and created microfinancing for the poor, and he has been asked to head this interim government after a month of chaos in Bangladesh. These mass student-led protests and then the violent government crackdown that ensued, it killed hundreds of protesters and ultimately led to the toppling of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government. You know, Max, her 15 years in power had grown increasingly authoritarian, you know, crushing all opposition and dissents. Now, you notice he congratulated the brave students who he said took the lead in the protests, but he has appealed for calm and he has warned, let me read it to you. Violence is our enemy. Please don't create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country. Now, let's have a listen to what he told reporters before leaving Paris at Charles de Gaulle's airport.

Let's recap what has happened in Bangladesh this past month.It began early July, these protests over a quota system that gave preferential treatment in government jobs, and then it morphed into something far greater when former Prime Minister Hasina, whose father, of course, was the founder of Bangladesh, ordered police and her security forces to crack down on the protesters. And then over the following weeks, hundreds of protesters were killed, but they continued to take to the streets, calling for Hasina's resignation. And then on Monday, the beginning of this week, protesters marched towards her residence. Hasina suddenly fled the country by helicopter to India, leaving her country in complete chaos. And in the wake of this power vacuum, yes, there were celebrations, but there was also this uptick in attacks on the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. They make up 8 percent of the population of more than 170 million people, predominantly Muslim. Homes and Hindu temples have been attacked, and neighboring India is extremely concerned. They fear that there will be a mass exodus of Hindus trying to flee across the borders. So Yunus, whose interim government will be sworn in later this evening, has a huge job ahead of him trying to restore peace and obviously prepare the country for new elections expected in the next few months -- Max.",

Not that successfully.But secondly, this is a war of sort of narratives, right? Russia wants to paint Ukraine as the aggressor. Meanwhile, Ukraine, another potential reason for them to do this is to show the Russian people that Russia cannot defend its borders, that this war is not a good thing for them, is not some noble fight as the Kremlin tries to paint it.

His profile page on the Olympic info site actually says his aim was just to take part here in Paris. But he's now celebrating gold, having taken the 400 meters victory in a personal best time. And it was a quick one. The fourth fastest time ever run over the distance. He came from fourth to first to beat the pre-race favorite, Matthew Hudson-Smith of Team GB. The fight and the grit he showed clear for everybody to see. When he was asked afterwards just how he did it, he said, well, you can't outrun a dog. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUINCY HALL, U.S. OLYMPIC ATHLETE: The race was anyone's at that point. I just wanted to keep doing what my coach told me to do. Just keep driving, keep driving, get home. We do a lot of hard practices. And then we focus on coming home at the end of each practice.

This time, it was Australia's Nina Kennedy taking the victory ahead of her U.S. rival and the defending Olympic champion, Katie Moon, who finished with silver. Kennedy had missed out on the final in Tokyo three years ago through injury. She's openly talked about her struggles with depression, how she fought back from that. This time, though, she soared to the heights of Olympic gold and actually gave Australia their first ever gold in this event, with more gold than they have ever won at any previous Olympic Games.We have today 25 medals on offer, one of the most brutal events. The women's heptathlon has already kicked off this morning. Belgium's Nafi Thiam chasing history. She's looking to become the first woman to win three golds in the Olympic heptathlon. Although the world champion, Katerina Johnson-Thompson, and Team USA's Anna Hall are both very much hoping to have their say. That one's going to be an epic battle over two days of competition. The big question tonight, can Noah Lyles become the first man since Usain Bolt to do the 100-200 meter double at the Olympic Games? He's unbeaten over the distance in 23 races, dating all the way back to the final in Tokyo three years ago. This is the one he says is his favorite of the events. It's his best chance of breaking a world record. But it was his U.S. teammate, Kenny Bednarek, the silver medalist in Tokyo, who actually posted a faster time than him in the heats. And he said, after his disappointment in the 100, he is a man on a mission for this one. But following that one, and it's really interesting how the dynamics have changed in terms of equality between the genders at this Games. Men's 200 isn't the final event of tonight. After it, we have the head-to-head that people have been waiting two years for in the women's 400-meter hurdles. It's the defending Olympic champion Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone up against the world champion Femke Bol, two athletes whose times are a second and a half faster than anybody else in the field. They're the only ones to have broken 51 seconds. It's going to be a tough night for Bol, though. Beating Sydney Levrone is the one that's described as the impossible job. But as the saying goes, Max, somebody has got to do it.",
