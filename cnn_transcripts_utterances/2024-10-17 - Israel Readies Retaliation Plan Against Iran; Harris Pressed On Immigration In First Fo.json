Getting past that and talking about, look, for Harris, I mean, this was, I think, a twofer. On the one hand, she wanted to try to reach some Republican voters who are disaffected from Trump. You know, there's mostly independents rather than hardcore, Republicans. But also, I think she wanted to show toughness, right? I mean, I think she -- and to a large extent, she succeeded in that by pushing back very hard at the Fox, you know, host when he was essentially repeating Republican talking point, but also asking some legitimate tough questions.

I mean, they were -- they were -- they were good, strong, substantive questions.  I think, you know, it reminded me of, you know, when Trump is someone who is most comfortable existing within a kind of conservative media sphere and energizing his base through the tropes that work in that sphere.Tonight, when he was trying to talk to a general -- a more general audience, he really couldn't reach much beyond those arguments. I mean, he doubled down on, you know, he claimed not only that Haitians are eating pets, but this is what is being reported. And he's just repeating what's being reported when, in fact, what's being reported is a litany of officials from the mayor to the governor to the police department saying it's not true. He referred to the January 6th rioters as we, you know, and called it a day of love which I would be surprised if it doesn't end up in a Democratic ad at some point. And at various points during the evening, you could see kind of the stunned look on the face of the audience. He was most effective at the beginning and basically making the argument that will explain, I think, why he is probably on track to improve among Latino voters. The very first question, why do groceries cost so much and what can you do about it? I mean, there are a lot of Latino families, like a lot of working-class white families and a lot of working-class black families that feel they are worse off at the end of the Biden administration than they were at the beginning. And that is a real opening for Trump, and that is a structural challenge or headwind that Harris faces. But what we saw in 2022. Was that there was an unusually large number, maybe an unprecedentedly large number of voters who were dissatisfied with the economy, but still voted against Trump's style candidates because they viewed them as unacceptable on other grounds, a threat to their rights, their values, and to democracy. And I think you saw some of that again there tonight. This is the push and pull on the last few points of voters. They're dissatisfied or disappointed in the outcomes they've gotten under Biden, but they remain reluctant to return Trump to power for all of the reasons that he has put on rather vivid display in the last few weeks talking about Haitians eating pets and the enemy from within that he is willing to use the military against.",

Houthis have repeatedly attacked commercial shipping and navy assets in the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.One official says the U.S. strikes were carried out by B2 Spirit bombers. Now, those are much larger fighter jets that carry heavier bombs than the U.S. has used against the Houthis so far. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says the employment of U.S. Air Force B2 Sprint long range stealth bombers demonstrate U.S. global strike capabilities to take action against these targets when necessary, anytime, anywhere. A source tells CNN Israel's plan to respond to Iran is ready. American officials expect the retaliation before Election Day here in the U.S. November 5th. Iran launched a missile barrage at Tel Aviv and Israeli military bases earlier this month. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly told the U.S. Israel will target Iranian military sites, not oil or nuclear facilities.

The Israeli military killing at least 16 people in multiple strikes in the southern Lebanese city of Nabatea. 52 others were injured, according to the Lebanese health ministry. One of those who was killed was actually the city's mayor.He was killed when one of those airstrikes hit a government building in the heart of that city. The Israeli military says that they were going after a Hezbollah compound that they say was underground belonging to Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces and they accused Hezbollah of using Lebanese civilians as human shields. But the Lebanese prime minister is accusing the Israeli military of deliberately striking that government building at a time when local officials were holding meetings about emergency relief operations in southern Lebanon. No immediate comment from the Israeli military on that allegation. Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, we are continuing to watch as the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is continuing to deteriorate. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza now in the crosshairs of that deteriorating situation. Also, of course, in the crosshairs of Israeli bombardment and fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants in Jabalia. One of those key cities in Northern Gaza. This is, of course, the fourth time that we have seen Israeli troops carry out a major ground operation in Jabalia but this time they are also calling on hundreds of thousands of people to evacuate northern Gaza, forcing many to flee, but others have been trapped amid the bombardment. And the humanitarian situation is simply worsening, with United Nations now calling the situation in northern Gaza catastrophic. The U.N. Human Rights Office said it took one of their teams 10 tries on Wednesday to actually be able to reach hospitals in northern Gaza where they were delivering fuel and supplies. Meanwhile, of course, we're seeing the United States putting major pressure on Israel to improve the humanitarian situation. Some steps have been taken, according to the U.S. State Department, but it's clear that much more still needs to be done. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Jerusalem. BRUNHUBER: There's been an outpouring of shock and grief from musicians and fans around the world over the untimely death of Liam Payne, an English singer who was part of One Direction, one of the bestselling boy bands of all time. He was 31. Police in Argentina say the singer fell on Wednesday from the third floor of the hotel room where he was staying in Buenos Aires. Hotel staff had requested urgent police assistance in the moments before Payne fell. The hotel manager said they were concerned about the wellbeing of a guest who was tearing apart the room and staff couldn't enter. Payne's fans gathered outside the hotel and set up a makeshift memorial to pay their respects. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP)",
