It tend to happen in athletes who are competing at a higher level. Basketball is one of those sports where you tend to see these types of sudden cardiac arrests more. And the more minutes that you are playing, the higher likelihood of it happening. Now again, this is rare. So I just want to be clear that no one is suggesting that, you know, you tailor the number of minutes and things like that. But built on that is dehydration and other things causing the heart to work harder, possibly bringing something like this on. So it may have been an underlying condition that may not have posed a problem yet in someone's life, but as you're going through these different paces, different conditions, taxing the heart harder, it could have elicited an electrical abnormality. Could have elicited something with the muscles of the heart now leading to the sudden cardiac arrest. People who have sudden cardiac arrest, if they can figure out what caused this, there is a possibility that they could address this and that he would go on to play. And you know, be able to play at the level that he was playing before. Again, that's speculative. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The U.S. president's son is charged with two federal tax misdemeanors for failing to pay taxes on time. The plea deal will also resolve a felony gun charge if he abides by court- imposed rules. Hunter Biden owed at least $100,000 in federal taxes for both 2017 and 2018 but didn't pay what was due by the deadlines. Meanwhile his legal team denies that they lied to court officials inorder to get filings from a senior Republican lawmaker removed from the docket. The judge had threatened them with sanctions after a staff member allegedly misrepresented who they work for. Biden's legal team says the entire incident was unintentional and a misunderstanding with two court clerks. And allegations involving Hunter Biden have the House Speaker threatening to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden for the first time. We'll have a report from Capitol Hill on how lawmakers are reacting. Now the extreme heat wave in the U.S. is unrelenting and expanding. Tens of millions of people are under heat alerts as the extreme temperatures continue to shift to the east.

The heat is still going to be in the Southwest, but we're going to start to push this jet stream farther to the north and warm up big cities. Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, all the way into the Northeast as this bubble of air here begins to push farther and farther and farther closer to bigger cities.A lot of heat right here in the central part of the plains. Temperatures are going to be 105. We're going to see heat indexes 110 in north-central plains. But for Vegas, you're still going to be above 110 for a couple more days. Phoenix the same story. So even though you are losing the big core of the heat dome, you're still going to deal with an awful lot of heat here for at least the next three or four before you even get back down to normal. We are adding tens of millions of people here to the heat advisories over the next couple of days. That heat slides to the east. Look here, this Friday, 97 in Chicago. Now it won't feel 97 if you are by the Lake Shore, but if you get toward Aurora and Schaumburg, you're definitely going to feel that kind of heat. Kansas city, 101, may be even warmer in parts there especially with the heat index. The humidity is really going to be with the heat here the rest of the week for that matter. And temperatures as we work our way into the end of the weekend will be breaking more records. At least 180 possible records still and not only now in the desert Southwest.

But of course, we're not out of the danger yet. And in Avia, which is right behind me, you can probably see it a little bit in the distance. It's very hazy because it's also very hot and because there is smoke coming out.We just heard that although things have been improving, a new fire has just broken out. So it's extremely difficult to assess how things are going to develop in the next hours ahead. Greece is going through the hottest day of its summer today. It is 46 degrees Celsius in many parts of the country -- that's 115 Fahrenheit. And with strong winds blowing in most of the country as well. So apart from what is actually happening on a day-to-day basis with all the phenomena we're seeing now, a lot of questions have started arising about, you know, the future of tourism. We have seen massive evacuations. The biggest evacuation in Greece's history from Rhodes, one of the country's most touristy islands where its economy is so dependent on tourism. And a country that the economy is dependent and about a quarter on tourism alone. So now with everything that's happening, there's a lot of debate. What does this mean? Where is this going to lead this country, the rest of the Mediterranean? The Greek Prime Minister has spoken about being at war with the fires and has actually acknowledged that we're going through a climate crisis. So once the shock and the, you know, the panic subsides about how people are going to go out and what happens next, the debate is moving on to what this means for the future of this country and the region in general -- Max.",

We don't know the circumstances. And we don't even know how long he'd been in Ukraine. He's been out there in the 15 months since he was freed in that hard-fought prisoner swap that the U.S. negotiated amid reports that his health was deteriorating. He's out there tweeting. These been on television. He's been advocating for the release of other Americans who are detained in Russia. So we're trying to find out more information about his condition. But meanwhile, there are questions around what this will mean for the ongoing negotiations as regard to Paul Whelan who has been there more than four years, arrested and now convicted.

A potential UPS strike has been called off for now. The shipping giant and the Teamsters have reached a tentative deal on a new contract. Amongst the issues raised were air conditioning for delivery vans, demands for significantly greater pay and closing of pay gaps between workers. The tentative agreement still needs to be ratified by about 340,000 UPS Teamsters to end the threat of a strike all together. The CEO of one of Britain's biggest banks in the U.K. -- one of Britain's biggest banks -- resigned late on Tuesday night. After admitting that she leaked financial details about Brexit campaign and Nigel Farage. Alison Rose, boss of NatWest, says she made a serious error of judgment by discussing the political commentator's relationship with the bank to the BBC. Last month Farage revealed he had been dropped as a customer by a major U.K. bank -- or rather downgraded in terms of accounts. The BBC reported his accounts had been closed for commercial reasons but he still retain the general NatWest one. However, Farage obtained a copy of the bank's report which appeared to confirm that his political views had played a role in that decision.
