And everybody is shocked if not surprised that he met this untimely death in his penal colony in the far north of the country. You're joining me now in the middle of Moscow, but right outside the FSB headquarters, where you can see people are still coming. There's a lady just done that man. Some more people over here. They are coming to pay their respects to offer sympathy and condolences to the family and friends and the organization of Alexey Navalny. These are all the flowers that have been put down so far. Just go ahead. (INAUDIBLE). And as I say, this is a monument to the victims of repression during the Soviet period. And so, it's interesting that this is the place where people have chosen to come and pay their respects to Alexey Navalny. There is a photograph of him here, somebody's laid that. People are putting traditional red roses, children's picture over here, saying -- on the tombstone there, Alexey Navalny, heroy, which means, hero. And that's how, of course, many people in this country see him her as. Now, just the act of putting that flower on this memorial is risky in a country like Russia, because all kinds of dissents, all kinds of political opposition have been crushed by the Kremlin. And even though people are doing this now, it's not large numbers. But as a steady, steady flows, you can say, shows just how angry and how much people are sort of braving that repression to come out and put these flowers on this money. Remember, across the country, hundreds of people have been dragged from these snowy parks, in towns and cities across Russia, and taken away and detained for doing exactly this. And so, it is a huge risk that people are taking, because there's a whole line of people coming here now. A huge risk that people are taking for come out and pay their respects to Alexey Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure.",

Since of course, a lot of things started there in the Donbas region. It was known as a place that was also very fortified. Obviously, a lot of those positions had been in place for a very long time. And just from that perspective, it certainly is something that is hugely significant for the Ukrainians. Also, the way in which the oldest went down over the weekend is definitely something that shows all the things that you were just talking about, namely that the Ukrainians at this point in time are badly outgunned by the Russians. And a lot of places on the front line, but specifically in that one, where the Russians really managed to bring a lot of firepower to bear on the front lines there, but also that they're unmanned. And I think one of the other things that you mentioned is definitely the case also. A lot of those troops that were fighting there in Avdiivka on the Ukrainian side, they had been there for a long period of time without being able to be rotated out. So, that shows some of the challenges that the Ukrainians have been dealing with. Again, this retreat happened very quickly, happened under fire, apparently, over the two days of the weekend. So, it goes to show that the Russians definitely able to bring a lot of that firepower to bear on that part of the front line.

Europe continent is no longer continent of peace. We are at war, whether we like it or not, it was not chosen by us. It was chosen by Putin. He attacked one of the European nations. Not yet European Union, but, you know, from his perspective, it might not necessarily matter that much. That means that it also requires a European response, we have to do everything that we can, because this is what we must do. There is no other way. Now speaking about specifics, currently, the situation is such that we ourselves have drawn to us red lines that we would not cross. We need to erase those, we need to make strategic dilemmas for Putin, so that he would not know how to calculate that, because at this point, he does. He knows what we are not going to do, what we're not going to step, he knows that we are not united. So, for him the battle, the strategic level of the battle is quite easy. We have to change that. We have to disrupt the field, invent new strategy, admit that maybe something was not going quite well, what we decided in the past, rearrange the whole thing.

But, on the other hand, and that has been a major discussion point during the Munich Security Conference that Europe has to step up as well.

But there's a complication for the West here, as India refines the oil and sells those products on.
