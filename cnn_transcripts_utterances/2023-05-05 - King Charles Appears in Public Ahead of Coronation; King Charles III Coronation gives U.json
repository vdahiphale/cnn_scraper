Look at how happy all those well wishes are. These are likely people who have turned out many of them may well have camped trying to get their spot ahead of time. We're told the Princess of Wales is also on the Mall right now speaking to people and has actually said that her plan is to \"go wherever the fun is\" so that sounds like this royal walkabout will be very engaging. It's been a busy day. You know, this is the day before the coronation, you know the huge events the first in 70 years King Charles and Queen Camilla have had rehearsals. We've seen some royal escorted cars heading to Westminster Abbey earlier this morning. There are also of course, plenty of heads of state and dignitaries who've traveled from all over the world to be here. And many of those will be hosted at Buckingham Palace later today. So quite a busy day for our King Charles the third ahead of this huge ceremony tomorrow no doubt he'll be looking for an early night I imagine. Oh, look, he's there some lots of flags there. Lots of people and you know what it is not I know you're in the studio right now. I can tell you the British weather.

So it's a very warm King Charles, as we were both discussing, he looks very happy. He looks very comfortable in this position. Look, another bonnet there another red bonnet. This is an immense moment I think for these people that were hoping to see something at the coronation tomorrow. But a day early, they actually get to speak to the King, meet the King, shake hands with the King for those that do your point that have traveled all this distance to see him.

And you made such a great point about the kind of crowds that we saw for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth the second of the support that we saw there and same again here for those that are perhaps questioning support for the monarchy that certainly not evident in what we're seeing in terms of the sheer quantity of the crowds a day before the official coronation event, big smiles, clearly great joy and people being happy to see him. Admittedly, these are the most buoyant of supporters. But certainly this is a great showcase, I think for the country and support for him too. And we were just seeing images as you were talking, of course, as well of Kate and William and she always manages to engage with families, I think in children as well, which is quite nice.

What's useful about this, just seeing all the back and forth is really trying to engage with the public. And you're right there has been some criticism of a coronation. Not everyone is on board with a ceremony that is, you know, incredibly exclusive and elitist because that's what it is, the anointing of a King by God. Of course, many people in U.K. don't have Christian faith, but they are doing what they can feel the royal family to engage people where they can. And we've seen that in the last few days, we'll certainly see it, I think, tomorrow with a huge recession. We'll see on Sunday with the street parties on Monday, there's a huge volunteer effort. All this I think to try and make sure that people feel included in this event, which could otherwise feel purely elitist and exclusive. And it's an ancient ritual and tomorrow, there will be a lot to it is very, very solemn so also creating the celebratory moments around it. I think it's important at this point.",

I mean, one of the big differences, I think, between the coronations that we've all seen in film of his mother, Queen Elizabeth, the second is that all these individuals will have captured it on their mobile phones. There are a lot of selfies being taken and he, to your point, clearly enjoying this moment and being really for the first time on not a solemn occasion, this center stage and truly in the spotlight and the limelight. Yes, so obviously, that I think the pageantry will pull people in on the day, tomorrow, it will be truly spectacular but then there's the separate story about Charles the current monarch that he's going to be and whether he can use this opportunity to really express himself and as a person, away from his mother, away from his children, away from Diana Eden, really asserting himself as an individual. He feels he's very confident and can have a very strong reign. There's no suggestion that Williams is going to take over anytime soon. I don't think he really wants that either. And I think there will be a really poignant moment tomorrow when the one person that's going to pledge allegiance and kneel down in front of the King will be the Prince of Wales, William. And then of course, we've got this public homage, which has been pretty controversial where you know, the wider world is invited to pay their homage to new King as well. Whether or not people do that or not, I think will be a quite an interesting tests. But you know, all the people that you're seeing Charles, with at the moment are, you know, they are the super fans, Julia, though the front of that particular section.

And they are clearly achieved, as you quite rightly point out the super fans. Talk to us about that homage and I think perhaps some of the misunderstanding and the message that the royal family was, and King Charles was trying to send with that. And perhaps some of the perception, particularly in the media, that this was something that was supposed to be less elitist in traditional form where peers would swear allegiance and actually opening it out to individuals across the nation on the Commonwealth and misunderstanding, perhaps--",

Actually, if you look at what they said, they wanted to invite people at home around the world, if they wanted to be part of that moment. And this was part of the idea of inclusivity that they're trying to integrate into the whole of this very ancient service. So bring other religious leaders into the ceremony, for example, bring female bishops in, bring children into the service as well, trying to involve as many people as possible. And there is this poignant moment after the King is crowned, where traditionally you would have lords and peers paying homage to the King, so showing his authority over the land. But they wanted to get rid of that because they felt it was outdated. And they wanted to bring the public in instead and they would be invited to pay homage in their own way at that moment. So that's where the lot of people feeling pretty upset that is being told to pay homage. I don't think that's what they intended. So they didn't mess up I think the communications around that. And we'll actually see how many people actually want to get involved but they're trying to include people in this event. And if you think back you know, just the King's grandfather, their way of including more people in that coronation was inviting four members of the working classes.

Whatyou're seeing here is robust hiring, and overall a slowdown in pay growth. So that's a positive signal that the Fed can kind of put in their back pocket to say, OK, I'm going to look at the credit signals. I'm going to look at the consumer sent signals, like when I look at the economic growth signals, but I know that the labor market, that signal continues to be robust, so I can really pay attention to these other factors going on in the economy. The labor market is actually adding strength and supporting the consumer. So I would read this data as one thing that the Fed doesn't have to worry about, which is the strength of the labor market in terms of helping the consumer.",

And as you say quite rightly, I carrythe Crystal Scepter which was given by Henry the Fifth after the Battle of Agincourt. It was traditional that the king would come to the city of London to borrow money to raise an army, which of course happened back in the early 15th century. The city being good bankers, took the collateral of the loan, we took the crown jewels as collateral to make sure we got our money back. And the gift from Henry the Fifth when he won the battle of Agincourt and got his crown Jews back was this amazing Crystal Scepter, which is very beautiful. It's not very heavy. But I wouldn't want to be holding it for more than the two hours that I will be holding it. It's absolutely priceless. So I'm wearing some calfskin gloves to give myself proper grip on it.

And the Princess of Wales too were also out, shaking hands, waving lots of smiles and celebrations it seems. Now to ensure everyone is kept safe more than 29,000 police officers have been deployed across London. Firearm officers, dog handlers, mounted police and helicopters all part of what the police call Operation Golden Orb. Royal Correspondent Max Foster is outside Buckingham Palace, warmed up and ready to go Max. It is going to be I think an incredible spectacle over the next couple of days. I could talk to you about Princess Kate shoes, but I'm going to skip over that and ask you another awkward question. How many times have you been asked what role Harry's going to play?
