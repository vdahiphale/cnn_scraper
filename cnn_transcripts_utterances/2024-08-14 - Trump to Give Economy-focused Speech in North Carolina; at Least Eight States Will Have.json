The Trump campaign, they've been trying different attack lines, he in particular -- too liberal, a chameleon, she won't talk to the press, attacking her racial identity. If the president, the former president, and his campaign are listening, what would your recommendation be based on the data that you see every day?",

You were ready to run against Joe Biden, unpopular, mental and physical health impaired, policies that failed the country. You're ready to, more or less, might win in a cakewalk.But the debate changed all that and the Democrats pulled a switcheroo. So Kamala Harris is not Joe Biden and I'm sure that President Trump is pissed off. He's angry the carpet was pulled out from under his case campaign, but it's not something they can litigate or even protest. It is what it is. It's a waste of time to do that. Move on, next play, get suited up, buckle your chin strap, embrace where you are right now, and prosecute the case against Harris.",

They think back four years ago when they say, you know, I feel like economically things were better when Trump was president. Right now, there have been a handful of polls that have come out showing that with Harris now in the nomination or presumptive nomination seat for the Democrats, that gap has closed.No longer are we in an era where Trump is ahead by 10 to 12 points over the Democratic nominee and part of that is because Harris has gotten a little bit of a pass. Attempts to link her to the Biden- Harris Administration, saying it all at once, saying, hey, she owns every bit of Joe Biden's economic record, that hasn't necessarily stuck yet, which doesn't mean there's no time for it to stick. Voters still do not feel good about the economy. They still feel very concerned. There is a chance for Republicans to prosecute this case and say, if you want a better economy, you need to go back to Donald Trump. But that's not what's happening when he goes off on weird tangents about Kamala Harris not being authentically black or tweeting strange things. I mean, we've had this debate a million times before. Donald Trump has to stay on message. He rarely can stay on message for very long, but he has got to.",

It's absolutely baffling to see someone who had done so much to have a message to say, look, I've done well on the economy. I think we should secure the border. It's an issue where you can say we need to secure the border, we need to know who is coming into to this country and voters will agree with you on that. But that type of message is not that.",

I agree that it's unlikely to have as much of an effect on turnout because already in a presidential year, anyone who has even thought about maybe turning out to vote is probably going to be brought out to vote. We are also seeing that that's the switch out at the top of the Democratic ticket, Democrats are reporting slightly more enthusiasm for participation in the election than they were under Biden.When Biden was the nominee, Democrats were depressed. They were frustrated and it was going to have to be an issue like abortion to kind of pull these people well out to the polls. Now, they are a little bit more, at least for the moment, we are still in that honeymoon period. So I don't know that necessarily abortion will be the turnout driver that it is in a midterm, as Neil said, a lower turnout election. But somebody like Trump is going to have to hope that there are a lot of split ticket voters in a state like Arizona or Florida where they have these ballot measures. People who will vote for Trump at the top, but then take them more pro-choice position on the ballot measure. Otherwise, he is looking at a really tough electoral map.",

Sometimes we think that standing behind a black woman as a leader does not display strength as a black man, as you were just saying. I'm here to tell you all tonight that it does the opposite of that, it displays strength. I'm standing behind a black woman to be president of the United States and it doesn't make me any less of a black man.I'm going to read one other quote. This is from W. Mondale Robinson, Mayor of Enfield, North Carolina. Ms. Harris is not a trusted messenger for black men. Everything she says will be looked at with a side-eye from black men because there's a lack of trust in politicians coming for you in election years, saying they're going to do something and then they don't -- didn't deliver on it. So that's less about sort of the gender issues and the race issues, and it's more about just like politicians shouldn't be trusted. But what is noteworthy about this dynamic that has been going on for years, all the way back to Shirley Chisholm, is that even if it is really miniscule -- KANNO-YOUNGS: Yeah.",

I think that's totally right. There are layers to this, right? We just described that uncomfortable truth, but I think has been a conversation within the black community for a while, but maybe just is not sort of amplified to more mainstream audiences. But there's other layers here too. I think what the mayor was referring to there as well as, look, the vice president has her own specific challenges here. For one, she has the challenge of -- she's a Democratic candidate and she has just jumped into the election. And for years now, I've talked to black men on the voter level, on the leadership level, who have acknowledged that there has been growing frustration, a feeling that, look, we are one of the more reliable voting blocks for the Democratic Party. And yet, I am not seeing my life improve at that fast of a rate despite my consistent support. So there's a frustration with the overall party. I think what the overall number -- I think the reporting shows what the overall system with the overall faith that the American government can deliver for you. That's what the mayor was referring to. But also with the vice president specifically as well, you've seen her lean into her prosecutor record her here as well. And that's been effective against the former president. But in the 2020 primary, we saw some backlash there as well.",
