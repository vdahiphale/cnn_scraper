Insurers are saying that statewide incidents by and large are covered for this and the industry itself is well capitalized to make any payments that are required, God forbid.But the problem is the knock on impact it has on pricing in a market that's already seeing prices skyrocket and Phil, it quite frankly, it's eye watering. Take Florida as an example, the average Floridian is paying $6,000 for property insurance this year, that's four times the average across other states. The industry itself is predicting a 40 percent, 40 rising insurance costs this year that follows a third rise last year. And part of the reason for this, quite frankly, is insurers the leaving 15 insurers left the state they stopped writing policies over the last 18 months. We've got double digit numbers going into insolvency or liquidity. And actually, the message is very simple. The business model doesn't work, the way that insurers work, they need to take in more money in terms of premiums than they pay in losses, or they stopped writing policies or they go out of business. And that's basically what you're seeing with these insurance leave. These are not the only problems. When we go and buy insurance and insurer like Allstate, for example, goes, and buys reinsurance to protect them. Those costs are up 40 to 70 percent, this hurricane season alone then add inflation into the mix. We talk about this a lot just to rebuild buildings in the United States over the past three years, those costs have risen 40 percent. That's labor and that's raw materials. This is a perfect storm, in terms of pricing and people like Floridians in California and Louisiana. They're all suffering the consequences.",

It's no secret that's their plan and that's their goal. But increasingly over the last several weeks, there's been acknowledgment within his camp.And his lawyers about how now with his mounting legal troubles with the four indictments he's facing. It's more likely than not he's going to have a trial in the middle of primary campaign season especially now that Judge Chutkan just roll that it's going to be March 4. [07:40:00] I think there's even as much as we saw Donald Trump say I'm going to have appeal this and whatnot and Ellie can speak to whether he can actually do that. They recognize that he's probably going to have to do this and that's very concerning for him because I think as much as they are benefiting from the short term political boost of these indictments. We're seeing them fundraise, a ton of money off of these charges. They're far more worried about the trials themselves.

When you're on a criminal trial, you have to physically be there as the defendant, we remember the E. Jean Carroll trial a few months ago, that was a civil case.Trump opted to skip that. He will have to be physically in the courtroom, it's a full day, it's a long day, trials usually start at 9, 10 in the morning, go to 4 or 5 in the afternoon, he will be in D.C., he will be in Florida. And so he will be physically off the campaign trail. And I think it'd be really interesting to see, from a political perspective, how does that play because presumably he'll be getting what while coverage, not the good kind when you're defendant in a criminal case. But presumably, he's going to get a ton of media coverage, but he's not going to be out there at rallies.

They really see these people as seeking a better life in the U.S.The Biden Administration views this as more of a human smuggling case than they view it as a potential terrorism case. So what happened here, Phil, was basically a case of bad timing. This group of Uzbek nationals presented themselves seeking asylum in the United States. They were vetted according to standard U.S. procedures. And then they were released into the United States pending a court date as is typical in this kind of incidents. What happened was that the U.S. only later developed intelligence that allowed them to understand that the human smuggling network that had facilitated the travel of these individuals to the United States had an individual in its group with some pretty troubling links to ISIS.

The U.S. also broke up the smuggling network.And Turkey at the behest of the United States detained the ISIS linked smuggler that was involved in this group. And that allowed the U.S. pretty quickly to determine that this person was really more like an independent contractor. He was not a member of ISIS. He was somebody who just sort of had personal sympathies with the group which gave them some confidence pretty early on, that this was more of a human smuggling case than it was a potential terrorism case. So for some officials that we spoke to this whole episode is really evidence of the system working the way it should. The U.S. received additional intelligence about a group of migrants inside the United States they investigated, and they determined that they likely did not present a counterterrorism threat but for some counterterrorism and intelligence officials that we spoke to in the course of our reporting. This episode was a lot more alarming for these people. The whole incident just shows the how vulnerable the United States is to the possibility that terror groups like ISIS could try to essentially sneak across the southern border by hiding amid sort of the flood of the surge of migrants seeking asylum in the United States.
