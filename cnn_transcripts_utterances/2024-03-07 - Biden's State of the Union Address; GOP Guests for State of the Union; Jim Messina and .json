Each person, obviously, is a sign, a signal about the Republican messaging plan, as House Speaker Mike Johnson has urged Republican lawmakers to show respect during the speech. You just heard Congressman Ralph Norman from South Carolina saying that he does hope that Republicans behave in the chamber there. CNN's Kristen Holmes is near Mar-a-Lago, where Donald Trump will be watching tonight. Kristen, this list of Republican guests, who's on it? What does it tell us?",

And it really shows that Speaker Johnson is using this as a platform to highlight those priorities with one glaring exception. So, let's pull up the list of just some of the people who will be there with Speaker Johnson tonight.The first one is that outlier. That is the parents of Evan Gershkovich. Obviously, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter who has been imprisoned in Russia. Speaker Johnson himself has come under fire for not passing Ukrainian funding so that they can fight against Russia. But the rest of this reads like a play-by-play of the Republican list of priorities. One, you have the parents of service members who were killed in the Afghanistan withdrawal. You have, on immigration, two NYPD officers who were attacked outside of a migrant shelter. You also have someone who was kidnapped in the Israel-Hamas war. You have people from cultural issues who have focused on that, an advocate for women's single spaces, as well as a man who has been outspoken on biological men in women's sports. The other thing I want to point out here is what you talked about with Johnson urging respect and decorum. Sure, that is inside the chamber and he can say that to his members in his position. But what happens outside the chamber? What happens with former President Donald Trump, who is not necessarily known for his decorum, or respect levels, because we know Donald Trump plans to live post all about the State of the Union, reacting in real time, pushing back on his social media platform Truth Social. The other thing I want to point out is what was launched earlier today by the super PAC that is aligned with Donald Trump. And this was an ad that started airing on cable, particularly on a program that Joe Biden is reported to really like, and this was hitting Biden particularly on his age and mental acuity. At one point a narrator even asked, could he even survive another presidency? So, again, you have Johnson on one hand, you have this ad coming out the day of the State of the Union on the other hand. But, obviously, as we know, the issue of age, mental acuity, fitness for office, that's going to come into play and going to be a huge factor in this election in November.",

When I ran President Obama's campaign, I said to him all the time, look, it's a referendum on the incumbent. The incumbent usually loses. If it's a choice, he will win. And that's the choice he's going to lay out in pretty stark terms tonight, but he's going to do it with optimism, he's going to do with hope, because that's one place President Trump just won't and can't go.",

And it's within the margin of error, but up in four points in two, and two points in the other.

And so people are going to start thinking about, OK, how do I make this choice?And tonight really is one of the two moments that an incumbent president of the United States gets to make his case directly to the public, the State of the Union and his speech at the Democratic National Convention. So, it's a high-stakes moment for him to look at the country and say, here's what I'm doing to make your life better, and here's what the other side isn't doing.

You didn't pull the trigger, your son independently did it, but you are the one that needs to be held responsible here. And it's 15 years in prison he's looking at. And it's precedent setting because this is the first time that a parent has ever been charged with this. And one big issue that he has against him is he bought the gun for Ethan. It was Black Friday, four days before, Ethan was begging for it. He went to the gun store with him and he got it. He was the registered owner. And that assumes a responsibility.

But when they went into the sheriff's department right after the shooting, he sat down, he said, I hid the gun. I hid the gun in the armoire and I hid the bullets in another place. And so the jurors -- you know, during jury selection there are a lot of gun owners on that jury and they talked about the care that they have with their gun. One potential juror yesterday said that I -- I store my gun unloaded in a case. Another person said, I store it unloaded in a locked safe.

I'm working on a draft and we have to have a House version of this. It won't be all that different from the Senate, but it will have things like the Repo Act, which allows us to attach Russian sovereign assets, to be able to tap into those resources so that Russia has to pay for their own war crimes. And also things like a loan program for direct government assistance. Those things together, I will tell you, Kate, they're the majority of the majority on both sides of the aisle.
