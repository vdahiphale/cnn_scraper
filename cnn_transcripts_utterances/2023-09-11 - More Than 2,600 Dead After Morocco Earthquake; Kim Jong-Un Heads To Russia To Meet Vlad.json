I'll be speaking to one rescue worker on the ground as they race to find survivors. Then North Korea's Kim Jong-un is on his way to meet Vladimir Putin in Russia. U.S. officials warned an arms deal could be on the cards. We'll have the very latest for you on that. Plus, thousands are taking to the streets in Jerusalem ahead of a Supreme Court hearing linked to the judicial reform plan. We'll be live at those protests for you. But first this evening, Moroccan rescue teams have reached the epicenter of Friday's deadly earthquake. Aid trucks and recovery equipments arrived in Ighil on Monday. Three days after the quake first struck. The 6.8 magnitude earthquake is most powerful to hit Morocco in more than a century. And many people are still trapped, waiting for help to actually reach them. Key roads into the remote Atlas Mountains are blocked by landslides as well as debris. And rescuers have been relying on helicopters to get vital supplies in. On the ground, residents are digging through the rubble, hoping to find more survivors. The death toll is nearly -- it's already nearly 2,700 people and expected to rise. Our senior international correspondent Sam Kiley has this report now from the Atlas Mountains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another victim buried, returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2,000 people perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years. Most of the debts were in villages in the Atlas Mountains where homes cracked and crumbled late on Friday night. (on camera): The pancaking of these buildings down a side street here in Moulay Brahim killed 25 people. Three or four are still missing, believed buried in the rubble. And this is a patent that has been repeated throughout this province, and it looks very often like there's been some kind of airstrike, the collapsing buildings here actually leaving holes as if they'd been hit by Russian bombs in Ukraine. But this has been an all too natural disaster. (voice-over): At least, three elderly people have been in tuned here in the remains of their hotel, and a fourth guest is missing. After the quake, Sami called his parents for a day and a half, it rang out until the battery died too.",

They're heavily sanctioned, they're accused of blatant human rights abuses, of course, Putin waging an unprovoked war in Ukraine, and Kim Jong-un launching ballistic missiles in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. And so, now that these two are coming together, combining forces if you will, potentially, this could be very problematic. On the Ukrainian front, if Vladimir Putin is able to get from North Korea, what it is believed that he wants, which is weapons, ammunition, things like artillery that he's running very low on, and Kim Jong-un is sitting on a huge stockpile, that could certainly be a potential game-changer on the battlefield in Ukraine. Something that Putin wants very badly. The fact that he is actually asking North Korea, asking Kim Jong-un for help, a lot of analysts see as really very humiliating for Putin, considering where he was and where he has fallen now as a result of his war. And of course, Kim Jong-un knows that Russia has decades of institutional knowledge and know-how when it comes to intercontinental ballistic missiles, nuclear weapons, the exact kind of thing that Kim is trying to grow and build and perfect at a (INAUDIBLE) clip because Russia along with China, have veto power at the U.N. Security Council. And China would be the biggest enforcer of the sanctions that the council has crafted over the years to stop Kim Jong-un from acting, and you've seen now cooperation between China, Russia and North Korea. This potentially means that an emboldened Kim Jong-un by partnering up with Russia and Vladimir Putin, continuing his friendship with Xi Jinping can basically do what he wants unabated, and also Vladimir Putin gets something that could give him an edge in Ukraine.

Ashade of army green on the outside, luxuriously appointed on the inside. The train is a simple of three generations of the Kim family dynasty, and a nation stuck in the past. Kim has taken his chugging locomotive to Vladivostok before meeting with Putin there in 2019. This time, Kim may hope Russia will help him with oil supplies or even technology to use its own ambitious ballistic missile program, goals perhaps worthy of a rare venture beyond his nation's hermetically-sealed borders. Only once has Kim boarded a flight overseas, he borrowed an Air China jet from Beijing to get to his first Singapore meeting with Donald Trump. So much has changed since his bygone days of U.S.-North Korea diplomacy. Now, Russia is ready to make a deal, making Kim perhaps the most powerful North Korean leader ever. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Kim had to go back on the train, all those hours, I believe it was 35 hours back empty-handed. And he never forgot that, Isa.

And there's simply nothing they can do about that. And that will make a difference to their ability to move forward. And any steam, any momentum that they believe they've gained, these last few days and weeks risks being lost or at least compromised. So, of course, the clock is ticking, what General Mark Milley said was that they're looking at 30 to 45 days ahead of them. That's on one hand a lot of time and you can say the losses at both sides are sustaining the intense nature of the fighting that's going on in those frontlines.

They are angry about efforts by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to limit the power of the Supreme Court, efforts they say will undermine Israel's democracy. Now the court is due to hold an extraordinary hearing on Tuesday tomorrow where it will hear arguments for and against one aspect of judicial reform plan. A law passed, if you remember back in July, that takes away the court's ability to declare government actions unreasonable. Earlier a smaller group of protesters scuffled with police outside the home of Netanyahu's Justice Minister. Six people were arrested. Let's get the very latest now from our Hadas Gold. And Hadas, from what we've seen in the pictures today, we saw, you know, thousands of people taking the streets yet again, protesting what could be, as we have said in the show, one of the most consequential hearings in the history of Israel's Supreme Court. Just talk us through what we can expect tomorrow.",

As we speak, they areactually marching from the Supreme Court to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence here in Jerusalem so that he will hear them as well. These protesters say that they have come out so that the Supreme Court can hear their support for them. Hear the support for the judges because of what will happen tomorrow. This is setting up potentially one of the most consequential legal judicial clashes in Israeli history. This hearing will take place tomorrow. It should only last about a day or so. And it is, as you noted, hearing arguments for and against the saw that was passed into life that essentially is about the Supreme Court's own power and whether the Supreme Court should be allowed to essentially nullify government decisions by declaring them unreasonable. And, Isa, for the first time in Israeli history, all 15 judges on the Supreme Court will sit together to hear this extraordinary case. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (voice-over): It is now the longest and largest protest movement in Israeli history. For nine months, tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets every week, protesting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to completely reshape the Israeli Supreme Court. When Netanyahu returned to power late last year, he brought along the most far right wing and religious government ministers in Israeli history. But he promised he would be in control.

And the ride is about to get even bumpier. The Supreme Court this week will begin to hear arguments on the first aspect of the digital overhaul to pass parliament. A new law that strips the court of its power to nullify government actions it deems unreasonable. Netanyahu has refused to say whether his government would even abide by a court ruling striking the law down, which would spark a judicial crisis setting different branches of government against each other. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AMIT SEGAL, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, CHANNEL 12: The Supreme Court and the government alike possess a credible nuclear threat against the other side. If both sides are rational actors they will put their -- they will disarm themselves. Problem is, we're in a crisis that is not very rational anymore. GOLD (voice-over): Netanyahu's allies say the judicial reform is needed to rebalance powers between the branches of government. But it's prompted a crisis in Israel's defense forces, reservists and some soldiers' vow and not to serve, the Israeli Shekel weakening as well as concern from Israel's greatest allies. Meanwhile, Netanyahu's far right coalition partners including Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich pushing contentious new bills and making controversial statements about Palestinians while violence and death spiked to record levels in the decades-old conflict across Israel and the occupied territories. Israeli security experts like Haim Tomer, a former chief of intelligence for Mossad Assad, warned that Israel's security is on the line as the country risks tearing itself apart. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Calls for his resignation had grown louderover the unwanted kiss he gave Jenni Hermoso after she and her team won the Women's World Cup. Rubiales took to social media on Sunday saying he will continue to defend his honor just hours after his resignation. Hermoso's Football Club in Mexico honored her in her first match since that World Cup victory. Our Atika Shubert continues to follow the story for us and she joins me now from Valencia. So, Atika, a resignation but no apology, how is this being received in Spain and what does this legally mean for him next?",

But we haven't heard anything from Jenni Hermoso herself. And, you know, keep in mind that it was only last week where she filed her official complaint to Spain's prosecutor. And then she immediately flew to Mexico saying that she wanted to focus on football, focus on the sport. And when she got there, interestingly enough for the timing, on Sunday, she received a standing ovation from her team, Pachuca there in Mexico and from the crowds there in support of her. And that's almost exactly the same time that the news of Rubiales's resignation came out. So no, no official statement, but I think those images of her receiving that applause, that standing ovation really do say a lot, Isa.",
