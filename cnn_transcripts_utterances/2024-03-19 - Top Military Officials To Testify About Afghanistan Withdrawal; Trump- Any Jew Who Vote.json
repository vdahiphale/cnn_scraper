Two and a half years after the bombing at the Kabul airport, the event remains a stain on the administration's record. President Biden has said he does not regret his decision to end America's longest war. But the chaotic and deadly way it happened, that moment struck a chord with voters, and President Biden's approval rating fell below 50 percent right after that and still hasn't bounced back.Next hour, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will hear from two of the top military officials who over saw the exit, former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley and former Commander U.S. -- of U.S. Central Command, General Kenneth McKenzie. CNN's Oren Liebermann is following all of this at the Pentagon. Oren?",

      "sentences": "Dana, this hearing starts in 30 minutes, so at 1Now, we have heard from both of these leaders before, including in congressional hearings about the Afghanistan withdrawal. And they have both testified that they recommended to President Joe Biden keeping a small force of U.S. troops there, somewhere between 2,500 and 4,500. They both say that the president listened to their opinion, as well as other opinions. They felt they were heard. They felt they had the opportunity to present their position. The question then is, what is the difference with this hearing we're expecting to start here in just a short bit? And the answer is, now they are both civilians, which means they are not bound by the same rules of what they can and cannot say as they were when they were in uniform, the top U.S. general and the top general of Central Command. So the question is, do they try to use a bit of that freedom to go further in their discussions of what happened, further in the criticism of how this all played out? And that's what we're watching for here. As civilians, do they say more than they have said before? This hearing will be at the House Foreign Affairs Committee. There, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul has criticized the Biden administration for not only how the withdrawal itself played out, and how it then quickly led to the collapse of the Afghan military and the government, but also he has been very critical of the government for not taking responsibility and having some sort of accountability for the suicide bombing in the closing days of the withdrawal that led to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members. Here, McCaul talked last hour to Wolf Blitzer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R), CHAIRMAN, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE: I think somebody needs to be held accountable. You know, in what form that takes? We'll see where the evidence goes in this matter. Somebody has to say, I'm sorry for your child being, you know, killed at Abbey Gate. And that really hasn't happened. And so I do think this will lead to accountability. It should. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman Becca Balint of Vermont. Thank you so much for being here. What's your reaction to those comments? REP. BECCA BALINT (D-VT): Well, of course, it's absolutely outrageous. But what we've seen from Donald Trump is as he's gotten older, as he's aging, he's become a highly distilled version of himself. He's vengeful. He's vindictive. He is ultimately incredibly insecure, and he projects. And so as a former middle school teacher, I can tell you what it looks like when someone is acting from a place of insecurity with no impulse control. He is trying to call people disloyal because he himself is incredibly disloyal to the people around him.",

Since the attack on October 7th in Israel, anti-Semitic incidents are already spiking.According to the Anti-Defamation League, the incidents in the U.S. rose 361 percent in the three months after October 7th compared to the same period the year before. Congresswoman, you are the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. It's personal, but it's personal for all Jews, I think. How would you -- and I know that you've studied this as well.

It says, see, a former president is even speaking this, so there must be some kernel of truth in it.And ultimately, we know that he is lashing out at American Jewry because they know they can see through him. 70 percent of American Jews voted for Biden in 2020.

All right, let's just assume that we're going to assign the winner in 2024 to the winner who won in 2020. And what we see is Biden with 303 electoral votes, Donald Trump at 235.You'll notice in Nebraska there's a little light blue. Why is that? Because Nebraska, like Maine, are the only two states in the nation who give an electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. One of those congressional districts is right in around Omaha, and Joe Biden won that district last time around. Now what happens if we start giving Donald Trump some states where he's leading in right now? So let's give him the state of Georgia. Let's give him the state of Arizona. Let's give him the state of Nevada. All of a sudden, look at this, 270 electoral votes to 268. Joe Biden barely wins on the strength of carrying Nebraska's second congressional district. Now, if we zoom in, and all of a sudden we give that district to Donald Trump, it's a 269 to 269 tie. So that's a big reason why Joe Biden's there. But that's not the only map where we can see how Nebraska's second congressional district could make a difference. How about we go back, we're going to give Joe Biden back Nevada, we're going to give him back Arizona, and we're going to give him back Georgia. But let's say then, we take away Pennsylvania, and we take away Michigan. What do we get here? A 269 to 269 tie with Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, the fact that Biden carried it, making it a tie. So Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, although quite small, only one electoral vote could in fact make a big difference in this election.",
