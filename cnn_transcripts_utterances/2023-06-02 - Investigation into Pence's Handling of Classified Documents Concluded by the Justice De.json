The Justice Department has now closed its investigation into Former Vice President Mike Pence and his handling of classified documents. You know, back in January, CNN was the first to report that an attorney for Pence found about a dozen documents marked as classified at his home in Indiana. that search was initiated after classified documents had been found in both the possession of Donald Trump and Joe Biden outside of, you know, being in the White House. Let's get to this with this breaking news. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is -- has part of the story. CNN's Paula Reid has the other side of the story. Katelyn, let me start with you, tell us more about what we know about this now investigation being closed?",

And so, the question for the Justice Department has been, well, given the standard that the attorney general has set just a few months ago when he announced special counsels to investigate the documents at Mar-a-Lago, obviously, Donald Trump, and for President Biden, would he have to announce a special counsel for Mike Pence as well?This announcement that the investigation is being closed really means that they can obviously go forward with the announcement of the former vice president and his presidential run without any concern that the Justice Department is going to be announcing a special counsel. And we know, that, you know, this is -- these types of reviews are very common. They're not unusual for the Justice Department and the FBI. They do interviews. The check to see whether they, you know, whether documents -- who owns these documents to make sure that there was any damage done by where they were being held. And then, you know, usually these things get wrapped up very quietly. Obviously, the context because of who we were talking about, the former vice president and, of course, the ongoing investigation to the former president and the current president made this a lot different.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Evan, thank you. Stick with me.I want to also bring in as we talk Paula Reid for more on this. The idea, Paula, of the special counsel, I know, is something that you have been reporting out on. Why special counsels to investigate Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and no special counsel for Mike Pence, as we now know, as Katelyn just said, no criminal charges will be sought according to this letter? PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  There are a lot of reasons here. But the biggest reason that President Biden and for President Trump have their possible mishandling of classified information investigations overseen by a special counsel is because of who they are. Of course, President Biden appointment the Attorney General, Merrick Garland. So, while he initially had a Trump appointed U.S. attorney review the classified documents that were found at two locations connected to President Biden. He then appointed a special counsel, because again, it's about optics, right? It's about having an independent investigation with Former President Trump. The two ongoing active investigations that were being conducted into Former President Trump became a special counsel investigation. Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed once he declared his candidacy. Now, that's a reason they're both overseen by special counsels but the actual facts of those two probes are quite different. The Biden probe is much more similar to the Pence matter, in terms of the voluntary nature of the searches. No one from the government was reaching out, concern that there were missing documents. The fact that they were mostly cooperative with the Justice Department with archives. And also, the volume of material. At last count in the Biden probe, we're talking about dozens of documents. Whereas in the Trump investigation, we're talking about hundreds of classified documents that have been found. Multiple searches, questions about obstruction, other questions about the possible mishandling of defense information. And as we first reported here on CNN, among the various types of evidence that investigator have is an audio recording where not only does the former president claim to have at least one classified document, he also acknowledges his limits on his ability to declassify materials once he was out of the White House. And that's significant because that's been one of his key defenses for all of this in the court of public opinion. While Mike Pence took responsibility for what happened, Biden also acknowledged that this was a mistake. Trump has tried to argue in part that his just didn't happen. Let's toss to that side. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S PRESIDENT:  All I know is this, everything I did was right. We have the presidential records act which I abided by 100 percent. It's a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time. It's a hoax. And it has to do -- it has to do more than anything else with trying to interfere with the election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, Donald Trump is a very different story because he definitely knew that he had classified documents. He's talked about is. He's acknowledged that. Then we get into intent. What was the purpose for Donald Trump having these documents, and the new reporting by Paula and team shed some light on that. He -- we know that he held these classified documents, and tried to use them to influence some of the political news coverage of him, but prosecutors are digging on that very question now. And that's going to make or break the Trump decision. Did he know that he had the documents? For sure. Did he have criminal intent? That's what they're working on.",

They're investigating the same way any at USA or U.S. attorney would do or the same way that there was an investigation of Mike Pence.There are some administrative differences here. The special counsel in the Biden case and in the Trump case, will have to ultimately put their recommendations together and send them up the line to the Attorney General Merrick Garland. He has final say. So, there is that added layer of bureaucracy. But there's no reason inherently why special counsel needs to be a bigger deal or needs to take longer than any other investigation.",

Now, clearly, he's referring there to the new campaign that's being prosecuted inside Russian territory using drones. And you mentioned that, John, the attacks around Belgorod, both by land and in terms of artillery. There have been drone attacks in Smolensk in Russia's west and in its southern town as well. All of this, I think, worrying Putin that he may be facing centrifugal forces. He's mentioned this before. The Russian Federation is a federation of a lot wide-range of ethnic groups. And every now and again, he says how worried he is that these foreign influences and the events that is affecting Russia may cause the country to fly apart.
