Trump is now saying the opposite. He's claiming he got no trial, no jury, no crime, no victim, only a crooked judge and a corrupt Trump hating attorney general.Trump is also countering what his attorneys claimed in court filings, saying he does have the cash needed for the bond. \"Through hard work, talent and luck, I currently have almost $500 million in cash, a substantial amount of which I intended to use in my campaign for president.\" Let's talk about this with our senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, I should say when I was going to break, I misspoke and said that he announced that he lost 500 million. He says he does have 500 million, a big difference there. If he does have that money, as he says, why would he be struggling so hard to come up with the bond money? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Great question. Dana. Now, he could just if he wants to continue the appeals, which is what he says he wants to be doing here in this case, to appeal this $464 million judgment. He doesn't want the AG to seize that money. He could just write a check to the court to continue the appeals or he could go to these third party underwriters to give him the bond. He has not been able to do that his attorneys have been clear. And that's because his attorney has clarified now to our own Kara Scannell that this isn't necessarily cash he has on hand, liquid hard, cold cash.",

You are somebody who is not unlike Tom Suozzi, maybe even more so than Tom Suozzi in a very battleground district. What will you do if you have to decide whether or not to vote to keep Mike Johnson as Speaker or oust him? REP. MARCIA KAPTUR (D-OH): Well, I want to keep my options open but I know the speaker, I really want to vote for is Hakeem Jeffries of New York. And we'll see what happens. There have been a number of Republican resignations. They're leaving early because of the chaos and extremism on the other side of the aisle. I think it's very unpredictable where things will be by July, August, September, so we'll have to see. But I'm sorry that the woman from, gentlewoman from Georgia has done this to create more chaos at a time when America needs to be very resolute to meet our responsibilities at home. They're six months late and bringing to the floor bills that should have been done last year, six months late. And of course, we have to meet our first responsibility, which is to protect and defend this country against all enemies, foreign and domestic. And I intend to do that in my own votes.",
