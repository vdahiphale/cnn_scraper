You and I have talked about intelligence reports and assessments, both on the Israeli and the American side, in the days leading up to October 7th that indicated that Hamas might do something. Now, what that something was expected to be was what we had seen before in previous rounds of fighting that were frankly rather inconsequential for Israel. And that would have been rockets being fired across the border, which then likely would have been intercepted by the iron dome, which is exactly what we're seeing on our screen right there. But there was no sense that Hamas would be able to break through the fence and carry out the types of massacres that they did.There is acknowledgment and public acknowledgment here in US from intelligence officials and Biden administration officials that this was purely an Israeli intelligence failure. American intelligence officials are not taking any responsibility for this. They are laying it at the feet of the intelligence apparatus and security apparatus in Israel. Essentially, the US has been so focused on China, and on Russia, and Ukraine that they just don't spend a lot of time thinking about Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups. Now, will that change going forward? That remains to be seen. We've certainly seen US intelligence playing a much bigger role during this conflict with drones ...",

LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes and no, Anderson. You know, I'm going go back a little bit. I was in the fusion center near Be'eri with my counterpart in Israel in 2012. I saw the women that collect the intelligence, that fuse it together and provide to it the commanders. There was a focus on Hamas and Gaza in 2012 when I was there. That focus deteriorated over the years because of focus in other areas like the West Bank. But truthfully, you -- as a commander, you get all sorts of intelligence reports from your intelligence collection cells, your fusion -- the young sergeants and privates that put the information together. It only depends on what you pay attention to. And if the Israeli military and the Israeli government was not paying attention to that fusion cell in Be'eri -- and they have several other fusion cells throughout the country, one in northern Israel against Hezbollah, another one in the West Bank where they formulate the intelligence and gather it and say here's what we think is going to happen. But truthfully, all those intelligence young soldiers can do is pass that forward. Even with the kind of headlines that Oren -- or that Alex just mentioned of, you know, disaster in the kibbutz, that should gain attention. But a cultural bias sometimes prevents commanders and political leaders from understanding the importance of some of this. And sometimes those intelligence officers will put a headline that screams disaster about to approach, and it has to be weighed with all the other sorts of intelligence. As concerns the US paying attention to this, yes, we take a lot of information from national governments in terms of what kind of terrorist activities that are going on all over in the world ...",

They could openly see the exercise sites.In fact, when the IDF took me into Gaza several weeks ago, we looked over a mock Israeli village they had created. Israel simply didn't believe it was possible that Hamas could carry out such a large-scale and coordinated attack. And on top of that, at the political level, they believed that Hamas was more interested in economic rehabilitation of Gaza. In the permits that Israel was giving it, they were ready to approve and more permits. Moreover, much of this report was already known. In fact, the Haaretz article from a week ago pointed out a year before October 7th, Israel's army had insight into Hamas's plan to attack Israeli towns and IDF bases. So although \"The New York Times\" adds some details here, there have already been many reports, as Barak Ravid pointed out, that Israel knew much of what was going to happen and simply didn't believe it was possible. Everyone at every level we have spoken to from political to military has pointed out there will be a deep and thorough investigation about what went wrong.

It looks pretty dramatic. But we're also 55 days in. And even if he got surgery and even if he got antibiotics, we imagine the pain he must be in, especially now that we're hearing that people are sleeping on concrete floors and plastic chairs and being moved, we don't know the real details.

He had an opportunity to cooperate and -- with the Ethics Committee. He was asked to provide documents, he did not. He was asked to come in and speak with them, he did not. That is due process. The notion that due process requires a criminal trial is preposterous. There's a reason why Congress has its own set of rules and operates under those rules. And let's remember, Anderson, that this is unprecedented in many ways already because in almost every ethics investigation, the Ethics Committee defers first to the Department of Justice. And then the Ethics Committee will act if necessary after any conviction, most members will resign in this case because of the extraordinary nature of George Santos's fraud and deceit. The Ethics Committee moved ahead in coordination with the Department of Justice. So we now, in a very unusual way, have an ethics report before we have a resolution to the criminal case.

So the judge certainly can extend the gag order or issue a new one that says you can't threaten the family member, for example, of the judge or any of the staff members. You know, we'll see what he does, but where does it stop? I mean, then he starts threatening the judge's next door neighbor. And I mean, you know, you want to keep the gag order very narrow legally, so that it won't be thrown out as unconstitutional. On the other hand, if you keep it narrow, you know, he can just find other targets.",

Just months ago, our Pam Brown reported on a secret investigation at the academy, dubbed Operation Foul the Anchor. Which found that rape, sexual assaults, and other misconduct that had been ignored and at times covered up by high ranking officials.Now, CNN has discovered that years before that investigation, another critical report exposing racism, hazing, discrimination, and sexual assault across the Coast Guard. Coast Guard leaders have kept it secret for nearly a decade. For details, here's Pam Brown. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAMELA BROWN, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): This culture of respect report obtained by CNN was based on interviews with hundreds of Coast Guard employees in 2015. Among the alarming conclusions, Coast Guard personnel accept poor behavior as status quo. The Coast Guard does not provide sufficient measures to prevent sexual assault. And, Coast Guard personnel have been discriminated against and sexually harassed. It's been kept from the public, dubbed for official use only. The front page saying it should be disseminated only on a need-to-know basis and kept in a locked container. The report describes the failures of Coast Guard leadership, claiming leaders are not fully aware of perpetrator-predator characteristics and have allowed Coast Guard members to escape accountability. In one example cited, a military member was reduced in rank and asked to leave the service after being involved in a sexual harassment complaint, only to be hired later by the Coast Guard as a supervisor. And was even accepted as a victim advocate into the Coast Guard's program for sexual assault victims. KIMBERLY YOUNG-MCLEAR, RETIRED COAST GUARD COMMANDER: I have experienced racism. And as a black queer woman, I've experienced harassment. BROWN (voice-over): Retired Coast Guard Commander and whistleblower, Kimberly Young-McLear, is one of the people who knew the report existed and has pushed for its release for years. YOUNG-MCLEAR: I and many of us were very, very angry and very upset that this was a document that spelled out exactly what the culture was, provided a road map of how we can improve the culture and the Coast Guard sat on it and then they buried it. BROWN (voice-over): In 2019, Young McLear even testified in front of Congress about the toxic culture in the Coast Guard. YOUNG-MCLEAR: If they had implemented the vast majority of the recommendations that it absolutely could have prevented what happened to me, and not just me, what continues to happen across the entire U.S. Coast Guard. BROWN (voice-over): Yet, the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security have for years refused to release the report publicly. And keep in mind, this newly uncovered report was written four years before another internal Coast Guard report that was kept secret until a CNN investigation last summer. Dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, it substantiated dozens of rapes at the Coast Guard Academy. ADMIRAL LINDA FAGAN, COMMANDANT, U.S. COAST GUARD: I again apologize to each victim survivor, their loved ones, we failed to provide the safe environment that every member of the Coast Guard deserves. BROWN (voice-over): The problems outlined in both reports still persist, according to dozens of recent and current Coast Guard employees who have spoken with CNN. They worry that change will not happen in the future until the Coast Guard confronts its past. YOUNG-MCLEAR: In order to improve the culture, they have to acknowledge what the culture actually is.
