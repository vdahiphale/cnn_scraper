      "sentences": "Some major breaking news into CNN. Just moments ago, posted to social media, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated his pick for Attorney General, and that is Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, a Republican firebrand, a lightning rod for controversy. These confirmation hearings are going to be intense, to say the least.Let's go to CNN's Paula Reid, who has the latest on this. Paula, wow.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is certainly a surprise. I've been speaking with sources today about the potential options for Attorney General, and Congressman Gaetz's name has not surfaced. Now, one of the many reasons that this is surprising is that Congressman Gaetz has been under investigation previously.That investigation was closed, but he was under investigation for possible sex trafficking and possible obstruction of justice, and this was an investigation that was open during the Trump administration. It was overseen by then-Trump Attorney General Bill Barr. It went on for several years. It was eventually closed. The congressman was not charged, but that is certainly something that is likely to come up during any potential confirmation hearing. He is also currently facing an ethics probe in Congress over similar conduct. Now, I want to look at the Truth Social post that President-elect Trump posted. He described Congressman Gaetz as a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the College of William &amp; Mary's Law School, who also distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice. Now, we know that the president-elect has been frustrated with the fact that he has been the subject of multiple criminal cases. Congressman Gaetz likely has empathy in that regard because he too has been under investigation at the Justice Department, but this is certainly a surprise. He has not been among the names that have been floated by people familiar with these talks, and it's unclear if this will be a successful nomination because, again, this would be an attorney general who had, within the past few years, been under criminal investigation. An investigation that was started not by his political adversaries, but by the Trump-appointed attorney general, Bill Barr. So, as you said when you tossed to me, this will certainly be an interesting confirmation hearing. It comes as quite a surprise, even to those of us who have been talking to sources, about who Trump could select for this key position.",

Paula Reid, thank you so much for that update.Let's talk about this with our panel. Meghan Hays is a Democratic strategist and served as director of message planning for the Biden White House. Also with us, CNN senior political commentator and former assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings. Scott, I don't think I'm divulging or betraying any confidences to say that when we told you the news, you were in disbelief.",

No, I was as surprised as Paula, because it's not a name that we had seen.You know, we'd seen some reporting, a lot of different names, frankly, a lot of really sort of well-heeled Washington legal types that were on the list. So I'm as surprised as anyone. But what I take away from this is that this is a president-elect who is feeling his power. I mean, this is someone who is appointing people to things, whether it's Gaetz or anything else we've seen today, who is feeling his power, feeling his influence, doesn't feel like he's in a mood to negotiate with the people in Washington, D.C. He's here to do what he wants to do, and he's going to expect the Republicans to fall in line. Now, all these people, whether it's Gaetz or Hegseth or anyone else, have to go to confirmation and go through these committee hearings and prove themselves like anyone else. But it is apparent to me that Trump is in a decisive mood and is not someone who's interested in picking things that he would consider to be watered down. So that's my initial reaction to this. I mean, we truly learned about it two seconds before we came on here. So, pretty wild day.",

So I think it's a little bit shocking with this and with Tulsi Gabbard, with DNI.So I just, you know, I think it'll be interesting to see what tomorrow brings, but I do agree.

And honestly, I think he does too. And these, some of these picks are conventional. Marco Rubio, for instance, you know, well-known name. But some of them are designed to shake up Washington. And I am assuming that's what Donald Trump believes he's doing here with a few of these folks, is I'm not here to pick the Washington people. I'm here to pick the people who will shake up Washington.

He's taking him out of Congress, and he's giving him the Attorney General's office. And so again, I've known Matt for 10 years. You know, Matt is very good at what Matt does in Congress, and now he's going to bring that to the Attorney General's office. And so I don't want to get ahead of what their plans are.

And so, you know, I think it's me fascinating to watch the power struggle, the power balance between all of these folks. But we're also acting like everyone's going to get through Senate confirmation and we'll have to see which ones do and which ones don't. Some of these folks are clearly more qualified. Mike Waltz, Marco Rubio, clearly more qualified for these positions than the other folks. But again, Donald Trump told everybody what he wanted to do. This is not a secret.
