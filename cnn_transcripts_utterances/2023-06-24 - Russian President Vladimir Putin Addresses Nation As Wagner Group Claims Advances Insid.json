On Friday he claimed that Russian military struck a Wagner camp and pledged retribution for that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRUNHUBER (voice-over):  This social media video shows the alleged strike but CNN cannot verify its authenticity. Russia's defense ministry denied that accusation. Prigozhin later claimed that military helicopters also hit his troops and civilians before two aircraft were shot down. It's unclear where the alleged incident happened. We are going to go right now to Vladimir Putin speaking. (END VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translator):  And everything must be put aside that makes us weaker. Any differences that may be used and are used by our enemies to disrupt us from within. For the action that split our unity are basically an acts of (INAUDIBLE) and renegade actions against those fighting at the front. It is a stab in the back against our country and our nation. And this spanned (ph) (INAUDIBLE) to Russia in 1917, when the country was fighting in World War I. But this victory was stolen from it. Intrigues, bickering behind the nation's back turned into a great catastrophe, for the destruction of army, the collapse of a state, the loss of huge vast territories and the tragedy of a civil war when Russians went against Russians and brother went against brother. And profiting from that were various (INAUDIBLE) foreign forces that were tearing the country apart. We will not let that repeat. We will not let that happen again. We will defend our country and our state from any threats, including internal treason. And what we are facing now is treason. Big ambitions and personal interests have led to the betrayal of one's country and one's nation. And the cause for which Wagner's group fight (INAUDIBLE) were fighting along with the armed forces. The towns and villages of Donbas, where they fought and gave their lives for the new Russia (INAUDIBLE) of the Russian world, their (INAUDIBLE) and glory have been betrayed by those who are trying to organize an armed rebellion, pushing the country towards fratricide and civil war and ultimately to defeat and capitulation. I repeat any internal rebellion is a deadly threat to our state, to us as a nation. It is a blow against Russia and against our people. And our action to defend our motherland against such a threat will be harsh. [03:05:00] PUTIN (through translator):  All those who deliberately went on the path of treason or preparing an armed rebellion or preparing terrorist attacks will be punished inevitably and will be held accountable -- they will be held account of by law. The armed forces have been given the necessary orders; additional anti terrorist security measures have been imposed in Moscow, Moscow region and in other regions. Decisive measures will be taken to stabilize the situation in Rostov-on-Don, which still remains difficult. The work of civil and military organ governments is actually blocked. As the president of Russia, commander in chief, as a citizen of Russia, I will do everything in my power to defend the country and defend its constitution and the lives, security and liberties of its citizens. And the one who organized and prepared (INAUDIBLE) armed rebellion, who turned to face weapons against their comrades that betrayed Russia and will be held accountable for that. Those who are being (INAUDIBLE) -- for the people being drawn on to this, I call upon you not to repeat the mistakes, previous mistakes. Stop any participation and criminal actions. I am sure that we will defend and protect what is dear and sacred to us. Together with our motherland, we will overcome any ordeals and we will become even stronger.",

First of all -- and I missed the very top of his address there, which came an hour later than had been expected actually.I did not hear him mention the name of Yevgeny Prigozhin at any time. So I thought that was significant, given that Prigozhin was once a Kremlin insider, who now seems to have turned on the state. He has described this as treason, as a mutiny, as a crime against Russia. He invoked history. He said that, in 1917, there was an armed rebellion during World War I that led to civil war, where Russians ended up killing Russians, brothers ended up killing brothers. And he said that tragedy must not be repeated. There were a couple of details toward the end of this that I thought were very important. He said that the armed forces and the security services had been issued additional orders for anti terrorist actions. We know that has been announced in Moscow right now and he had it in other regions. He said that the situation in Rostov, that southern city and province, is complicated right now. And he conceded that the command structure of the military and the civilian government there is currently blockaded and that it would be dealt with. So he also, finally, he tried to say that Russia is in an existential battle right now. It is facing off against the West, he argues, which is using all of its weapons and abilities to try to divide and hurt Russia. And that is why there needs to be a time of unity right now. Finally, after really months of silence, where Yevgeny Prigozhin, the most powerful mercenary chief in Russia, had been directly criticizing, cursing the Russian military command, Putin has taken a position. Now that you have mercenary groups on the ground, moving north through Russian territory, you finally have Putin coming out and saying, this will no longer stand. The question is, is it too late?",

He accuses them of carrying out attacks against civilians, of sending Russian troops into the war in Ukraine without adequate leadership or military equipment.They are kind of quiet and clearly very uncomfortable there. They ask about taking his fighters away from there. And he says under no condition. He says he is going to stay and blockade Rostov and move on Moscow unless the chief of the general staff, Valery Gerasimov, and the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, come and meet him. In a separate video, he goes on to claim that the chief of general staff, Gerasimov, has actually fled the building that he is currently in as the Wagner group troops were approaching it. So we cannot independently confirm any of these claims. We do though very much know that there are forces on the ground deployed around Rostov. He also claimed that his forces had taken over control of an airbase there. And he has completely attacked the legitimacy of the entire Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of last year, arguing that the pretext was not to fight alleged Nazis or to restore order but to help get promotions for the defense minister, Sergei Shoigu. As we've heard now in this response from Putin, this is now down to effectively a power struggle between the Russian state, the Kremlin, the armed forces and this powerful mercenary group that has left the front lines in Ukraine and is now pointing its guns at the state in Russia.",

Ivan Watson in Hong Kong, thank you so much.Just to bring you up to speed, moments ago, Russian president Vladimir Putin addressed the nation, said of the conflict it is a stab in the back and calling it treason. So amid all of that turmoil in Russia, a simple message from Ukraine's ministry of defense. Quote, \"We are watching.\" Meanwhile, Russian political scientists shared this message. Quote, \"Everyone calm down. There is no revolution. Prigozhin straightaway clearly stated that he will not touch the authorities except for the already hostile military.\" For more now on how those developments could affect Ukraine, we are joined by Ben Wedeman in Zaporizhzhya. So Ben, I can just imagine how this is all being greeted there in Ukraine. What has been the reaction? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the general feeling is, Kim, that this is Christmas in June for the Ukrainians. Keep in mind that, of course, Ukraine is in the very initial stages of its counteroffensive against Russian forces. And this could not come at a better time for the Ukrainians, to have the Russian armed forces writ large, its mercenary core as well as its regular army, seeming to implode at the moment. In fact, what is circulating on the internet here, on social media in Ukraine, is a picture of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a video of him from when he was an actor, popping a beer, sitting down in a comfortable armchair, picking up a bowl of popcorn and watching the TV. And that seems to be the attitude and the reaction of many here. We have heard from an adviser to the presidency, talking about the infighting between the Russian elite at this critical moment and saying that everything is just beginning. Yesterday, in fact, we were in one of those front line areas, where it appears that they are preparing for a push, for it to relaunch the major part of this counteroffensive. And certainly this is the ideal time for the Ukrainians to do that, given what appears to be Russia's paralysis at the moment, trying to deal with this essentially uprising by Prigozhin against the defense establishment in Moscow -- Kim.",

So I think that gives you a sense of the severity and the difficulty of the situation.But there must be questions in President Putin's mind. If we look back to the beginning of May, the end of April, one of the big feathers in Yevgeny Prigozhin's cap wasn't just that he was fighting the war for the Russian country in Bakhmut and helping the victory there. It was that one of Russia's deputy defense ministers resigned from the defense ministry and less than a week later was absorbed into Wagner's mercenary group, into Prigozhin's mercenary group. Wagner, at a command position. It seemed to indicate a level of support within the Russian military and particularly its hierarchy for Prigozhin's views, that this view must have some prevalence. And that will be a concern for Putin, because the test is going to be now, when push comes to shove, which bits of the military can he rely on to take down Prigozhin? How will Prigozhin's fighters stand by him? And, of course, what will the outfall be? And it's going to fall into very sharp focus whether or not the war in Ukraine is being fought properly, is worth being fought. And the more that the war in Ukraine and the necessity of the invasion and having that fight is called into question, the more that it will weaken Putin's position. And I think that the other thing that just becomes clear is how isolated Putin has become. He has stayed out of addressing this issue and in fact, it's remarkable how long he has allowed this developing agenda from Prigozhin to call Russia's military into question, to call out the chief of defense, Valery Gerasimov, to call out Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, as failing. Now Putin has really had to step in and deal with it. But he has let it go for so long, a lot of damage has happened underneath the surface. And that also doesn't speak to Putin's strength, certainly for those in the close circle, in the Kremlin around him. Those with a vested interest in the economic future of Russia will perhaps begin to question more whether he is the man to do it. This is not going to unfold today. Today it's a military operation. Today this is about taking down Prigozhin and ending this standoff that is developing in parts of the country. It is not clear how quickly that is going to happen. But Putin, at this moment, is in a weaker because he has lost a very key and previously trusted core ally, one of the very few people that Putin will have trusted. And now will potentially leave him, Putin, more at the mercy of the diktat of his defense minister and defense staff.",

But I got to tell you, I'd much rather be on the Ukrainian side right now than the Russian side, because there is utter chaos and dysfunction allegedly on the Russian side, whereas the Ukrainian side is continuing with their own momentum in their offensive. (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER:  For more on this, I'm joined now by M. Steven Fish, a comparative political scientist who specializes in democracy and authoritarianism. Thank you so much for joining us here. Moments ago, we just heard Putin's strongly worded response to the crisis, calling it a stab in the back and treason. What stood out to you? M. STEVEN FISH, DEPARTMENT OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, UC BERKELEY:  He is calling a traitor the same guy that he has been relying on for many months in the field in Ukraine. This is the only guy, Prigozhin, who has actually been able to make any battlefield gains. And so far Putin has actually not stood up to him. So this makes Putin, in fact, look very weak indeed. Putin has been deluded since the beginning of this war. He should've never launched the war to begin with. And Prigozhin is the one guy who has been able to deliver some gains on the ground for him. But then today Prigozhin also issued a video, where he questioned the whole basis for this war effort. He said that Putin's whole line about East Ukrainians, Russian speakers in East Ukraine being abused by the Ukrainian government, and using that as a pretext for this war was nonsense. He said that the war was all about lining the pockets of Putin oligarchs. So he's undercut the whole basis for the war. And Putin has made himself dependent on this guy, who is now turning against him. So this is a very uncomfortable position for Putin to be in.",

They really haven't been a very competent fighting force in Ukraine. And here comes this guy, who has this militant loyalty of all these thousands of troops that he pulls together. A lot of them are former felons that he's pulled out of prison. He puts them together in this fighting formation and, they actually deliver some gains on the ground for Putin. So they are the only force that has been able to make any headway in Ukraine at all. The fact that, in the 21st century, in a major army, we are talking about some mercenary organization fighting alongside a regular army and being the force that is making the gains seems pretty weird.

It was during the annexation of Crimea in 2014, when President Putin turned to a close friend and inside ally. And that was Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, who was able to provide him with the manpower that he needed. He went on to be known or the Wagner mercenary group to be known as Putin's private army, carrying out his bidden from the Central African Republic, to military interventions in Syria and Libya, setting up troll factories to interfere with U.S. elections. All of that was done with Yevgeny Prigozhin behind the curtain, never claiming credit. It is only since the invasion of Ukraine that he has stepped into the limelight. And he has done it loudly and antagonistically, using this invasion in Ukraine to show up the Russian military time and time again, most recently in Bakhmut; to call them out publicly whenever they can with the most inflammatory language possible. Saying the defense minister should be tried for failing the country, addressing the Russian people directly. And the question this whole time has been, why has President Putin done nothing about it? Why has he allowed this figure to rise to such a level of prominence and to air Russia's dirty laundry? We may now, of course, have that response from President Putin, who spoke just a few minutes ago. Of course, accusing Prigozhin of treason, saying he will be held accountable. But is it too late? What really stuck out for me in those moments that President Putin addressed his country was that he never once uttered the name of Prigozhin. Perhaps a sign of just how irritated he has become with how public a figure Prigozhin has been. But there is a big complex problem here. Throughout the conflict, President Putin has allowed Yevgeny Prigozhin to antagonize the Russian military. And it is those Russian military leaders now that President Putin has to turn to when it comes to Prigozhin, the problem no longer Prigozhin, the problem solver. All this will play out in a very complicated way. And it will take time, weeks, days, more. What we need to keep our eye on right now is how does Russia, how does the Russian military get its hands on Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has blockaded himself in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don? As you mentioned, has very heavily armed guard, the Wagner mercenary group protecting him, what does that military operation look? Like and could it turn bloody?",
