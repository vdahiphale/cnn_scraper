I'm Jim Sciutto, live in Washington, where it's 10In the days since the presidential election, Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate has become the center of the U.S. political world filled with people angling for jobs in his new administration and those hoping to help influence Trump's picks for those top spots. Trump advisers have been holding formal meetings with the transition team and the president elect each day presenting him with input on a wide range of policy and personnel choices. Trump is expected to announce several key positions in the coming days. Some believe he will bring back among them Tom Homan who served as acting director of ICE, that is Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first administration. Sources say that Homan may serve as a czar-like position in fulfilling Trump's campaign promise to carry out, quote, the largest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in U.S. history. One person who does not seem to have any desire to fill a spot in the new administration is nonetheless playing a very key role in the transition process. Alayna Treene has the details.

But the one person who's really been looming over all of it has been Elon Musk.Now, of course, Elon Musk was on stage with Donald Trump his top campaign advisers and his family on Tuesday night when he declared victory during the election but he's also been at Mar-a-Lago and around Donald Trump in the days since. I'm told many days this week he dined with Donald Trump just the day after the election. He brought his children to Trump's Florida home where Donald Trump gave them a tour of his resort. But he's also been sitting in many times when he's been with Donald Trump on some of the calls from foreign leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, I'm also told that Elon Musk has been weighing in on some of Donald Trump's potential picks, making it clear to the president-elect who he believes should have that role and he's also been calling up allies of Donald Trump himself, including lawmakers and starting to in exert his influence in that way as well. Now one thing that we saw happen on Sunday is that he came out and waited into the Senate Republican leadership fight. He quickly endorsed Florida Senator Rick Scott after Scott had supported an idea from Donald Trump to allow for recess appointments essentially trying to make sure that he can swiftly confirm some of his nominees and in many times bypass the Senate confirmation process three of the men are vying for that spot but Elon Musk said that he supports Rick Scott. And I'll just say, Musk has been very influential. He is very close with Donald Trump specifically so in these final weeks before Election Day where he has been out there campaigning for the former president. And now, he is spending a lot of time with Donald Trump and making it clear that he's going to be a top person who Donald Trump relies on as we look ahead. Now, sources familiar with the conversations say that Musk is not expected to take on some formal role in Donald Trump's second administration. Donald Trump has mused before that he would love for him to be a cabinet secretary however uh Musk and others believe that he could have just as much power on the outside.

Obviously, there's conflicts of interest here but what you'll see in a second Trump administration is a very bold actions that might do away with traditions and some of the guard rails that you usually -- usually see in administration so it won't be the Wild West, but it'll be close to it.",

Listen, it's a long list of things and Governor Hutchinson, you referenced that big picture in terms of a disappearance of guardrails.So, tell me, do you think in the Republican Party, given that Republicans will control the Senate as well likely the House, are there Republicans who you believe maintain an interest in guardrails and a willingness to back them up? You know Republicans who who've attempted to stand up to Trump have been -- well, they've been voted off the island as it were.

He's going to be tested and we'll see whether the Republicans will stand up and whether it's a recess appointments that they push back on or whether it's some other way that you they that the administration tries to bypass Congress.

So I think that's going to be one nexus. And I also think the House is going to be very right on the knife's edge. You know, it does look like the Republicans are going to -- are going to grab it, but, you know, we still have an outside shot. Whichever way it goes, it's going to be -- it's going to be razor thin. And so, I think Hakeem Jeffries is a -- is a new and younger leader and I think he could be a forceful figure in terms of putting -- putting these guard rails that governor Hutchinson's talked about trying to put some of those in place.

It will probably be in the area of reforming the regulatory environment, doing away with some of the mandates and also making sure that the Justice Department is reformed, looking at the new attorney general to do that. So you're going to be looking at executive action for quick victories. Longer term, he's going have to work with Congress to get some of his economic package through.",

They believe those things. They think Zelenskyy is corrupt or not a serious leader, taking American money, blah, blah, blah.Trump has never said those things and so we need to appreciate the fact that he is maintaining a distance between all of those points of view. He has also not criticized Vladimir Putin, he's not said that this is a Russian aggression, it needs to stop. But my view is that the reason why he is not criticizing Putin is because he knows he ultimately has to reach a deal with Putin and so he's not demonizing him but that doesn't mean that he misunderstands the situation on the ground. I think we have to see how this plays out. And I would just remind viewers that it was actually President Trump who reversed the Obama administration's arms embargo on Ukraine. For years we had a ban on lethal assistance to Ukraine which Trump reversed and not because he was, all of a sudden, you know, challenging Vladimir Putin, quite the opposite. He was even having this press conference in Helsinki in where he was very warm towards Vladimir Putin, but he was setting the stage for future negotiations.",

So it's been an uneven record at best as regards Ukraine.And we should know, you know, it's not just folks floating out in the rightwing you know Twitter sphere who have made such claims. J.D. Vance, I mean, he in the last days of the campaign you know said something along the lines of who are the good guys and bad guys in a war that as you well know was started when Russia invaded. So I just wonder when you -- when you put that together and you also add into it the president elect's frequent criticism of NATO, and his public statements along the lines of put that together and you also add into it the president-elect's frequent criticism of NATO and his public statements along the lines of -- well, if you don't pay enough money, then Russia do whatever the hell you want to the east.

That is certainly even though it's not ever spoken publicly by government officials who are very careful about every single word they utter on this topic particularly being caught in between Beijing and Washington certainly behind the scenes.
