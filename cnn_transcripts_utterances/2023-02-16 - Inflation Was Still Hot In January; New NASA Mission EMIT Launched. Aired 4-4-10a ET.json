      "sentences": "It`s been a bumpy road to cool inflation and a longer road than many Americans wouldlike to see. But some good news, year-over-year inflation cooled to 6.4 percent falling for seven straight months. But inflation in January rose 0.5 percent and inflation and the economy have been key issues for President Biden. And coming off this report, he said that it is good news but there is still work to do as inflation remains too high. So the biggest inflation drivers were energy costs, which includes gas, up 1.5 percent from a year ago, shelter which contributed to nearly half the increase last month, that rose 7.9 percent year over year. And food costs remaining extremely high, up 10.1 percent year over year. Some key items at the grocery store costing more eggs up 70 percent, butter up 26.3 percent, and lettuce up 17.2 percent year over year. But you`ll see some savings on a couple items at the grocery store -- beef, veal and bacon, all down year over year. So how does this translate to Americans budgets? Well, according to Moody`s Analytics, families are spending nearly four hundred dollars more a month this year than they did last year on the same goods and services because of inflation. So this signals that there is still work for the Federal Reserve to do. We can expect continued interest rate hikes to try to bring down inflation in the months to come.

It`s derived from the Latin word emittere. Up next, we`re going to meet a climate scientist who`s been researching and tracking dust for decades. That`s right, dust. She tells us that those tiny particulates can essentially create change of Brobdingnag in proportions across the globe. The company SpaceX just launched with EMIT on board, a special instrument from NASA that`ll help scientists learn more about how dust is affecting our atmosphere. CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar shows us how we`re going to learn more about dust from space. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over):  In July 2022, this SpaceX rocket launched with a new NASA instrument called EMIT on board. NATALIE MAHOWALD, PROFESSOR OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE/CORNELL UNIVERSITY:  Well, EMIT is going to revolutionize what we can do. So it`s just going to provide such amazing new data to help us understand the surface and the atmosphere.",
