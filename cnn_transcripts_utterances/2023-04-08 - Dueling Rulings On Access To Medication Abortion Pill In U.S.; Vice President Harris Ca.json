And let's take a look at some of the side effects. Drugs have side effects. When we look at deadly side effects, for every million women who have used mifepristone, there have been 20 deaths. If you look at penicillin, if you look at Viagra, it's many more. For penicillin, it's 20 deaths per million users.

Doctor, I mean, this is the most common abortion method in the U.S., as we just heard Elizabeth Cohen report there. First off, I just want to get your reaction to this ruling. DR. MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: I am flabbergasted by this ruling. For a judge who has no scientific training to overturn a panel of experts who advised the FDA on the safety and efficacy of a medication, is frankly unprecedented. Not only was this medication approved 23 - almost 23 years ago, but it's also undergone incredibly rigorous safety monitoring. Since then, it is part of a special monitoring program that is applied to only a handful of medications across the United States, recognizing that this is a medication that is unfortunately subjected to some political debate. And let me be clear, as Elizabeth outlined, that medication is tremendously safe. It is actually far safer to have a medication abortion than to undergo childbirth, in terms of the likelihood of severe effects on the body and hospitalization.",

How is it playing politically?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think right now, the White House still feels like it's in a pretty good position despite the fact that those numbers showed that even though people feel a little bit better about the economy, they still feel like it's in poor condition overall. And the White House in response to that is really trying to get out there more this year than they have in the prior two years in terms of selling the entire big packages, whether it's infrastructure or the prescription drug reforms that the President was able to pass when Democrats controlled all of Congress. And that's a big piece of what they're going to be doing in the lead up to 2024 so as to try to make people continue to feel better about the economy.",

One of the big arguments that the President is trying to make and one of his biggest focuses is when he goes out onto the stump and he is talking about new manufacturing jobs that are going to come because of the infrastructure bill or new jobs around semiconductor manufacturing, which was also a bipartisan bill that was passed by Congress, he is talking about jobs that he says go towards people that don't have to be college educated, that these are blue collar jobs. And that's how he is really trying to reach that middle class, that you just talked about, Amara, people that Biden has tried to ensure stay within the Democratic fold or that they went back, because in prior election cycles, Democrats have lost a lot of the white working class, and that's who the President is trying to target when he is out on the stump talking about that.",

That perpetrator was killed by Israeli Police on the scene. One person also killed, a victim killed, who was an Italian national. All of the victims were tourists. Prime Minister Netanyahu called on reservists, as you mentioned, for both the Police and the Military. The Israeli Army says it's now in a state of heightened alert due to the tumultuous situation over the last few days, to real concerns that this could uptick in violence, could continue. But I want to take you to where it really all started. If you can remember, it was a few days ago that Israeli Police raided Al-Aqsa Mosque, this very striking images of Israeli Police inside, hitting people with battens, hitting people to butts of their rifles, that really started, was the catalyst to this latest cycle of violence. And I bring you back to that, because those factors, those ingredients, if you will, that lead to this latest cycle, are still very much in place. Ramadan is underway. There are more prayers scheduled at Al-Aqsa Mosque for the final couple of weeks of Ramadan overnight prayers. And they're still of course, this tension, the heightened rhetoric, rather, from Hezbollah and Hamas, and again, a state of alert from the Israeli Army, all of this leading people to worry that there could be more deaths, more violence in the coming days.",

And certainly, like the film you're showing right now, those kinds of film clips show the most dysfunctional and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. But it doesn't implicate the various administrations, the four administrations that have been in charge of the Afghan situation for the last 20 years.So, what I'm suggesting is that, yes, the documents are going to point out failures. But those are not things that you publicize to the general public. I think it's wrong to say the White House document is blasting Trump even though they do set the context, or the Trump administration did nothing wrong. I saw a tweet by Secretary Pompeo this morning saying this was all on the Biden administration. That's totally false.

So, all of those things contribute.And if I go back to what I said initially, the report by the White House set the context for what happened, and certainly the Biden administration did some things wrong.

Democratic lawmakers in the state have vowed to sue if the legislation is enacted. They say the bill is racist and unconstitutional, a power grab. White conservative state officials would be controlling much of the criminal justice system for a city that is more than 80 percent Black. Now, you've heard about the city's water infrastructure problems. Well, now a dispute between the mayor and the City Council has left people there without garbage collection.Here with me now to discuss is President and CEO of NAACP, Derrick Johnson, who held a town hall meeting in Jackson this week to talk about the issues. I want to talk about water and trash in just a moment. But, first, you have said that the NAACP will be following the governor's signature on this legislation with a lawsuit. Explain your case to oppose what likely will be signed by the Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves. DERRICK JOHNSON, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, NAACP: Well, the Mississippi Constitution clearly lays out that judges are to be elected by the citizens of the district. And what the State of Mississippi is seeking to do is use up usurped authorities of the citizens by appointing judges, which isn't a direct violation of the state's Constitution, but also it violates equal protection because they are going to treat the citizens of Jackson differently than any other citizen across the state. No other jurisdiction would have appointed judges. And so, for those two very clear reasons, we're going to file a lawsuit. But, more importantly, this is simply retaliation against the City of Jackson because of the state's aggressive nature by starving the water systems of resources out of 25 years of federal Clean Water Act money. The State of Mississippi in their reallocation, only provided the City of Jackson money for three years. So, they created the failure, because Congressman Thompson and members of Congress was able to put into the omnibus bill over $600 million to address the problem of the state's retaliation, then was an aggressive legislative session targeting the City of Jackson to usurp the authority and to take the assets of the city.",

There was some amendments to the bill, but the final draft of the bill is just as harsh as the original bill when it was introduced. This is election year in the State of Mississippi. And the election year politics across the south, particularly in Mississippi, is so racialized that everyone is trying to outmaneuver on the question of race. And so, to have this type of bill is good for white Republicans, unfortunately, to use as red meat to try to generate a base to turn out to vote. And so, we are looking at the reality of a state that is living in 1950, not recognizing that we have to close the racial gap, not to continue to use red meat to divide.And unfortunately, for the State of Mississippi, it has resulted in this state not having a single Fortune 500 company headquartered in the State of Mississippi.

The state has demonstrated that they are not good stewards of resources. We are in the middle of an investigation where the State of Mississippi misspent or stole close to $100 million in funds and gave two contracts - to individuals like (inaudible). So, we didn't want the state to step in and take over the water system because they have demonstrated they cannot manage the money. And so, we are in a better place in terms of the water system.As it come to garbage, I am absolutely confused. You have a mayor, a City Council that went through a process to contract who will provide garbage pickup. There was a company that was the lowest bid by over $12 million, an African-American company. That company has performed, in fact, it worked for several months without being paid. And now, there is the majority of the City Council, and I don't know what's behind it, refusing to award the contract to the company that was the ultimate winner of the bid.
