      "sentences": "And good evening. Thanks for joining us. We were expecting fireworks in the first day of cross-examination of Michael Cohen, the one-time fixer for the former president, turned witness in his criminal hush money trial and we got it. No sooner had the defense begun after morning of the prosecution front-ending all possible attacks on Cohen's character than defense attorney Todd Blanche repeated a colorful, shall we say, insult that Cohen had used to describe Blanche online. That prompted a sidebar with the judge who asked Blanche why are you making this about yourself. The attorney said that he wasn't, that he had a, quote, \"right to show the witness' bias.\" The judge sustained the objection.The trial got back underway, but it long - wasn't long before Blanche returned to Cohen's propensity to mouth off on social media. Blanche asked Cohen, quote, \"'And on that same TikTok, so again on April 23rd, you referred to President Trump when he left the courtroom, you said that he goes right into that little cage, which is where he belongs in a,' and I'm going to clean up the language here, 'effing cage, like an animal.'\" Do you recall saying that?\" Blanche asked. Cohen responded, quote, \"I recall saying that.\" That sort of set the tone for the rest of the hearing when the former president's attorney, a former federal prosecutor, tried to undermine Cohen's credibility as well as his recall of conversations with the former president. It wasn't the only drama either. Allies of the former president, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and several others who appeared to be in town for a VP audition, showed their numbers. And for the second day in a row said what a former president under gag order cannot. Joining us tonight, a former U.S. attorney, Michael Moore, former federal prosecutors; Jeffrey Toobin and Temidayo Aganga-Williams. Also CNN Anchor Kaitlan Collins who was in the courtroom this morning; former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig; and correspondent Kara Scannell, who was also in the courtroom.

But this morning, what the prosecution also did was use Cohen to wrap up their case, going over month by month, all of the elements of the crime, the alleged crime, the invoices that Cohen said were falsified, the check stuff that he said, the descriptions were falsified. And then the checks signed by - majority of them signed by Donald Trump that he said was all false, all because of the retainer.Then the prosecution tried to get ahead of all of Cohen's past legal run ins and everything. But then the cross, I mean, that was - we were expecting some fireworks here. What stood out to me was Cohen remained composed the whole time, even as he was parsing words with Todd Blanche over whether he had lied to the special counsel during the Russia, Russia, Russia investigation or whether he had given an inaccurate statement. They were going back and forth. Cohen even killed the whole time and then relenting and telling Blanche, okay, I lied. But he didn't he didn't break his cool and he didn't give in on some of these other things. But the real theme of the day was Blanche trying to establish by throwing Cohen's words back at him from his podcast, from his book, that he hates Trump and that he's on a revenge tour and he's trying to make money doing it. Cohen acknowledging made $4.3 million on the sale of two of his books.",

I'm just going to say candidly, I thought the cross examination was unfocused and underwhelming.I followed minute by minute as we were doing our live coverage. I just reread the whole thing. There were moments, I think, where he breaks through and scores points. But by and large, he was jumping from topic to topic. He missed some obvious moments. I'll give you an example. The first question, which you talked about in the warm up there, Anderson, was wildly inappropriate and I think miscast the stakes. Blanche came right out and he said, we've never met, you and me, Michael Cohen, right? And Michael Cohen said no. And he said, yet you called me a crying little shit on TikTok. Immediate objection, sustained. It's not relevant what Michael Cohen thinks of the lawyer. It's very relevant what Michael Cohen thinks of the defendant, which he got to later. But if you're Todd Blanche, you don't want to make it about Michael Cohen versus the defense lawyer. You want it to be Michael Cohen versus the truth. So I'm not impressed by what I've seen from the cross so far. He has a day to figure it out. He said he's going to take all day Thursday, but I think he needs a change in course here.",

So you want to get them if you're cross-examining, you want to make them tell the story on your terms and not to follow the script that they've been in, so I kind of see that.I really took away that the jury's probably seeing and thinking right now that Cohen is a grifter and a waffler.

Butwhen the prosecution was up and they were asking Michael Cohen about what it was like for the FBI to come and to raid his hotel that he was staying in because his house was under renovation, his home, his office and what that was like. He was describing that he was frightened, despondent, angry. His life had been turned upside down. And he talked about this call that he got from Trump a few days later. And we had heard at the time Trump called him maybe four or so days after the raid - called him back, really. And he said that Trump told him, don't worry, I'm the president of the United States. There's nothing here. Everything's going to be okay. Stay tough. You're going to be okay.

I mean, I disagree with you about the - have they proven the case? Because when I went back to look at the indictment today, basically they've got to show that he intended to commit another crime, not that he tried to help his campaign. They've got to show that he actually had the intent to commit another crime. And I don't think they've gotten there yet. And that's why - that's - they hoped they've gotten there with Cohen, but that's - he's got to be the one. And so without that, that's why they're trying to ding his credibility up on - time after time and whether it's through the comments that he makes on social media with - how he acts on the stand, the wishy washiness of his answers, I mean, that's what they're after.

They put up all kind of people who do - who've done awful, terrible things, much worse than selling t-shirts and wishing that someone goes down. They've tried to kill people. They've killed sometimes the victims in that very case and juries believe them. Because if you're going to challenge the credibility, you have to place it against a corroboration, I think that's where the counter narrative of explaining why is Donald Trump signing these $35,000 checks again and again and again. They're obviously not for legal fees. I don't think that's a reasonable explanation. So I think the Cohen question is going to come down to the corroboration, when the jury goes back and they think about all of these witnesses. They think about these documents.

The fact that Paul Manafort went to jail and saying that he would not flip and talking about how Michael Cohen did and saying no one should retain the legal services of Michael Cohen. Well, Donald Trump did retain the legal services of Michael Cohen for 10 years. And we're talking about payments that he made to Michael Cohen at the heart of this. I also think the other thing that Todd Blanche got into, and I'm sure he'll get more into it, speaking of how much he made off of his books and after the post presidency or not being in the White House, it's not clear how the jury will take that.

We'll talk about that in a second.
