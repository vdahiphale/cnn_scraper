And nobody understands that better or attracts that better than Joe Biden. You know, a storytelling Irishman, you know, lives in an emotional world.And, you know, those are critical values for politics. That's why, you know, rallies are so exciting. That's why people tear up when they hear the name Bobby Kennedy or Jack Kennedy or John McCain or whatever. But the problem is that can go way too far. And when there's an excess of love and loyalty, you get 70 million Americans who will not budge from their support for a felon, from a criminal, from an adjudicated rapist who has promised to turn this country into an authoritarian country. That's what happens when you won't set aside loyalty and love and emotion. So the stakes are so high that right now the question is, you know, not that, not how loyal are you, but can we avert? Forget about and we can talk more, if you like, about, you know, the event that Joe Biden were reelected. But can you avert a second Trump presidency? And there is not a single number out there, not one, you know, Cook Report telling us that we may lose the House that says that Joe Biden is going to win. And so the answer to that, which is a fair answer, is that, yes, there's still time. There's four or five months to the election. So then you need to ask yourself, what's the trajectory look like here? Are things getting better? If you believe that the problem the Democrats have is that we haven't gotten our message across, the message of the bipartisan infrastructure law, the message of capping out-of-pocket expenses in Medicare at $2,000, of capping insulin costs at $35, and standing up for veterans. If you believe that our problem is that we haven't gotten that message across well. And if you also believe that the president has the biggest megaphone, you have to drop the emotion and the loyalty and love and say, in the next four or five months, is that story going to be told with such precision and poetry and beauty that you will turn around all the numbers that say we are going to lose? And I did this painful thing tonight because, for me, the answer to that is I just don't see that trajectory. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You know, let's be clear, as we all know, those leaders met and they had very rigorous and very serious discussions. It's when it comes to the public that that just simply is disintegrating.And that matters. Unfortunately, in an election year with only, you know, a handful of months to go, it matters a huge amount. It does make it very difficult for international leaders. And NATO allies have been concerned for a very long time about this election, about the looming threat of Donald Trump. Even before the considerations of President Biden's health became so prominent, there has been deep fear in Europe. Endless talk about Trump proofing NATO of Europeans doing more on European security. And that was a focus in this meeting of the NATO leaders. But you're right. It's very difficult to communicate this to the public, to have any broader influence, because every single news article, every single question, every single comment is about President Biden's health. And, you know, despite, again, a very strong press conference deep on the issues, there is just a real concern about, you know, can the president win? The polling doesn't look good. Can he govern if he does win for four more years? But right now, you know, the short term, the urgent question for leaders around the world, for people around the world, especially in Europe and especially for Americans, of course, is whether he can actually beat Donald Trump. And that, I think, is a grave concern. It's very sad, you know, for Americans, for people around the world to listen to a president talk about that he wants to stay in the race because of the gravity of the situation that he faces. He talked about the need to get legislation. Unfortunately, it sort of framed President Biden as, as a man who governed, who's led the country in various roles in an era that no longer exists.",

It is also Prime Minister Netanyahu who has been accused though of moving the goalpost because you remember that it was over the weekend that Hamas said that it was willing to forego one of its demands that any ceasefire it agrees to would be permanent provided that it's at least negotiated during the first phase of a ceasefire deal. But Prime Minister Netanyahu set out a day later his insistence that Israel must be allowed to continue the war after any ceasefire deal that is agreed to.

The head of the Israeli army said this led to troops waiting outside the gates, quote, while the massacre continued inside. He said that cannot be allowed to happen again.
