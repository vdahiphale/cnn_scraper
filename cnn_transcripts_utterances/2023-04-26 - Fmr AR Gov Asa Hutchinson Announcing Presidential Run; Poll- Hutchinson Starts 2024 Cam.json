And this time, its him, and potentially maybe Sununu, who sort of like never Trump lane. So, for that reason, perhaps he'll get a little bit more attention.But you're absolutely right, despite the fact he has law enforcement, he was a congressman, tow-term governor, all the things that he's done. It's not -- to a Trump voter who right now hold the keys to the Republican primary, it's a tough. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: There's also people that oppose Trump but engage in Trumpism, still engage in the culture wars and what have you. Even in that speech, there you can see Governor Hutchinson drawing a contrast there. Recently, he opposed anti trans legislation that would have been passed in his own state and received backlash for that. I remember the last time I talked to him, it was during the Trump administration, and he was criticizing Trump's refugee restrictions as well. And on that program, there's been multiple ways in which he's contrast himself from Trump in recent years. And that that does set himself a little bit of apart when you look at this competition, even those that are engaged in sort of tit for tat. You know, debates right now with Trump still are engaging in some of the same tactics to appeal to his base. The fact that Hutchinson is not doing that may make it even more challenging for him to appeal to that.",

And DeSantis, Governor DeSantis of Florida, essentially copies that same model.My question, I guess, for Asa Hutchinson. Again, if you look at his resume, you look at his experience, he's a credible candidate for president. If you rewind the tape, he would be a mainstream Republican in the pre-Trump Republican Party, but he talks about fighting for the soul of our party. He also says in this speech, that there are misguided people, he means Donald Trump, calling to defund the FBI because of Trump's grievances. You heard him there, say he kept businesses and schools opened even more than Florida during the pandemic, but he's polite about it. The question is, can somebody with that demeanor break through?",

This part of politics that just doesn't really exist in this country anymore.And it's going to be interesting to see whether or not he can find a way to, you know, attack and go after DeSantis.

Our CNN's Eva McKend is there on the ground in Bentonville, Arkansas for us.To that point, Eva, how does Governor Hutchinson and his campaign staff, how do they see that effort?

And he also brings to the field just a hefty resume.I was speaking to people in the crowd, two of them, they actually told me in the past, they voted for both Republicans and Democrats, and that we need civility again in our politics. So those are the very people that Governor Hutchinson, who's on stage now is appealing to. The big question is, can he make gains in this crowded Republican primary? Can he appeal to voters?

Do you want to show up on the debate stage? Or don't you? And that's the party politics right now. That's the rules that are being laid out. And he's going to have to make the decision.",

KINGKANNO-YOUNGS: I was going to say, but you've also seen this before that even when candidates are engaging in some of the more traditional campaign strategies, you might see Trump as well just continue with a tour of his own campaign rallies to continue to appeal to his base or go on to social and make posts like this to try and gain attention as well.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy had said, he would not make changes but, because he was short votes. He then agreed to earlier work requirements for Medicaid recipients and to keep some biofuel tax credits.The question now is, was that enough to get to 218, meaning the votes necessary for passage?

But that doesn't mean that the efforts to try to get the conference in line aren't ongoing. In fact, at this exact moment, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is behind closed doors with several holdouts.People who have said that they're going to vote no. One of them Tim Burchett of Tennessee has told me repeatedly over the past several days, including today that he is still a no. Also, Ken Buck of Colorado, someone who has not said if he was going to vote, yes or no for this package, would not say if he would vote for this package after meeting with Kevin McCarthy. And even Matt Gaetz, who had pushed for some of those changes, including moving up the implementation of proposed new work requirements for the Medicaid program. He raised concerns earlier today about the last-minute nature of this deal making and didn't say whether or not, he would vote for it. And the Matt is very narrow for McCarthy. He cannot lose more than four Republican votes. If he does, that could be enough to sink the bill. But in talking to McCarthy, allies say they're confident and they're also saying to their members, get behind this bill right now, because it will put pressure on the White House to come to the table. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R-NC): This president has put himself in a terrible position. And us passing this bill this week, will show that House Republicans have a position. We've raised the debt limit. We've made an offer. And we have a menu of options we put before the president. He needs to come to the table and start being a grown up in the situation and negotiate with the legislative branch. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Manu Raju, live on the Hill to kick us off.Let's bring the conversation back in the room with our great reporters. Manu made a key point there, Lauren at the end, this is not going to become law. You have a Democratic Senate, Democratic president. This is a blueprint essentially to get House Republicans to endorse a negotiating blueprint for their speaker to sit down with the president. But it's more -- this vote is more than that, though. This is a test of Kevin McCarthy's authority. Can he go into a room after the drama he went through to get elected speaker and say, I'm sorry. I know, there are things you don't like, there are things, I don't like too. We have to take one for the team here.",

They were pretty upbeat. They were feeling like, they're going to be able to get there later this afternoon. Things can change, votes can shift, but they were feeling positively.

If we start to have volatility in the financial markets, that he'll blame the Republicans. But if he takes even a little bit of that blame, given how competitive our politics are, could hurt. KANNO-YOUNGS: I think you're already starting to see the pressure on the White House increase a little bit here. In the press from yesterday, as well the press secretary was questioned. I thought it was very good from Bloomberg. She was basically questioned and saying, well, look, investors don't really care whose fault it is here. But if the long -- and the long-term impact is that the economy suffers, then doesn't the press -- doesn't that push the president to try and negotiate a little bit here? I think you are going to see the pressure increase. Now, look, the White House has been -- has said for weeks now, as you said that they want the debt ceiling to be raised with no strings attached. It probably is not going to help that some of these social programs may have restrictions as well if this passes, but long term, I mean, it's the economy.",
