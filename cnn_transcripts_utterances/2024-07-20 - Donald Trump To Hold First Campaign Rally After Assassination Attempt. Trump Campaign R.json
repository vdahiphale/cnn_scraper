      "sentences": "Hello, and thanks for joining me. I'm Alex Marquardt.The 2024 presidential race is about to enter a critical new phase for both of the leading candidates. In the next few hours, former President Donald Trump is returning to the campaign trail after the Republican National Convention. This comes exactly one week after surviving that attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania last weekend. He and his newly minted running mate, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, will be holding their first joint campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan. And it comes as President Biden continues to recover from COVID at his Delaware beach more as he plots a path forward with a planned return to the campaign trail next week despite those growing calls for him to end his reelection bid. So far, at least 35 Democratic lawmakers are now publicly urging him outspokenly to step aside, with the latest announcement coming in just the last few hours. But the president is insisting that he's staying in the race, and a source says that he's seething at former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi since some of her closest allies are joining the calls for him to drop out. CNN's Kristen Holmes is covering that Trump rally in Michigan. But let's start with CNN White House correspondent Priscilla Alvarez, who is with the president in Delaware. So Priscilla, I understand that the president's doctor has just given an update on his COVID recovery. What did that doctor say?",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. Moments ago, we received that doctor's note at firm Kevin O'Connor that says that the president is still testing positive for COVID, but that his symptoms are improving, and he continues to take Paxlovid.Now, of course, the president, we learned, had COVID on Tuesday. He has been self-isolating here at his residence in Delaware. And even as he self-isolates, he has been deliberating along with his inner circle as they continue to receive multiple letters and messages from Democratic lawmakers who remain concerned about the president's viability as the Democratic candidate. And so the campaign for their part, publicly, and on the airwaves yesterday, said the president is staying in the race while acknowledging that it has been a difficult few weeks for them. The campaign also saying that the president is going to hit the trail again this week, that is the expectation as he recovers from COVID. But certainly, this was a moment, a pivotal week for the president to be out front to shore up support among black and Latino voters, and to make the case to some of his allies that he is up to the task to take on former President Donald Trump. Instead, however, he was sidelined with that positive diagnosis. And what we have seen over the course of the week is that ongoing pressure from Democratic lawmakers, including today in the last couple of hours, and yesterday and the days prior, who say that he needs to step aside, looking instead to who might replace him. Now, the name that has been floated quite a bit is Vice President Kamala Harris, but aides tell me that the two remain in close touch. There is no daylight between them, and the vice president has stood behind the president, including in a call with donors yesterday. Now, the vice president, too, will be at a fundraiser today in Massachusetts as she continues her time on the trail as well. But again, the campaign is saying today that the president remains in the race as the president is trying to recover from COVID here in Delaware, where he is a self-isolating. Alex?",

The Israeli military coming out and actually confirming them, which they don't always do when they carry out strikes on foreign soil. In this case, the Israeli military says that it struck several dual use infrastructure targets, including energy infrastructure targets. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, just gave a briefing where he said that Iran is behind the Houthi rebels in terms the funding, in terms of directing their actions. And he also said that this area was struck because Al-Hudaydah, the port, is also used to bring in weapons from Iran, including what they allege was a Samad- 3 Iranian-made drone that struck Tel Aviv yesterday. The Israeli military carrying out these strikes and also warning that more strikes could come should Houthi actions continue as the Israeli military spokesman said that these actions by the Houthis are against international law and in this case, obviously, resulted in the death of one Israeli citizen.
