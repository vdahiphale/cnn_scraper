As you noted, three objects, this one up here off the north coast of Alaska on Friday, then over Canada on Saturday, and Sunday here, Lake Huron. What's the common theme here? They're all coming this direction. That's the direction of the jet stream, prevailing winds, et cetera. That brings China into play, but not only China. Russia is up there as well.And the fact is, we don't have an answer yet as to what country owns them, or even the Pentagon leaves open the possibility it's not a nation state. It could be privately owned and operated. The two big questions are this -- why is the U.S. now detecting more of these? And are there more of these? In answer to the first question, we know that, and that is that the Pentagon, U.S. military, NORAD, they're looking more closely. They've in effect tightened their radars, their sensors to look for smaller options, particularly in that space you mentioned, 60,000 to 20,000 feet, and they are seeing more. So the big question is, are there more? Is this a part of the globe that China and other countries have been trying to exploit more in recent years? And that seems to be the suspicion here. You had the NATO secretary general say this morning, that's exactly the suspicion of the U.S. and its allies, that this is a space that not just China, but perhaps other countries are using to look down at earth and gain intelligence.",

And keep in mind the jets firing, the F-22s are going much faster than the target here.

We know one of them the U.S. has identified as being from China. Open question as to whether China is responsible for the others, but certainly a suspect here. There's always been the possibility that China shoots back. And China has been saying for a number of days, we reserve the right to do the same. And now, in the last 24 hours, you have China saying, hey, we spotted something here. We may shoot it down.We don't know if this is a U.S. object that they're talking about. What we do know is that U.S. drones, also crewed surveillance aircraft, are operating all the time, not over, but very near Chinese airspace. China doesn't like that. So, of course, the question, the danger going forward is, do those two forces come into conflict at some point? Does China feel it has to take a shot? You start with uncrewed surveillance aircraft, drones, et cetera. But this is a really dicey time between the U.S. and China. So when we think about escalation, these are the kinds of encounters we have to watch very closely, because there are also a lot of crewed U.S. surveillance missions about China -- I've been on one of them before -- every single day.
