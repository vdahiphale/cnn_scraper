The country's president calls it a wake-up call. France expands price controls in the battle against food inflation, and Brazil's foreign minister is with me. We'll be discussing plans to expand the family of the BRICS nations. Live from Dubai, it is Thursday, August 31st. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Welcome to the show and a very good evening. We begin tonight in South Africa where we are learning more about the deadly fire that tore through a crowded housing block in central Johannesburg. At least 74 people were killed, 12 of them children. Officials described the five-story derelict block as a hijacked building. That's one abandoned by landlords and taken over by gangs and other groups who lease it out to people who cannot afford other means of housing. The fire which has now been extinguished, began early on Thursday. It is been called the worst in recent memory. The cause is not yet clear. Now in the past few hours, South Africa's president visited the site to get a briefing from search and rescue teams and he said the disaster was caused in part by social crisis. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It opened up the economy without recapitalizing our industry. The consequence of that is that our manufacturing industry was decimated by imports from Asia. Now, that is economic policy. So you cannot say it will take a long time. It was a deliberate economic policy of trying to deliver cheap goods to the voters for the present government, but this was at the expense of growing the economy. They delivered cheap goods by importing from Asia, instead of restructuring our manufacturing sector, which admittedly had been protected under big tariff barriers during the apartheid era, but they had to restructure and gradually open the economy up. Instead of doing that, they opened the economy instantly. Our manufacturing sector was wiped out, and that these are the consequences that you are seeing today.",

We have Nestle, PepsiCo, and Unilever all named. He said they have done \"a bit,\" I'll quote, \"but not much.\" This has been an ongoing issue, obviously, not just in France, across the continent. But in France, there were negotiations back in June, to put some price caps in place for certain goods in the supermarkets. They've now doubled that. I think what will be key here is how they enforce it. We're told that it will be backed up with sanctions and checks from the government. Something similar was said in June, and we found out this week that many of the commitments that were made by food companies to reduce prices or put caps on them actually really weren't followed through at this stage.

It's still double digits, though, which means food prices are still getting higher, just not as quickly as they were. This is though, as you say, a problem across the board. It is interesting to see what different countries have done about it. Hungary, for example, have also implemented price caps into that quite quickly. Portugal has an exemption on VAT, on value-added-tax on certain goods for low income families. Italy is trying to implement caps. I know here in the UK, the government has threatened food companies, producers, supermarkets with caps, but hasn't actually implemented anything at this stage.

But optically, from a global perspective, when you see Russia in this alliance, you know, many people are asking the question, what does this mean for global power shifts and for what it means in terms of, as you said, currency, using your own currencies, the dominance and the survival of the U.S. dollar.

Much appreciative of your time, Minister Vieira.The head of European football says there's no need for UEFA to take action against Luis Rubiales. The UEFA president condemned the chief for forcibly kissing player Jennifer Hermoso. Rubiales has been suspended by FIFA and Spanish prosecutors are looking into it. Atika Shubert is with us in Madrid. Look, banning 90 days, also currently being investigated. Are these actions enough, given the outcry that we've seen?",

The number of complaints has gone from one complaint on the night of the World Cup, to 16, today. So it just seems to be increasing by the minute. However, this all really rests on the tribunal for sports in Spain. They have the authority to move him out. They have not made a decision on whether or not an investigation is warranted and whether or not these would be grave or very grave infractions. Depending on that judgment will mean whether or not he is officially suspended. Either way, he's ineffectual. But in terms of  technically holding that office, he's holding on.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In one particular corner of one country, there lives a creature that lives only one place in the world. This is Colombia and their unique species is adorable, elusive and critically endangered. But trudging through a forest hot as a sauna, our odds are better than average, thanks to people who know them really well. ROSAMIRA GUILLEN, FUNDACION PREYECTO TITI (voice-over):  They love the nectar of the flowers. And they stick their head in the flower like that -- and their facial hair. WEIR (voice-over):  Rosamira Guillen started her career as a landscape architect. But when she was hired to help build a zoo, she met the animal that would change her life and theirs. The cotton topped tamarin, a little monkey with a look right out of Dr. Seuss. And an equally cute local nickname, the titi. When she learned the illegal pet trade and slash and burn cattle ranching had driven them to the brink of extinction, her architect mind shifted from building zoos to rebuilding forests, which is much more difficult than just dropping seeds and soil. GUILLEN (voice-over):  This may take a day to cut through a hectare of forest but to rebuild, it takes about 20 years. WEIR (voice-over):  Her effort is called Project Titi. In over two decades, she's learned that rewilding takes sweat, smarts and human relations because in order to connect the titis' fragmented habitat, she would need land and the cooperation of ranchers, who do not share her love for these monkeys. Is it harder working with nature or human nature? (LAUGHTER) GUILLEN (voice-over):  Well, I would be happy to just hang out with the monkeys in the forest. Our goal is to get to a certain point where there is enough for them to be stable and make it in the long term, right? Our fears is that, you know, you always fear that you will not have enough support to keep going. WEIR (voice-over):  She worried that she would never have the resources to buy a pivotal piece but then came an angel investor from Silicon Valley. Entrepreneurial, smart, dedicated to saving our planet.",
