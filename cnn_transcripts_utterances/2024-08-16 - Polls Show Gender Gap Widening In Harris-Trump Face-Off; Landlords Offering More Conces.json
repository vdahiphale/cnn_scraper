      "sentences": "I mean, you look at where we were when Joe Biden was in the race and where we are now that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee and the gender gap is the name of the game, all right?We're going to take a look nationally first. All right, this is Democrat versus Trump margin. So it's average across the same pulses. We'll look at Biden versus Trump first. We're going to see that the gender gap was working in Donald Trump's favor. Among women voters, Joe Biden held an advantage, but it was just four points. Look at Donald Trump's advantage among men voters, though, up by nine points. Now let's come to this side of the screen. Let's look at where we are right now, Harris versus Trump. First off, among men voters, look, Donald Trump still holds the advantage. And he held the exact same advantage, nine points. But look at the difference among women voters. It's night and day. While Joe Biden was leading just by four points, look at Kamala Harris' advantage, up 11 points. Now the gender gap is working against Donald Trump, and it's working for Kamala Harris, a seven-point switch-a-roo among women. And that is the reason that Kamala Harris has the momentum in the polls. It's why she has that no clear leader within the margin advantage error nationally. It's because women voters are moving towards the Democrats, while men voters are sticking with Republicans, but not becoming any more Republican. So the gender gap is working against the former president, Mr. Trump.",

And we're seeing it specifically in these Great Lake battleground states.I want you to look again here. Donald Trump versus the Democrat. We're talking Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. We know that this election most likely will be decided in these three pivotal battleground states. And I want you to look here. Biden versus Trump, Harris versus Trump. We'll start here on Biden versus Trump. Again, the gender gap working in Donald Trump's favor back when it was Joe Biden being the Democrat nominee. Donald Trump leading among men voters by 17 points. You look, Joe Biden, has that advantage among women voters. In fact, it was a larger advantage that he helped nationally by 10 points. But again, the gender gap working in Trump's favor. He had a larger lead among men than Joe Biden had among women. Jump over to this side of the screen. Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump. What do we see? It's the same thing that we saw nationally, right? Donald Trump holding his fair share among men voters, up by 15 points. But Kamala Harris -- look at that -- that 17-point advantage. Significantly wider than what Joe Biden was holding among women voters. So gender gap that was working for Donald Trump is now working for Kamala Harris. And it is the reason why, in the \"New York Times\"/Sienna College poll, where Joe Biden was trailing in those Great Lake battleground states, Kamala Harris is leading. It is women voters. They have been supercharged by the Harris campaign in ways they simply weren't by the Joe Biden campaign.",

And all that new supply is making it harder and harder for landlords to fill units.So, yes, some landlords are being forced to offer concessions, like free parking, free weeks, or even three months of rent. One in three apartment units listed on Zillow right now are offering concessions to try to get people to sign a lease. That is up from about one in five years ago. And I spoke to a grad student in Arizona who told me that every single apartment that she looked for was offering some kind of concession. She ended up getting half a month off of rent. And another woman, a teacher, also in Arizona, said she got a whole month free for rent. And it's not just in Arizona. Zillow found that at least half the units in six major cities have concessions right now, including Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Raleigh, Nashville and Salt Lake City. So look, there's always this balance of power between tenants and landlords. But right now, renters have some leverage. So if you're out there looking for an apartment right now, you can use that leverage to your advantage to get a better deal and maybe even some other concessions.",

That's basically in line with historical norms.And importantly, this is a big deceleration from the prior two years when rent was spiking more than 20 percent. Now, this issue, the cost of housing, has come up on the campaign trail. Vice President Harris is out with some new ideas for how to help both renters and buyers, including, importantly, some tax incentives to try to boost the supply of both houses, starter homes, for example, and rental units. There's also a $40 billion innovation fund. That, again, is designed to try to ease this shortage of housing. It's also $25,000 downpayment support. That, of course, would be politically popular. But I have to tell you some of the experts I'm talking to, they're pushing back against the wisdom of downpayment support right now because it would boost demand at a time when demand is already very high. So it'll be important that they get the supply side figured out before they start encouraging more demand -- Boris and Jessica?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So what we are looking at here is a way of monitoring levels of the virus in wastewater. It's sort of a passive monitoring system, as fewer people are getting tested and reporting the results of those tests.And so looking at the viral levels in wastewater over time, you are seeing a summer peak right now. That is comparable to what we saw in the summer of 2022. It hasn't yet quite surpassed those levels in the wastewater data, which was actually expected to happen today, which would make it the biggest since the CDC really started tracking in this way at the beginning of 2022. And this is corresponding with uptakes that we are seeing in emergency department visits, in the hospitalization rate and in the death rate. It's really important to note, though, that those levels are so much lower than they we're at previous times during the pandemic. And come off a low that we were seeing in May. That was the lowest that we've ever seen in the pandemic. So while there is a lot of COVID out there, it is causing less severe disease. And as you can see from this map of where the wastewater levels are highest, and that's in the red and the yellow states. This is not evenly distributed. So the west to seeing the highest levels of the virus in wastewater right now. But this wave -- we typically see these in the summer. This one is coming a little earlier than we saw last year. We see a bigger wave in the winter typically. And that's because we tend to see these sort of four to six months cycles of new variants and waning immunity. And we are seeing both of those right now. The current variant that's the most prevalent is called KP.3.1.1. It's 37 percent of cases in the most recent CDC data. That's tripled over the past month. We are expecting updated COVID vaccines to be coming within the next month or so. So a lot of people who are worried about protecting themselves are looking forward to those. Of course, masking, testing, staying home if you're sick, getting Paxlovid if you are infected in the higher risk group, all of those things are still recommended -- guys?",

And in fact, that's what was originally decided.And that's why Jordan Chiles won the bronze medal and the heartbreak for Barbosu as she realized she did not have that bronze medal. The Romanians then appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. They have ad-hoc committees, small panels that are at the Olympics to make quick decisions. And unfortunately, they had the wrong email address for USOPC and USA Gymnastics. And so the lawyers were not advised on as quickly as they should have been about this appeal. And then the U.S. was rushed and hurried when they did then put up their defense. Anyway, the decision was made. The Romanian was then given the bronze medal. Since that time, the U.S. has said it will appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. That's the last place they can go after the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In the meantime, though, the Romanians basically hurried, and they could do it, the IOC, the National Olympic Committee said, go ahead, you can have a medal ceremony. And so they did have that just a couple of hours ago, as you said, in Romania and Barbosu now has the bronze medal around her neck. But of course, Jordan Chiles, is back in the U.S. and she has her bronze medal. So we've got a lot of bronze medals floating around and two heartbroken athletes as well as another Romanian. And I thought it was wonderful when Barbosu said today at her ceremony that not only does she deserve that bronze, but Jordan Chiles and her Romanian teammates, who is also in the mix here. And if -- if only the adults in the room had the class, the grace and the dignity of these wonderful young athletes.",

It's not necessarily -- they're not targeting -- we're not the target audience, clearly, the three of us, for -- for breakdancing. But these are human beings. And no matter what you think, if it was ridiculous, if you didn't like the routine, if you thought it was silly, you're still dealing with human beings. And I think people forget that as they look, get all of these athletes, be it Jordan Chiles or Barbosu or, in this case, the Australian breakdancer, as Raygun -- as -- as commodities or something to just be mocked and laughed at. And hopefully, people will learn, although I'm not going to hold my breath on that. I'm sure we all won't because of where we are with social media.
