Here in the nation's capital, if you listened closely enough, you may have heard a collective sigh of relief. This afternoon, President Biden signed into law the bipartisan bill that raises the nation's debt limit that prevents the federal government from running out of money to pay its bills. Many experts predict a default, the first in American history would have been catastrophic for the US economy and beyond. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us live from the White House. Priscilla, the president really emphasized how precarious this standoff was, yet, another fiscal crisis was averted with just some days to spare, but it also underlined how he was able to get things done in a bipartisan fashion with the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy.",

And of course, this only came days before a potential default on June 5th, which is on Monday.Now President Biden also stressed during his remarks, the bipartisanship that was shown by both parties, of course, this was the outcome of weeks of pain-staking negotiations between White House negotiators and Republican negotiators, and there were calls a handful of them between President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, only a week ago where we were talking about a breakthrough as they reached a tentative agreement. And now a week later, and only hours ago, President Biden signing that into law, and so that was a message that he shared on Friday evening from none other than the Oval Office, just really signaling and underscoring how important a moment this was.

He, of course, is the person to beat in this race at this point. All of these candidates are vying to be the alternative. But Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, made a bit of a last minute change this week to fly back here to Iowa to appear before these Republicans and as he was leaving, he was asked what do you think it means that Donald Trump was not here?

Well, for a while now of course, we've been hearing that a possible large-scale counteroffensive by the Ukrainians could be imminent, and it certainly seems as though they are moving closer to that point.In fact, in an interview with \"The Wall Street Journal,\" the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he now said he believes this country is ready for that counteroffensive. He said they still actually need more things for it, but he also says they can't wait for months and he believes that a counteroffensive would be successful though he says he is not sure how long it would take. One of the other things we also picked up on is that he said that the Ukrainians need more air defense systems, specifically more Patriots.' Now, we know that the Ukrainians currently have two of those systems, one provided by the US, one provided by Germany, but he was speaking of 50 in total, in order to keep Ukrainian cities safe. Of course, it appears to be the case that the Patriot is the only surface-to-air missile system so far that has been capable of shooting down those Kinzhal hypersonic missiles that the Russians had claimed were invincible. At the same time, on the battlefield, it seems as though the Ukrainians are putting the Russians under evermore pressure. One of the things that we've seen in some of those occupied areas like for instance, Berdyansk, that important port town that is an important staging area for the Russians, it has been hit by some missiles, some believe that it could be storm shadow missiles provided by the UK that the Ukrainians then fired. And then of course, you've had that cross border action going on as well, where the Russians are saying that their border region around the area of Belgorod has been under fire.
