At least three people have been killed in Florida and Georgia as the storm continues to pummel the southeast. The National Weather Service is telling residents to stay in their safe place. Helene is now moving over south Georgia as a Category One storm with 90 mile per hour winds.Officials say it's still an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation. Now, it made landfall a few hours ago as a monster Category Four hurricane with winds of 140 miles per hour. It's the strongest storm to ever make landfall in Florida's Big Bend. The National Weather Service is describing it as unsurvivable with up to 20 feet of storm surge expected in some areas. Helene has knocked out power to more than a million and a half homes and businesses in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We were expecting that to happen right around this hour.The wind we know is going to carry around and stick around here in the Tallahassee area for a little bit longer. And that's currently what we're experiencing here. What we are also keeping a close eye on are power outages. Just here on this street where I'm standing, these street lights have flickered on and off now at least three times. Power outages across Leon County, holding steady now for about 130,000 customers, which doesn't sound like that many customers without power, but when you put it into perspective, there's only about 300,000 people who live in Leon County. You can sort of feel some of that wind coming in here again. Across Florida though, it's a different story. More than a million people are without power. And then when you begin to add Georgia and also the Carolinas, you're looking at 1.5 million customers without power. A lot of people are still sheltering in place. That's been the communication even from Governor Ron DeSantis asking people to stay either in their homes or in the shelters that are being run by either the cities or the counties. We've also gotten updates from the governor here of Florida on a fatality in the Tampa area. Another two confirmed fatalities in Georgia as well because of a tornado attributed and because of Hurricane Helene really just showing how dangerous this storm has been so far and continues to be for millions of people.",

That recorded a 941 millibar central pressure. This, Hurricane Helene, rolled in with 938 millibars. That, of course, the lower the number, the stronger the hurricane. And we have seen anywhere from extreme storm surge values that have set records in Cedar Key. We have seen extreme wind warnings stretch from the coast, inland into southern Georgia. And we know that because of the forward speed of this storm that the storm is not done. It is moving quickly and it will impact several U.S. states overnight and into the days to come. Particularly hard hit will be the state of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. And we're thinking about the tropical storm force and hurricane force winds that will impact areas that don't normally experience them. This will bring down trees, take down power, and also the flash flood threat potential with this system is extreme. We cannot overstate that enough. The amount of rain that is falling from the sky here is, quote, \"unprecedented.\" It will be historic in nature, especially for those mountainous regions. Even the National Weather Service talking about the potential of landslides in some of those vulnerable mountain communities of South Carolina and North Carolina. So we are going to really think about the people who are impacted by this storm, this monster of a storm. And as a meteorologist, knowing how powerful this storm was as it made landfall, I fear what daylight will bring to the Big Bend region and the southeastern U.S. as this expansive, expansive storm continues to roll on through.

That is about 20 minutes from where we are, but because of the storm surge that they are late this afternoon, anywhere between four to six feet of it, we had to find higher ground and then from there, we tried to make our way back to Hillsborough, which is the Tampa area, but because several bridges have been closed because of this storm, we decided to stay put in St. Petersburg and the flooding here is just as bad as it was over in Gulfport.If you can kind of make out where I'm at, because much of this neighborhood is without power, you can see just how much of the bay has pushed into this one street out here. The white stuff that you might be able to make out in some of this water here, some of this bay water, we believe to be a part of some Styrofoam, a part of a concrete, a dock that was broken in half, that sits just behind me, but its really difficult for you to make out just because again, there's no power out here and its really difficult to put a light considering the amount of flooding that is going on at that place there. Going into the storm, the concern from emergency officials in Pinellas County was the fact that even though the hurricane was going to track north and west of us, and so this area was not going to get a direct hit. The concern was that these low low-lying areas would flood no matter what. We have prepositioned in Pinellas County the last two years in a row to cover to other hurricanes. One hurricane was Ian two years ago, that hit to the south. And then last year, we were in Pinellas County to cover Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall to the north, and in both of those hurricanes, this part of Pinellas County flooded and it flooded pretty bad. In fact, last year during Hurricane Idalia, which again stayed off the coast, state to the west, went to the north, did not have a direct impact on things out here. Laura, more than 1,500 homes here in Pinellas county were damaged in the flooding. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that's bringing in some strong winds. And also some heavy rain. The rain seem like it had gone away maybe 30, 40 minutes ago. Now it's coming back again. We're probably going to experience this now for the next hour or so. We are expecting the rain to begin to die down completely in the 3:00 hour. And then the winds are going to stick around with us here in Tallahassee until about 5:00 in the morning. Now, it's those two reasons why a lot of communities like this one here in Tallahassee are still asking people to shelter in place, whether they're staying here at their home or there at a shelter. One of the shelters here in Leon County, for example there still wanting people just to stay in place, ride out this storm completely until it is safe to go outside. Now, here in shelter specifically, we know that there's 1,700 people in shelters where we are in Leon County. Another thing when paying close attention to is power outages. It seems like it's just increasing by the hour about 1.5 now, more than 1.5 million customers are without power in Florida, Georgia, and also in the Carolinas. Here where we are in this county, we're right around 130,000 customers without power, but to put it into perspective, there's only about 300,000 people who live in Leon County. So you're talking about a good amount of people here who are experiencing power outages. As I look out, where from where I'm standing on this little vantage point, I get a good view of other parts of Tallahassee, some areas still have their lights on from what I can tell. For example, we're standing even on this street, these street lights flickered on and off now a few times as well. So power restoration, Kim, is going to be a big focus going in to tomorrow. A lot of communities and a lot of officials have said, what is it going to look like in the morning when we do go out? What's the damage is going to be?

But as we've seen with Ishiba's win, when his political acumen, his experience in policy and foreign policy led to him securing the top job. Now, a little bit it about Ishiba. He has formerly served as the country's defense minister, and he's quite well liked within the general public for his work in rural revitalization. He's also proposed the idea of an Asian NATO. But I've spoken to a couple of experts and they're quite surprised by his win because he's actually not really very well liked within his own party. He's has actually been quite a sharp critic of his many politicians within his own party, and he's been once known to the tray I his own party after leaving it once it lost power. Now, again, however, we do have to remember that the Liberal Democratic Party is going through a bit of an identity crisis right now, has been marred by two very large scandals that actually led to the former Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida's popularity dip significantly. So, the LDP and Kishida himself recognized that they needed a new face to lead this party if they were going to win at the general elections. And Ishiba looks like he is going to be that choice.
