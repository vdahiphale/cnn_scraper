Biden will receive an aerial tour of the site to get a firsthand look at the destruction there. And then he'll be able to get a full picture of the building that was left behind. And then later, he's expected to meet with officials and first responders. The president will also spend time with the families of the six construction workers who were killed when the bridge came crashing down after a massive container ship hit one of its columns.Last week's incident effectively shut down operations at Baltimore's port. And Biden has pledged the full support of the federal government with recovery efforts. His administration is asking Congress to approve paying the entire cost of rebuilding the bridge.

The Israeli military shared its. Damning preliminary report on that killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. The IDF says that a quote serious violation of protocols contributed and that a shoulder bag mistaken for a weapon was central to what happened. Two IDF personnel have since been dismissed as a result of the investigation. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has been following this for us from Jerusalem.

We have seen a convoy struck before, nearly 200 aid workers have died in Gaza since the beginning of this war. But we have never seen the Israeli military carry out such a thorough and public accounting of its actions. And this report is quite damning. The Israeli military acknowledging that commanders involved in these strikes on this World Central Kitchen convoy violated military protocols and made errors in decision-making, fatal errors that led to the deaths of these seven aid workers.The Israeli military gives a timeline of what happened. They say that this all started when humanitarian aid trucks left this pier where aid has been coming in by sea. Shortly after that, they identified a gunman on one of these aid trucks. And subsequently, as these vehicles, civilian vehicles belonging to the World Central Kitchen, joined this convoy, Israeli commanders made a grave mistake, misidentifying the vehicles as carrying militants. Believing that these militants were inside these vehicles, which, of course, was very much not the case. They also misidentified a bag that one of these aid workers was carrying as a weapon. All of this led to the decision by commanders to carry out these airstrikes on three vehicles. In the course of four minutes, three of these World Central Kitchen vehicles, were struck, resulting in the deaths of these seven aid workers. Now, in terms of consequences, the Israeli military's chief of staff has decided to dismiss two of the officers involved in this, the chief of staff of the Nahal Brigade, Colonel Nohi Mendel, as well as an unidentified major who was serving as the brigade's fire support officer. Three other senior officers, the brigade commander, the division commander, and the head of southern command have been reprimanded by the chief of staff in this instance.",

And while I am glad that the IDF has found this attack on aid workers who were providing humanitarian assistance, to be unjustified and a terrible breach of protocol. It's not the only breach of protocol in this war by the Israeli Defense Forces. They killed three of their own hostages who were speaking Hebrew and waving white flags. They've killed innocent people seeking shelter in a Christian church, in mosques, in hospitals, in civilian refugee shelters. The IDF has proved to be undisciplined in many cases and trigger-happy. And the accountability, now that it's begun with this tragedy, has to be extended to the entire course of the war.",

So far, fortunately,. there appears to be no serious damage. Let's go straight to CNN's Chad Myers. Chad, 4.8 on the Richter scale, grand scheme of things, not a huge earthquake, but it is rare to get them in the Northeast. CHAD MYERS, METEOROLOGISTThe seismic waves go farther in the east, because there are fewer cracks in the soil, cracks in the bedrock, so when it rings, it just goes for miles and miles and miles, and there you go. We probably will get one aftershock somewhere in the ballpark of about 3.8 or so. It was a shallow quake right there, just about three or four miles below the surface. That was part of the problem. I saw some pictures, Boris, online, where they showed cracks in the city streets of New York. I kind of chuckled, and I said, well, you are a tourist, because that crack has been there for a very, very, very long time.",
