Of course, the Israeli Air Force has said they've dropped the same number of bombs on Gaza in six days as during the entire 2014 conflict with Gaza. So, that's the scale of what we're actually seeing here on the ground.And I should say, listening to Becky talk about that border, the Rafah border here, as you both know, we're a few miles from the Gaza border. We're about ten or so miles from the Egyptian border and not much further. Over that border is that closed crossing. And this is what it's like. It's a very -- you're in a very desert- like environment as we experience when those tanks go by. I mean, that is the terrain here. And that border is closed. And you think about Gaza and how tiny it is and how many -- you've got more than 2 million people there, and that border completely closed just not far from where we are. It gives you a sense though that if you were to open it, there is the real question of where they go. You're coming into terrain very similar to what's behind me and where we're standing right now. And so that's some of the big questions they have to answer. But, again, where we are, we just did hear some Israeli attack helicopters and, again, that consistent continuing outgoing artillery fire from Israel into Gaza.",

We're dealing with terrorists. We're dealing with thugs. We're dealing with barbarians who are dressed as civilians, who are hiding behind civilians. And so as much as Israel will do everything it can to mitigate collateral damage, it will not stop Israel. It will not solve our resolve and it will not stop the necessity of completely eliminating and eradicating Hamas from the face of this Earth. Look, in the State Department, even in this briefing, it looks like, that my colleague, Jenny Hansler, was reporting on, they even note that Hamas is known -- is using civilians as human shields, as they have from the beginning. And it's also impossible to influence what Hamas is going to do inside Gaza. With that in mind, do -- I mean, are you -- would you say that it is impossible to ensure the safety of civilians once the security operation gets underway?",

We know and the world knows that the leadership of Hamas is not in Gaza. They're in Qatar. They're living in five-star hotels. And so, you know, one way to end this conflict is for the Qataris to round up the leadership of Hamas, put them on a plane, and let's trade them for the hostages. That will end things very quickly.

I wish I could see you. I just see a screen. But I'll do my best and thank you for that. I appreciate it. You asked about what it was like for me. Actually, we woke in the morning to a message from my sister on the family WhatsApp asking if we were all right. She was very concerned for everybody. Something was happening. There were missiles. There were alerts but also it felt different to her. It sounded different to her. And she describes while we are online with her what is happening. We hear about the shattered -- we hear her. I'm going to read this for you, just a bit of it. We got a text from someone there, infiltration Sderot. It sounds like they shattered the glass at the backdoor, lots of shooting. She talks about their house being surrounded, lots of gunfire, about a knock on the door, which had to be terrorists. My father writes, lock all entrances, all the tensions on you. She says, we did before entering the safe room. We are all very scared. The girls are in their homes and someone could kick it down, kick down our front door. And the back door is (INAUDIBLE). Definitely a lot of shooting in the kibbutz. That was at 7:47, we got our final message from her and there was no response to our messages. Until a few minutes later, Rotem wrote to us, mom and dad are dead. I'm sorry.
