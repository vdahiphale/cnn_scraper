KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTERAnd you really saw him kind of abrade Donald Trump in that speech that he delivered, saying that he was not someone that could relate to people in any kind of meaningful way. He said that Donald Trump had never changed a diaper, changed attire, and he really went after him for some of this hurricane misinformation that he has been spreading, saying that it was dangerous. And I've been covering Obama for a while now. I don't think I've ever seen him quite that upset and emotional, particularly on this issue of the hurricane lies essentially that Trump has been saying. So, this is quite a personal issue, I think, for Obama. We saw him at that rally, but he also visited a campaign office before he took the stage, and he really talked in forceful terms about the necessity of supporting Harris when it comes to black men, and it does give you a sense of how worried the campaign is about this particular voting bloc. They have looked at polls that show that black men have not supported Harris in the ways that they were supporting Biden or in the ways that they were supporting Obama himself. And so, you will see him more and more on the campaign trail. He is set to hit all of the battleground states in the weeks before the election. In a way, he is repaying a favor that Kamala Harris put towards him back in 2008. She traveled all the way to Iowa to knock on doors ahead of the Iowa caucus for Barack Obama.

Those ties have been growing a lot closer over the past couple of months, as on the one hand, Russia has continuously isolated or increasingly isolated by Europe and by the United States on the international stage, and the Iranians, of course, facing that standoff with Israel in the greater Middle Eastern region.So, certainly, those two countries now much more reliant on one another economically, and then, of course, also in the military technical sphere as well. The Russians, for instance, have been accused by the United States and by Ukraine of using Iranian drones on the battlefield in Ukraine, and also now Iranian-provided short-range ballistic missiles, even though the Iranians still continue to deny that they ever gave that kind of technology to the Russians. Masoud Pezeshkian today said that both Russia and Iran should support one another on the international stage. I want to listen in to some what he had to say during that meeting with Vladimir Putin.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is visiting European allies, as he works to sell his victory plan, his blueprint for winning the war against Russia. Important to note, the details of that plan have yet to be made public. Following their meeting, Mr. Zelenskyy said he and the Pope spoke about bringing Ukrainians home, who had been taken captive by Russia. The U.S. Secretary of State says that U.S. is working very hard through deterrence and through diplomacy to prevent a wider conflict in the Middle East. Speaking at a gathering of Asian leaders in Laos on Friday, Antony Blinken emphasized the need for a diplomatic solution in Lebanon. His words coming amid intensified Israeli airstrikes, as well as an Israeli ground incursion in the south of the country. Happening right now, a judge in the state of Texas is deciding whether to accept Boeing's guilty plea agreement to fraud charges. Now, this stems from its role in two fatal crashes which killed 346 people. The previously agreed upon deal between Boeing and federal prosecutors includes fines and oversight for the planemaker. The victims' families call the agreement a sweetheart deal, and are asking that it be thrown out. A UN inquiry is accusing Israel of carrying out a concerted policy of destroying the healthcare system in Gaza, saying its continued attacks constitute the crime of extermination. That report says Israeli forces have deliberately killed and tortured medical personnel and relentlessly attacked medical facilities, blocking food, fuel and medicine for reaching hospitals. Israel denies the allegations, calling them outrageous. Three hospitals in northern Gaza, meantime, are under evacuation orders right now. Doctors, though, say they're critically ill patients, including many of them who are children, could die if they tried to move them. The hospitals also warned they are running out of fuel, and say it is a catastrophic situation. Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as \"Doctors Without Borders\", says Israel's evacuation orders are turning Gaza into an \"unliveable wasteland\". I'm joined now by Anna Halford, a project coordinator with MSF. She is joining us from Deir al Balah in Gaza with me on the phone. First of all, appreciate you joining us. Can you just give me a sense at this hour, what is the current situation in those hospitals in northern Gaza? ANNA HALFORD, PROJECT COORDINATOR, MSF GAZA (VIA TELEPHONE): It's -- in principle, it's very difficult for us to say because we don't have -- we're not up there ourselves. We have colleagues who are in northern Gaza at this point, who are either trapped or who have recently got to safety from the Jabalia area. We also have colleagues and ex-colleagues who have been working in those hospitals. We have a contact inside allowed a hospital, and the situation is, as you just described in the intro, running out of fuel, running out of medication, which has already been in short supply for quite some time, trying to do their very best for the patients who are still coming in, in response to attacks, airstrikes, shootings and so on, and who are turning up needing emergency care. So, maintaining the electricity supply in such hospitals, maintaining the care when there are not enough medical staff around, who also have to think of their own safety, and who, in many cases, have fled with their families when that was still possible,",

Even if a patient is able to get out, can you just walk us through how difficult it is an operation like that, if they are able to evacuate patients? And then, the question, of course, I think many people have is, evacuate them where? Where do they go?HALFORD (VIA TELEPHONE): Exactly. So, again, evacuating a patient who is sufficiently, critically ill to be on a ventilator, they are unstable, by very definition, moving them -- moving away from monitoring equipment, the medical care required to accompany such a person, even if you do have access to safe routes and an ambulance, which is functional (inaudible) generators, there isn't fuel for ambulances either. There are many people being transported by hand, by cart, by trailer, behind a motorbike. These are not situations that are optimal, let me say, for transporting any patient, let alone one who is critically ill or injured. And there has been an attempt, a UN-led attempt to evacuate some patients from one hospital. They were unable to complete that movement yesterday. They were unable to get safely within reach of the hospital in order to carry out that evacuation. And so, that's very frustrating for all of us in the medical community and the humanitarian community, because we are all very aware of the potential for these patients to -- for further suffer.",

So, I'm talking -- imagine that you have 30 people within the care of yourself and your spouse. There are orphan children who do not belong to you, technically, but they belonged to extended members of family who have died. You have elderly people whose mobility is already restricted. How do you move those people under a bombing or a shelling situation along roads without any transport to a place where that is also receiving airstrikes?

These back-to-back major hurricanes come on top of what's already been a disaster-filled year in the U.S., tornadoes, wildfires, floods, all requiring that response.Joining me now is Katharine Hayhoe. She is the Chief Scientist of the Nature Conservancy, and a Distinguished Professor at Texas Tech University. Excuse me. It's great to have you with us. I'm just looking at this new sort of quick -- quickly issued report from World Weather Attribution, which is a network of scientists. And so, they look into the role of climate change in different weather events, and they believe that climate change boosted the winds in Milton by 10 percent. So, otherwise, it would have made landfalls as a Category 2 instead of a 3, that extreme rapid intensification we were talking about for so many days when it jumped to a Category 5 because of the warmer water there in the Gulf, and also said that they believe climate change led to 20 percent to 30 percent more rain in this storm.

In fact, we saw the very same numbers with Hurricane Helene just two weeks ago, where their attribution scientists estimated that more than 50 percent of the rain that fell in some places, including in the mountains of North and South Carolina and Tennessee, was due to a warming climate. So, we know we've always had hurricanes and floods and droughts and storms, but we know that the warmer this planet gets, the more it is super sizing the events. Hurricanes are ratcheting up from a tropical storm to a Category 3, 4 or 5 overnight. They're dropping a lot more rain. Storm surge is worse because of rising sea levels, and all of this is putting us at risk.",

We've known that since the 1850s. When did people start to say, oh, maybe it's just a natural cycle? They didn't start to say that until just about 30 or 40 years ago. Why? Because that was when we started to see that the impacts of climate change were happening now instead of in the future, and that meant we had to do something about it. So, all of this, I'm not sure it was manufactured by the fossil fuel industry and by others who have the most to lose from climate action that will keep the rest of us safe and live to -- lead us to a better world.So, what Bill did was really perfect, because nine out of 10 Americans, as of a poll last year, so I'm sure that number is higher now, nine out of 10 Americans have been personally affected by how climate change is super sizing our weather events, what I call global weirding, but only two thirds of them make the connection to human- caused climate change. And research shows that when we say scientists agree, which we do, overwhelmingly, that is very effective in helping people understand that it's real, it's us, it's serious, and there are solutions if we act now.",

And around the world, there is only a handful of countries where more than half of the people hear conversations about climate change on a regular basis. Most of those are centered around Sweden, around Northern Europe, and then Australia also just makes it over that bar, but the rest of us are not.Now, when we say conversations, I'm not talking about ice sheets, polar bears and ocean circulation. We need to help people understand how the people and places and things they care about today that they love are being affected. Heart conversations, I think of them as rather than head conversations. And we need to engage people's hands. What can we do to make a difference? So, that's why I did my TED talk. That's why I have a weekly newsletter called Talking Climate that shares good news, not so good news, and something you can do every week. And that's why Bill, who we just heard from, wrote a wonderful book called \"Life as We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate, and Hope in a Changing World\", but also the hope that climate action could truly bring us a better, safer future.",

And the reason for this announcement and this award, I think in thecontext where coming up to its announcement, Erica, there was a lot of speculation about whether it might be a UN body involved in the Middle East working with Palestinians or Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who might get the Nobel Peace Prize, or indeed, the organization that had been led by Alexei Navalny, the Russian dissident before he died. So much speculation about who might get this very prestigious prize. In the end, this relatively unknown group, unknown outside of Japan and unknown until today.
