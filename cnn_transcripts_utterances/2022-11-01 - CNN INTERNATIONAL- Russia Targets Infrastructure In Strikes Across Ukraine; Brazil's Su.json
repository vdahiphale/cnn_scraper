Will that move change the trajectory of the war in Ukraine? Israelis go to the polls for the fifth time in less than four years. Can current Prime Minister Yair Lapid stave off a challenge on Benjamin Netanyahu? And a U.K. government minister is under fire for inflammatory comments over immigration. Will explain this hour. We are hearing that Iran plans to send about 1,000 more weapons to Russia, including advanced guided missiles for Moscow's war in Ukraine. Tehran has already supplied deadly drones. This comes a short time after the mayor of Kyiv announced full power is back on in the capital. It was restored 24 hours after Russian missiles targeted critical infrastructure in Kyiv and across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says most of the missiles Moscow fired were brought down by air defenses and the repair work goes on. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): As of now, restoration works are still ongoing in those regions where there were hits by Russian missiles today. We are doing everything possible to restore the energy and water supply. And we will restore it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This actually happened a few weeks ago, but it gives you a picture for just the level of weaponry that we're talking about and that you're dealing with here. This is a normal apartment building. Three people were killed, seven people were injured. And just yesterday, you mentioned in your introduction 50, more than 50 missiles fired at Ukraine. Ukrainian Air Force saying that they were able to intercept more than 40 of them, which is a tremendous success rate. But as you know, Max, even just a few that managed to get through if they hit those targets, and the target now is very much of course civilian infrastructure, then they still can have a devastating impact. So yes, there will certainly be a great deal of concern about more weaponry being pumped into Russia at this crucial point in the war, Max.",

Because the grid as it stands cannot cope with more people living here.They're being asked to, you know, shops can't have lights on, restaurants, everyone has to minimize the amount of electricity they use. And still, every time you have these attacks, you are having rolling blackouts, you have situations like yesterday in Kyiv where 40 percent of the city were without water, where you were suddenly seeing lines of people collecting water to stock up in preparation for more of these attacks on civilian infrastructure, because the feeling here on the ground is that this problem isn't going to go away. And that's why you're seeing Ukrainian officials calling for more air defense and also calling on more support and materials for trying to rebuild the grid. They are trying to keep up, but it is very, very challenging. And that's why they're asking for more support, Max.",

He actually came and cast his ballot here, was his first time in 13 years that he was casting his ballot not as a sitting Prime Minister, of course, now it is Yair Lapid in power. And also, what's at stake this time around is the rise of the far- right in Israel. And that's because in any governing coalition that Benjamin Netanyahu will be able to put together, it will likely rely on the growing popularity of a far-right party, one of whose leaders was once convicted for inciting racism.

The problem with dehumanizing rhetoric, or inflammatory rhetoric, like we heard from the British Home Secretary, is that it does tend to relax the natural human aversion to violence, and it dehumanizes these people that are trying to come into the countries. But, of course, there are legitimate points to be made about the threats to security that can sometimes be presented as the Home Secretary was alluding to. But it just indicates how thorny this problem is and how it's very difficult to navigate while preserving the safety of the country in question. And also treating people in a humane way.
