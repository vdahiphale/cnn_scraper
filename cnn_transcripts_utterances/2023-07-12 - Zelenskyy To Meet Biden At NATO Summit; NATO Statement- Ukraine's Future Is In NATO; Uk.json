And the aim to make clear is countries membership would help both Ukraine and NATO. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): NATO will give Ukraine security.

Ukraine did when one major concession. As NATO agreed to streamline the accession process to just one step. NATO with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that came after countries agreed to remove the requirement for a Membership Action Plan. Any invitation will still be conditional on democratic and security reforms. Stoltenberg did not give a timeline on when it could be done.

But all eyes will very much be on that particular bilateral meeting and what comes out of it. And later on, Joe Biden's words when he closes the summit with a speech. There have been these tensions between President Zelenskyy on one hand and the hopes he'd had of getting more and specifically a timetable, Leila and the rest of the alliance that, frankly was quite pleased with having come up with what it did come up with, as you mentioned, the fact that that requirements for Membership Action Plan has been scrapped.And President Zelenskyy doesn't go home, even already entirely empty handed. He's also had individual pledges of fresh weaponry. The French President, for instance, offering to send long-range missiles that Paris had been reluctant to give Kyiv so far. The Germans as well, announcing a fresh package of more than 600,000 -- 600 million euros, I'm sorry, that will include things like more Leopard tanks and that much needed ammunition. There is of course on the table that pledge of the fresh American military aid package that includes the controversial cluster munitions. No doubt that will be at the heart of President Zelenskyy's meeting with President Biden later. So, he does go home, not only with a sense of the fact that NATO is firmly behind him that Ukraine's future as we've been hearing repeatedly, for the last day is within NATO. But of course, much more tangibly, even as this counter offensive struggles to make the kind of progress that Ukrainians had hoped for. Much more weaponry and including those cluster munitions as controversial as they are. What we've heard here is the Ukrainian defense minister Alexei Resnikoff describing them as potentially a game changer as Ukraine -- Ukrainian forces try and pierce through those fortified Russian frontlines, Laila.

While this comes after Ukrainian says its air defenses also repelled Russian attack drones launched toward the Kyiv region for the second night in a row. Meanwhile, on the frontlines, Ukraine's military says it's making further progress retaking territory around the city of Bakhmut. Ukrainian officials say they've liberated more than a kilometer of territory as part of their push to bring the city within their firm control. For their part, Russian sources have claimed success further east around the town of Liman. On either side has been able to make any meaningful breakthrough along the eastern front lines in recent weeks with small amounts of territory changing hands.

But I think it's clear, it's not just that, for example, on Tuesday, a grain terminal in the city of Odessa was hit causing a fire. That coming less than a week before the expiry of that Grain Deal.So again, part of a pattern and as you say, as this offensive continues to inch along, we're hearing words like consolidated, holding on to positions, things like that, from the Ukrainian military accounts of what's happening. I think it's clear they are having to defend any small gains. They've made, as well as attack in the on the Eastern Front, still very much concentrating on what they call the Bakhmut direction to be clear. They're not actually trying to retake the town of Bakhmut as of yet. They're moving in to the north and south on the flanks trying to encircle and track the Russian forces there. And in the south, again, coming up against heavy Russian fortifications, it's clear they're having to basically demine as they go. But they are also claiming to be inching forward there. And I think this is why these weapons supplies that NATO countries continue to promise, particularly long- range missiles, we sort of promised from France to join the U.K. in providing those on Tuesday. Those will be crucial. Ukrainian officials are reporting that a top Russian General was killed in the port city of Berdyansk in the south earlier this week by that very kind of long-range missiles. So that is crucial. That's more than 100 kilometers away from the front lines there. So really, this is the sense that we're getting. It continues to grind along.

Those elements that bolster Russia's claim that it is de facto at war with NATO with the west.The central justification essentially for continuing this war. So, I think that is really crucial. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov quoting the French decision to supply those long-range missiles and erroneous decision fraught with consequences for Ukraine. He talked about the anti-Russian character of the NATO meeting. We've heard as well from the Russian ambassador to Washington who said all the resources of NATO are being thrown into the fight against Russia.
