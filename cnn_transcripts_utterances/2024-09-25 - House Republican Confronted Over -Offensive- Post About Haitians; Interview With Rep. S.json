And so, when you don't have leaders who tell you what is right and wrong, you end up with situations like this. Now, the thing that is so unsettling about this is you mentioned in your piece, Anderson, is that this man was law enforcement. This man had the power -- he carried a gun. He had the power to walk in the street and enforce the law and most likely we have the justice system behind him. He now can make laws that are rooted in racism and discrimination. And so, in this moment there is an opportunity in November for us to decide which direction we want this country to go in. You do not have to like every policy of Kamala Harris, but at least Kamala Harris wants to be in conversation about the direction -- the positive direction, and work together right and left, Black and White.

I think this incident is fascinating, in part, because we've reached this point where unless you say the N-word people like, well, I'm not sure if that's racist or not. I mean, like, you can't -- you don't get much more explicitly racist than what just happened there. And yet, Republican leadership isn't willing to hold him to account. I mean, even just a few years ago, we saw Steve King from Iowa, who was this just sort of dabbling and White nationalist mean you sort of ahead of the trend, if you will, in the GOP. And he's held to account by Republican leaders in and eventually lost his GOP primary, which seemed like a sort of rejection by the party.

And I'm back in 2015, Donald Trump said one of the smartest things he has ever said about politics, which is that it's the press that wants policy proposals, not voters. They don't really care about them. I think that's generally true.And I think this charge that Harris hasn't released a policy agenda is sort of a fig leaf. And I think too it's meant to distract from the fact that Donald Trump's policy agenda is basically tariffs. And he only really started talking about that when everyone was focused on Project 2025, he didn't do these broad sweeping tariffs in the same way that he's promised when he was actually president. So, I think that American voters, one of the questions I have is, are they saying that they're more interested in Harris' economic agenda and I think she'll do better a job because they're more prone to vote for Harris? Is -- are we getting the horse before the cart instead of the cart before the horse on this? And I think it's really unclear and I think that a lot of this is just sort of jockeying.",

I also think the reason why we don't see as much as Joe Biden because he's not running for president and typically in election cycles, the president. He still governing and still doing the job of the president, but he's giving space for the vice president to create her own narrative, to create her own policy agenda.

But Tallahassee is going to take pretty much a direct blow from an eye wall or at least very, very close. So will Valdosta, Georgia and you are thinking, wait, Georgia? How can that be across the state line? This is going to hold together. This is going to stay a Category 2 Hurricane at least for about 100 miles inland.So what we have right now, this is eight o'clock advisory. 85 five miles per hour and that's what we were at five o'clock. Let me be honest. This is probably not an 85-mile-per-hour storm right now, probably 75 or 80. It has flattened out over the past three hours. That is absolutely great because it could be a 95-mile-per-hour storm, but it's not there. We have two airplanes in the storm right now, hurricane hunters looking at it, not seeing it yet. But I think it's going to recover as the night falls, the sunsets, everything kind of calms down, the sheer calms down. And then the forecast comes through as it comes all the way up to the west of Tampa at 1:30. Now, this it does not mean Tampa is going to get a Category 4 wind. Category 4 is only going to be confined to that eye wall itself coming up here into the big bend of Florida. And then really maybe Valdosta, you get a Category 2 and even up toward Atlantic, you might get a Category 1 gust. That's kind of how it works. These -- the big number you hear, 130, 135, say very small confined area. But this is a wide storm with big impact. We are going to have hurricane-force winds, we are going to have a storm surge of 20 feet right where our Derek Van Dam is standing right now. And so, this is going to be a big impactful storm wind, tropical-storm-force winds over the entire state of Florida, hurricane force winds right there into the big bend. But look at the wind all the way into Georgia, all the way into Asheville, Charlotte. You're going to see wind gusts over 80 miles per hour at times. So it's a lot of rain coming down as well.
