The rescue comes days after they had been abducted in broad daylight in one of Mexico's most dangerous border towns where rival factions of a drug cartel have been at war in the streets. The video of the abduction is chilling. It shows gunmen dragging and loading the four Americans into a pickup truck. This is Latavia Washington McGee. She was one of two who was rescued, found alive. Family members say that the group of friends were on just a road trip so Latavia could undergo a medical procedure in Mexico. We spoke to her mother just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This huge trove includes emails and text messages from top executives and talent that further reinforce that they did not believe the false claims about election fraud that they were still pushing on air. Even Rupert Murdoch himself admitted in an email to the CEO of FOX News that the hosts of his network went too far in pushing Trump's lies. He describes a meeting with Republican lawmakers, writing this, quote, \"Big morning with McConnell, meeting with Graham and other anti- impeachers, but still getting mud thrown at us. Is it unarguable that high-profile FOX voices fed the story that the election was stolen that that January 6th was an important chance to have results overturned? Maybe Sean and Laura went too far. All well for Sean to tell you that he was in despair about Trump, but what did he tell his viewers?\" Close quote. These documents also include a bunch of text messages between FOX Host Tucker Carlson and a member of his staff in which he actually says and details his disdain for former President Trump. He writes, quote, \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait. I hate him passionately. I blew up at Peter Navarro today in frustration. I actually like Peter, but I can't handle much more of this. That's the last four years, we are all pretending we have got a lot to show for it because admitting what a disaster it's been is tough too to digest. But come on, there isn't really an upside to Trump,\" close quote. Those are the words of Tucker Carlson. Wow. Joining us now, Ken Turkel. He has represented several high-profile clients in defamation lawsuits, including probably most famously the case you won, Ken, against \"Gawker\" for Hulk Hogan that was in 2016, and that was really precedent setting, right, because you guys were able to overcoe a high bar against a media organization.

      "sentences": "When we say this, looking at what's been released, there is an awful lot of documentary evidence, text messages, emails, quite a bit to digest. Breaking it down, the thoughts that I have are, first, you rarely see that much paper in one of these cases, internal messaging rooms, things like that. But there is so much here, so much communication.And then you have this emerging testimony of Rupert Murdoch, which is dynamite. It's tremendous evidence for a jury trial. It's storytelling. I think in their opposition to the summary judgment motion that FOX filed, Dominion started with an excerpt from that testimony, because it really is, at the end of the day we tell stories, and the stories have to make sense and they have to be compelling and persuasive. It's a great story lead-in. But there is really no legal impact to it from an actual malice perspective because the law is always going to focus on the mindset, or what I like to call the undisclosed mental process of the speaker. And that's what usually makes these cases so hard is you are trying to prove what someone was thinking, what they knew, when there is rarely any direct evidence of that. What is interesting about this case right now, keeping in mind that Judge Davis already denied a motion to dismiss, that I think the legal issues are going to stay the same. We are dealing with summary judgment. Is there dispute in material fact? And rarely do you see this much clear indication that a broadcaster, a writer, was disclosing their state of mind, directly disclosing it. I don't believe this. Then you have a report that's to the contrary. Fascinating. Very different.",

And her response to that is going to be certainly interesting and something that we are going to want to hear about and see.There is going to be some video perhaps what ultimately led up to this stop of Tyre Nichols. And then just the officers talking. Look, there are still a lot more that needs to come out about this, and I think the Memphis police department now that their internal investigation -- they investigated 13 officers. That's a lot of police officers. Of course, seven now being fired, others being suspended.

So there's still a lot. But also, the other thing that's happening here, this community really besieged by crime.

Especially when it comes over borders, like the one right behind me is trying to figure out where it starts as you point out the chemicals, the ingredients that are used to make fentanyl, they come from China. So, that's a big player in all of this, and so too is Mexico. Just south of the border and what law enforcement they are doing. Now, the Mexican army and the military as a whole as well as local law enforcement in Mexico. They face a lot of allegations of corruption that they're just not doing enough. The Mexican army told us, that's not true that they are doing something, we said show us, here's where they took us.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (voiceover): Culiacan in the state of Sinaloa, Cartel country, as some see it. Here the Mexican army is on the hunt for drug labs. With 50 soldiers and in a convoy of six armored vehicles. We travel out of Culiacan into a rural and mountainous landscape. U.S. officials estimate fentanyl makes Mexico's criminal organizations, billions of dollars each year. The cartels determined to eliminate anyone or anything that might threaten their profit. Colonel Alfredo Gonzalez Cuevas, our guide. Taking us to the scene of their latest fentanyl bust. They're securing the perimeter right now. Days earlier, he says cartel members opened fire on him and his soldiers. He said they started shooting at them hitting the vehicles. And then the four guys started running. The Army's Intel led them to this unassuming home. In a quiet family-friendly neighborhood. That white building right there. That's the fentanyl lab. The army says they seized 270,000 pills here all containing fentanyl. This is about all sorts of machines to make the pills. In is the only 35 years in the Army working to dismantle drug operations. The Colonel tells me fentanyl has been far more devastating and difficult to control than cocaine, heroin and meth. They test substances to know what exactly they're seizing. So, it shows it here, it's a breakdown of what the chemical is and what makes it up and then David hands here listed the hazmat component to it. Crucial and understanding how fentanyl is made is knowing where the chemicals are sourced. A lot of them he says come from the port, which came in from Asia. Higher-ranking military officials have told us, most of them come from China. China's vast chemical industry is where experts say many of the ingredients to manufacture fentanyl known as precursors are sourced. And with worsening U.S.-China relations, working with Chinese officials to stop the flow, increasingly challenging.",

A sentiment echoed by China on Monday, the Foreign Ministry responding to our questions, saying in part, \"The accusation by some people from the U.S. that China is not further controlling the export of fentanyl precursors because of geopolitical influence is a desecration of the spirit of the rule of law and is completely groundless.\" Adding, \"Using China as a scapegoat will not solve the drug crisis in the United States.\" Back in Culiacan, the army keeps a presence at these busted labs 24/7, preserving the scenes for prosecutors and preventing cartel members from restarting production. They also conduct random inspections at package facilities around Culiacan.
