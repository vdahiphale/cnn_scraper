The SpaceX Polaris Dawn crew will attempt the first commercial spacewalk after leaving the safety of the Dragon capsule. They'll also test out a brand new spacesuit design. In Vietnam, nearly 200 people have died from the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi. According to state media, at least 128 more are missing. Hundreds have been injured. Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit Vietnam in decades. Peru's controversial former president, Alberto Fujimori, has died at the age of 86 after a long battle with cancer, according to his daughter. His supporters hailed him as a hero for saving Peru from economic collapse in the 1990s and for taking on rebel groups. But he was later convicted for corruption and human rights violations, including civilian deaths, after leaving office. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are hitting the campaign trail after their contentious debate. Trump will be in the western swing states of Arizona and Nevada this week. Harris heads to North Carolina today, then back to Pennsylvania on Friday. Running mate Tim Walz will visit Michigan and Wisconsin. Harris' campaign and Democratic lawmakers warn she's still the underdog in this race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ): This race is going to come down to, you know, just a few thousand votes, probably. Everybody is all hands on deck. Everybody is. We have a campaign that's not taking any vote for granted. SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): I'm very concerned. And I tell people all the time, you know, somebody asked me in Chicago, what'd you learn from 2016? And I said, you can't win by a little, you got to win by a lot. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Harris is going to North Carolina with two stops, one in Greensboro, one in Charlotte. North Carolina has emerged as a key battleground state. And here is why. There are 16 electoral votes in North Carolina. Think as an insurance plan, if you will, if Pennsylvania does not go her way. But she would need one more state in addition to North Carolina to reach the number of electoral votes that Pennsylvania has, of course, which are 19. But North Carolina is shaping up to be a very competitive race throughout the campaign and other races as well. A very competitive governor's race there is also making it more appealing to Harris. Now, it's been since 2008 since a Democratic presidential candidate has carried the state. Barack Obama was the last one. But I talked to North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper after the debate and he said that he believes that Harris's answer on abortion and health care really will resonate in the state and help her win. The question, of course, is if Donald Trump is able to also show strength there. But he is going to be campaigning on Thursday in Arizona and then off to Nevada, a West Coast swing campaigning as well as fundraising. Now heading into the final 54 odd days or so of this election campaign, there is no doubt this is as close of a race as it can get. Both sides realize that. So winning the debate, as most observers agree that Harris did, does not guarantee winning an election. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now, we know from UNRWA that there were some 12,000 people, those Palestinians who have been displaced, evacuated from other areas, moved on from their homes that were sheltering in this particular area. It's been used as a shelter really since October last year. It hasn't been used as a school for some time.So what we know from those on the ground, from the Gaza civil defense and also from the U.N. unit is that two airstrikes hit in this particular facility. We know, according to local officials, that some 18 died and about 44 or more were injured. Now, we do know that also UNRWA staff were among those killed, at least six, according to the U.N. group. They say that the head of the shelter with UNRWA was killed. Also, those who were trying to give out humanitarian aid to those in the area. Now, we have been seeing this on a number of occasions, strikes hitting schools, in particular UNRWA schools. And Israel has consistently said that that is because Hamas is using them to shelter behind civilians and to plan attacks against Israel. They say that there was -- the target for them was a Hamas command and control center within that facility itself. Now, neither side, Israeli or Palestinian, has given any indication of the balance of deaths compared to militants, compared to civilians at this point. But we have heard widespread condemnation that once again, a U.N.-backed school where displaced Palestinians are sheltering has been hit. We heard from the U.N. spokesperson, for example, saying U.N. premises need to be protected, respected by all parties to any conflict. This is something that has happened repeatedly over recent months -- Max.",

The diplomat, though, that we spoke to has also said that that's unlikely to be something that Sinwar would want, believing he would be safer in Gaza than the likes of Iran or Lebanon, for example, where we have seen Israel has taken out and assassinated Hamas and also Hezbollah commanders and chiefs over recent months. So at this point, there really is a wait to see what exactly this final bridging proposal would be from the United States that could convince both sides to sign up -- Max.",
