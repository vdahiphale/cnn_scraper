Airbus says it's still on track to deliver 720 planes this year. The CEO joins me live. And the world mourns, a legendary singer who knew turbulent times, Sinead O'Connor has died at the age of 56. Live from London. It is Wednesday, July 26th. I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest and of course, I too, mean business. Good evening, everyone. Tonight, the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark rate to the highest level in 22 years. The quarter percentage point hike brings it to 5.25 percent as you can see there. Fed officials paused at their last meeting if you remember, and they are leaving the door open to further increases. Chair Jerome Powell speaking now, a moment ago. He said inflation numbers have been coming in better than expected. Still, he said it is too soon to tell what the Central Bank will do next. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said, it could happen. It could also not happen. We know investors think it's not going to happen. Investors think that this interest rate hike today, lifting rates to the highest level in 22 years will be the last one in this rate hiking cycle, but investors had been wrong on that before. Powell was asked what will it take to get the Fed to stop raising interest rates, and he said, look, they're looking for signs that the economic activity is cooling, that demand -- supply and demand in the labor market is coming into better balance, and he said he wants to see more progress on core inflation, which excludes food and energy. He described core inflation as \"still quite elevated.\" And Powell, he also said that, it seems clear to him that they're going to have to hold interest rates at these high, these restrictive levels for some time, and Isa, he said, they have to be prepared to move them even higher if necessary.",

It really goes back to that context. In June, that kind of strange meeting where Fed officials decided not to raise rates, but then raised their forecast to project that they'd have to raise rates two more times this year. So one of those rate raises came today. That was well expected by the meeting. You hear Chair Powell being really non-committal about whether September is going to be a hike, whether it will be a pause. I think with the recently softer inflation data, it probably will be a pause. But there is still a more serious question out there, which is, in the medium term, are rates high enough to slow down the economy enough to bring inflation down? I really don't think we can answer that question yet. I think Chair Powell knows we can't answer that question yet. So you're seeing him kind of keep all of those options open.",

Now, if you continue to get inflation reports like the one that we got in June, that'senough evidence for Fed officials to pause, maybe pause for an extended period of time. But in the near term, some of these base effects are going to go the other way. You're basically going to be comparing prices to lower prices in the past, that's going to mean the year-on-year readings increase. And then we have some really interesting emerging dynamics, one that you just mentioned, oil prices moving higher, gasoline prices moving higher. That's headline inflation, Fed officials tend to care less about that. But underlying inflation, house prices. We're starting to see house prices picking up faster. That could be another reason that Fed officials want to come back. And remember, their guidance has been that they will hike one more time. Markets are seeing that as kind of a 50/50 proposition. September is probably a time for them to look at that again, pause again, like they did in June and then November is when we think that next rate hike is coming.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Sinead O'Connor obliterated the image of the female music star in the late 1980s with a shaved head, stirring performances, and a mouthful of controversial opinions. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] ELAM (voice over): O'Connor topped the music charts in 1990, with her version of \"Nothing compares 2 U\" written by Prince. She won MTV's Video of the Year Award, \"Rolling Stone\" named her Artist of the Year in 1991. She earned four Grammy nominations for the song and the album it was on, but accolades and awards seem to mean nothing compared to O'Connor's drive to provoke thought. SINEAD O'CONNOR, SING: Fight the real enemy. ELAM (voice over): When O'Connor ripped up this photo of Pope John Paul II on national television, backlash reverberated around the globe. Weeks later, a New York crowd booed the singer loudly and incessantly when she took her turn on stage at a Bob Dylan tribute. O'Connor repeatedly defended herself calling herself Catholic and spiritual. And in 1999, she became the first priestess of a dissident Roman Catholic group. When the Catholic priest sex abuse scandal exploded, O'Connor call for the Pope to tell the truth. O'CONNOR: We have the documents and we have the proof that tell us that we're being lied to and we're being lied to by people who are supposed to represent Jesus Christ. ELAM (voice over): O'Connor lashed out at other celebrities. Once called YouTube's music bombastic, started a war of words with Miley Cyrus when O'Connor publicly urged the young performer not to \". let the music business make a prostitute of you,\" and accused Arsenio Hall of being a drug supplier for Prince after the superstar's death. O'Connor's personal life was tabloid fodder -- divorce, custody battles. The singer married four times, was mother to four children. Tormented, talented, O'Connor attempted suicide in the late 1990s. In early 2022, she checked into a hospital while grieving the death of her third son, Shane. At 51, O'Connor converted to Islam, covering her trademark shaved head with a hijab. But she continued performing her music, reflecting upon a lifetime of struggle. [VIDEO CLIP PLAYS] (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And we will defend him vigorously in court.\" Now this trial will likely be a lengthy one. There are 19 counts against Joe Lewis at this stage, insider, fraud but also conspiracy.

His comments gave the Dow a boost, followed by a cold shower, it's a few points higher now. A remarkable 13 straight days in the green. And it was a much higher in the last hour; that has come down a bit. S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are somewhat flat, so turned around in the last few minutes.

And what Chair Powell is trying to go is to say is we will just keep policy rates at these levels for longer, credit conditions will continue to tighten. Maybe in time that will bring down core inflation. So I think there still is a real discussion about whether we are going to get core inflation back to 2 percent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
