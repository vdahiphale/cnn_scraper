They're going to be asking themselves, who's really putting a plan on the table that is going to make my life better? All Donald Trump offers is anger and grievance, whereas Kamala Harris has actual plans that will help people keep more money in their pockets. She's got receipts because she's been on the front line of the fight to bring down the cost of insulin or just to protect a woman's ability to access health care. So this is a stark choice in front of us, and I'm confident that as voters start to get more, you know, engaged in this upcoming election, that they'll see Kamala Harris's agenda is about making their lives better and Donald Trump's about making Donald Trump's life better.",

So we're working hard. I don't even know where Donald Trump was yesterday.And as we talk about understanding the average American's life, we've got two candidates who worked hourly jobs, had to scrape to get ahead, have gotten -- you know, lived their version of the American dream, versus a guy who was -- who was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. This is I think a really stark choice between people who actually get it, who lived our lives and want to make more people -- you know, ensure more people have a path to prosperity, versus a guy who just -- who hasn't and doesn't get it, and care about winning an election, not necessarily what he's going to do once he does.

The Ukrainians literally just coming out with that, you mentioned some of it, at least 41 people have been confirmed to have been killed about 180 wounded in this attack. It happened in Central Ukraine in the city of Poltava in a military educational facility. And what we are getting from the Ukrainians is they say that the telecommunications institute of that facility, the building of that was partially destroyed. The Ukrainians are saying, and this is the Defense Ministry, that apparently there was an air raid alert, but the time between the alert and the actual two missiles impacting the site was so short that people were still on their way to air raid shelters and were obviously very much caught off guard. And that is why you have this very high toll of people who were injured. And of course, people who were killed as well. The emergency services though, Kate, were pretty quick to be on the scene. The Ukrainians say and were able to rescue 25 people, 11 of whom were trapped underneath the rubble. As you can imagine, a lot of that operation is still very much going on. The Ukrainian president has come out and ripped into the Russians for this attack. What we don't yet have, Kate, is anything from the official Russian places, the Russian government or the Russian military. There was however, a very prominent Russian military blogger who did come out and say that in fact the Russians had attacked this facility in Central Ukraine. This of course comes as the Russians have really stepped up their missile attacks on cities really around Ukraine. One of the things that we had a couple of days ago was a big attack here in Kyiv. We have attacks happening in Kharkiv in the northeast of the country, pretty much on a daily basis. That is something that the Ukrainians are dealing with very frequently. However, this specific attack is definitely one where the toll is extremely higher than we've seen anywhere in the past months -- Kate.",

We, the families of hostages have learned to know each other so well over the past year now. Unbearable to say that, 11 months. And so, we feel that any lost hostage, those who were murdered by Hamas is part of our family. We are doing our best to keep strong, to hold on to the hope that we can still make a difference.

This looks a lot different than what was happening in the beginning because there were demonstrations throughout this, since October 7th. But this seems different. Do you think this is a potential game changer? Will it potentially change Netanyahu in the way he is thinking amid these negotiations? LAVI: On one hand, it is uplifting to see the images from Israel. I was last there in May, demonstrations or rallies then were very different, the numbers were much smaller. And so, this gives us some kind of motivation and understanding that the Israeli public had enough of the sabotaging of the negotiations by so many different parties including our own government. And so, that gives us kind of hope that perhaps we can make a difference. Perhaps we cross the Rubicon with the brutal murder of those six hostages, but it will be too late for them. We have to ensure that it's not late for the other 101 hostages that still remain captive. Many of them are still alive. And so, I hope Israelis will keep going on the streets, keep demanding, but we also need other publics around the world to demand their own government to do more for the hostages who are held captive by Hamas, to pressure Hamas. I think the US administration has completely failed in using its levers on Qatar since the beginning of the war, using its levers on Turkey, on Iran, on so many others who are sponsoring, funding, or involving Hamas, and the entire international community failed us as well, the families of hostages by emboldening Hamas. But we are holding our government accountable. We want to make sure our prime minister is frank and honest with us. We are not feeling he is sincere and so that's why so many Israelis are angry. We don't want to go on the streets in the middle of the war. It's so conflicting to do that because what happened on October 7th cannot happen again. We cannot normalize Hamas, we cannot normalize hostage taking, but there are no other avenues for us to show our frustration, to show our anger with the lack of sincerity that we believe is part of this current government.",
