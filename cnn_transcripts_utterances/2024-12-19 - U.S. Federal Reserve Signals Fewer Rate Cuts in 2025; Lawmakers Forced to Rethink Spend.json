Vladimir Putin prepares for his annual news conference to the Russian people. We'll hear from an expert on what to expect. And the verdict is expected in the Gisele Pelicot mass rape trial, considered one of France's darkest cases in recent history. And we begin with the global economic uncertainty ahead of Donald Trump's second term in the White House. The U.S. Federal Reserve, rattled by the possibility of tariffs that could keep inflation high for the next several years. The Fed cut interest rates by a quarter of a point on Wednesday, as expected, but the Central Bank is now forecasting only two rate cuts next year instead of four. That sent Wall Street into a selloff. The Dow fell more than 1100 points, extending its losing streak to 10 days, the worst since 1974. Markets in the Asia Pacific region are also lower. Japan's Nikkei, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite are all in negative territory. U.S. Fed chair Jerome Powell says economic growth and the job market look good for next year but stubborn inflation could mean fewer interest rate cuts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This negotiation had happened behind closed doors for several weeks, and ultimately a deal was reached. It came out just last night. That deal, about 1500 pages in length. It had a whole wide range of provisions. But the most significant part it would extend government funding until mid-March to avoid a shutdown.Now, throughout the course of the day, anger began to build on the right. Republicans, particularly conservative members, said that it was a bad deal that Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, cut with Democratic leaders and cut with the White House. They pointed to a number of provisions that they did not like in there. There were some politically toxic measures as well, such as raising the salary, giving a salary increase to members of Congress. But perhaps most significantly, it was Elon Musk who came out to oppose the bill very loudly, calling on members who vote for the bill to be essentially lose their elections. And it wasn't just Musk. After Musk came out in his opposition, then Donald Trump himself came out opposed to the measure. He and J.D. Vance issued a scathing statement over this bill. He attacked the bill and he also added a highly complex issue on top of it. He is now demanding that Congress raise the national debt limit, avoid the first ever debt default. That could have happened next year. He wants that done now because he doesn't want to deal with it when he's president, even though doing so is a highly complicated issue that will be very difficult to resolve in just two days. That's one reason why Republicans and Democrats alike have concerns, including this Republican senator. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Health officials in Gaza say Israeli attacks killed dozens of Palestinians on Wednesday, adding new urgency to the revived ceasefire negotiations.

And the Russian investigators are saying that they believe that Kurbanov was recruited by Ukraine's intelligence service, the SBU. They say that he was told to get an electric scooter and then was given a homemade bomb and parked the scooter with the bomb in front of the door that later the general, together with an aide, would come out of. Now, as part of this plot, the Russians say that Kurbanov also got a car-sharing car, rented a car-sharing car, and parked it outside of the door of that building as well. They say that that car was outfitted with a camera that had a live feed that went straight to the city of Dnipro in Central Ukraine where it was monitored by Ukrainian security services. And when the general left his building, that is when the bomb was detonated. Obviously, General Kirillov was killed yesterday when he left his apartment building. That blast seemed to be massive. When we were on the scene, we saw that even in the houses adjacent to where this blast took place, that windows had been shattered there. Russian politicians obviously irate about all this.

And that is saying something, though its name is much more innocent sounding.The Human Sexual Rights And Family Values Bill, that's its official name, and it was supported by Christian, Muslim, and traditional leaders in Ghana. It passed unanimously in Parliament. That explains just how popular it is. MADOWO (voice-over): And many in Ghana are supportive of this Supreme Court, essentially deciding that they cannot stop it until it's officially a law. I've been reporting in Ghana twice this year, and I know that many people support this bill. But activists, those that work in the LGBT human rights space say even before it has become a law, there are already serious consequences.",

Even without the passage of the bill, people have been attacking members of a certain community, and I think that just this pronouncement, this kind of formalism, this resort to constitutionalism, actually put at risk the life and health of certain members of the community.And of course, some of us who are human rights defenders. MADOWO (voice-over): Ghana's outgoing president Nana Akufo-Addo, has less than three weeks left in office. So, if he does not sign it, he would kick the can down the road and leave that as a problem for the incoming administration of President-elect John Mahama. MADOWO: Amnesty West Africa asking him not to sign it into law, saying it does not just infringe on the rights of one group but on the rights of all. But one of the lawmakers who was the biggest supporters of the bill, helped to bring it to parliament, Sam George, tweeted that \"It is done. To God be the glory.\" Gay sex in Ghana was already punishable with up to three years in prison, but this makes it even harder to even identify as LGBTI in Ghana. It criminalizes the promotion of LGBT rights in the country. And that is why it's getting -- it's getting a lot of criticism. However, the Finance Ministry in Ghana had already warned that, if this were to become law, Ghana risked losing out on $3.8 billion from the World Bank, another $3 billion from the IMF. These are funds the country badly needs for an economic revival. But for the men on the street, they think it needs to become law. Larry Madowo, CNN, Nairobi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
