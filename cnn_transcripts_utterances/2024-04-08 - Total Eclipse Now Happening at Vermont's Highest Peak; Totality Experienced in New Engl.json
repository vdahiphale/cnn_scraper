Scientists have had a very unique opportunity in this to get a glimpse of the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere.So joining us now to talk a little bit about that is Janet Ivey, who is the CEO and founder of Janet's Planet. Janet, tell us what scientists can learn from today. Actually, you know what? Can you just start off by telling us -- I feel like I asked the scientists the science question and then they go immediately to their like emotional reactions because it is incredibly emotional. So what was your reaction to seeing this? JANET IVEY, CEO AND FOUNDER, JANET'S PLANET: It was just incredible. It's like I'm with a group of people that saw it back in 2017 in Nashville. I'm in Goreville, Illinois today with some of those same people. And again, it's just -- it's one of those moments. It's like we've seen everybody along the path go, oh my gosh, this is just a spiritual experience nearly. And I cried. I cried watching the couple get engaged. Do you know what I mean? I think what is so lovely before we get into the science is just the fact that think about this. As a nation, we are all looking up. We are all having a shared experience. And how I wish that we could take this all, this inspiration, this united thing that we're all experiencing today and wrap that into some unity in our own country. But the thing that scientists are gathering and many people participated in citizen science, they wanted to see what the animals were doing. You talked about the birds flying around crazily. Back in Nashville in 2017, the giraffes like loped around, like going, what's happening? The flamingos went and covered their babies. So we can learn a lot about what animals do or don't do in these times. [15:40:00] We can also kind of like, did you guys see that beautiful prominence, that solar flare that was happening at about 6 p.m.? We're never able to see that with our human eyes unless we have totality. And so again, there's still so much to understand. Why is our corona hotter than the surface of the sun? Why in solar maximum, you know, why does that happen and affect space weather so much? And again, we're going to get more reports about temperature and how that, when we don't have the radiative power of the sun, temperature drops. Cloud cover. For many people that cross their fingers, it's like they saw clouds dissipate today. So that interplay of heat and light and cooling and clouds, it's just, it's like the list is very long, but I think most importantly, to share this as a shared experience with tons and tons of millions of people, getting to do that today is quite incredible.",

And even here today with little ones, I was showing them how they could view like the kind of like, you know, progression of the eclipse through a Ritz cracker with our sun to the back.So what you hope is, is that this is that introduction, that inciting moment, almost of their hero's journey to science. And hopefully that did spur some young people to go, wow, science is magical and cool. It's magic, but it's science. And I can be part of this amazing thing. We heard from Kelly Korek at NASA, who's the, you know, astrophysicist there. And she's talking about all the things they're studying. So hopefully through the eyes of astronauts and NASA folks and just regular, regular people and many of the meteorologists who have also been in awe, maybe there've been a few meteorologists who have been birthed today as well.",

And so they can see, and it's like light up things in different ways and see again, it's like peer a little more deeply into the chromosphere, peer a little more deeply into that sun's corona. And again, a lot of times the different colors through a process called spectroscopy, we can tell a lot about the chemical makeup, the things that are going on. And again, it's like this, they will collect the data, all the citizen science data will come flooding in. And then soon there will be a great report. And I think it will be -- I think it'll be quite incredible to like read what they've discovered in this time of solar maximum.And another year we'll go back to a time of solar minimum with the sun. So it won't be as active as it was today. I'm pretty sure they were also trying to make sure they were getting any images of that crazy, you know, Comet Pons Brooks and to see if it did any off gassing. It's like where I am, we did see Venus and Jupiter. We did not get a good glimpse of that comet. But again, scientists are looking for, again, is there any, you know, way that we can understand the sun and its weather and the kind of like a solar wind and all that's happening. So I'm just excited that everybody had a chance to look up today. And I hope that everybody was all inspired.",
