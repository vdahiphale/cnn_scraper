Ahead right here on CNN Newsroom, Beijing cracks down China's government tries to crush large anti-lockdown protests, which have spread right across the country.Warnings of a critical humanitarian situation in Ukraine as millions struggle without power or water and winter sets in and threats of torture sources say the families of Iran's football team face violence or prison with players protest at the World Cup. In China, police are out in full force and the government is tightening online censorship hoping to prevent more scenes like this one. Thousands of people protesting strict COVID lockdowns and the Communist Party's firm grip on all aspects of life. CNN has verified protests in 15 cities with dozens more reported but the Chinese Foreign Ministry claims media accounts do not reflect what actually happened. Meantime, China reported more than 38,000 new COVID cases Monday. It's in fact the first day in nearly a week that it didn't set a new record. Panic over the pandemic and Beijing's response sent Wall Street plunging. The Dow dropped nearly 500 points or one and a half percent Monday. Meantime, the Biden administration stopped short of criticizing China's response to the demonstrations but said the U.S. supports the right to protest peacefully. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was more direct. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're seeing it in Beijing and Shanghai where police are out on patrol on the streets. We're seeing it in Shanghai where authorities there have set up these big blue barricades on Lamouchi (ph) Road, which is the site of those protests over the weekend.And CNN has also learned that protesters are being rounded up according to a protester telling CNN that Shanghai police have detained 80 to 110 protesters after the Saturday night protests in Shanghai. The protests are also telling CNN that the police collected their biometric data, including their fingerprints, their retinal scans, their photographs. The protests are also telling CNN that the authorities told them in detention that they were being used to foment a color revolution. And the fact that the protests erupted nationwide was somehow proof of that. It's unclear at this moment how many people remain in detention. And on Monday, we did not see a repeat of the scenes that you're seeing on the screen there. There's dramatic scenes of protests over the weekend. On Monday in Beijing, also in Shanghai, no signs of major protests taking place there. But CNN has been able to verify that 20 COVID related protests have taken place in 15 different cities across China. We have a map of it. Take a look at this. And just to emphasize the sheer reach the scope and scale of these protests. I'm want to read up the list of the cities where protests have taken place in Beijing. We have verified five protests have taken place there, protests in Chengdu, in Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Hotan, in Korla, Lanzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Tianjin, Urumqi, in Xi'an, in Wuhan. We know and verified at least two COVID related protests have taken place there. And there was also an extremely rare protest that took place last night here in Hong Kong, extremely rare in the back of the national security law being imposed here by Beijing, or dozens of protesters turned out in a corner of the central business district with flowers with banners and with those symbolic white sheets of paper symbolizing censorship, and now becoming a symbol of the protest movement. But Paula, when the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked about the sweeping anti-COVID protests in his country, the spokesman just outright dismissed.

The victory clinched Brazil spot in the round of 16. And joining them is Portugal who punch their card to the knockout round after defeating your way of two nil. World Sports Don Riddell has our highlights. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT (on camera): nobody has a World Cup record quite like Brazil. They've won the tournament a record five times but it's been a while. And 2002 now seems like a lifetime ago. However at this tournament, they have so far justified their billing as one of the favorites. On Monday night here in Qatar, the (INAUDIBLE) edge past Switzerland in group G with a late goal from Manchester United's midfielder Casemiro. Thanks to their earlier win over Serbia, they're now guaranteed to qualify for the knockout round alongside the holders France. One of the games of the tournament played out elsewhere in group G, Serbia came from behind take a three one lead against Cameroon. Aleksandar Mitrovic seem to have given his side an unassailable advantage. But the indomitable lions fought back with two goals in just four minutes. Vincent Aboubakar and then Jean-Eric Maxim Choupo- Moting secured a thrilling draw for Cameroon. They still have it all to do though. In order to stay in the tournament, Cameroon will have to beat the favorite's Brazil and hope that the other game goes in their favor. If Switzerland avoid losing to Serbia, they're through. In Group A, it's another thrilling game involving an African side, Ghana threw away a two nil lead against South Korea. Weak lies with a thundering herd from Cho Gue-sung, but the Black Stars weren't rattled, and kudos to Mohammed Kudus secured a famous win for his team. Portugal won the late game of the day against Uruguay. It looks as though Cristiano Ronaldo put them ahead, but his head mustn't have actually touched the ball. Because his former ManU new teammate, Bruno Fernandez was credited with the score, and he later made the game safe with a penalty. So Portugal also joined Brazil and France and the knockout round. The other three teams in this group still have a chance. And next up, it's a grudge match between Ghana and Uruguay. Tuesday marks the start of the final round of group games and therefore a lot of teams are soon going to be packing their bags. Back to you. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [01:16:28] NEWTON: UN is describing a dire and critical situation in southern Ukraine where the cities of Mykolaiv and Kherson are struggling with a lack of water, heat and power. Making matters worse in Kherson is that constant shelling by Russian forces. Civilians in the recently liberated city continue to flee as more and more attacks target residential areas. Russian forces stationed on the east bank of Dnipro River are launching strikes which have also hit other towns in the Kherson district and that includes just a few hours ago. Now meantime, on Monday Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Foreign Ministers from seven Baltic at Nordic nations in Kyiv. They discussed more aid for Ukraine as the country works to restore power following Russia's relentless strikes on its infrastructure. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Today is everything single day. The occupiers again shell Kherson and the region's communities.

CNN's Sam Kiley has our details.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The head of Ukraine's atomic energy industry has said that Russia he believes is planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which had captured back in March. Now his allegations have got very little substance behind them. Other than he says information he's picked up on the internet and indications from people on the ground in the city nearby that the Russians appear to be preparing to make some kind of move. But this should be seen really in the context of the ongoing psychological war between the two countries who are also of course, involved in a physical war because Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is a major strategic asset for the Russians. At its peak, it supplies 20 percent of the power of the electrical power into the Ukrainian energy structures, those very structures that have been under relentless attack by Russia and cruise missiles for the last month resulting for example, in the city of Kyiv. The capital having to reduce its energy consumption, they hope by 60 percent just to keep the essential services functioning. So it's very unlikely that the Russians would give that up. On top of that it is an important military base for them. They've been using it and its environment to shell against Ukrainian positions, Ukrainian civilian towns on the other side of the Dnipro River. And if they were to evacuate, it would become a bridgehead for any kind of future Ukrainian operations to try to recapture more of the Southern territory with the ultimate eye on the Crimean peninsula, which of course, Russia illegally annexed back in 2014-2015. But this is all coming at a time when the Ukrainian government has also announced that 32,000 civilian targets have been deliberately hit by Russia. They're saying that outside of the front line, only 3 percent of the targets struck by Russia could be described as military. Now, of course, this is again, a Ukrainian claims that have been hotly refuted by Russia. Sam Kiley, CNN, in Zaporizhzhia. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

That's despite lockdowns and mandatory mass testing. On Monday, China reported more than 38,000 cases. Now, the number, while it is of course high for China it breaks the streak of six consecutive days of record highs. Joining me now is Dr. Jorge Rodriguez, a board certified internal medicine specialist and viral researcher. And he joins me now from Los Angeles. It is good to see you again. And I wish we were not speaking about really such a vulnerable part of the world that is still so vulnerable to this virus. You know, I have to say, it seems like for China, time has stood still here, right. I mean what options does it have especially given how vulnerable its population is with the lack of vaccines. DR. JORGE RODRIGUEZ, BOARD CERTIFIED INTERNAL MEDICINE SPECIALIST: Well, I think you make a great point. And China, they are trying to make time stand still. China's moving forward and the virus is moving forward. So, they do not have many options because China has relied on just this very totalitarian type of blockade if you will, you know. But the virus has changed. Omicron changed the whole thing by becoming so resistant. And unfortunately, China does not have a good Plan B. They do not have a good vaccine. You know, if they're going to do something mandatory, they should probably have their people have a mandatory vaccine. So I think this horse is out of the barn. And the fact that they are having these many tens of thousands of infections now, means that the zero tolerance, the zero availability of people to get out of their homes is already a very failed tactic. NEWTON: And yet, what do they do now? You know, Dr. Anthony Fauci was on CNN Monday. He offered his thoughts and was quite candid about the fact that as a scientist, it was hard to keep one step ahead of this virus. I want you to listen now to what he said about the Chinese situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR.

Now, this is one of the most populous countries in the world. So it's going to be very difficult to do. I think that part of the reason that they are resorting to these zero COVID policies is because they may not have the financial means to bring really good vaccines. So I think they are going to be within a very difficult situation because the fact that they are already having tens of thousands of cases per day, these are going to continue to increase exponentially. So I don't have an answer to that, but I think they may have to reach out diplomatically and try to seek help, you know, from the rest of the world.

RODRIGUEZ: Of course. That is whole point. Listen, we are not isolated. And that is why from the beginning, this way of treating COVID was doomed because there was no concerted effort with the whole world. You can't just treat it in the United States. You can't just treat it in the U.K. We are completely united by transportation, by immigration, by economics. So that's what's been lacking. And maybe the WHO did not do enough. But we can't just blame it on the WHO. If every country is not going to cooperate and realize that we are all in this together, we are going to be where we are. And unfortunately, I think we are too lackadaisical nowadays. And we're taking it for granted because people are not dying as much. So what's next?

He basically said it won't lead to everyone. You cannot imagine what these young men are going through. What are they going through, Jason? You know better than most. REZAIAN: Well, is massive pressure. You know, they are -- the representatives of their country of their fellow Iranians, at the same time there came after a regime that is brutal, and ruthless. And that exerts a lot of pressure on them. And your reporting here at CNN has indicated that the Iranian security agents have put more pressure on these players to fall in line. Not publicly support protesters. But just by virtue of standing up and not singing the anthem. Or in a press conference talking about their support for the grieving Iranians who've lost loved ones in this protest. Talking about how they are standing with them. It's incredibly powerful. It might seem subtle to us and the outside world. And who live in Freedom but for Iranian standards over the last 43 years. It's a big deal.",

But the last time it happened was back in 1984. So certainly when the stirrups in conjunction to another volcano, it's just a few kilometers away. Gets a lot of people attention. And we know officially are saying there was no immediate threat or lava flows associated with these volcano. And they certainly (INAUDIBLE), activity begin to ramp up. The fact since July, about 20 across per day were occurring across this particular island that they got enough Hawaii. And the community here about 10,000 square kilometers of land, 200,000 people call this Island home. A vast majority of them kind of the outer edge of near the coastal communities. So in (INAUDIBLE), seeing the vast majority with the earth place and activity then the volcano and the lava flows are actually coming in on the northeastern periphery, where if they're not impacting protests or community evacuations. No one evacuations for everyone in place. But the biggest concern, the ashfall, ashes accumulated, some were 7 centimeters of which, across some of these communities, certainly the dangers associated with that breathing it becomes a major issue. Airlines, a (INAUDIBLE) place as a result of it. And then there's another element with the ash, there's rain fall in the forecast and any time, you mixed rain with the ash, you create what is called a lahar, essentially a cement like sludge that forms and here's an example. From a volcano in Guatemala. So you'll notice when they're style, brain mixed with the ashes that has already been deposited and create a sludge and it becomes positive. You create a sludge and it becomes really abrasive, destructive to communities and can bring down rooftops. So this is the biggest concern for the communities across the region.",
