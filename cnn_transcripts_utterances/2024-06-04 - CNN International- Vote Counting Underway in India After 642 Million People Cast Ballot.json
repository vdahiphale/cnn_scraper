However, these are very early trends and the balance could be shifting all the time as the day goes on. Millions of people cast their vote over seven phases from April the 19th to June the 1st, and Indian officials are calling the mammoth process a success. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So it's going to take a while to count up all of these votes.The magic number here is 272. That's how many seats in the lower house of parliament that somebody has to win to win a majority. The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, was predicting at the beginning of this that his alliance would win some 400 seats out of the 543 in the lower house of parliament. As of now, the preliminary results are suggesting that his alliance will do well below that, that, in fact, it may be difficult for the BJP, his party, to win an outright majority, which it has done twice in national elections over the last 10 years. Again, it is still early, but if you want an indicator about the uncertainty, look at the Indian stock market, which rallied on Monday, had record gains after exit polls had been published, showing a big win for the BJP. And today, with these uneven results and signs that the opposition is doing much better than had been predicted, the stock market right now, Max, is down nearly 6 percent. Again, an indicator of just how uncertain the results are going to be and a suggestion that we have to watch this very closely to see how it will shake out in the next several hours.",

So it could be a bit less stable majority for the first time in a decade. And if that is the case, then he'll have to rely on a coalition in government. So it could be a bit less stable. It raises questions in governance that Modi has not had to deal with to date. It would also mark a success potentially for the main India opposition alliance and the biggest player in that, which is the India National Congress, which performed dismally in the last two national elections. And again, the preliminary results suggest that it has performed far better. But, you know, wait and see. Let's watch and see how this goes. One other conclusion that has come out, and I can quote the chief election commissioner, he has said that one lesson they've learned from this election, which has been going on for some six weeks, is that they should have done it earlier in the year before a deadly heat wave set in that in the last week alone, Max, has killed scores of election workers. He's saying it's just too hot, and that is one lesson he's taking away from this mammoth process -- Max.",

The 61-year-old handedly defeated her two opponents with at least 58 percent of the vote, according to the National Electoral Institute. CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM, MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT (through translator): Our duty is and always will be to look after each Mexican without distinctions. Although many Mexican women and Mexican men don't agree fully with our project, we will walk in peace and harmony to build a fairer and more prosperous Mexico. VALDES (voice-over): Besides being the first woman set to become president, she would be the first one of Jewish ancestry. Her grandparents migrated from Eastern Europe, fleeing Nazi persecution, although she rarely mentions her religious background. Her parents were leftists, according to a biography by journalist Arturo Cano, in which Sheinbaum says that she grew up talking about politics all day with her parents. But her first career is academia. She has a Ph.D. in environmental engineering, focused in renewable energy and climate change. Her introduction to politics happened in 2000, when she became Mexico City's environmental minister under the head of government, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. She became part of his team during his three presidential campaigns, and in 2018, when he won the presidency, she was elected chief of government of Mexico City. She pledged to continue the policies of Lopez Obrador with a five- point plan. Increase public safety, free public education, fight poverty through social programs and a higher minimum wage, better regulation of water resources, and transition to renewable energies. On foreign affairs, she has pledged to protect Mexico's sovereignty, and while recognizing the importance of their relationship with the United States, she wants to focus on growing ties with Central and South American nations.",

He was invited by top congressional leaders to discuss the state of the war. The first date proposed, June 13th, conflicts with a Jewish holiday. House Speaker Mike Johnson says there's a sense of urgency to get it scheduled soon, hopefully in the next couple of weeks. Sources say it will likely happen next month. Well meanwhile, pressure is mounting on Israel to accept a new ceasefire hostage release proposal laid out by the U.S., but Netanyahu is claiming that Israel didn't agree to that plan. His spokesperson says U.S. President Joe Biden presented only a partial outline, and Netanyahu is insisting the war will not end until Hamas is eliminated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We are working in countless ways to return our hostages. I think about them all the time. I think about the women all the time, about their families, about their suffering. Therefore, we have gone the extra mile to bring them back.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And actually, when we listened to Biden's speech on Friday, the tone from the U.S. President was almost a warning to the Israeli government. Take this option that we're handing to you.And of course, Biden framed this as a deal that had been come up with the Israeli government, although with the backing of the U.S. But he also acknowledged that there would be factions of the Israeli government that would not back the deal, particularly in the far right. And now what we're seeing is the Israeli prime minister really coming under pressure from within his own cabinet. We know, of course, that some far right ministers, including the national security minister, Ismael Ben-Gavir, have threatened to pull out of the government if indeed that deal is signed. Netanyahu is also facing pressure from his own citizens, many of whom have been protesting for months now, calling on the prime minister to focus more on securing the release of hostages. And of course, we did hear from the Israeli government, from the prime minister, saying that Biden had only outlined a partial aspect of this proposal, that they would not be agreeing to any sort of lasting ceasefire without their full terms being agreed to, primarily the destruction of Hamas. But despite this, we've heard yesterday from the U.S.'s ambassador to the U.N., saying that the U.S. will go ahead and circulate a draft resolution calling for this three-phase peace plan at the U.N. Security Council. The State Department says it is confident that the Israeli government will back this plan. But clearly we're hearing mixed messages from either side, as well as that mounting pressure. But this is a plan which would essentially see not only the release of hostages gradually, as well as the exchange of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, but essentially a lasting ceasefire, the return of Palestinian civilians to all parts of Gaza, and crucially a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from populated areas. That is something that the Israeli government has long been stood against. We've heard from the prime minister repeatedly saying now that they will not agree to a deal that does not see the full destruction of Hamas. Biden framed this on Friday in a way that really highlighted the Israeli government's primary pretext for launching this war. He said that Hamas has been downgraded now to a point where they would not be able to carry out an attack like we saw on October 7th, and that a continuation of this war will not only prevent any lasting security for Israeli citizens, but will also further Israel's isolation. So a warning message there perhaps from President Biden, but clearly Netanyahu is facing his own internal pressures as well.",
