We have a tornado watch in effect for Louisiana, Mississippi, as well as Arkansas.This is a particularly dangerous situation tornado watch, which is a rare tornado watch, only issued 5 percent of the time. And it's because this line of storms that is beginning to push to the south and east is starting to really again get its act together. We have multiple confirmed tornadoes on radar right now, one just to the southeast of Monroe, one to the south of Alexandria, Louisiana as well. And then a huge lightning storm right now to the south of Beaumont, Texas. As the system producing this pushes to the east, we're going to continue to see the chance for strong, violent, long-lived tornadoes increase. That is the reason why we have that PDS tornado watch. And it's also the reason why the Storm Prediction Center has issued a level four out of five severe weather risk for today. That is extremely rare. It has only happened 12 times this year. It's going to continue through tonight, that severe weather threat. It's also going to continue on into Sunday too, though as it gets closer to the Carolinas, it will start to lose its punch. Here's the reason why. The system pushes east, and you can see some drier air beginning to push into the system on radar. Eventually, that begins to break up the storm system. It loses its instability. And once we get to Sunday on into Monday, we can say goodbye to this storm system. Now, typically, Jessica, we see large destructive tornadoes like this during the spring tornado season. However, we do have a secondary tornado season which occurs in fall and early winter. Right now in the month of December, we typically see 43 tornadoes on average. So it does happen. It's not extremely rare, but it's also not very common. This is the last weekend of 2024. Notice this statistic here. We have seen above average tornadic activity for the month -- for the year 2024. So we are ending the -- ending 2024 on the exact same note with this tornado outbreak. So it's quite fitting. And again Jessica, we're watching this system here across the southeast. But there are multiple areas here across the U.S. that we have to keep an eye on.",

There are certain protocols whenever an incident is occurring that you would put it on. And if you didn't, the question will be asked, why or were you trying to really cover up any type of behavior.In this technological age where there's really recordings everywhere, it's really hard to get out from under that. And so I think there'll be a lot of explaining to do with respect to how this occurred, why it occurred, and why the force was deemed to be necessary under the circumstance. Was it? And really, if you look from a legal perspective, you look legally whenever you use force. Is there an imminent fear that any of the officers had, and if so, were any of the actions they took proportional to whatever fear or threat they were facing and did they act reasonably? And those three criteria will be the rubric upon which this is looked at. And if those things are found to be flawed, which on the face of it they are. It didn't seem as though the deceased Mr. Brooks was fighting in any way. He seemed to be restrained. He didn't seem to represent a threat or danger. And so therefore, the nature of their conduct and whether it was reasonable will be looked at. The proportionality of what they did to him will be looked at. And certainly whether he represented an imminent immediate threat would be looked at. To this point and looking at that, it just looks like a very, very horrific set of circumstances that could have been prevented. And I think the New York state attorney general will get to the bottom of it.",

Were they not appropriate? What were the individual circumstances there?Was there enough done with respect to looking at those issues and seeing whether or not in those set of circumstances, they -- those other instances could have been prevented. Were they appropriately disciplined for them? Should they have been in the position they were now, such that they could have access to someone else? And whether or not officials knew, and they took appropriate steps to prevent what occurred before and why they were on the job now. And so all of that, I think, will be subject to review. These officers will get their due process. But again, those three prongs will be looked at. One their job, number two the criminality if any that was involved, and number three, the lawsuit. And I think those three things, in addition to a full-scale review of the facility itself, will bring some, you know, measure of really transparency to how this could happen and look to prevent it from happening in the future.",

We've been hearing those first-hand testimonies from some of those survivors, as well as seeing footage that was filmed on people's mobile phones in the moments ahead of the crash. Many of them described the chaos on board the flight, passengers being moved up and down from their chairs, the plane moving unusually and a loud bang being heard before those oxygen masks dropped. So of course, investigators will be listening to those first-hand testimonies and speaking to survivors, as well as looking at all the other evidence.

We knew that Joe Biden and Hunter Biden had some of these meetings and photo ops in China in 2013, but we never saw these pictures before. Let me walk you through these images, and then I'll explain why they matter. So the first one you see here, this is President Biden, then-Vice President Biden, introducing his son, Hunter, to Xi Jinping on the left, who, of course, is the president of China. There are other pictures from that same time where Hunter Biden met the vice president of China, another official, high-ranking government official. You can see that there with, of course, Vice President Biden in the middle. So Hunter getting face time with some very powerful government officials. But on the other side of it, you have Hunter introducing his father to some of his business partners. These guys here between the two Bidens, father and son, these guys were some of the top executives at a private equity firm in China that Hunter was doing a lot of business with. He briefly had a photo op with the president, the vice president at the time. So Jessica, this is important because there was a time, and you probably remember this, when Joe Biden denied that there were ever any interactions between him and his sons business associates and that there was no overlap whatsoever. Those denials have been undercut because we've learned that there were meetings, there were some dinners, there were some phone calls, too. But Hunter Biden, when he testified to lawmakers earlier this year and one of his other business partners, said, yes, there were some meetings, but no business was ever discussed. They were not substantive. They were photo ops. Essentially, Hunter Biden was selling the illusion of access, but not real access to his father, Jessica.",
