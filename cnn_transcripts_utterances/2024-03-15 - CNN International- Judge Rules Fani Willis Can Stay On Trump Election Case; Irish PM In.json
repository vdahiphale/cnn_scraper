      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon.New this morning, a Georgia judge has ruled that District Attorney Fani Willis may remain on the election interference case against Donald Trump. Coming up, our legal analysts and panel will break it all down. Also, President Biden and the Irish Prime Minister are meeting in what has become an annual tradition around St. Patrick's Day. But, sharp differences over policies on Israel and Gaza may change the tone of their meeting this year. We're live at the White House. Plus, voting is underway in Russia's presidential election. We will go to Moscow for an update as Vladimir Putin seeks yet another reelection. We begin this hour with breaking news. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can stay on the election interference case against Donald Trump. That ruling made by Judge Scott McAfee a short time ago. But, his decision also comes with one huge caveat. He says that special prosecutor Nathan Wade must be removed from the case if Willis remains on the case. Now, attorneys for Donald Trump and other co-defendants had argued that Willis' romantic relationship with Wade had created a conflict of interest. Let's bring in CNN's Ryan Young, who joins me from Atlanta. Ryan, we've been speaking about this for the last hour or so. Just sort of bring us up to speed for our audience who may just be tuning in right now. RYAN YOUNG, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Rahel, friend, look, we've been really going through this. This is nine o'clock at this point. And there is so much in this, especially this decision. When you think about what's on the line here, there is a lot of people who believe that Fani Willis was taken off this case, that this case would sort of go into purgatory. Who would know what will happen next. But, what we do know is the judge has decided that Fani Willis can stay but Nathan Wade has to go. Now, all this centers around a relationship that the two of them have admitted to having. They traveled to far-off places like California, Aruba, and Miami. And what that was at the center of this is how this money was split up between the two of them. Fani Willis has always said that she took cash money to reimburse Nathan Wade for their travel. Nathan Wade made a lot of money as this special prosecutor, over $600,000. And some people were trying to accuse the two of them of basically enriching their pockets by having this case. Now, I want you to listen to Fani Willis when she was in court, and how adamant she was about what she believed was going on. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHLEIGH MERCHANT, MICHAEL ROMAN'S ATTORNEY: So, your office objected to us getting Delta records for flights that you may have taken with Mr. Wade.",

Scott McAfee making that decision this morning. I also want to read something from page nine, \"Without sufficient evidence that the District Attorney acquired a personal stake in the prosecution, or that her financial arrangements had any impact on the case, the Defendants' claims of an actual conflict must be denied. This finding is by no means an indication that the court condones this tremendous lapse in judgment or the unprofessional manner of the District Attorney's testimony during the evidentiary hearing.\"So, you can understand and hear the language from the judge there. There has been so much conversation about when this relationship actually started. When did it come to light? Nathan Wade was going through a divorce. At some point, he started a relationship with the district attorney. They say it happened after he was hired, and then from there it progressed. Now, they said the relationship is over. The judge even says there is easily a way for the public to say, how do they know that the relationship has never resumed, or this financial arrangement that they had about where money was spent could continue? So, you can understand those questions being taken into place. But, at this point, she can remain on the case. Nathan Wade is going to have to step down. There were so many people believing that this was the case that could get started before the election. All these delays may slow that down. There is even talk from the judge about maybe putting a gag order in place to maybe stop all sides from talking. I should report as well, Fani Willis has not planned to appear before a camera today to talk about this case. Of course, everyone probably wanting to ask her the questions that we all have in our mind about how they move forward, and who is going to take over the prosecution if Nathan Wade has to step down.",

You were elected by the voters of Fulton County to be the district attorney who should be above reproach. And what he was saying is, don't do this again. Be professional. Do the right thing. Be transparent in what you do. And if you are, everything will go well. I think that he felt there was a conflict, but it wasn't enough. It may have been perceived, but the testimony wasn't enough, and the evidence wasn't enough to have Fani removed. So, he did the right thing.And let me tell you this. In my opinion, he helped the prosecution even though I don't think that was any part of his ruling or what he was thinking. He has now removed Nathan Wade. That means that Fani doesn't have to fire Nathan Wade and doesn't have to worry about the microscope that she and Nathan would be under had they stayed the way it was. She can now go out, hire whoever she thinks is appropriate, male, female, young, old, but somebody that knows what he or she is doing as to prosecuting and/or defending a RICO case. So, it took away any publicity, any adverse political effects from either side saying she should have. She should not have. She did this. She did not. So, I think what he did was wonderful.

This is typically a pretty celebratory stop. As you saw there, there is the crystal bowl with shamrocks. They will often dye the fountains green here at the White House.But, with this war looming over this -- it's an issue that the two of them are planning to discuss at great lengths. Now, when the Prime Minister was talking about this, he said that there should be an immediate ceasefire so that aid can get into Gaza, talking about the humanitarian situation in that region. And the President nodded along, saying that he agreed, and the President has said that there should be a temporary ceasefire so that there can be additional assistance sent into Gaza, and as well hostages released from Gaza. But, there is no doubt that this is a point of contention. In fact, some of the delegation, some of the Irish delegation wanted the Prime Minister to boycott this annual stop over the concerns of how the U.S. is supporting Israel as it continues its war into Gaza. Now, the Prime Minister made clear that he would convey his concerns in this meeting and that will surely happen at greater length behind doors. But, just another example, Rahel, of the President having to navigate this domestically, having to navigate the politics of it even within his own fractured coalition, and also having to tackle it with foreign leaders when they visit the White House.",

That's reserved for the most dangerous controlled substances. And a Gallup poll released last year said 70 percent of Americans think marijuana should be legal. So, this is something that the administration bears in mind. It's been something they've been thinking about and reviewing. And this is another opportunity for the Vice President to hear from musician Fat Joe, as well as the Kentucky governor, but also people who have been pardoned for previous marijuana convictions.So, this is going to happen in a couple of hours, and it's part of, again, this overarching effort by the administration to do this review and see whether there can be any changes in the classification federally of this particular drug marijuana.",

But, obviously, when there is serious business to be discussed, that is from leader to leader, that is the place where you register those concerns.And as you heard the Taoiseach there, he -- I believe he was speaking to the Vice President and acknowledging her call. And so, I think what's important for us to just take away is that this reminds us that they're increasingly -- other leaders around the world are voicing their concerns, joining, frankly, in what the Vice President has said and what the President has expressed, and hopefully that can bolster the political pressure on Netanyahu to actually start to pay attention to some of these other political concerns as we continue to see.

But, of course, there are enormous questions about exactly how that aid will be distributed. We have seen so many times over the last several weeks as aid distribution has become perilous at times, has been deadly as well in part because of the desperation on the ground of Palestinians who are suffering from hunger, who are struggling to find basics in order to survive.And we also saw last night as aid distribution can sometimes turn deadly as well. There are conflicting reports about who is responsible. But, the Palestinian Ministry of Health says that 20 people were killed, 155 people were wounded. The Palestinian Ministry of Health says that it was Israeli shelling on a food distribution site in Gaza City. The Israeli Military, for its part, says that Palestinian gunman opened fire on that distribution site an hour before an aid convoy was coming through. But, what we do know is that the devastation is clear. And it seems like more than just gunfire. The images that we've seen from that event show rubble, show dust all over deceased and wounded individuals with pools of blood, suggesting a weaponry far more serious than gunfire. But, again, conflicting accounts, and we're still trying to gather more facts on the ground. Rahel.",

But, what we see are people, all through these neighborhoods, working so diligently to clean up this mess.And let me just show you something that I think really highlights the scale and the ferocity of this storm. Look at how high these sheets of metal are, Rahel. I mean, I'm 5.7. This is several feet, taller than me. And what this storm did, the power of this storm took these large sheets of metal and just draped them around this light pole here in Winchester. I mean, they are almost turned from sheets of steel into fabric. It's unbelievable when you come out here. And again, I think this image really helps highlight the scale. When you walk down the street, what you see are just blocks and blocks of debris, I mean, houses that were tossed from one side of the street to the other side of the street, homes obliterated, offices obliterated. Rahel, one of the things that I think is so striking here too is that, as you mentioned, 38 people were injured. We have not heard of any fatalities. That is the good news here. And it's really pretty surprising when you look at the mass destruction here. What you're seeing down the street here, if you look on the left hand of the frame, is a home that had been on the clear other side of the street. And we spoke with family members, the women who lived in that home, and they told us that around eight o'clock last night, the woman who owns that home was inside. She called her family because she couldn't get a hold of 911. She called them sobbing, screaming, that she had been crushed underneath her home. Her family members rushed out here. She had again been tossed from one side of the street to the other. Her family members were able to dig her out. Fortunately, she suffered just a broken nose, Rahel. And that is the story for so many people here. We spoke with another man who was inside of Taco Bell, also completely flattened. He was inside as that tornado hit. He was holding up in a cooler, holding on to a steel door. The tornado passed over them in about five seconds. He and his co-workers walked away. They suffered a couple of broken bones. One co-worker, he said suffered a punctured lung. But otherwise, they walked away fine. And that is really the miracle of the day here in Winchester. Let me show you a couple other images here of just the massive scale of this debris. So, over here, this red car you see, that's right where that Taco Bell had been. So, that had been a drive thru. And then next to it, you can see this Jeep Laredo just flipped over and crushed like a soda can. It's really striking out here, Rahel. Again, now, the effort is the cleanup. So, we've seen huge numbers of people come out, starting to pick through this debris, starting to pick up the pieces of their lives. Back to you.",

Whitney, thanks so much.We're going to get now to our breaking news this morning that we've been following all morning. A Georgia judge saying that Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis can remain on the election interference case against Donald Trump, but only, and it's a big only, that's only if special prosecutor Nathan Wade steps down. Now, the judge's ruling included a strong rebuke of Willis for what he called a \"tremendous lapse in judgment\". He also called her romantic relationship with Wade a result of \"bad choices\". But, in the end, the judge, Scott McAfee, concluded that Willis' actions were not enough to disqualify her. Mr. Trump and his co-defendants had argued that the relationship created a conflict of interest. Let's bring in our CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson. Joey, good to have you. Let me ask, just first reaction, were you surprised by this ruling? Were you surprised by some of the judge's language here?",

      "sentences": "Rahel, good to see you on. No and no. Let's start with the judge's language. Certainly, he had to recognize the inevitable and the obvious, and that were that there were some people certainly who listened to the two and a half day hearing, who may have had concerns with respect to the testimony, the credibility of the district attorney, that is Fani Willis, in addition to Nathan Wade. So, that had to be addressed. And he did address it. It had to be addressed in terms of the judgment of the district attorney in hiring Nathan Wade, to begin with.And so, the language of the judge, certainly, he could not ignore what we call the elephant in the room. Right? So, no, as to the language that the judge used nor the characterizations, and no, as to the actual result. At the end of the day, what had to happen, Rahel, is that there needed to be established by the defendants in this case that this -- that there was some financial impropriety that really was a driving and motivating factor to the appointment by Fani Willis to the special prosecutor and that she benefited in some way, the judges not finding that present. And so, at the -- ultimately, the indictment stands. Right? That is the initial indictment brought by the Special Counsel, the special prosecutor that charges various crimes with Mr. Trump and the 18 defendants. But, having said that, right, as you state, the special prosecutor will have to step aside and the judge doing that as a measure to try to continue to keep the faith in the justice system, and if there is any appearance of impropriety that the judgment of the public, perhaps that takes it away the little bit of detains. And so, on balance, I think it was a well-reasoned decision. I think it was a responsible decision. And I think the judge made the right decision.",

And many have said this morning that, look, the district attorney is not usually the one trying the case anyway. So, she is not necessarily expected to be in the courtroom.

      "sentences": "Yeah. Rahel, so broader picture, this is what you see throughout the country, not only in Georgia, but in every state. You have a prosecutor and the lead prosecutor, of course, here being Fani Willis, right, in this jurisdiction, but every prosecutor also has what's called assistant prosecutors, assistant district attorneys, or assistant county attorneys. And so, every day, they're interacting with the judge, prosecutors, what they want, defense attorneys want, what we want, and the judge has to make a decision that's based upon the merits.The reasoning, there was an evidentiary hearing, right, making it specific to this case, and to your question, Rahel, there was an evidentiary hearing held here. Evidentiary hearing means the judge heard testimony. And hearing testimony, you have to make certain findings of fact. You have to draw certain conclusions of law. Not all of those are going to be favorable. And sometimes, you have to use tough language. And as the judge said, in his opinion, prosecutors can strike very hard blows, but they can't be foul blows. And so, the judge had to course correct on that. I think ultimately, this is part of the legal process, and that it'll be incumbent upon Fani Willis to move forward in the case, removing Nathan Wade, going with a team of professionals to pursue the case. And at the end of the day, it's not going to be about financial improprieties, trips to Belize, trip to Miami, domestic trips to Tennessee or South Carolina. It's going to be about what the indictment says, whether or not the defendants charged in the indictment, including Mr. Trump, are guilty of those offenses, could a fair trial be held? And ultimately, does the law in the case match the factual allegations? That will be up to a jury to determine. So, there is a path forward. And I think everyone will be a professional, notwithstanding whether you didn't like the judge. You hated the judge. You loved the judge. Everyone has a job to do. And it's about doing that job, moving the case forward, and getting justice for the state and justice for the defendants who are accused.",

It'll be up to the judge to determine whether his decision could now be appealed. If that happens, there is no way that this case moves forward. If that doesn't happen, whether it moves forward will depend upon Mr. Trump's other trials that are scheduled. Right? We've got one in New York. We've got a couple of federal cases. So, it'd be contingent upon those trial schedules whether it could be fit in and whether actually there is -- this time, right, under the other four -- the total four cases to move forward. SOLOMON",
