And it's showing up in lots of different polls from many different organizations.That's when I tend to believe something. It's not just a one-off on a particular survey on one day in one state. So, look, Barack Obama was absolutely the perfect messenger because black males would be inclined, I think, to listen to him as he explains the stakes of the election. We all think, as we cover this constantly and do nothing but politics, at least I do nothing but politics, you would think that people would know this instinctively, but they don't and they have to be asked, they have to be asked to vote. And black males have been defecting to Republicans at a little higher rate, not 20 percent as some of these surveys are suggesting. But while maybe 8 percent of blacks in the United States will end up voting Republican, among black males, that may be 13 or 14 percent. Well, you know what? This is going to be so close in a lot of these states that that could be the election.",

Wade rights into the state constitution.I think it's been every one so far, at least every one that has gotten well over 50 percent. So I would think it would matter everywhere. Now, the good news for Kamala Harris is she is focusing on that and it's going to make a difference in some of these swing states. The bad news for her is that despite what people say in these surveys, it's so much more complicated than that. They really don't just look at one issue.",

Now, once you do that, I think you can reasonably conclude two things. One is that the better pollsters, the ones who are willing to spend money to do their job better and not be embarrassed after Election Day, have tried to improve their polling to take into account people who were hiding from the pollsters who favored Donald Trump, as proportionately in 2016 and 2020. And that's a good thing. Here's the bad news. Because I've talked to many of the pollsters about this. They have no idea if it's going to work this time either.",

      "sentences": "Well, this new warning from the DEA is stark, but it could, quite literally, save your life or the life of a loved one.Because so many of us are buying things online now. And when we go into a brick-and-mortar pharmacy, you expect that the product behind the counter is from a reputable pharmaceutical company. But what the D.A. is saying is, with these online scams, it's not a pharmacist that's fulfilling your prescription, but quite often drug traffickers. So let's look at some of the warning signs here that the DEA says people should be on the lookout for. If you are able to buy a prescription online and you don't actually need to provide a doctors actual order prescription, that is a red flag. If the price is too good to be true, cut-rate prices, that's a warning sign. If you receive a pill and the packaging is damaged or the pill itself is damaged, that should be a red flag. And the big red flag as well there at the bottom you see, if you get pills and the bottle has no expiration date, that is a major cause of concern. Let's look at some of the Web sites that the DEA says are fraudulent. You'll see these are generic names. Careonlinestore, Pharmacy store online. Now, if you look at these Web sites, if you actually go to them, this is what you'll now see, which is a graphic from the Drug Enforcement Administration. These Web sites have been seized by the Justice Department. But guys, there are still so many of these types of Web sites that are out there that are selling products that can literally kill you. Finally, you'll might be wondering, why would a drug dealers sell someone a product that could kill them? I recently talked to LAPD undercover detective who does this for a living, trying to go after these illicit drugs. What he told me is that, look, at the end of the day, these drug dealers do not actually care about their customers. They're in it to make a profit. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just last month, 18 people were charged in an investigation by the DEA and Homeland Security investigations. It's alleged that they're part of this global online pharmacy scheme. Guys, the DEA Administrator Anne Milgram says that this group flooded the U.S. drug supply, sending packages through these scams to every state in the country, including Washington, D.C. They want people to be on alert. And they say that the D.A. will continue to relentlessly go after these deadly scams.",
