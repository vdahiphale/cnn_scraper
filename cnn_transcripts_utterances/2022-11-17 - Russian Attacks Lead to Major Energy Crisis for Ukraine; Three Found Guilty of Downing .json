Welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD, good to have you with us.Well, with temperatures near or below freezing in Ukraine and snow falling in the capital and other cities, Russia appears to be targeting people's ability to stay warm. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Kremlin forces fired dozens of missiles today, aimed at power plants and other civilian energy sites. Officials in Dnipro, Kharkiv, and Odessa say infrastructure in their areas were hit. Another strike in Zaporizhzhya reportedly leaving four people dead. United Nations officials say Ukraine is on the verge of a major energy crisis. One electric company says about 40 percent of consumers don't have power. President Zelenskyy once again asking allies to send in more air defenses. CNN has learned the U.S. is running low on some of those systems. In the meantime, a Polish security official says all the evidence in Poland, NATO and the U.S. have collected suggests it was a Ukrainian air defense missile that landed Tuesday in Poland, killing two people. President Zelenskyy modified his position on where the missile came from, initially  saying it was not Ukrainian but, in an address Wednesday night, he stressed the importance of getting all the facts. A Polish official says Ukraine is likely to get access to the site soon. More now from CNN senior international correspondent Matthew Chance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A Russian made missile striking a NATO ally and setting the world on edge. But it now seems the explosion that killed two Polish farmers here was a tragic accident, not as feared ordered by the Kremlin.",

As winter sets in, Russia is making Ukraine civilians suffer with reckless abandon. But what happened here in Poland shows just how dangerous that is for the whole world too. This while Ukrainian officials are redoubling their request for more advanced air defense systems from the United States and Europe. They've also committed to cooperating with an investigation into what happened here and admitted their air defenses were active in the area. But officials are clear, Russian President Vladimir Putin is responsible, dragging millions of Ukrainians and now a sleepy one street Polish town into his war of choice -- Matthew Chance, CNN, on the Polish-Ukrainian border.

The families have been waiting for this verdict, this clarity of what had become very appear (ph) at very early stages, that a Russian Buk missile system had been taken, driven from Russia over the border into Ukraine and then used by separatists to fire at this airliner. The airliner was flying at 33,000 feet; because there was a conflict on the ground below, there was a 32,000-foot air cap in place in the country. So the airliner was at 1,000 feet, supposedly, in the safe zone. The separatist shot it down and this is now, if you will, the end of the story, because these three of those four charged, the one who was found not guilty of murder and bringing down the aircraft, was acknowledged to have not known about the operation. But to intelligence operators involved, it provided the paperwork and allowing the missile system to be driven across the border. This will not put an end to the suffering of all those families. But it's very clear from a Ukrainian perspective that this has very clearly shown Russia's malign engagement and involvement in that conflict in 2014, which is being replicated writ large, again, at the moment, with deadly weapons systems and with deadly effect. I think for many of the families involved, they had hoped that this does show the world that the world should have acted more strongly back in 2014, that it should have seen Putin's malign actions in Ukraine and understood them for what they were back then. And there is a sense that this war could have been averted by that. So this decision will strengthen opinions in that area as well.",

But he did the sort of diplomatic equivalent, which was not raise the issue and say that actually, Ukraine is entirely transparent, all its data is available and asked that Ukraine be part of the investigation, which does seem to be the direction events are headed in. Ukraine, its air force has said that they were, as Matthew Chance reported in his package there, chasing Russian missiles. Of course, questions will be raised about, was Russia firing missiles intentionally close to the border with the attempt to induce these automated weapon systems that will fire at a target? They go put almost (ph) too quickly for people to sort of track the missiles and direct the air defense systems. So an analysis will be made on what was Russia targeting. Was it intentionally flying close to the border to induce just this sort of accident that appears to have happened here? On the weapons side, Ukraine desperately needs every weapon that it can get, because it feels that it has Russia on the run in the south and feels that it has some momentum on its side. Certainly, in military terms, if you can exploit momentum in your favor, i.e. Russian troops withdrawing and retreating in the south, then that is your military advantage.

Now Xi also met with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, to do more to counter what was happening and try and again convince North Korea not to do so. And Xi said he would be willing to support Yoon's plan for aid for denuclearization if North Korea agrees to it. But at this point, there's no chance of that. Lynda.",

But many people here in Great Britain will wonder how, two months ago, the Conservative government that was previously in office at Number 10, said that this country could grow and spend its way out of its current predicament, announcing about $40 billion to $50 billion worth of tax cuts that were unfunded, whereas now there suddenly seems to be a black hole that needs to be filled with $65 billion  in the equivalent in pounds of spending cuts and also tax rises. So let's go through what's been announced today. It's a combination of those cuts, many of them actually by stealth, that are going to be pushed back to kicking into effect in 2025. More immediately a lot more people here will be paying higher taxes straightaway. The threshold for the highest rate of tax is lowered, a lot more people are going to be dragged into what's been called the fiscal drag if you like.
