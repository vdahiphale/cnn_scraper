At trial now moves to the penalty phase and jurors must decide whether to sentence Bowers to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole. CNN's Danny Freeman reports.DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Victor, Amara, it took only five hours for the jury to come to this unanimous verdict convicting Robert Bowers of all 63 federal charges that he faced including the capital charges that he faced as well. We had a team inside the courtroom and they described it as really silent as the judge was reading out these convictions. You could hear a pin drop though Bowers himself was described as being basically emotionless and once those capital charges, those verdicts were read, then you could hear some of the air in the room bled out and some of the family members start to sniffle as they process what had just happened. I just want to go over what some of the charges were that we're talking about here. 22, like I said, capital offenses on the table, and the primary ones would be obstruction of the free exercise of religious beliefs, resulting in death. Basically, the jury convicted Robert Bowers of killing 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue back in 2018, specifically, while they were practicing their Jewish faith. And to that point, I really want to illustrate and give some perspective and context. These people in the Pittsburgh Jewish community specifically in the larger Pittsburgh community have been waiting a long time four and a half years for this day in court. And then through the trial the past three weeks, it's been grueling in terms of the testimony and exhibits that we've had to hear and see. I just want to highlight one piece of testimony from a survivor of the shooting. Carol black, she described hiding in a closet in a basement while the shooting was going around, upstairs and in her basement area. And she described seeing her friend Mel Wax die, she said quote, he immediately went down on the ground on his back and was dying. He didn't say anything. He just made a garbling kind of sound. And then he made a grunt. And then there was silence. His head was just inches away from my feet. And I bring that quote up just to illustrate the intensity of these past three weeks. And we actually got a chance to hear from some of the members of this Jewish community about how they felt about the verdict that happened on Friday. Take a listen to what one leader from the new light congregation had to say.",

We know that the defendant did not call any witnesses, and they barely cross examined, the witnesses put on by the prosecution.So it would have been almost impossible for this jury to find anything other than guilty based on the testimony. You know, the grueling testimony, as we've heard from the survivors, from some of the law enforcement officers who arrived on the scene from the first responders who were there.

Obviously, Robert Bowers tried to negotiate a plea deal with the prosecution that would have avoided the death penalty. He was hoping to get life without parole. But the Justice Department rejected that offer and said, No, we want to move forward with trial because they were convinced that they could get guilty verdicts on the capital offenses and move forward, seeking the death penalty.So the defense attorney didn't have very many options when it came to presenting a defense. It was clear that he had done it. There were witnesses there that could put him in the room put the gun in his hand, and it would have been impossible for him to claim that he was not guilty of these crimes. So I think she made the best argument that was available to her.

The defense attorney is going to say that he had, you know, he has a distorted view of reality, and that his actions were not logical, were not rational.But we're also going to hear testimony from the survivors. We're going to hear from family members. We're going to hear from those individuals who lost their loved ones, and the impact that the loss of those loved ones have had on their lives. It's going to be very, very emotional and difficult part of this trial.

Thank you for being with us. I first want to look at what we learned here.And this comes after the state investigation. So we learned some of this a few months ago, and then what comes next. We learned that -- and this stood out to me, and even the AG, he pointed this out as egregious. One of the details here was that when arrestees would claim that they couldn't breathe, the officers would respond with, you can breathe, you're talking now. I have heard that, chief, as a defense to some of the maneuvers from law enforcement over years. There have been law enforcement analysts on this network who have said, well, if they're talking, they can breathe. Is that -- how does that resonate across the profession to hear the AG call that out?",

I welcome DOJ to come in and take a look at both departments that I ran, and they did find problems.And we were able to work together in order to correct them. But there are 18,000 police departments in the United States. DOJ can't be everywhere. So it's got to go beyond just DOJ looking at a department if you want real transformation in the profession of policing. There are serious systemic issues that still persist. And we have to find a way in order to fix that. And so, you know, you've got, you know, 50 different police standard and training boards, you've got, you know, again, 18,000 departments, you've got all kinds of issues, complex issues that need to be dealt with. And we haven't even talked about the power of the unions. It's very hard to get rid of a bad police officer. And so, there's a combination of factors that go into really trying to fix policing.

They'll deal with a wide range of issues affecting that department.What monitors do, is one, they provide technical assistance. They'll bring in subject matter experts in different areas, they'll take a look at what they're doing or make strong recommendations. But that department is going to have to come into full compliance with every single paragraph of that consent decree, and that could very well exceed 500 or 600 paragraphs that they have to come into compliance with. And what the monitor does is not only do they review where they are now, they make recommendations, then they have to assess to make sure that they've actually put in place changes not just for the moment, but changes that will last for, you know, a long period of time, forever, hopefully. And so, yes, the monitoring team will have a lot to do. BLACKWELL: Are there deadlines for these benchmarks? I mean, how long will this dissent -- decree last?

A lot of various, a lot of body-worn camera video and reports that have to be reviewed.Once that's done and the foundation is laid in this process of actually making the changes necessary to come into compliance with a consent decree begin to take place. It is not unusual, five, six years, some go longer than that. A lot of this going to depend on leadership of that department. If you've got a leader in the department that fights to consent decree, it can go on for a very long time, more than a decade. If you've got one that really is open to the change and not fighting it, then, of course, then the process can go a lot quicker. But again, it's not going to be a very fast process.
