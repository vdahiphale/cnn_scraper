Reading the room yesterday, seven MPs doing the questioning -- four from his own party and three from other opposition parties -- he didn't really win the room over. Whatever this committee decides -- we might hear about that in a few weeks time -- it will still get voted on by Parliament.Look, Johnson could be simply given a telling-off -- a written warning. He could have his pay cut. He could be suspended for 10 days or more. If that happened that would be a pretty big censure. He -- there could be a by-election in his constituency and this really could signal the end of his political career. It's not clear that's going to happen. But Johnson's defense here was look, I didn't mislead -- that statement, knowingly or recklessly -- because he says he was relying on the advice of senior officials around him to describe those events at Downing Street. And he said look, it's an old building. He lives in it. It's his office as well. It's an old building. There's a lot of people working in there. It's not possible to have complete social distancing. That they were following guidelines. But I think one of the most telling questions from one of the MPs on that committee was when she asked Boris Johnson -- look, there's this gathering -- you're all in a room. You've explained to us that some of the mitigating screening is actually in another room. But you're all in that room and you say it's the best you can do to follow the guidance and you need to have this gathering at this time. It's in your workplace. This was a workplace gathering. But why is your wife, an interior designer, there? And really, Johnson's assertive defensive really didn't have a strong comeback on that. And I think there were other cases where similar questions were put to him. Why didn't you listen to other advisors who were telling you other things? But Johnson feels that the committee has got it wrong. He's a tough political fighter. But yes, this could be it.",

Watch the ball go out of bounds here. This is where it was questioned. But the officials apparently never told the Mavs according to Cuban. Dallas lined up on their offensive side while the officials gave it to the Warriors on their side and Kevon Looney just got an easy dunk. So Cuban said all they had to do was tell them, but they didn't. Now, in the officials' pool report after the game they claim it was always going to be Warriors' ball. So the Mavs ended up losing this game by two and they were not happy about it afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
