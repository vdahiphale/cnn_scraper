It's about Kennedy, right, and an assassination attempt and the trauma of that nation. There are so many things that Carter did in his approach that we're in direct response to the struggles that the nation was having. And you mentioned that inaugural speech, and I really like this line, \"We've learned that more is not necessarily better, that even our great nation has it's -- has recognized it's limits, for better or worse.\" Because we know Americans do not like to be told about their limits. And he really suffered for that. This is the kind of way he approached the job. And even today, I think, in planning the funeral, it's not just about what he didn't want. It was about not self-indulgence. I think he had, especially as a born again Christian, that sense of humility is built into your internal system. And so it's not that you don't want to be honored. It's that this idea that it shouldn't be overdoing it. So, you know, not treating yourself like a king, especially if you are someone who has a faith in in Jesus Christ as your king, right? You have a sort of separate idea of these things. And I'm going to be fascinated, honestly, by every hymn choice today because I think he's, as usual, going to be sending more messages to us.",

He was the only Annapolis grad, and he actually wanted a career in the Navy. That's what he was initially seeking. He and Rosalynn moved to Annapolis. She was very happy with life there. I became a bit of a Jimmy Carter obsessive in recent years. And in reading about their time in Annapolis and what it meant for him, and he wanted to be an engineering officer on a submarine. That was his big dream. And then his father died unexpectedly, and he had to go back home to Plains. And upon returning for the funeral, obviously, realized he could no longer stay in Annapolis, that he had to come back home and tend to family matters. And he brought Rosalynn back with him. But as you famously read in his book, it was -- a book about him, it was a decision that Jimmy Carter made alone.

And it just obviously has shaped so much of American history that still has ramifications for the presidencies that we cover today. And I thought that was such a fascinating part of his story of looking into that and seeing the life that Jimmy Carter envisioned for himself. And ultimately, what President Carter went on -- went on to be, and obviously how he also viewed the military when he was in office and service members. And so to see this as he's now returning to Washington, a place that he did not really enjoy that much and was never a man of Washington. He didn't enjoy the backroom deal making, the -- the comfy relationships, the horse trading that accompanies so much of Washington relationships, as you know, Wolf, from covering the White House. He didn't love that. He was part of it. He said later that it not having that political capital actually might have cost him. But that was not really the way he operated.",

He couldn't believe that vice presidents before had been left out of the loop for issues like that. And he put them inside the West Wing to keep them -- you know, affecting the chain of command.
