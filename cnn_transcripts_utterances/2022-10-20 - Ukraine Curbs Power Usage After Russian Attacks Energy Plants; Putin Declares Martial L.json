Meantime in Moscow, a desperate move by a desperate leader Vladimir Putin has declared martial law across territory, Russia does not fully control. For Ukraine regions, Russia claims to have annexes weeks ago, but for the most part, the declaration appears to be almost meaningless. Half of those regions have been partially under Russian military occupation for years. And in recent weeks, Russia has been losing territory to our Ukrainian counter offensive. Putin has also increased security across Russia, especially provinces neighboring Ukraine. Here's what the U.S. president had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I think Vladimir Putin finds himself in an incredibly difficult position.

The first is the logistics had been such a horrible part of this war for the Russians. The Ukrainians had been so good at disrupting the logistics, they weren't great anyway, but the Ukrainians have had significant success. And then again, the other thing is simply firm command and control to make sure that the Kremlin when it wants something done, there's not a governor fighting with the military command or fighting with, you know, one of the self-proclaimed, you know, fighters that are fighting inside of Ukraine.
