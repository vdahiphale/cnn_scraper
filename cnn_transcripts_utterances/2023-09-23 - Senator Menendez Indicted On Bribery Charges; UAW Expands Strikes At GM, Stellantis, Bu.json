I mean, we are likely going to have that landfall here within the next hour.Sustained winds right now, 70 miles per hour. Keep in mind hurricane is 75, so we're only five miles per hour off from what would be considered hurricane strength. That forward movement has slowed just a little bit to the north northwest at just about nine miles per hour. But you can see all of those outer bands, they're stretching pretty far north. It's raining right now in New Jersey and Philadelphia are -- in Philadelphia as well, and those are some of those far northern bands of Ophelia. But here's a look at the core of the storm again. That eye wall is getting ever so close to land right there. So we're going to be seeing that landfall here very quickly. But some heavier bands starting to push into Jacksonville, North Carolina as well as Kingston, even Raleigh has had some off and on rain bands throughout the day today. Keep in mind too, the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms as possible, tornadoes, even some damaging winds and large hail. That storm will serve to veer back towards the northeast as we go over the next 24 to 48 hours. It will also weaken so that by the time we start to see those main impacts across Delaware, New Jersey and even Maryland, it will be a little bit of a weaker system than it is right now. But it's still going to take all of that heavy rain with it. So even though the system itself will be weaker, especially in terms of winds, you're still going to have the potential for flooding extends all the way up into states like New Jersey, New York and even Pennsylvania. It's just going to be the focus of two days. So the moderate risk for flooding today is mainly focused over North Carolina and Virginia, but the flooding potential does still extend even as far north as Massachusetts, gentlemen, tomorrow.",

We know that deadline that the government will no longer be able to fund itself is September 30th. Now, it's important because every agency has different plans and procedures. Things like what is -- what employees would be furloughed, what employees would be deemed essential and does have to work through a shutdown. Now, of course, at risk if the government would shut down would be essential things that are very key to this Biden administration, like pay for military and military families, food aid programs, travel, processing those essential things. And so the White House yesterday was up here at the podium, talking to Republicans saying that they should not risk those issues not being paid for. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Republicans shutdown does not have to happen.

He's facing an uphill battle when it comes to getting anything done here based on the dynamics in the Republican Party in the House side. Last night, our Abby Phillip talked to Congressman Matt Gaetz. This is what he said when he was asked what would happen if Speaker McCarthy put a continuing resolution to the floor.

MATT GAETZ (R-FL): If Speaker McCarthy embraces a clean continuing resolution to continue the spending policies of Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden, that would most likely trigger a motion to vacate.

Matt Gaetz is rumored to be trying to become the next governor of Florida. He's just basically opened the door to them doing exactly what they're doing. They get on network television, they get to raise money, they get to posture. And in this case, they get to threaten to shutdown the government which almost everybody in Washington, I'm sure you're hearing the same thing, Omar.

Over on the Senate side, we've already heard from Senator Schumer, the majority on the Senate side, they've said they don't want to do that. They don't intend to do that.And so, for this not particularly important procedural dispute, what we're going to have is, these individual bills, they may or may not pass, there'll be a lot of discussion along the way. But if McCarthy wants to regain control, he's got to stop these folks from controlling the process. And so, he can put this off for a little bit of time. But in the end, he's going to have to face down against that faction, and see if they're going to allow him to govern. One clue as to what's likely to happen, Omar, is that they sent everybody home for the weekend. So, even as the clock is ticking, even as they need to be negotiating, he sent everyone home and it's really kind of a quiet acknowledgment that he doesn't have the votes, he doesn't have control.

Here is more from CNN's correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich.VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  So, today you now have over 18,000 UAW members on the picket line after President Fain of the UAW announced that he would be targeting 38 more facilities at GM and Stellantis across 20 states, sending an additional 5,600 members out to the picket lines. And this is because President Fain said that GM and Stellantis needed a strong push to come with a better offer. However, if you notice, Ford was not noted in those additional targeted strikes. President Fain saying that real progress was made with Ford. And here are some details. According to the union, Ford's latest offer reinstated cost of living adjustments, which was something that many of these workers gave up in 2009. They're now offering more profit-sharing, and temporary workers can now become full-time workers in 90 days. And there's additional job security, which essentially means that if a Ford employee is laid off, they will receive two years of income and benefits, but notably missing from the announcement on Friday was where things stood with wages. We know that the union has been asking for a 40 percent wage increase over four years. The last public offer from the three companies was around 20 percent. Ford and the UAW saying that while they have come to terms with some of these other demands, there's still a big gap on the wage issue. And these new targeted strikes will certainly have an economic impact. This is going to impact dealerships, because dealerships will not be able to get parts from specifically GM and Stellantis. And this will then trickle down to the consumer who is looking to bring their car in for a repair, potentially those parts will not be available. We have some recent economic reporting from Anderson economic group that says just in the first eight days of this strike with just the three plants, we have seen a $1.6 billion economic impact, with these new 38 facilities that are now being targeted by the union, that number, Omar and Victor, is expected to grow.",

Acuna, now, he was all pumped up when he hit a homerun in the first inning last night, number 40.Braves' superstar joining Alex Rodriguez, Alfonso Soriano, Barry Bonds and Jose Canseco are the only players ever to go 40-40. That was also Acuna's 160th homerun. He's the first player ever to have 160 dingers and steal 160 bases at the age of 25 years old. Braves beat the Nationals in that one by a final of 9-6. Now, Aaron Judge also having himself a night last night.   He hit not one, not two, but three homeruns against the Diamondbacks. Judge, the first Yankees' player ever to hit three homeruns in a game twice in one season. Reigning MVP with 35 homeruns now in just a 100 games this season. He's been out a lot due to injury. But remember, last year at this time, Judge was in the spotlight as he was chasing Roger Maris' American League homerun record, which he did break, getting 6-2 homeruns. Yankees beat the D-backs now at 7-1. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (CROWD CHEERING) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So they brought in first baseman Rowdy Tellez to pitch the final inning, and the 270 pounder is throwing heat, he's throwing in the high 50s, low 60s.He got the strike-out there. His teammates were pumped as well too, pretty awesome. Brewers can clinch the NL Central with a win today. And we got a big day of college football on tap. There are six games between ranked teams to enjoy later on today. The biggest between sixth-ranked Ohio state, they're going to play ninth-ranked Notre Dame, that game in South Bend, that one 7:30 Eastern. But the game may be the most watched today, Deion Sanders and 19th- ranked Colorado playing a 10th-ranked Oregon, that one is at 3:30 Eastern, Coach Prime's Buffaloes actually huge underdogs today. The Ducks favored by 21 points. Victor, if Prime can somehow find a way to pull this one off, he may truly be the greatest coach in college football.",
