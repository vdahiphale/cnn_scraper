It is game day.In CNN headquarters in Atlanta, you were looking at live pictures of where just a few hours, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will meet for the first 2024 presidential debate. It is historic, the earliest in modern election history, the only faceoff between two candidates who have each taken the oath of office prior, both say the stakes are high. And look at this, it is as close race as ever. CNN's poll of polls shows Biden and Trump in a statistical dead heat. Millions of voters will tune in and there was no question that tonight could fundamentally alter the course of this race. So which voters are we watching tonight and where could this debate matters?

And what you need to know about this race, when you include the third party options, there are a ton of folks at this particular time who say that they are in fact either undecided or say that they're going third party. We're talking nearly 20 percent of the electorate at this particular point. Look at this 19 percent heading into this first debate. That is far higher than the historical average when it's just 11 percent. So there are far more voters who are up for grabs at this particular point then in the average cycle, and not just in the average cycle, Jim, I'm saying that this is the highest share going into the first debate on record. Now, part of that is because we have such an early debates, so its not surprising that there are so many folks who are undecided, but nonetheless, it is notable that there are a lot of folks who need convincing on either Joe Biden or Donald Trump at this time. Now, we look did it nationally. What about the swing states? Because that's ultimately where this election is going to be decided, right? So what are the three swing states that were watching? How about the Great Lakes battleground states? Why are we watching these three states in your screen? We're watching them because if Joe Biden wins all of them, he's likely to be the next president. If Donald Trump can win just one of them, he's likely to be the next president. Look how tight these polls are at this point. Pennsylvania, which has the widest margin, is just Trump plus two. That's within any margin of error. That is what we would call no clear leader. Michigan, tied, Wisconsin, tied. So when we look at these polls, we realize how important tonight's debate is because the racist so close that even if it just moves it just a smidgen, a smidgen, that could be enough in these important battleground states in the Great Lakes that it can change the entire dynamic of the race. And one in which I think a lot of people so far have felt that Joe Biden is probably behind Donald Trump. It could very well be after tonight's debate performance if Joe Biden does well, he could be ahead of Donald Trump. Of course, if he doesn't do well --",

Bernie has so much -- so many things in his head and he has to memorize that he don't have to write down a lot of things.But you have to be prepared to not have to feed off the audience. Just like Donald Trump, Bernie feed off of audiences. He loved the back- and-forth with audiences, and he would say the same things, expecting certain things back. So there's a way that you have to mentally know that you have to stick to the plan of what you're going to say before you ever walk in that room about whatever that issue said that you're asked about, and when you talk about somebody like President Biden, he's probably working on one liners that he hopes you in the press and everybody else picks up that he says to Donald Trump about each one of these things that he wants to hit own tonight.

You mentioned was, I was deeply both and preparing Mitt Romney in 2012, when he had that first debate against Barack Obama, Barack Obama came out in that first debate in 2012, flat, even though he was well-prepared, it's very difficult for an incumbent president to be put into this situation where they're being questioned and poked and prodded in this way -- yes. I mean, they get it from the media. Yes. Of course, they get it on the campaign trail every day. But it's a little bit different in a debate setting. And so, it can be a challenge in this first debate for an incumbent president, you know, who's used to the trappings of the office, used to having a lot of people say yes. It's very, very difficult to then put them from that situation into the debates situation. So we'll see how Joe Biden responds and reacts. He's obviously a seasoned pro. He's done lots of debates so well have to see, but I have no doubt that for the Biden team, they are aware of this first debate letdown dynamic, and have prepared him and warned him going into tonight's debate.",

That maybe not -- not the way to convey the authentic Trump, right?Look, my counsel would be and I haven't been involved in his prep at all, but my counsel would be go to the issues. This is where in the polling, you've got strength. This is where when you ask the public, listen, who's going to do a better job of managing cost of living issues, the economy, certainly immigration. To the degree that Trump can stick to talking about what its plans are for those things, I think he'll be on good ground and that naturally, I think will address some of the temperament issues and some of the temperament concerns that we've seen because I think what he's talking about issues, talking about plans, he's not getting into personal grievance.

They're willing, some of them, to hold their nose and vote for Donald Trump if he can tell them what he's going to do to make their life better, and he has an opportunity to do that. Joe Biden is going to remind them what he has done to make their life better.

These are obviously the claims of his victimhood that we have heard not really just since he faced all these legal troubles, but really for the last decade. That's how Donald Trump operates, that he's the victim of multiple scenarios and that's how he ended up in this position.So when it comes to how he's going to say that Biden is the actual threat to democracy. That is what he's going to focus on as his legal issues and saying it stemmed from President Joe Biden, which obviously there's absolutely really no evidence of. And, of course, the case in New York was brought by the state of New York, not by Joe Biden's Justice Department or the Justice Department. When we talk about what they are going to talk about, that's not a reaction just to him trying to make this case. It's a reaction to the fact that part of his preparation is watching very closely what is coming out of Camp David. And some of the reporting that we have seen is that Joe Biden plans to focus on democracy, plans to focus on January 6, and Donald Trump's role in January, and also his rhetoric since January 6. So, that is a very clear reaction to that. One thing Donald Trump spent the day doing is watching the lead up to the debate. The coverage on various networks, seeing what people are saying is coming out of Camp David, Donald Trump is a reactive person. And one of the things I do want to know your, we have said over and over again, the Donald Trump's team does use the word preparation with them, that they don't have these traditional mock debates, that does not mean that Donald Trump has not had extensive preparation. They know how critical this moment is, and I am told some sources close to Donald Trump that he is aware of how critical this is. Now, whether or not he can do, which is to stay on message, to not only dive in to these personal attacks, to focus on things like the economy and inflation, integration as well as crime, things that he polls higher than Joe Biden on to look at recent numbers, we don't know what version of Donald Trump is actually going to show up on the stage. And these various conversations with senior advisers, they will acknowledge that as well. The hope is though, particularly given the fact that Donald Trump is going to have the last word determined by a coin flip, is that no matter what happens today, he could end on a solid message of focusing on those core issues. They don't really want, and this is Donald Trump as well, to talk about democracy, they don't want to talk about things like abortion, but they know that these are inevitable questions, and that is one of the things they had been preparing for, not just how to answer it, but also had a pivot back to those four issues like inflation question that they believe helped Donald Trump.",

We also have a big one for law nerds, Jim, that deals with the Chevron doctrine, you know, whether or not courts have to defer to agency rule-making when Congress isn't explicit. You know, the Supreme Court has chipped away at agency power throughout the recent years. So, we'll see if they completely overturn that doctrine, which would be a huge blow to agency power. So those are probably the two big ones were waiting for. And then one other involving January 6, defendants in a certain law that they were used to, that prosecutors choose to convict them under to see if that law can hold.

So to help us break this down for more, Michele Goodwin joins us now, professor of constitutional law and global health policy at Georgetown University. Michele, good to have you. We need you, a lot to work through here. First on this Idaho decision, Ketanji Brown Jackson, she actually sided with majority but wrote a separate opinion objecting to the court failing to make a decision on the case. She wrote, quote, there was simply no good reason not to resolve this conflict now. So if it's correct to frame this, as Jessica did, what holds the Idaho law or federal law if that question is unresolved, when are we going to find out the answer to that question? MICHELE GOODWIN, PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW &amp; GLOBAL HEALTH POLICY, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Well, centuries ago, it was made very clear that federal law always trump's, states law, which is why this case is so alarming to some people. That is to say that although this case is about abortion rights, it fundamentally implicates American democracy and how we understand federalism and how we understand federal law is always preempting states law. What's clear in this decision is that this court has not dismantled EMTALA, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. It does not cabin the law or constrain it and said, well, it applies to everybody else, but not pregnant people. It is true that the court has adjudicated this on a technical count, much like it did in the mifepristone abortion case from just a week or two ago. But fundamentally, what this means is that pregnant patients in crisis in Idaho should go to emergency rooms, should be able to receive a dignified health care that is medically informed, including if that means an abortion in order to stop what could be emergency hemorrhaging with a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.",

Circuit Court of Appeals that no, no president is above the law and not immune from criminal punishments when the former president has broken the law. Trump's argument is that past presidents, current presidents, future presidents will always deserve what absolute immunity, meaning can do almost anything including as his lawyers argued, have someone from a Navy SEAL take out someone that they don't like.

Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and one minute for responses and rebuttals. At the moderator's discretion, there may be an additional minute for follow-ups, clarifications, or responses. So how does a candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidate's field of view or the timing lights. When the light show yellow, there are 15 seconds left and candidates answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are five seconds left, and when the display is solid red the time is up.

The greatest number, Jim, I've seen is that 74 percent of Americans say they're going to tune in. Now, we know people always say they're going to do virtuous things.

Oh, my goodness, this poll, and they're tearing themselves apart.And I tell them all, you will be so much happier and no worse off if you ignore the polls until after the Democratic convention. That's when they actually matter. SCIUTTO: Okay. By the way, we were just showing live picture there again of President Biden making an unscheduled stop on his way downtown Atlanta. So again, I know you just said don't pay attention to every poll every day. But you have things like Nate Silver's model yesterday that puts Trump at a 65.7 percent chance of winning. And then you have this, that stood out to my team and I, and that is that Biden has never had a numerical advantage in CNN's poll of polls. All margins that weren't zero have been appointed to in Trump's favor. Again, that's small but Biden's never led.

One thing I have noted in surveys well beyond this election season, is that people thought that Joe Biden was going to govern more as a centrist.
