All right. I want to start with you, Stephen. Yesterday, Biden talking about how -- you know, trying to shore up concerns about his mental fitness.

An opposition was building within his own party to the idea of him continuing to be the nominee.Everything the White House has done and everything the president has said since then has exacerbated this question. It hasn't made it go away. It's still a big question. That's why the interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC tonight is going to be very important. The president is traveling this weekend. He's got a big NATO summit next week, which will allow him to adopt the role of a statesman. But there is also a press conference there that is going to be very closely watched. You saw those remarks last night. Everything the president does and says now, is under an extreme microscope. And any mistakes he make [SIC] play into this narrative that people -- a lot of voters can't see him being president in a second term when he's 86. So, the political problem has not gone away.

They've actually made it worse with these comments about you know, eight -- no meetings after 8 p.m. And Democrats are reaching an inflection point really -- coming up really fast. The polling shows that Donald Trump is leading by six points. That is a massive lead in today's political society with their convention coming up. I mean, if you went into election day, and Donald Trump's up six points, you're talking about a blowout of epic proportions. So that's why they're really on a clock.

He needs to be doing these things, because people need -- he needs to be showing the American people that he can do the job that they're going to elect him for. So, they don't have a choice but to get him out on the road and to be doing things. And to be fair to him, he -- after the debate, he went to two different watch parties. He was at the Waffle House and a different watch party. He then landed in North Carolina. He greeted voters on the tarmac at 2 a.m. in the morning. It's not like he is not doing things. It's just now he's under such an extreme microscope that it's almost -- you can't reach perfect every single time, and that's what people are expecting. And that's just not a fair standard for him. Does he need to be better and to kind of curb some of these things and be out there? Absolutely. But he needs to take this to the American people.

None of them, I don't think, are going to be as closely watched here. One of the problems in the debate was that the president wasn't able to either lay out a strong, detailed case for what he would do in a second term, and he wasn't also able to effectively prosecute the case against Donald Trump, which to be fair, he has been doing for the last year. He's been arguing that Trump would be a massive threat to democracy and American values, and the soul of the country. If he can do that, while it's only a television interview -- it's much different than a debate -- he could probably at least get some good headlines and buy himself a little bit of time. The problem is that a lot of these Democrats are coming on TV talking about this right now, even the ones that are supporting him, are saying he's got to do a lot more.

But I really question that, because voters have had these concerns. They were kind of confirmed last Thursday night.

If for instance, this Middle East situation appears to improve, that would be something else for the president to talk about. That's why I think the NATO summit, where he'll be standing with world leaders next week, will be a good picture. But to your point, voters saw that picture. Fifty million people had that image of a president who appeared to be struggling, emblazoned on their brains. How a television interview will be watched by far fewer people, even with social media clips and anything else.

It had a much more symmetrical shape. But you can see it has weakened some. You can see it kind of getting a little lopsided on that satellite. But it's still a dangerous Category 2 storm with 110 mile-per-hour winds. We're still looking at storm surge up to four to six feet, heavy rain across the tip of that peninsula there. Four to six inches of rain, maybe up to ten inches in some locations. That could cause some flash flooding. Now as we go through the weekend, it will kind of emerge tonight back into the Gulf of Mexico, where it could reintensify over very warm waters, maybe become a hurricane again as it sets its eyes on South Texas as we go into the weekend. We've been talking about incredibly warm water temperatures with this the entire stretch. And it doesn't end, because like I said, the Gulf of Mexico, incredible warm, can give it another chance to get its act together. This high pressure, this dome of heat and humidity, is weakening some, and that is what's helping it turn farther North into Texas and can open up those doors as we go through the weekend. So, you can see the hurricane warnings for that imminent landfall there in Mexico; comes back into the Gulf overnight. And then we're looking at possibly another landfall somewhere in North Mexico, South Texas as we go into the weekend, possibly as a hurricane. Regardless of where this exactly makes landfall, we're talking about dangerous rip currents all weekend for all of these beaches. Again, keep in mind, it's a holiday weekend, so people really need to stay on alert -- Paula.",
