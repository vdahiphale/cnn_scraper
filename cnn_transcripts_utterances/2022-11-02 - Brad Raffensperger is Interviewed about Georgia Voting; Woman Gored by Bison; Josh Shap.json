During the pandemic we had 25 percent of the people, you know, were voting absentee. And that's why, as an emergency measure, drop boxes were put in to as an administrative rule. But that went out after the senatory (ph) runoffs. They weren't allowed. And so for the very first time they're actually codified and put into state law. We're now back to about 6 percent to 7 percent of the people voting absentee. So the numbers are down by 80 percent of who's voting absentee.",

You get one for every 100,000 voters.And then, obviously, next session, the general assembly can look at it and should that be tweaked, should there be a few more drop boxes. But it's population based. Every county has to have one. Back in 2020 we had nearly 40 counties that did not have a single drop box. Now every county has to have a drop box. But the fact of the matter is, we have safe and secure elections, we have photo ID for absentee voting, photo ID for in-person voting. We have record turnout. It's never been easier to register. We have record registrations. We have 6.9 million registered voters -- active registered voters and it looks like to me we will probably be pushing well over 4 million, which is what we had in 2018. We won't hit the presidential number of 5 million, but, still, we're showing that it's here as the proper guardrails and accessibility and we believe that we're the model for election integrity but also election access.

Thank you so much for being with us this morning. And let's talk about the economy. So much of this, as you know, is about inflation. And you've got a Democrat in the White House. You've got Democrats controlling the House and the Senate and inflation is out of control. My question to you is, as governor, there's not a lot you can do to deal with inflation, but you do oversee all these state agencies, right, that deal with tax policy, that deal with grants, that deal with aid to those suffering. What would you do, as governor, to help people struggling with the economy, with inflation? JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA), GUBERNATORIAL. CANDIDATE: Well, look, obviously this is not an issue created by the governor of the commonwealth or, you know, the state lawmakers. But I do think we have a responsibility to address it, to bring down costs for Pennsylvania families. That's why many months ago I leaned in on this issue and put forth a concrete plan to reduce costs for Pennsylvanians. First, we would cut business taxes. Second, we'd get rid of those nuisance taxes here in Pennsylvania, like the cell phone tax. Every Pennsylvanian with a cell phone pays 11 percent more on their bill each month. Third, we're going to double what's known as the property tax rent rebate and double the number of seniors that are eligible for it. That's going to help seniors with rising costs be able to stay in their homes. And finally, for those who are dealing with pain at the pump, I want to give them all an immediate $250 gas tax rebate. You have two cars, $500 and so on and so forth. The bottom line here is, we have to cut costs for Pennsylvania families.",

They can also care about their personal freedoms. And those personal freedoms are under attack with this dangerous extreme opponent that I'm running against who wants to ban and criminalize all abortion with no exception.So, I lean in on protecting personal freedoms and also talking about the economy and crime. I'm proud to be endorsed by prosecutors of both parties, by local police all across Pennsylvania. I've got a plan to hire 2,000 more police officers across this commonwealth, properly trained and from the communities that they are sworn to protect because people have a right to both be safe and feel safe in our communities.
