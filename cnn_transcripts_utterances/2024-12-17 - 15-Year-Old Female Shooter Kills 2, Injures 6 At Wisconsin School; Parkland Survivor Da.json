She's one of more than 400 students who were inside their Christian school in Madison, Wisconsin when a 15-year-old girl opened fire yesterday. Two people were killed, six others were injured, and the shooter who attended the school died from a self-inflicted gunshot.A source tells CNN she planned the attack in advance and used a 9 millimeter pistol, but officials say it's still unclear who owned the gun and how she ultimately got it. Joining me now is David Hogg, he survived the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida that killed 17 people. And David announced yesterday that he is running to be vice chair of the DNC. Nice to see you in person. Thanks for being here. I was watching your face. I can't even imagine what it's like for you to listen to that little girl, especially considering that you had that kind of trauma. You were obviously older, but still a teenager when that occurred in Parkland. And I want to play for our viewers what you said just weeks after 17 people were killed at your high school. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) DAVID HOGG, PARKLAND SHOOTING SURVIVOR: When politicians send their thoughts and prayers with no action, we say no more! And to those politicians supported by the NRA that allow the continued slaughter of our children and our future, I say get your resumes ready. (END VIDEOCLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, that's absolutely important. If people see the warning signs, they need to call it out. If they see something, they need to say something. But at the same time, we saw how that failed after Parkland.There were so many signs that the shooter had the police called to his house multiple times before the shooting, was reported to the FBI, was reported to law enforcement, and was still able to legally own and obtain an AR-15, even though he couldn't own a handgun if he was to purchase it from a federally licensed dealer because he wasn't 21 yet. And we have made progress. The law that we passed after Uvalde, it has prevented over 1,000 high-risk individuals under the age of 21 from getting weapons like the AR-15. And we're not going to hear a headline about the shooting that doesn't happen, right? Or the 19,000 times that the red flag law that we passed after Parkland has been used to disarm people that are at risk themselves or others. But we have so much more progress to make on this. And what kills me the most is the partisan gridlock on it. We need the Democratic Party to be bolder on this, but we need Republicans to come to the table, too, and actually figure out what we can get done about this. After Uvalde, many people said once again, like they said after Parkland, that nothing was going to change. But it did. And it's because Republicans and Democrats came together and said, all right, we understand that we can't necessarily give Democrats a huge political win or Republicans a huge political win, so we can't talk about the general talking points that they have and the policies that they support. So they actually invented a new one. Instead of raising the age to buy a gun to 21, they expanded background checks for people under the age of 21 for purchasing weapons like the AR-15. And it has made progress, but there's so much more we need to do, because nobody -- I know Republicans don't want this to continue either.",
