We talk about the mood of the country, 14 months out from a -- from a presidential election, not that great. Three in 10 Americans, that`s it, say things are going well in the country, 7 in 10 say things are going badly in the country. And 58% of Americans in this poll say that Joe Biden`s policies have actually worsened economic conditions in the country, only 24% say they`ve improved economic conditions. This is why we hear him talking about Bidenonics every day. He`s out and about in the country.",

We ask folksthough, do you think, are you seriously concerned that Biden`s age might negatively affect his ability to serve a full term? Three quarters of Americans are indeed seriously concerned. Three quarters of Americans don`t agree on anything, but there`s concern there. You see it here too seriously concerned about his current mental and physical competence being negatively impacted by his age and seriously concerned that his understanding of the next generation`s concerns are impacted 68% say that and that -- and the economy, as we talked about that is what is behind these numbers. Why Joe Biden is in a sort of dead heat margin of error race with nearly every Republican tested. Poppy noted that Nikki Haley is the exception to that. She`s running outside the margin of error. But look at this Trump margin of error race, no clear leader. DeSantis, Pence, Scott, Ramaswamy, Christie, they are all with no clear leader. And I just want to know guys, one other thing that is going to cause agita for the White House team is this motivation factor. Are you extremely motivated to vote in next year`s presidential election? Look at this, Republicans and Republican leaning independents, have a 10-point advantage over Democrats on that score.

Nice and neat. It was called the valley view golf club in Akron, Ohio. But in 2015, it shut down. And today a range of grasses and native flowers are driving a whole new course of action.

And because this was a golf course, we decided it was necessary to take a more active role. We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape. The next step was to establish a native cover of vegetation. And rather than plant trees. We decided to plant nuts. And over the course of a fall, our volunteers brought us a quarter million nuts. And over the course of two days, 600 volunteers showed up to plant, 120,000 of them. This is the Cuyahoga River, and we`re looking out over a vast restored flood plain. When we acquired the property, the banks of the river were steep. They`d been channelized, uh, the golf course, they wanted to keep the water out. We wanted to bring the water back into the landscape. One of the biggest challenges of any park district is preserving our natural resources.
