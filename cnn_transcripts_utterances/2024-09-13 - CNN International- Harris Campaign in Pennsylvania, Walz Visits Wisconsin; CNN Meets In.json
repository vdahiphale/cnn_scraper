And a stern warning to NATO from Moscow, what Vladimir Putin says could put the alliance on a collision course with Russia.And we begin this hour with a massive strike at Boeing. 33,000 unionized workers at the troubled plane maker have rejected a tentative deal. The new contract included pay raises of at least 25 percent it's worth noting, Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to America's economy at $79 billion. And the aircraft giant has suffered major problems in recent years, including two fatal crashes. CNN's Business and Politics Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich is following all of this, and she joins us now from New York. Good to see you this morning. The International Association of Machinists say the rejected deal is the best it's ever negotiated with Boeing. So why did union members turn it down?",

They voted down the deal, and 96 percent voted to go on strike, and that is exactly what we are seeing early this morning as thousands of Boeing union members are out on the picket lines. It's really hard to say what the single issue is. But listen to the President of the Union who spoke just last night after this historic union vote.OK. And we don't have that shot for you, but essentially, what he was saying is that they have to go back to the drawing board, because they don't really know what the main issue is. It could be a couple things that a lot of these union members feel like in previous contracts. They didn't get exactly what they wanted. They've been dealing with higher inflation. And Fred, if you remember, a lot of other unions and other industries, like the auto industry, really walked away with exceptional contracts, and they are looking at those unions saying, hey, wait a minute. Did we do as well as them? But as you mentioned, this is going to be potentially, if this strike drags on, a hit to the U.S. economy. This could affect suppliers. This will affect deliveries of planes to airlines. But I just want to caution people, this will not affect passengers of airlines right now. This is sort of what could happen down the line if you're flying on an airplane now, everything is all good. But as this strike drags on, it could affect the airlines in terms of getting the planes that they have ordered from Boeing.",

We know that the union also wanted a return to traditional pensions. They didn't get that. They got more in their 401K instead. And sort of a big issue that the union is very, very interested in. And what was offered is that if this deal was ratified, if it was a yes vote, they were going to get the next plane production in Washington state, and that would have been really important for job security for these workers. That's now up in the air, Fred, because that was contingent on this deal being a yes vote. It was a no vote so now they're going to have to work through that. Can they get that plane back in production to provide job security for these union members who are now on strike?",

But they see a lot of opportunity to build up support among undecided voters who are saying that they want to hear more about Kamala Harris, and they've already made their minds up about Donald Trump. So, the way that the campaign is going to try to capitalize on that is by doing everything they can to keep that good vibe, energy, enthusiasm going from the summer that has waned a little bit over the last 2.5 weeks, doing things like bringing Barack Obama back onto the trail, like there's talk about trying to get Taylor Swift and Beyonce to be doing concerts.

Because the Harris campaign looks at this, they know that there is going to be a strong and devoted turnout for Donald Trump. They need the voters to overwhelm that in enough of the state scattered 270 votes. One person saying to me, this is an unconventional campaign. You've got to do unconventional things.",

On the policy front, he unveiled a new proposal to get rid of taxes on overtime wages.And Russia says it's expelling six British diplomats, accusing them of spying. Moscow says it has detected what it calls signs of intelligence and subversive work. It hasn't provided any proof, and the announcement comes as London and the U.S. consider allowing Ukraine to strike targets deep inside Russia. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is now in Washington to discuss the issue with U.S. President Joe Biden. The Kremlin, meantime, says it's sending a clear message to the west. It's telling Ukraine's allies to think twice before letting Kyiv strike deeper inside Russia with Western made arms.

      "sentences": "Well, certainly I think it will factor in. Because, of course, President Biden, every time a new capability comes on the table when it comes to Ukraine, the first thing at the top of his mind is the potential for escalation with Russia, and certainly that's something he very much wants to avoid.And I think the revelation this week that Iran is providing Russia with its own ballistic missiles only lends some complications to this decision making, because, of course, the U.S. has this great fear in the Middle East that Iran could potentially target American troops and create a broader conflict there. So, you do see this connective tissue between these two conflicts. But the fact that this conversation is happening at all, I think gives you a good indication of how much pressure President Biden is under to ease some of these restrictions on the American and Western long-range missiles that have been provided to Ukraine. Currently, they're only allowed to be used within Ukraine's borders, but President Zelenskyy says that he needs to fire them deep into Russia to help his country win the war. And there has been a divide among American officials on this topic. On the one hand, you have people who are concerned about the risk for escalation. You also hear people who wonder about the effectiveness of this strategy. And you heard the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin give voice to this last week when he said that Russia has already moved some of its key targets outside of the range of these missiles, and also making the point that the supply of these weapons is not limitless. But on the other hand, you have members of Congress, including some senior Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee who say that fears of escalation are not necessarily founded, that the risk of escalation hasn't necessarily been borne out over the last two years, and that Ukraine needs this capability in order to win the war. And so, this will be a key topic of discussion when the president sits down with Keir Starmer later today. What American officials say is that he isn't planning to make any new announcements or decisions today, but certainly it will be a topic of discussion. They're tamping down on expectations that the president could allow the American attack on weapons to be fired deep into Russia, but he also has the option of allowing the UK and France who have their own long-range weapons to allow those missiles to be fired into Russia, and that's something that they will discuss today. Both of these men, President Biden and Keir Starmer, dispatched their top diplomats to Ukraine this week to hear directly from Volodymyr Zelenskyy about why this capability was necessary, and certainly those conversations will be reported back in the meeting at the White House later this afternoon.",

And this is what he says in his resignation letter, that he let himself down his own standards, that he let his subordinates down, that he let his commanders down and but in effect, let the country down. But his unit, the intelligence unit, 8200 had specialists around Gaza monitoring Hamas' activities, and it's been well documented over the past year that some of those intelligence operatives, low level intelligence operatives, were seeing activity by Hamas that concerned them, that looked like training and rehearsals for some kind of operation months before October 7th, and they passed that up the line, and nothing apparently happened about it. Well, the military's own internal investigation has been going on. It's come up with some preliminary findings. But I think that Sariel is announcing that he is stepping down will not shock and surprise people. There's been a lot of focus on politicians here, like the prime minister, who is also widely held in public opinion to be responsible for the failings of intelligence and readiness for Hamas' October 7th attack. That the military has decided to get on with its own investigation because it needs to learn now, because it's still in battle and fighting now, where the prime minister has pushed off an investigation that would more broadly bring in politicians like himself into the questions of, how did this happen?

It was a spear phishing operation conducted by Iranian hackers, according to U.S. officials, and they ultimately were able to infiltrate the Trump campaign's email account and obtain these private, sensitive campaign documents they then tried to leak via multiple news organizations that we haven't seen those documents surface publicly yet. But this is another reminder that the U.S. government is really grappling with this problem of foreign adversary -- adversaries trying to sow distrust and so discord within the United States and taking advantage of that polarizing political atmosphere that we are currently witnessing play a big role in the 2024 presidential election. And I want to be clear too, it's not just Russia. U.S. officials are constant -- or not just Iran U.S. officials are constantly reminding the public in this week's leading up to Election Day that Iran, Russia and even China are taking steps to try to do -- using various tactics to try to undermine our political system in the democratic process. Take a listen to what Mattew Olson. He's the top national security official at the Justice Department, what he said just yesterday about these foreign efforts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW OLSON, ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Our adversaries are actively seeking to covertly influence voters and to undermine our democracy authoritarian regimes. So, we're talking about Russia, Iran and China, primarily. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Iran has indicated through their actions that they may prefer Kamala Harris. But still, this foreign adversary role in our election process, regardless of your politics, is something that the Justice Department is really trying to stress is an apolitical issue. So, we'll continue to see them try to publicly warn Americans before they go to the voting booth that they -- foreign officers are trying to manipulate their decision-making process and to hopefully check their information to make sure they're getting it from credible sources, not from potentially malicious actors.",

You remember Roger Stone a long-time Republican operative. He's been a Trump ally for a long time, including his involvement in efforts to overturn the 2020 election.But Roger Stone appears to have been hacked himself. The hackers then used Roger Stone's personal email account to then try to target Trump campaign officials, and we don't know exactly who within the Trump campaign ultimately clicked what appears to be a malicious link and gave those hackers access to a trove of campaign documents. But that is something the FBI has been looking intently into, and has been briefing the Trump campaign and Trump himself on at every step of their investigation. And it seems, based on this announcement that our sources say is coming, they've collected enough evidence to know who is behind the hack and leak operation? And who was operating on behalf of the Iranian government?",
