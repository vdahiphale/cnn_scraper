Jim and Bianna, I think this is probably the biggest nationwide manifestation of public discontent that we've seen in China in a generation.

If you look at the large scale protests that has had a significant impact on China's leadership, I think Tiananmen in 1989 is the best example. The protest activity started in April and we didn't see the culmination of the effect until June, right? So, we still have a little bit of time to see how much this will spread.And as mentioned by Ivan earlier, what we're seeing right now is at least 16 different locations but we still don't have a sense of how large this is. It seems like each location is a couple of hundred people per location. And if it is spread out across the country, it is actually relatively not too difficult for China to clamp down if it is only a couple hundred per location. But if we start seeing thousands and tens of thousands in one location, I think particularly as it gets centered around Beijing, I think that would be much more of a challenge for the Chinese government to deal with.",

So, what we don't know is, for example, tonight, Monday night, or tomorrow, if this is going to continue to escalate if China will have been able to sort of toned this down a little bit.But what I would say even if we see more protests growing the next couple of days, we don't see the same political conditions that we saw in 1989, which was a very divided Chinese leadership, in which one leader could take the fall for this. Right now, we saw Xi Jinping consolidate power from the 20-party Congress. I don't see any potential major challengers to him right now. So, it could be possible that one of his deputies take the fall but I don't see Xi Jinping himself taking the fall for that.",

I mean, the fact is its COVID policy is failing really and they don't have the medical resources to handle it if more and more people get sick.

We're learning from some that it takes about 30 minutes to come in and out, maybe perhaps a little longer now.But Senator Warnock and Democrats have really put a heavy emphasis on this early voting. And I think it sort of speaks to a culture the Democrats in Georgia have fostered, essentially arguing, don't wait until December 6th, that is too late. That is what we heard from Senator Warnock on the trail this weekend at a number of events. Herschel Walker off the trail this weekend, he was not out, but he will be campaigning a lot this week in Dalton, Cumming and various other places outside of Atlanta. And though Walker was off the trail both of these campaigns on the air, the ad -- the airwaves just flooded with ads. We know that Senator Warnock has -- the campaign has spent $18 million to Herschel Walker's $6 million. The spending, of course, is only one measurement of a campaign strength.

      "sentences": "Yes. The president has a lot to get done as he returns to Washington now and prepares for this lame duck session of Congress before the Republicans take over the House of Representatives come January. He has got things in terms of policy priorities that wants to get done, but he also has to do some of these fundamental aspects of governing, like funding the government, for example. Government funding expires on December 16th. So, that is just a couple of weeks away.The president has requested $37 billion in funding for Ukraine, $10 billion of COVID funding and, of course, there is the broader government that needs to be funded as well. The president has also talked in recent days about wanting to try and push through an assault weapons ban. It is very clear at this point that the White House does not have those votes in the Senate in particular to get that done, but, nonetheless, something that the president is talking about. There is the national defense authorization bill, that annual authorization bill for defense spending and also questions about whether or not Democrats will try and get through a debt limit deal before Republicans take over the House. So, House Republicans, of course, have threatened to use that as a negotiating tactic next year. We are not expecting to hit the debt limit until later in 2023. So, that is an open question mark. The president also has several key events this week. He's hosting the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for the first state visit of President Biden's presidency so far. Tomorrow, before that, though, he's heading to Bay City, Michigan, where he's going to be hosting an event on touting the chips bill from earlier this year, that bill that invests in semiconductor chip manufacturing. He's highlighting their investments by a South Korean-based company in Michigan in a partnership with the state of Michigan. And then on Friday, the president bracing for the next jobs report to see where the direction of the economy is headed. So, a lot on the president's agenda this week, and, of course, these final crucial weeks before Republicans take over the House are going to be so important to determining the course of the next year.

You don't have notable names, like former President Trump, which may be a good thing, given what we've seen happen in the past there, or even the people like Governor DeSantis campaigning for his opponent, Herschel Walker.

So, Herschel Walker is not -- he is a political novice. He doesn't have a lot of political debts that he's incurred. And so nobody owes him, nobody has a reason to stick their neck out for him and he's in a very, very tough fight and has taken a real pounding in the last week.

That is the simple truth of the matter.There's nothing else to explain why no one, not former President Trump himself, nor any of the other so-called responsible leaders have opened their mouths to say that this is completely unacceptable. We do not want their votes. We do not want their participation in mainstream politics. They could easily do that and they have refused to do so. And then when you look at what the statements are coming back from the extremists, who are gratified by the silence, it tells you everything you need to know.
