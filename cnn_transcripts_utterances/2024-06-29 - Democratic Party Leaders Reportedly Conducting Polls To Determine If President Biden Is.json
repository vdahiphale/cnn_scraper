And right now President Biden is back on the campaign trail hoping to reenergize his election bid after what he acknowledged was a weak debate performance Thursday night. The president just touching down in East Hampton, New York, today. He's making several campaign stops on Long Island and in New Jersey as well today. But it comes as CNN has learned the Democratic Party leaders are conducting polls to determine if Biden is really the best candidate. The party is conducting new polls to determine if Biden will drag down candidates down ballot, especially in critical races in the House and Senate. CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us right now with the very latest on this. Arlette, what more are you learning about these efforts behind the scenes? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well Fred, we're learning that behind the scenes, Democrats are quite anxious relating to the president's debate performance on Thursday night. And it's prompting some a top Democrats to engage in some polling and research to see how much of an impact his performance would have, not just on his ticket, but also down ballot races as well. So in the coming days and weeks, Democrats are expected to conduct their own polling and research. Of course, there will also likely be news media polls sometimes as well to try to determine what the state of this race would be and what kind of further impact the president's remaining yet the top of the ticket would have on down ballot races when you think about the Senate, which Democrats are trying to control, the House, which Democrats want to try to win back, and other offices as well. But it really speaks to the awareness within the Democratic Party about trying to chart forward the next steps after that debate performance. One person said -- told CNN, a longtime adviser to the president said that the only way that the president would likely consider stepping aside is if he was really presented with serious data showing that he would not only potentially lose reelection himself, but also cause damage to the House or Senate, or other races as well. It's unclear how exactly this is all going to shake out when you think about the polling in the coming weeks. The Biden campaign, of course, has insisted that the president is remaining in the race, and they also believe that their message is one that will continue to resonate with voters going forward. So I think a lot of attention will be paid in Democratic circles to what this polling looks like as Democrats are trying to chart the path forward for the next four or five months of this campaign.",

The president was quite fiery and impassioned in his speech, not only acknowledging his own performance on the debate stage, but also in his attacks against Donald Trump. There were moments yesterday in North Carolina where the president was using lines that he had tried to use during the debate, but ones that had simply a fallen flat with his performance.And so his advisers have insisted that there are no plans for the president to drop out of this race. The advisers say he is still intent on debating Donald Trump in September when that next face off is currently scheduled to take place. And they have said that the conversations that they've been having with the presidents are about how to move forward on the campaign trail and deliver his message and convince voters of his ability to serve in a second term.",

But what sets this storm apart is just how early we are seeing this strong of a storm. Normally you don't get the second named storm until mid-July, July 17. The average first date of the first hurricane isn't until August 11. And this one, as you mentioned, is forecast to get to a major hurricane. We don't usually see our first major hurricane until September 1st. So very early in the season, and the main reason for that really comes down to those incredibly warm sea surface temperatures. The area were Beryl is located, the sea surface temperatures running about three to five degrees above average. I know that may not sound like that much, but it is enough for systems like this to be able to flourish and really intensify rather quickly. The other thing, too, is the location. It formed east of the Windward Islands. That's not very common early in the season, meaning May and June. Typically, they're more in the Gulf and the Caribbean, not necessarily this far east. Now, this storm is expected to become a hurricane later today, could be as early as the 5:00 update, perhaps, maybe the 8:00 update. Those would be the next subsequent updates that we get after 2:00 p.m. But the point is it is expected to increase as it continues to make its way towards the Windward Islands. Several watches and warnings already in place there, but it is forecast to get to a major hurricane late Sunday or early Monday. That means as it's reaching the Windward Islands. So those areas need to pay very close attention to this. From there, it's going to continue to make its way in towards the Caribbean Sea, so likely going to see at least a few more areas getting those watches and warnings as the system begins to progress westward. Also, too, looking at that wide swath of those tropical storm-force winds, you're looking at numerous islands in both the Windward and the Leeward Islands that are likely to have impacts from this. So again, remember, just even if you're not in the cone, you're still likely to have impacts from this particular storm. Also want to note, it's not the only thing were watching. We actually have two separate systems we're watching, one just behind Beryl. That having a pretty good chance of becoming something in about the next 48 hours or so. And this other system here that's located right along the Yucatan Peninsula, that could slide up into the Gulf of Mexico in the coming days. So a lot of things that we've got to keep an eye out here for. The next two names on the list, by the way, if they were to get named, is Chris followed by Debbie.",

That section was passed after the Enron case when they tried to destroy papers and evidence. Here, they're also talking about fraud. And they're talking about the fake electors being a fraud. And that is a paper case. That's a presentation of paper to Congress intended to obstruct what they were going to do on January 6th.So he's got a problem. This win is not a big win for him. It might be for some of the others to get their sentences reduced, because that charge may be let go, and so now they will be sentenced differently for the other charges they had.

In that particular case, what they talk about is that a defendant can challenge a warrant, that is the affidavit that the warrant is based on, on the idea that the police officers or whoever issued the affidavit in support either had a reckless disregard for the truth or actually lied. There is really no evidence to support that there was a reckless disregard for the truth. She's trying to bootstrap onto that that Corcoran, the attorney, was forced to testify and that the evidence that he gave was illegally obtained by the government.The problem is that there's a district court case that says that he had to furnish that evidence. There's a D.C. circuit case that says he had to give up that evidence. It is not her position to overturn that and say this D.C. circuit was wrong. [14:20:01] On top of which even if she thinks they're wrong, there's a good faith exception, and that is, if the affidavit was facially valid and the warrant was facially valid, then she can't, under the good faith exception, suppress that evidence. In addition to that, they're challenging what's known as the particularity clause. It's in the Fourth Amendment, that you must particularly state in the warrant the person or evidence to be seized, and the place to be searched. The place to be searched was the entirety of Mar-a-Lago, and the particularity clause doesn't require that you say exactly what document you want. You can say that there's a class of documents that you want, and that clearly stated in the warrant. So the particularity clause challenge really holds no water. It's like saying, I'm in there to grab any guns I can find. They don't have to say they know exactly which guns are in there. They don't have to stay exactly what drugs are in there. All they have to say is this is what they're looking for. And if they find those documents or those drugs or those guns, in the case of those type of warrants, they can seize them even if they don't know exactly what they are. These challenges should have been handled by way -- because the facts are known, should have been handled by way a briefing and she should have already ruled on this. There is no need for additional evidence. She, as always, is just stalling off the end result, which is a trial.",

Experts think this could be because the hot weather forces people inside into the air conditioning. And we're seeing this bump maybe a little bit earlier this year, than we've seen in previous seasons. We know that we've been dealing with a lot of hot weather. Typically that comes ahead of a bigger wave that we see in the fall and the winter of COVID, so we'll see if we see that this year as well.But the CDC tracks this through a couple of different metrics. One is emergency department visits. Another is hospitalizations, and another is deaths from COVID. Across all of those measures we are seeing bumps in the CDC data of between 15 and 25 percent in most recent weeks worth of data. But it's really important to put that into context. One way of doing that is to look at wastewater virus levels of the COVID virus across the U.S. And by that measure, the CDC says the levels of the virus are low nationally. They are rising fastest and the south and the west. But if you look at the graph over time, they're really coming off one of the lowest levels over the last couple years. So they are still low really relatively speaking. Where the virus is rising, the CDC has a map of about 38 states where it's rising or likely rising, and those are really all across the map. Now CDC's advisors met last week, and they record commended that everybody over age six months get an updated COVID vaccine this fall. The vaccines will be updated to more closely track with more recently circulating variants of the virus. CDC also recommends everybody get an updated flu shot this fall, everybody over six months. They point out that more than 75,000 people died from COVID in 2023, and about 45,000 people died from flu in the most recent season. And so these are serious viruses, and they say that getting a vaccine can help protect folks. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

Like I said, the Supreme Court just gave permission to every other sundown town in the country, like Grants Pass, to throw as many police and prosecutors as they want at poor people to try to put them in cages or try to displace them, invisiblize them, make them go away. But you can't punish homelessness away. If we could, we would have done it hundreds of years ago. This isn't the first time folks have tried. The only thing that solves homelessness is protecting access to decent, affordable housing.",

And so while the Supreme Court did make this terrible ruling, and it's a dog whistle that a lot of folks are going to here around the country and they're going to start making things worse. At least in Grants Pass, it's going back to the lower courts where there's still an injunction based on the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment, and where there are laws made by local policymakers protecting the rights of homeless people.
