The interview comes as Trump's campaign is working to reach potential first time voters who are less likely to engage in politics, through non-traditional media avenues. The former president also expected to hit the campaign trail Wednesday with what's being billed as an economy-focused speech in the crucial state of North Carolina. Paris has promised to put out details about her economic policies this week, as Republicans hammer away at the lack of details around her policy plan. Over the weekend, Republican V.P. Nominee J. D. Vance, taking on the role of a tack dog, sitting for interviews as Trump campaign aims to highlight Harris' decision so far not to take a lot of questions from the press. SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  I think that what it is two people, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who aren't comfortable in their own skin, because they aren't comfortable with their policy positions for the American people. And so they're name-calling instead of actually telling the American people how they're going to make their lives better. I think that's weird, Dana, but like, they can call me whatever they want to. (END VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES (on camera):  And, of course, there are a lot of questions as to why Donald Trump is sitting down for this interview with Elon Musk. I am told by sources on the campaign that this is part of their effort to reach out to those first time voters. They say that these kind of rallies, this kind of typical political engagement, is not something that the voters they want to reach might necessarily be tuned into. Instead, those voters are going to be focused on something like an interview with Elon Musk, or an interview with Aiden Ross, the streamer that he met with last week. That is why you're seeing Donald Trump do these kind of out-of-the-box interviews instead of being on the campaign trail. Now, a lot of allies say they'd rather see him out there on the campaign trail. We'll obviously see if this pays off as we get closer to November. Wolf?",

There's no clear leader on the question of who would better handle the issue you think is most important between Harris and Trump. And that's a pretty dramatic change from where Biden was on this very sensitive question just over a month ago. How significant is this? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, it's significant, Wolf, and like, at this point, it really speaks to the vibes and the energy that is coming off of the Harris campaign more than anything specific that she has proposed. And it's a difference that is apparent at her rallies, it's apparent in the way people are responding to her online. This is a very different campaign than it was three weeks ago, or three weeks in a day when Joe Biden was still the nominee. We'll see if it holds, not just over the course of the campaign, but as she gets into actual proposals for what she would do and how much they will differ from what Joe Biden has been doing the last three and a half years as she's been part of the administration.

Her campaign's website lacks an issues page. The media and the public have legitimate questions, and she should face them. This is a political necessity.So, what do you think?

And he's doing the same thing with the vice president's campaign now.And it is very clear that thousands of people are coming out of excitement to see a history-maker, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. And so Donald Trump can't help himself rather than -- I know Scott probably feels this way, rather than sticking to the campaign agenda of talking about issues. But it goes to something deeper that I don't actually think Donald Trump is campaigning because he's focused on the American public. He is, his campaign has a lot of ego in it, and that is why you see him losing it, literally losing it, making up false claims about A.I.- generated people.

Every day he's off of that track is a lost day. And so I'm sure Harris is more than happy to have a back and forth about crowd size. I'm sure they would love for him to keep doing this.But to win the election, he's got to speak to what people actually care about. He had this down against Biden. This is not a foreign concept to him. They had it down against Biden.

But there's nothing defensive about a guided missile submarine armed with Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles and anti-ship missiles. Those are purely offensive weapons meant to carry out an offensive strike.Now, for the U.S., this is a deterrent. It's a message to Iran and its proxies in the region that the U.S. has these sorts of capabilities, has these sorts of weapons in the region, and, of course, then, the ability to use them. The message is one of deterrence, but the U.S. and Israel are closely watching how and what Iran and its proxies choose to do with that warning from the submarine and the other forces the U.S. has in the region, that should Iran make that decision to escalate, should it choose to carry out a larger, wider scale attack, the U.S. has the ability to hit back and to hit back hard.

And so if that Iranian attack actually materializes, it could put into question this whole effort to try and really lobby a lot of international pressure to bring that pressure to bear, not only on Hamas, but also very squarely on the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. So, we will see whether that attack materializes, if it turns off the negotiators from actually meeting in Qatar or in Egypt on Thursday. But certainly, there are a lot of diplomatic efforts aimed at trying to get Iran to think about that ceasefire as a way of getting what it wanted out of this. Instead of carrying out that retaliatory strike, if they can claim responsibility in part at least for getting a ceasefire deal, then they could take that as a win. I think those are some of the conversations that are certainly happening in this region. But there's no question that if a significant Iranian attack happens, one that causes casualties, in particular in Israel. I think that will completely derail this hostage release and ceasefire negotiations. And certainly that will spell very bad news for this region, for the people of Gaza, and for the hostages who remain captive in Gaza. Wolf?",

So, we're seeing today evidence come forth of an aggressive effort apparently by Iran to try to influence the election or at least gain information about the candidates. And so this is kind of a wakeup call and all-hands-on-deck in terms of election security for the election officials and the national security folks within the Biden administration right now, Wolf.",

I mean, I think people need to be reminded that in 2020, Iran was actually the most aggressive in terms of the types of operations they were doing. They didn't have the blanket attacks that we saw Russia in 2016, but, you know, they sent letters to voters pretending that they were Proud Boys members and threatening them to vote in a different way. And so they've done things, they've gotten into systems.So, to me, this is very consistent, number one, and, number two, it's consistent also with Iran's focus on trying to undermine the U.S. electoral system and make voters question our election integrity.",

It's about the information environment around that, and trying to sow doubt in what you trust in consuming either on the news or other platforms in terms of what the election is about. So, there's a lot of that in terms of amplifying discord.Microsoft came out with a report last week indicating that Iranian actors had set up literally fake news sites, one conservative-leaning, one progressive-leaning, to try to convince Americans that there are actual news outlets that they're commenting on this. So, it's a lot about kind of trying to muddy the waters about what we know about our democracy and distract us from the actual voting and campaigning of it.",

The joy of the Paris Olympics might be over, but sadly, the controversy is not.Let's just remind you of how we got here because if you've not been following it, it is a bit complicated. Remember this, it was arguably the most iconic shot at the games for the first time ever, an all- Black podium in the sport of gymnastics, Brazil's gold medalist Rebecca Andrade being praised by the American athletes, Simone Biles and Jordan Chiles. But everything has changed a lot since then. Charles is no longer the bronze medalist. Instead, its Romania's Ana Barbosu, who initially thought she had won the bronze medal until the Americans appeal to the judges, a successful appeal resulted in Chiles score being adjusted and being promoted up into third place, hence, that iconic podium seen. Romania, that were furious and it sparked something of a diplomatic incident. The remaining prime minister promising to boycott the closing ceremony. But then the Romanians launched an appeal of their own, taking the case to the court of arbitration for sport and they won the medal back for Barbosu. The reason they were successful because apparently, the Americans had taken too long with their initial appeal. So, now, Jordan Chiles is devastated. She has removed herself safe from social media as she tries to cope with a crushing disappointment, but it's not the end of it. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee say they are going to appeal the appeal of the appeal, saying they firmly believe that their original appeal was done within the allocated amount of time and they now have the video evidence prove it. But it's not going to be easy. On Monday afternoon, USA Gymnastics said that the court of arbitration for sport told them that their rules don't allow for any reconsideration, even when new evidence is presented. So they are now considering another appeal to the Swiss federal tribunal. For now, the gymnastics floor routine bronze medal is in limbo. But everybody of course is hoping this can be resolved soon, but I'll leave you with this scene from Paris last week, American figure skaters finally being handed their disputed gold medals from the Winter Olympics two 2.5 years ago, Chiles and Barbosu can only hope that it doesn't take that long to sort it out. Wolf, we'll just have to wait and see. It's just hard to say right now whether a resolution is going to come in the next few days or the next few years.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is mainly based on population growth in particularly as you pointed out, population growth among older men.So this study takes the current rates as of 2022 and uses demographic projections to look out to 2050. And as you said, deaths from cancer among men worldwide are expected to nearly double by 2052, more than 10 million. You can see that's the red line here in this graph. Cases are expected to go up by 84 percent to 19 million among men worldwide. Now there are few reasons for this. They are also expected to increase more in lower-income countries. We also know they looked at men because men already have a higher rate of getting cancer and dying from cancer than women do. And that's for a few reasons. One is men are more likely to smoke and they drink alcohol. Also, they have jobs that expose them to carcinogens or cancer causing substances. They're also less likely to get cancer screenings. So, that's a reminder to remember to do that. Now in terms of the kinds of cancer they're looking at here, lung cancer is expected to continue to be the most common cancer both in terms of incidents and deaths. The largest increase in cases by 2050 is expected to be seen in mesothelioma, which is a cancer that's mainly associated with asbestos exposure. And then largest increase in cancer deaths is expected to be from prostate cancer. Now, the researchers are advocating that societies need to prepare for this by increasing their health care infrastructure and increasing access to health care. They also advocate for a universal health care coverage, so that people can access the care that they need. Then on a personal basis, Wolf, there are few things we can all do to reduce our cancer risk. Don't smoke, limit your alcohol intake, eat healthy, get exercise and protect yourself from the sun -- Wolf.",
