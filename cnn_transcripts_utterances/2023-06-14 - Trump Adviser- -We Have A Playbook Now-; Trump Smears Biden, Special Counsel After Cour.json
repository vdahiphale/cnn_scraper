      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, Donald Trump defies legal advice 101. The former president followed his arraignment with a lie filled speech. He also made a big admission about the classified documents at the center of the special counsel indictment.Plus, Mike Pence now says he cannot defend Trump's conduct, while Nikki Haley is trying to get her answer just right. She brands Trump's conduct as reckless, but then dangles a potential party. And the House speaker breaks a floor freeze by conceding more to hardliners, establishment Republicans say he'll soon run out of things to give away. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, Donald Trump celebrates his 77th birthday today back at his New Jersey golf club. But whether he considers this a gift depends on whom you ask and what you believe. Look at the front pages of today's major papers, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, every headline splashes the former president's arraignment on a one in big bold face type. The indictment is the political story of the moment. Trump followed his federal court appearance with a defiant speech to his team, the politics are clear and winning. What is also clear, Mr. Trump is not helping his lawyers every time he talks about the facts. Like this one, that might not be admissible in the potential courtroom with a fight with the special counsel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: I hadn't had a chance to go through all the boxes. It's a long tedious job, it takes a long time, which I was prepared to do, but I have a very busy life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They do not believe this is a good situation. We know the former president has complained about it. He does not want to be indicted. But they do feel like they understand better now after that last indictment, after Manhattan arraignment. How exactly to handle this and this impart is by taking control of the public narrative by playing this out in the court of public opinion.

They pointed me to that stop at the Riverside Cafe as part of this strategy. They knew that there was not going to be any cameras, any real images other than those sketches of Trump from the courthouse. So, they wanted to take control of the narrative by putting out these positive images on a day that is not a positive day, its federally charged.The other part of this that I am told, is just continuing to campaign for president. Last night, he had a fundraiser. I'm holding his hobnobbing with donors. He was asking them what they thought about the arrangement. At one point, he was asking how he looked on the television. He wants to continue to work with, continue to go to speeches. But Dana, I was with him in Georgia over the weekend. As these legal problems mount up, it is clear that it is consuming, and he spent a majority of his speeches talking about this. And there are questions, real questions about whether or not this is going to lead to some sort of Trump fatigue that if you can really carry on this kind of legal burden and run for president.",

One thing that Kristin said, and I've been hearing that as well, it's consuming him, but it's also consuming and flooding into this race. And that contributes to the Trump exhaustion.So, we know one thing in the short term, the arraignment was certainly better than an arraignment should be. He made the best, he made lemonade out of an arraignment day, let's (crosstalk) that. But reality is, we know that there's Trump fatigue out there. We know that many Republicans want to turn the page. So, this contributes to it. But clearly, he is trying to blend the courtroom to the campaign trail to make this all about him. But you wonder if that's what Republicans want to talk about. Many Republicans want to make this race about Joe Biden. They want to make this race about inflation, they want to win back the White House. So, nothing that has happened in the last a few days since we've learned about this arraignment. It's maybe helped Donald Trump, but it has not helped the effort of winning back the White House. So that is what is sort of an odds here. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes. Building off what you just said. I just talked to a Republican donor this morning, who is helping to recruit people in down ballot races and Senate in the House. And this person said that there's widespread concern that these candidates are not going to talk, be able to talk about the economy, about the border, about inflation. Instead, there's a lot of concern that Donald Trump is just going to suck up all the oxygen in a 2024 election and leave little room for what they actually want to campaign on.",

He didn't just kind of ignore it and then move on to taking Joe Biden to task on the economy. He talked about himself. And as much as he has that sort of public provider as much as the campaign is saying that they believe that this at least in the short term is a political win.Something that his former chief of staff, John Kelly said in The Washington Post, really drew our attention. I just want to read it. Here's what he said. He's scared s-less, figure it that out. This is the way he compensates for that. He gives people the appearance, he doesn't care by doing this. For the first time in his life, it looks like he's going to be held accountable. Up until this point in his life, it's like, I'm not going to pay you. Take me to court.

He's really trying to seize this as an opportunity to bolster his campaign profile. But internally, I mean, these are very serious charges. And it is not just these charges in federal court. It is not just the hush money payment accusations, New York. He has two more potential indictments coming in other criminal matters. I mean, these are very serious charges.And again, he can try to make some, you know, lemons out of lemonade, but the lemons are initially sour in the first place. He's not dealing with a very good situation at all. And just as a contrast, as he tries to talk about Biden and as Republicans want to try to focus more on Biden and the economy, this -- the White House, the president is kind of burying their heads in the sand, deliberately staying quiet about it. And I think for them, this creates a contrast that they actually like that they are doing their jobs, they aren't doing normalcy, and this is the chaos in the Republican Party.",

And that if he doesn't follow the rules that the judge is setting, he could face consequences. And some of those rules are about what he can say to other people. So, one of the things that Trump agreed to acknowledged as part of his release conditions yesterday, is that he is not allowed to discuss this case with any other witnesses that the Justice Department provides him on the list. So, they don't have that list yet. We don't know who exactly it is. It will include his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, this man who is traveling and working with him still. But there's a lot of people that are potential witnesses, in this case, who are around Trump on a daily basis. They are Secret Service protectees, there are people who work for his political operation, who are his aides traveling with him. And so, if he talks with them about the details of this case, before it goes to trial, where they might be called to testify, he could run into some real problems. The judge could have to deal with this. And one of the things that happens if you violate your bond in the system is the Justice Department can ask to detain you. Dana? BASH: OK, Katelyn, thank you so much for that. And joining me now is former Trump attorney Tim Parlatore. He's here with me at the table.

And so, during that phase, where he's negotiating with NARA, you know, that's nobody's talking about classified documents at that time. They're just talking about presidential records, what's personal was presidential.And then it's only when the Justice Department gets involved that they start talking about classified documents, and the Justice Department begins that with a criminal grand jury subpoena. And you know, whether you agree with it or not, whenever you come at somebody with that type of a process, you're essentially telling him, we're going to try and put you in jail. You hire criminal defense attorneys to get involved. And in his mind, I can picture there being an element of, you know, he had the Russia investigation, he had the two impeachments. And he's just looking at this, as you know, another witch hunt. And so that may inform why he would be more combative about it. But it also informs, you know, from my perspective, as an attorney, the manner in which DOJ approaches, the case is also how the attorneys handle it. So, in retrospect, I think it could have been handled differently from both sides. I think it had been a Office of the Director of National Intelligence, administrative investigator who made the approach and there was no threat of jail from the very first communication that might have changed things.",
