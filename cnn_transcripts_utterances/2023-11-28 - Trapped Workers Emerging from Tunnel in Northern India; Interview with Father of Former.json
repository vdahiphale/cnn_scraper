After more than two weeks, rescuers are bringing the trapped workers out from that Himalayan tunnel. You are looking, once again, at the exterior of that tunnel, where 41 trapped construction workers are now emerging. More than a dozen have come out of that tunnel so far, having been trapped for 17 days. Vedika Sud is in New Delhi for us. Vedika, as we were just discussing, an incredible breakthrough after 17 days of work, to get to these workers that were trapped inside that tunnel; 12 we believe now have been released. We know that we've got a few more to, go and it's just going to take a bit of time to get them out.",

But what a moment. Amid the applause, the, cheering and the tears, you see them being pulled out, one by one. And that through an evacuation pipe that was drilled into this passageway, that was full of debris and mangled metal and rocks. It has taken 17 days, 17 days of disappointments, of heartbreaks, of heavy machinery breaking down but it has culminated to this, a moment that families, friends, colleagues, of these laborers and, of course, the rescue teams, the government and most of the people across India have been praying for. You, know what I really found very heartening is this temple, right outside the tunnel, that we've been watching very closely over the last few days. Every day, there was a Hindu priest there, praying for the safety of these men, followed by family members and rescue teams who were praying there. And today that hard work, all the perseverance by the rescue teams and the officials involved, has culminated into this huge success and breakthrough. It has taken 17 days to get here, despite using all the machines, which are heavy drilling machines that broke down. The last two meters, finally, the last phase, the last lap had to be done manually, through drilling through men on the ground. And it is only after that that they reached out to these 41 men, who were slowly being extracted through a pipe, which is about three feet in width, about 50 meters long. They've been mounted on stretchers that were taken in about an hour ago. And they're being pulled out gently on wheels with a rope. It's like a pulley system that they're using and the officers on the ground have told CNN, we have to be very careful. These men have been through a lot of trauma of the last 17 days, we have to be gentle. The entire passageway, we're being told in that tunnel, has been lit up with lights, to make sure that these men don't get scared, they're not in fear and they feel more comfortable where they are being pulled out and extracted from the tunnel. The ambulances, dozens of them, whisk them away to make sure that they get immediate medical attention, both for their mental health condition as well as their physical condition. It is going to take a while, of course, to be certain how they're doing after this trauma. But of course, the physical health will be assessed immediately and that is the success story after 17 days. This is a Himalayan terrain that we are talking about, ecologically fragile. There was a landslide that caused this tunnel to partially collapse, closing, Julia, the only exit out of this tunnel. But today, you are seeing relieved faces of officials, rescue teams, of those laborers trapped in and of their families. You are seeing celebrations. We just saw sweets being distributed, Indian sweets, which in India, are called laddus. They were being distributed by the chief minister of the state, by others on the ground. Because this is a moment they've been waiting for. They want to cherish it. This is a moment where those 41 men are being brought back home and being whisked away, taken away from the debris, taken away from the tunnel and being taken away from uncertainty, Julia.",

From the second and third dates of when they managed to get through, at least partiallythrough this tunnel, and use megaphones to reach out to these men. I remember, we filed a story also of how the first video emerged from inside the tunnel, where you can see their faces through the pipe. And though, through the megaphone, the official said, don't worry, we will pull you out. It has been a couple of days since but they are out today. Food, water, mobile chargers, medicines, vitamin D, all of that was being pushed through, as well as oxygen through these pipelines to these men. And constantly, there was medical counseling that was continuing across the debris to these men. But of course, a physical assessment can only determine now, once they are all pulled, out how well they are physically. For me and for many, of course, around India and overseas and for the officials and for the doctors, the concern would be their mental health. This is 17 days of undoubted trauma they've been through. They've been holed up in a small area, 41 of them. And they've been assured that they will be pulled out. There has been uncertainty on the other end, which has ended only 17 days later. So of course, we do know, at least through the medical counselors and the medical experts that we've been speaking to over the last 17 days, that they're doing fine. They've got the medicines they need but only a physical assessment, I repeat, will now assert or determine how well they are. And it is all going take a lot of time to understand the trauma they've been through. So the mental health condition of these workers will take even longer to assess.",

Now the latest hostage prisoner exchange between Hamas and Israel could happen anytime now. Each side has received a list of names of those expected to be freed today, 10 more hostages held by Hamas and 30 more prisoners and detainees held by Israel. It is set to happen on the first day of a two-day truce extension, mediated by Qatar with assistance from Egypt. Now in the past hour, both sides reported clashes in northern Gaza and accused the other of violating the cease-fire. Hamas describes it as a, quote, \"field skirmish.\" It is not clear if it will have any impact on today's planned exchanges. Now Monday, joyous reunions as 32 Palestinian prisoners and 11 hostages were freed. Qatar's foreign ministry says extending the cease-fire beyond tomorrow is contingent on Israel's condition that Hamas release 10 additional hostages each day. Now for every hostage released, Israel must free three Palestinian prisoners. Israel's defense minister says the country's military will fight with a stronger force when it returns to combat against Hamas. While addressing troops Monday he indicated fighting could resume within days and so the operation will happen across all of Gaza. I want to talk more about the truce now and what could happen ahead. We have one of Israel's leading investigative reporters and a security and intelligence commentator for Ha'aretz. Great to have you on the show, sir. Can I start by talking to you about what we've seen as \"skirmishes,\" quote, according to Hamas in the north of Gaza already? Just from what you are hearing, what you understand, how much further do you believe this truce can hold? (AUDIO GAP)",

All right, for now, the father of one of the freed hostages over the weekend is describing how his daughter survived 50 days in Hamas captivity. Thomas Hand says 9-year-old Emily is coming out with details of what she went through, quote, \"little by little,\" since she was freed on Saturday. He says she had to run from house to house, as Israeli forces attacked Gaza and that she believed she had been held for a year. Hand has spoken with CNN throughout his ordeal and now he tells our Clarissa Ward about the emotional reunion he had been waiting for for more than seven weeks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS HAND, EMILY'S FATHER:  He said, they should be here in a couple of minutes, like, whoa, I can't believe it. And all of a sudden, the door opened up and she just ran. It was beautiful, just like in -- just like I imagined it, you know, running together. I squeezed. I probably squeezed too hard. And suddenly, when she stepped back a little, I could see her face was chiseled like mine. But before she left it was chubby, girly, young kid face. Yes, she's lost a lot of body weight and the color, I've never seen her so white. The other and the most shocking, disturbing part of meeting her was -- she was just whispering. I couldn't hear her. I had to put my ear on her lips, like this close, and say, \"What did you say?\" \"I thought you were kidnapped.\"",

      "sentences": "That's exactly so. Burns has been a CIA director, he's been integral to the Biden administration's efforts tonegotiate the release of hostages. Of course, they are not negotiating with Hamas directly. The talks have been mediated by Qatar. Sources tell our colleague, Alex Marquardt, that Burns has been joined in Qatar not only by a top Egyptian intelligence official but also Israel's -- Mossad's David Barnea, who's been the point person for Israel in the hostage negotiations. Burns has been in regular contact with Barnea and, of course, has been in and out of Doha over the past month, including as recently as earlier -- the first week of November, discussing what was then just a nascent agreement about releasing hostages in exchange for some kind of pause in the fighting. This meeting comes as, obviously, the Biden administration has just been successful in engineering the two day extension in the pause in fighting, with the expectation that Hamas will release an additional 10 hostages for each day in the pause. We expect, in the coming days, continued and incredibly sensitive conversations about the possibility of extending this pause even further. A key priority for the Biden administration is the release of American hostages, as you mentioned. In particular, two American women who were expected to be part of the original tranche of hostages that had been released over the past four days and ultimately did not exit Gaza. But as you say, this is the kind of context in which American presidents have traditionally deployed the CIA director to act as a shadow diplomat. Biden certainly has used Bill Burns heavily in this capacity, not only in Israel but also has routinely deployed him all around the globe. Burns has been a globe-trotting CIA director and has been used by the Biden administration pretty heavily as part of its Ukraine policy. So again, you have somebody here who is deeply experienced not only in the Middle East as a former diplomat but also deeply experienced as acting as a sort of behind the scenes shadow diplomat under the Obama administration as deputy secretary of state. He spearheaded secret talks with the Iranians that ultimately became the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Again, it speaks to the sensitivity of the mission and I believe the seriousness with which the Biden administration is taking this, that Bill Burns is the envoy that they have sent.",

There are more than 41 ambulances stationed there. There was a makeshift hospital inside the tunnel as well. We're now being told that all 41 have been extracted. The prime minister has also wished them well and said this was a very tough endeavor and a huge project they had to undertake. Celebrations across social media on the ground, across India. I was talking to you about a temple some time ago, a small temple, symbolic for Hindus in this area. There was a small temple stationed right outside this tunnel. I'm not sure if it was there before this project was inaugurated or after. But you had a Hindu priest there who is praying for their safety.
