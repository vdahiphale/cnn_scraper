To try and attract more workers in this critical time period, Foxconn went on this mass recruitment drive, promising higher pay, better bonuses. But this worker said that when new workers got to the plant, the pay package that they got was much worse than advertised and they felt cheated. Now, Foxconn, for its part, is blaming the payment issue on a, quote, technical error. Now, Poppy, this is an unusual, rare public display of dissent in authoritarian China.
