Immigration is Chief issue.The, you know, the poisoning of the blood comment, it was interesting when he addressed it the other night in Iowa, and he basically rebuffed the criticism that it's xenophobic, that it's racist, the comparisons the Biden campaign has been making to, to Nazi Germany. He's pushed back against all those. And I think the fact that he's pushing back against those comparisons is really what's helping voters kind of come on board with them. But I think it's important to remember that his anti-immigrant policies are the thing that helped drive a lot of people toward him in 2016. I don't think there's any reason to think that the electorate has changed that much.

But at the same time when Republican voters see this language, you know, Trump is attacking Democrats as vermin, they're going to view it as a positive.And that's one of the reasons someone like Tim Scott didn't do as well, because Republican voters want someone who is going to use this sort of aggressive language, not because I think, you know, they're all racist or, or believe these things on a deep level, because they take this language and, and think, OK, this guy is going to have really strict policies on these issues that we care a lot about it also, HILL: And also, given what we're seeing in Washington and what we're not seeing happen in Washington, right, when we're -- when we look at immigration, and how it's -- there's the attempt to tie it to all the other funding.

ButPresident Biden, when it comes to the border, he really is almost desperate for a deal. First of all, he knows that the border is an actual substance -- substantive problem and a political problem for him. But also, it is tied to that Ukraine funding that is the highest of priorities for his administration. But certainly, the compromises that the White House is willing to make is really concerning.

He talks about, you know, having one of the largest deportation campaigns in history. My colleagues have reported on some of the immigration plans, he would basically build on what he did in the White House, take it kind of a step further.I think voters feel that people like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, are essentially following Trump's path when they talk about what they want to do on immigration that he set the tone. He's the one that kind of outlined where they want to be in.

And then this is a big if, right? This, everything has to go right. Then she still in South Carolina to deal with. And when I was talking to sort of South Carolina folks and strategists, it was really interesting, because they all argued that she does have a path, even if it's narrow, and her path is based on momentum and other people dropping out of the race. And when I talked to Haley's team, that's also sort of their thinking and how they're going to ultimately be successful in South Carolina. They argue there's a lot of time left before that happens.

U.S. intelligence is now warning both the credibility and the influence of Hamas has only grown since the October 7th terror attacks in Israel. That report detailing just how some government agencies believe Hamas has positioned itself as the defender of the Palestinian cause and an effective fighter against Israel. One senior Administration official telling CNN that before October 7th, Hamas was not a wildly popular organization. But today it's more popular.(INAUDIBLE) analysis for Foreign Policy magazine echoes that sentiment Colin Clarke writing Hamas seems to be hoping that its ideology its cause and its brand will go global in much the same way the Islamic States did. Colin Clarke is with us now. He's the Director of Policy and Research at the Soufan Group, also the author of After The Caliphate, The Islamic State And The Future Of The Terrorist Diaspora. It's good to have you with us this morning. I think it's fascinating when we look at that, it's one thing right to support the Palestinian cause it is an entirely different thing to support a terror organization who has made very clear that their goal is to get rid of Israel and to kill all the Jews in the world. And yet, the support that we are seeing the growth of that support, specifically in Western countries is pretty remarkable. COLIN CLARKE, DIRECTORY OF POLICY &amp; RESEARCH, THE SOUFAN GROUP: You're right, I think that's the first clarifying point is it's totally different to support the Palestinian cause than it is to support Hamas, which is a designated foreign terrorist organization. However, when you look at some of the protests happening across the world, we have 100,000 people out in the streets of London, it takes a very small percentage of that larger crowd to become sympathetic to a group like Hamas, and then feel like protests just aren't enough and to move toward violence. And so, U.S. government's concerned about that radicalizing influence of a very small percentage, which could still translate into, you know, a half dozen attacks or attempts per year.
