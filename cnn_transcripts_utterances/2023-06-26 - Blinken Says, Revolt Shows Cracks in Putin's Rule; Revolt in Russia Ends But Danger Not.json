Released today, a video of Putin you see there, but we don't know when or where this video was shot and Putin makes no mention of the rebellion.Also unclear, the fate of the man who launched the insurrection, the Kremlin claims a deal was struck to drop criminal charges against Yevgeny Prigozhin, requiring him to leave the country and live in exile in Belarus. But Prigozhin has not confirmed the deal and has not been seen since Saturday night. CNN's Nic Robertson joins us from London tracking all of this, this morning. Nic, we are seeing Putin. We are not hearing from him. What can people read into that?",

Putin wants to be somewhat distanced from all the trouble that's happened over the weekend, that he wants to project an image that he is still there, that he is still in control. He has delegated, it appears, his prime minister today to speak about a challenge to the internal stability of the country, but moving forward, it's about the unity, it's about doing it together, it's about being united and, of course, casting up the question, was any of this at the behest of the western enemy's of Russia.So, Putin is, if you will, speaking from behind the scenes but is not sort of putting his face directly out there with a speech, because it was a negative image of what happened over the weekend, and it is damaging for him, and he doesn't want to be associated with that, which is part of the reason why he has pushed Prigozhin toward Belarus, and the attentions of Lukashenko, the president there.",

Because the narrative that he had that the war wasn't being fought well and that people were dying unnecessary had big support on the streets. We saw that when he left Rostov-on-Don. People were shaking his hand and thanking him and cheering his troops. So, there was a popular level of support for that.And over the past few months, Prigozhin had begun to feel that he was winning the support of some of Russia's generals. He had cited Surovikin, who is in charge in the war in Ukraine for a while. He's been the only general in Russia's military worth a star. He had appointed a deputy defense ministry who'd quit the Kremlin and joined Prigozhin's ranks. So, he was feeling on something of a high with the military as well maybe conflated these two. I spoke to a contact in Moscow who said, look, he went too soon and the system was not ready. So, when Surovikin and, more importantly, Kadyrov, who had also spoken positively about Wagner, came out and criticized him on Saturday, he knew he didn't have that big military support and he had no option. He had to turn around. And he said he was saving blood of Russians, but he was saving his own neck, he cut a deal.",

But why didn't the forces take action? So, that means either they couldn't, they were incapable in some fashion, or maybe they supported Prigozhin. That's a possibility. Or maybe Putin didn't want the fighting outside of Moscow. Let's say they got very, very, which they did, close to Moscow. Can you imagine a firefight outside of Moscow with Russians shooting at each other? It did happen in the south. But if it happened in Moscow, it would be embarrassing and doesn't cover it, but it would look like a disaster. So, I think maybe those three factors would (INAUDIBLE).

That presumably is going to dry up, because, theoretically, his forces are going to move into the regular military.But what happens to him? I mean, I do think it is entirely possible that he could be killed anytime, whether now wherever he is, or in Belarus. But I think that Putin kind of has to watch his back too, Sara, because not necessarily that people will kill him at this point, but I think the elites, the power elites, the security services are looking at Putin and saying, what is going on here?

Then I think you have internal fighting, to put it mildly, among the people who would love to be in charge or who will hitch their star to the next guy who's going to be in charge. I think it's going to be very unstable, and I think the people whowant power are pretty ruthless. So, we're in for a tough ride.",

We do expect in the aftermath of that Alabama seat that that will very likely could be filled, a Democrat could fill in the aftermath of that Alabama ruling, adding one more Democrat to the delegation in Alabama. Here in Louisiana, that is the expectation as well. Currently, there's one Democrat in that House delegation. We expect that as a result of this ruling, it could lead to another Democrat.And this is significant over in the overall fight for control of the House. Remember, this is a very narrowly divided House, between the Republicans who have control and Democrats who are in the minority. Democrats need to pick up five seats, net five seats, in order to get back to the House majority in 2024. If it does turn out that these two seats can now go to the Democratic column, that, of course, narrows the majority even further. Now, that doesn't mean that it's certain to flip to the Democrats come 2024. There are other cases and other states involving redistricting issues that actually do favor the GOP, like in North Carolina. And there's also a big question about New York, which was significant for flipping the Republican control of the House in the last election. What will they do if they redraw the maps in New York?

He called this a moving picture. He said he believes that we haven't seen the final act yet.And that is really significant because U.S. officials are really tracking what happens next here. But they were wary over the weekend to give any sort of assessment as this was all unfolding. And the secretary of state on Sunday, when he was the first U.S. official to go on the record and respond to everything that we were seeing, said very clearly this is an internal matter for Russia, trying to disassociate the United States from being involved in any way, shape or form.
