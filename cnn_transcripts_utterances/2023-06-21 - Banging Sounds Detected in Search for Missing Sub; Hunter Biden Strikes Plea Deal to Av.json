That is according to an internal U.S. memo -- a government memo, I should say.Now, the U.S. Coast Guard confirming that a Canadian surveillance plane detected noises underwater. Right now, they are racing to find out where those banging sounds are coming from. But, as you know, time is quickly running out. It is estimated that passengers have maybe 24 hours of breathable air left if the submersible is intact. CNN Senior National Correspondent Miguel Marquez is in St. John's, in Newfoundland, live actually in front of a Coast Guard boat that is on standby to go out and help. The big news, the banging, what are we learning about the source, potentially, of the banging sounds?",

And we are going to keep the camera on that because they fired up the engines a short time ago, they pulled the ropes up, they're pulling them up right now. So, it is about to head out there. That's been on standby, one of two Canadian Coast Guard ships on standby.We were at the Horizon Arctic ship that left overnight. It is about two hours out now. So, there is an all-out scramble to get to this location, to try to figure out where the sounds were coming from, specifically those sounds, over a four-hour period yesterday, they were able to pick up banging, every half hour or so. It is still not clear where it was coming from. After that, they heard other sounds but did not sound like banging, they said. One concerning note is that they had to then move surface resource ships to the area where they are trying to co-locate or zero in on where that banging was coming from, meaning they were possibly searching in the wrong place or have the ships in the wrong place to figure out where the banging was coming from. It is still unclear what the banging was, but all on the U.S. side, the Canadian side, from the air and on the surface, every entity is now in a desperate search. Because if they are alive, they only have about maybe 24 hours left of air. If they have lost power, is it extremely cold down there? And it is not clear that they would have enough food and water to survive over four days, as well, just a miserable situation. And there is still hope that they can find these people alive.

He got through the Senate, by the way, with support of both of Delaware's Democratic Party U.S. senators.And then when Joe Biden took over in 2021, usually, a president gets rid of all the U.S. attorneys or they resign. He left David Weiss in place because of this case. He didn't want there to be any appearance of impropriety. David Weiss got a letter from Jim Jordan saying, we want your testimony, and David Weiss fired back. And he said, no, thank you, I respectfully decline. And he made a point of saying, I've been granted ultimate authority over this matter, including responsibility for deciding where, when and whether to file charges. What David Weiss is saying is, this was my decision, not Merrick Garland's, not the brass at DOJ. The timeline is so important here, Victor. Like we said, this started five years ago in 2018, 2021, two and change years later, Biden comes in and he leaves Weiss in office. But the thing I want to point out here is DOJ under the Trump administration, under a Republican administration, had two-plus years where they did not bring any charges, they did not bring any more serious charges than Hunter Biden has now seen.

In fact, my colleague across the aisle, Ro Khanna from California, and I have done several pieces of legislation, some of which has been signed into law by President Biden. And on Oversight Committee, cybersecurity is a place where we've actually had folks on both sides of the aisle be able to find some agreement where you can get the squad and the Freedom Caucus together. You know, it's a good issue.But look, I mean, we want to make sure that our country, that our defenses are ahead of China and Russia and other adversaries. We don't want to hit pause on technology innovation and development here. We want to make sure that we're protecting consumer data, government data and also headed into 2024. I think we want to make sure that information that people know the source of their information, that they know that if this video has been manipulated or not. I mean, there's just a lot of things that we need to address very quickly, sooner rather than later. Which is why you're seeing me on Oversight tackle A.I. and cybersecurity absolutely whenever we can.",
