It was kind of what made Trump rise when he came down the escalator in 2015.They can't get 218 votes for their own border security proposals in the House Republican majority at this point in time, so they can't move anything. The idea of some type of comprehensive bill is completely a nonstarter. And it just feeds into the -- I'm trying to figure out where this actually goes. You watched this week and what we've seen on the House floor and what we've seen just writ large on politics, on policy, I don't understand where we are other than this is just going to be a political issue that people want to use in campaign after campaign after campaign. CHALIAN:  Yeah. I think you've just identified at the end there precisely where we are. Obviously, if there were some larger solution available I would imagine folks would have found it over the course of the last 10 years since the last bipartisan immigration reform proposal fell apart. And you then saw obviously, President Obama did some executive work in this space. You've noted, Poppy, Donald Trump with his perspective in policy preferences made this admission, though his Republican opponents are clearly going after him for not following through on all the promises as it relates to the construction of the border wall. And now you're seeing the Biden administration take some action, too. I don't think some big, grand congressional proposal, Phil, is probably on the horizon.",
