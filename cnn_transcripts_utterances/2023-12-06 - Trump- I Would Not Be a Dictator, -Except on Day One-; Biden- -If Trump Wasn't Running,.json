I feel like one of the lessons I covered every single day of the Trump administration for Capitol Hill, one of the lessons that we struggled to learn and covering him was to dismiss some of the things he said, a lot of Republicans repeatedly say, oh, you know, it's going to be fine, it's going to be fine, and then, of course, this term was capped by January 6.

And what we've learned from a first Trump administration is to take him seriously. That what he says on the campaign trail, he is going to do in the Oval Office. I mean, he's been pretty -- he's pretty clear in 2016 about what he would do, and some voters were surprised when he took office, and there is no reason to think that he's being disingenuous here.",

His rollout video was very much about a counter to events in the Trump administration.

So, this is somewhat in line for that. And it's just the -- the confluence of events here that have led Biden to the White House. I've talked to former Democratic aides, to both Biden and his late son Beau, who said if Beau were still alive, he would probably be running for president and Biden would be supporting him. To me, this is very much in line just the circumstance that has brought Biden to the White House. HUNT:  Yeah. Let's also broaden out the conversation, too, because part of it is if Donald Trump were elected to a second term, and I think the Biden team knows this as well. He's already had four years of figuring out how to pull the levers of power inside the government, that's knowledge and expertise he didn't have when he started on day one in his first. This man Kash Patel -- his face is likely not terribly familiar to viewers, but he is somebody who served in Donald Trump's administration, he also had previously served on Capitol Hill, in the Intelligence Committee. He became someone who was kind of embedded inside these efforts that Donald Trump had late in his term to remain in office. He made some comments the honestly raised some eyebrows just yesterday.

So, in terms of timing, we would want to hear something around the end of January, and it can take up to a year, a year and a half to get a verdict, but these things are very unpredictable, Kasie, especially with such a notable individual, somebody who is the highest priority for the U.S. The return of him and Paul Whelan, they've said that.
