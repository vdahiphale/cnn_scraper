      "sentences": "Well, Sara Vice President Kamala Harris will meet a little bit later this afternoon with Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz, who also notably is one of Netanyahu's lead political rival in Israel. Now, typically in these types of meetings, the ambassador, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S., might participate in these talks, but our colleague, Alex Marquardt, is reporting that Netanyahu's office has instructed the Israeli ambassador not to participate in any of these meetings that Benny Gantz will be having here in Washington this week, a sign of disapproval from Netanyahu about Gantz's visit to Washington.Now, Gantz is scheduled to meet with Vice President Harris, also National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and tomorrow he will have a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It comes as the U.S. has really been prodding Israel to take more action, to get humanitarian aid into Gaza. That is something that Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about very bluntly just yesterday when she said that Israel needs to do everything they can to get additional aid into that region. She noted that people are starving there, that people are facing inhumane conditions. It comes as President Biden has also said that Israel needs to open more routes, get more aid trucks into Gaza as people continue to suffer there. But Harris also very forcefully spoke about the need for there to be an immediate ceasefire. Now, when she's talking about that, she's talking about it in temporary terms. The U.S. has been pushing for a six-week ceasefire to get hostages out and get more humanitarian aid in. Harris very forcefully, perhaps the most forcefully in recent weeks of administration officials, made that case yesterday in a speech in Alabama, saying that Hamas needs to agree to this deal that's on the table now. SIDNER: Arlette Saenz, thank you so much. We're looking at the video of that airdrop of aid that turned deadly at some point with people desperate to get the aid. We will be waiting to see what happens in this meeting with Benny Gantz and Vice President Kamala Harris. I'm sure you will get all the details for us. John.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, two things. And sometimes they get conflated. There's the one thing about Hamas and Israel coming to terms, particularly about release of Israeli hostages and -- in exchange for prisoners that Hamas is demanding.But there is the immediate need for a ceasefire that has nothing to do ultimately with the outcome of the war. It has to do with an immediate humanitarian crisis, famine, starvation, hundreds of thousands of people. Some are dying. And every aid organization says there's absolutely no way to deliver aid and distribute it at the level needed without a ceasefire. And withholding aid from hungry, starving people is a war crime. And so the U.S. is obligated, at -- particularly if it doesn't want to be complicit in what is ultimately a war crime, to end -- to come to terms to make sure there is a ceasefire and a humanitarian delivery. This doesn't mean that that's going to solve the problem, but this is an urgent need and it shouldn't be conflated with the need for Israel and Hamas to come to terms in some way about the course of the war, the ending of the war.",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, in just about an hour for now there's going to be something that's called a rule 11 hearing. And typically during this type of hearing, it's when a defendant can change his or her plea. And in this case, we're expecting Teixeira to share his not guilty plea to guilty. I mean apparently what's happening here, his attorneys are seeing thewriting on the wall. I mean he's looking at a great number of years behind bars if convicted on all counts. He's facing six counts of willful retention and transmission of classified information. And if he had been convicted on all six of those counts, he would have been looking at 60 years behind bars. Add that to the overwhelming amount of evidence that he was facing. Prosecutors alleging that he accessed -- repeatedly accessed classified information and shared it on that online chat room called Discord where a lot of gamers conduct their business, shared information about the war in Ukraine, including troop movements, also including information about equipment. And then prosecutors also say that at one point when he suspects that - that investigators were on to him, then he tried to cover it up, that he destroyed a laptop, that he destroyed a tablet, got a new phone and then told the people that he was conversing with on Discord, hey, if anyone contacts you about what I was saying, don't talk to them and delete all of the messages. So, there was a lot of evidence that they were facing. And so, since his attorneys were looking at all that, reasonably, they say, OK, let's enter a plea of guilty with the hope of getting some sort of reduced sentence. So, that's what we're trying to see, what will happen during this hearing that's about to get underway just about an hour from now. We'll get some more details about whether or not there was a plea agreement, whether or not there's going to be some sort of reduced sentence. These are some of the outstanding questions that we're waiting to get answers to. Sara.",
