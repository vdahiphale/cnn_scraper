Live from CNN Center, this is CNN NEWSROOM with John Vause. Wherever you are around the world, thank you for joining us here for CNN NEWSROOM. We begin this hour with a major disappointment for Ukraine and hopes for joining NATO. The 31 leaders from the military alliance are meeting for a second and final day in Lithuania. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was greeted by cheering crowds on Tuesday. He arrived, hoping the summit would see agreement on a specific timeline for Ukrainian membership, arguing it would strengthen both Ukraine and NATO.

And basically, in addition to being an airport that they occasionally would use for civilian flights, they also use them for missile launches.And Kim Jong Un can get there very easily from his palace and he can observe the early morning launch and watch this big rocket go up and they take all the video and then they release it as a big news bulletin, maybe 24 hours later, sometimes sooner. This missile followed a pretty typical trajectory for these ICBM's from North Korea. You know, they've been talking about firing an ICBM at a regular trajectory which would actually have it kind of crossing over possible continents. I mean large numbers of potential countries could have a North Korean missile flying overhead if they were to launch one of these ICBM's at a normal trajectory, but. They did a lofted trajectory which basically sends it very far up in the space and back down, only traveling total ground distance about 1000 kilometers. That is less provocative for sure. It follows the pattern that North Korea has used for previous missile launches. And it comes at a time, Laura, that there has been a real uptick in tension on the Korean Peninsula. I mean, it was just this week that the sister of Kim Jong- un, the North Korean leader, put out a statement warning that they would shoot down American military reconnaissance planes that had been operating in the area. North Korea accused those planes of crossing into their --not their airspace, but sort of like an economic zone that they control, you know, near the -- near the North Korean coast. And the U.S. denies this. There is no evidence offered on the North Korean side. But they are basically, you know, sending out warnings and this ICBM launch is certainly intended to be that for the United States, because that missile well within range of pretty much every major city there, Laura.

And this is the main point. If you want to initiate constitutional -- fundamental constitutional changes, you need to do it with -- in a broad consensus. This is what the Prime Minister promised President Herzog. He actually spoke to other leaders, including President Biden, and explain to them that he will initiate it with broad consensus. And the facto, they're pushing through a very radical reform with a very narrow majority. And This is why so many Israelis are so concerned.

Now, the problem with this change is threefold. Number one, the process. Constitutional changes should be initiated with a broad consensus and not in this manner. Number two, the substance of this specific chapter, which is the designed to remove oversight of the government -- sorry, of the supreme court over administrative decisions of the government basically to turn all ministers into all powerful ministers with no oversight on capricious or arbitrary aspects of their decision making. And number three, it's part of a grand package. And the government quite clearly states that after this phase will be passed, they plan to bring in the other chapters. So, it's a threefold problem.
