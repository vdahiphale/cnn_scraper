I'm John Vause in Atlanta with our continuing coverage of Israel's war with Hamas.And the Israeli prime minister has set out in stark detail the second stage of Israel's war with Hamas, which has two main objectives, he says -- destroy the enemy, and free the hostages. It's been a day and a night of relentless Israeli shelling. Israel says Hamas tunnels have been targeted as well as underground combat zones, all the while Israeli ground forces are expanding their operations inside Gaza. During a nationally televised news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced this new phase of the war and what he says will be the endgame. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Our heroic fighters have one goal: to destroy this enemy, and to make sure that the existence in our country, never again --never again is now.

And a fresh call for Gazans to move south, of the impending operation.So, what's your take on what's happening right now as far as these ground operations by the Israelis, and what's your expectation here on timing for a full invasion, and if Israel wants to expand on Hamas infrastructure and destroy leadership, how much territory do they need to hold?",

But operations like this would, if it is launched with the intent to finish the job, move in and sees key terrain. Whatever that is it might be a power plant, it might be a pause under which the tunnels come together. We don't know that here at this point. But they would then expand outward, close off an area and completely clear it. Now, how that -- how they deal with the people there, that's a problem and so they've got to take it step-by-step, and you've got to try to encourage the Gazans to leave northern Gaza. That is what they are trying to do. Get out of the way and let them deal with the tunnels, and the Hamas people. And then, from there, they might expand it further.

From the United States perspective, we're concerned about the prospect of a wider regional conflict.

They're required not to even hit a military target if civilian consequences will be disproportionate. And that seems to be happening time and time again as they destroy these huge apartment buildings, because an ostensible Hamas presence.Now, with respect to this broad call for humanitarian pause, which not even the Biden administration is finally belatedly joined, you know, what's needed there is it's not enough for this little trickle of aid to come across the border from Egypt, a tiny percentage of the trucks that usually come into Gaza to meet the needs of 2.2 million people. But how does a good distributed, when there is bombing taking place all around? You know, we've already seeing many humanitarian workers killed. Today, they don't even have communications.

So, now the Israeli government love to say, well, what Hamas did using human shields. Yes, of course, that sometimes happens. But that does not relieve the Israeli government, in the case of each and every attack, to ensure that they are not firing indiscriminately into civilian area, or that if even if there is a military target somewhere in there, that they are not having a disproportionate impact on civilians. Just given the numbers of this stage, 7,700 dead, or into the Gazan health ministry, entire neighborhoods flattened.

You've even seen some people say, oh, these are all just a bunch of human animals. Like the defense minister said in Israel. Or oh, they voted for Hamas 16 years ago, they deserve what they're getting. That is just wrong. Humanitarian law doesn't look at your political views. It doesn't look to how you voted. It just looks to whether, you know, did you join an armed force, carrying a arms, otherwise you are protected civilian in this effort to punish all of Gaza because of what Hamas is doing, not only to Israel, but frankly it's military dictatorship even within Gaza, that is wrong.

Everyone is really looking to see how much worse things get. You just heard Nick there speak about the situation on the ground. Remember that even before that ground operation got underway on Friday, there had been so little aid delivered into Gaza. That there was a question of course of hunger, thirst, medical supplies lacking, fuel, not having entered the enclave at all since this conflict began. What the U.N. agencies are saying now is that they only have a few more days of operability left before they have to leave the Gaza Strip. Now, at the heart of everyone's attention, of course, is also what's happening over at the Rafah crossing in the southern part of Gaza into Egypt. For now, authorities have not organized things. In other words, it's a very complicated situation. It is the acquiescence of the Israelis' agreement between Hamas and Egyptians that this particular point can be opened. This crossing can be opened. Things have not been organized in a way that the U.N. has been calling for so that more aid trucks can get in. But of course, crucially, what's also happened is that the civilian simply can't get out.

We are very concerned and worried, but I'm not a military strategist, and I'm not a decision-maker, I want to believe that what was communicated to us earlier today was by the prime minister, the minister of defense, is that it is indeed a primary objective of the state of the Israel to ensure that the hostages are returned safely to their loved ones.There is obviously an issue of trust between the Israeli population and the leadership because of what happened on that tragic day on October 7th. But I want to believe that the leadership is doing what is expected of them to ensure the hostages are returned, either through negotiations or through other means.",

We know that we are dealing with an irrational actor, like Hamas. We know that not all the hostages are held by the Hamas, but by other accomplices, like the Palestinian Islamic jihad.So I think when dealing with irrational actors, or who took hostage the entire population of Gaza, in my opinion, by going through that massacre on October 7th. It is hard to really hope for the best. War is a dreadful thing, and it's -- and seeing what is going on the ground now, is definitely worrying us.

From that day, October 7th, I myself am based in New York, I just moved here six weeks, ago I was with my family on September 7th last. So, one month before the attack.And that day, that's when most of the rollercoaster started, from worry sick about my friends and family back home, knowing that we lost contact with my sister, and my brother in law, Omri, and our two baby nieces. -- after about eight hours of my sister and baby nieces were, safe and were rescued. And knowing that Omri was taken hostage. Since then, it's been, it's been probably the most difficult time I've had, and I mean, when the most difficult times for our family, the trauma that will stay with us for the rest of our lives. But, we are shake every day by our efforts, and they give us strength, by the ability to speak to the, public and give voice for Murray and many others, who were taken, and when we are alone, and we are with our thoughts. When you are alone with your thoughts, you tend I think, the average person, the average human being tends to think of the worst at times. So it is difficult, but I have to keep being hopeful, that Omri will return, and I will be reunited with my sister, and with my two baby nieces. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with, you speaking with you. So, I want to send a message of hope, and a call for anybody involved, that they have to keep the hostages at the top of their agenda, whether they are policymakers in Israel, or policymakers worldwide. It will be irresponsible, and for anybody not putting that at the top of their agenda.",
