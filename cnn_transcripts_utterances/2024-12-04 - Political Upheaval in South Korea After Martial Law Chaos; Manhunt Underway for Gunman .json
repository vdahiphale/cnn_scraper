They want Yoon Suk-yeol to resign. Massive crowds in Seoul holding candlelight vigils and a march to the presidential residence today. Mr. Yoon has seen some swift, high level resignations over this crisis, including his defense minister and chief of staff. The country's allies are following the crisis with concern. The U.S. secretary of state in Brussels today, saying the United States is watching the situation very closely. Antony Blinken, though, expressing confidence in what he calls South Korea's democratic resilience. CNN's Mike Valerio is in Seoul now with the very latest.

At this point, Erica, based on all of our reporting, it does not seem as though the president of South Korea is going to resign. But people are hopeful that at least we have passed the acute phase of this crisis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VALERIO (voice-over):  Soldiers clashing with citizens in a shocking scene outside of South Korea's parliament. As crowds chant dismiss the martial law after the country's president declared nationwide military rule the first time since 1980 in an unusual late night TV address. YOON SUK-YEOL, PRESIDENT OF SOUTH KOREA (through translator):  I declare emergency martial law to defend the Republic of Korea from the danger of North Korean Communist forces. VALERIO (voice-over):  All this in response to a number of actions by the opposition, including rejecting a budget bill and attempts to impeach officials from Yoon's administration. Yoon Suk-yeol said the moves were intended to, quote, \"incite rebellion\" and accused opposition lawmakers of trying to destabilize the country. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  This decision is a crime. Is this someone who we will let run this country? No. Will we let this slide? No. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  It doesn't make sense. As far as I know, this is the first martial law declared since the Gwangju Democratization movement. It is really happening in the 21st century.

But, Erica, here in Seoul, a lot of analysts who we're speaking to and hearing from, who are diagnosing this crisis, are saying that North Korea may do nothing. North Korea may just stay on the sidelines here and use what has happened as propaganda for its own citizens, paraphrasing what they would say. Essentially that we are the less dramatic nation here on the Korean Peninsula -- which sounds crazy but that's where we are in 2024. They may do nothing because, to have some sort of provocation could play into the South Korean president's hands. He used North Korean influence and provocations as possible justifications for what he did yesterday. So North Korea may want to stay silent. Erica, and just say, you know what?

Making his way to the company's annual investor conference. That alleged gunman still at large as the manhunt for him -- and this continues in that investigation, of course, just getting underway. We will bring you more developments as we have them. I want to turn our attention now to France, where the potential political chaos is what we're waiting to see how this unfolds and develop. Lawmakers set to vote on that no confidence motion against the prime minister. They're examining the motion. It was sparked on Monday when Michel Barnier attempted to pass part of his government's budget, which includes billions in tax hikes and spending cuts. He tried to push it through using a controversial clause allowing him to bypass a parliamentary vote. That did not go over well, to put it mildly. CNN's Jim Bittermann, following these developments for us from Paris. He has not been in power very long, Jim, important to point out, only since September. And now here we are. Just remind us how we got to this point, if you would. JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTL. CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's kind of a backfire for President Macron. Basically he was kind of too, too clever by half here because, early in the summer, he decided he wanted to strengthen his hand with the parliament by calling snap elections. And that really did surprise a lot of people in the parliament but not so much that it changed the votes. In fact, one of the things it did was gave President Macron a worse hand in parliament. And it gave him gave him a deadlocked parliament with about one third extreme right, one third extreme left and about one third of the members of the parliament in the center. So that has now led to the point where Michel Barnier, the prime minister, that Macron finally named in September, basically was trying to put together one of his biggest obligations, which is a budget for next year. He worked on that. He negotiated with the various parties involved but to absolutely no avail. In fact, he accused, in an interview last night he accused the far right party of Marine Le Pen, of, in fact, political blackmail. Here's the way he said it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHEL BARNIER, FRENCH PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  She tried to get into a kind of one-upsmanship, telling me it's either the non indexation of pensions or it's medicines. I came to an agreement with the teams to assess medicines. And when I told her that, she said, well, pensions, too. I don't want to get into blackmail. That's not my state of mind. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One's fromthe extreme right, one's from the extreme left. They're going to debate that for a few hours here. And along about 7:00 local time, in fact, they're thinking that they will probably begin voting. At that stage of the game, it will be anybody's guess how the voting turns out, except that, in the advanced talk with the various representatives in parliament, it seems almost inevitable that Michel Barnier will lose his job. Because he will need to have 288 votes to override the motion of censure, which is before the parliament -- either one of the motions. And at the moment it does not appear he'll be anywhere close to that -- Erica.",

And those are some of the questions that police are still trying to answer, aside from the fact that they're still trying to locate this suspect. But what we know from sources right now, at this stage in the investigation, of course, very preliminary, is that the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, was headed to this midtown Manhattan hotel, the Hilton, for a conference for UnitedHealthcare. And as he approached that hotel, there was someone, who, sources are telling us, was waiting for about 10 minutes, possibly outside. Sources also telling us that person appears to be masked and fired several shots at Thompson from about 20 feet away or so but hitting Thompson and killing him. And what we've learned from sources is that this person then fled through a back alley by a theater, which, of course, this is in the heart of the theater district in Manhattan, and got on a bicycle and took off. And sources telling us it's possible this person then rode that bicycle into Central Park. So you can imagine, Erica, they are taking video, canvasing this whole entire area, trying to piece together like a puzzle where this person fled to, in addition to who might be this person before even trying to figure out a motive at this point. Sources telling me it doesn't seem like they're very close at this point to finding that suspect just yet. But we hope to learn a lot more possibly at a news conference that's scheduled for later this morning. It possibly may be even early this afternoon. We'll get some more details. But really quick, as you just mentioned, Erica, this happened about 6:45 or so in the morning. This was believed to be as a -- with all these clues that we're learning now, a targeted attack and happening in the midtown Manhattan. This is just a few blocks away from the Rockefeller tree, which is expected to have a tree lighting tonight. And so you can imagine the security that is already there in that area. But alone from the fact that this is a very busy part of Manhattan, where these gun shots were fired. So certainly this is all extremely alarming, even from the fact that it appears to be a targeted attack.

Hegseth is facing allegations of sexual misconduct, alcohol abuse and inappropriate behavior in the workplace. There has also been much talk about a leaked email from 2018 from his mother, in which she called him a man that \"belittles, lies, cheats and sleeps around and uses women for his own ego.\" Well, earlier today, in an interview on FOX, she said she apologized for that email shortly after sending it. Here's more of what she had to say in that interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENELOPE HEGSETH, PETE'S MOTHER:  But let me make two statements first and one is to president Trump. And I want to say thank you for your belief in my son. We all believe in him. We really believe that he is not that man he was seven years ago. I'm not that mother. I am here to tell the truth, to tell the truth to the American people and tell the truth to the senators on the Hill, especially our female senators. I really hope that you will not listen to the media and that you will listen to Pete. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now what's at stake here is a constitutional question about whether minors should have access to certain medical treatments if they want to transition. Now the state of Tennessee passed its ban last year. But as you noted, over two dozen other states have passed similar bans. So right now, the justices are contemplating whether this kind of ban amounts to sex discrimination under the Constitution. The Biden administration argues that, because teens who, for example, are born male have access to some treatments, that teens who are born female, who want to transition, cannot have access to. They argue that this ban amounts to unconstitutional sex discrimination. But Erica, the state of Tennessee says that's not true because both boys and girls are banned from this kind of care if they are minors seeking to transition. We don't know when the justices will release their decision. But we do know that the incoming Trump administration does not support this kind of medical treatment. But teens at the center of this case tell us that, even if they don't have federal support, they will continue to advocate for this.
