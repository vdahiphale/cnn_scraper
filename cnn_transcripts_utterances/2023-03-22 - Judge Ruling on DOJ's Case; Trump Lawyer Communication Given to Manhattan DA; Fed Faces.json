What will this deepening friendship between China and Russia mean not only for the U.S., but for the war in Ukraine, and, frankly, for the global balance of power. We'll discuss. We do want to begin, though, this hour with that major ruling by a federal judge in the DOJ's investigation into how former President Trump handled classified documents. CNN political correspondent Sara Murray joining us now live. So, Sara, this is the first time, as I understand, the Justice Department is arguing that it has seen evidence that there may have been a crime committed by the former president.

I mean we are learning that Judge Beryl Howell, last week, in a sealed ruling, so we're learning this from our sources, decided that prosecutors provided enough evidence that former President Donald Trump may have used his attorney to potentially commit a crime. That because of the evidence they provided, which includes surveillance tapes, essentially attorney/client privilege doesn't apply here anymore. Prosecutors provided enough evidence to pierce that shield and the lawyer at issue here, Evan Corcoran, should have to testify before a grand jury.Now, this is really important. Evan Corcoran could be a very important witness to prosecutors. He was someone who helped search for these classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. He's someone who attested to the government, we now know inaccurately, that all of these classified documents had been turned over. So, obviously, prosecutors really, really want his testimony. The Trump team was very quick to appeal this decision. They took to the appeals court. And what we saw last night was somewhat unprecedented. It was the appeals court essentially saying, OK, we are going to weigh in on whether this essentially should be put on pause, whether Corcoran's testimony should be put on pause. Prosecutors had overnight to file. Trump's team had overnight to file. Everyone managed to get their filings in. And now we are waiting to see what the appeals court says about this, if they decide to pause Evan Corcoran's testimony or if they say it could go forward. Again, this is really far into the progression of the classified documents case and could be potentially one of the last witnesses that the government needs to hear from. At a minimum, he's a key witness. As I pointed out, he was really in the thick of all of this, guys.",

What's -- what's the measure there of if it's too much for him to be involved in this case? COATESprivilege. And anytime somebody is communicating with their attorney, then you're supposed to hold sacrosanct that particular information for confidentiality reasons. You want people to be forthcoming. But perspective clients may also be able to have that privilege because we want people to have the ability to be forthcoming with the potential lawyer. And so if I hand over information to somebody in the hopes they'll become my attorney, I expect them not to be able to then use it against me down the line or not to have to play the role of a witness in a case and an advocate for the person that I may have been going against. It really does serve to protect also Donald Trump. You don't want to have your attorney having to hold back or pull punches because there might be a perceived conflict or, do I know this or do I not know this, and then not fully represent. But right now Tacopina is saying, look, I don't have any substantial or prospective or actual client relationship. Therefore, it should never apply, and I'm not conflicted out.",

So this is about the classified documents that were found at Mar-a-Lago, and the DOJ, as we just heard from Sara Murray basically saying, hey, we have -- the judge ruling the DOJ presented enough evidence to show - I'm reading this to make sure I don't screw it up because I'm not the lawyer -- Trump did use his own defense attorneys in furtherance of a crime or fraud. I know that language is important there. And they're saying, so we need this attorney to testify. You need to hear from him. There is enough here. How does that work? This seems to me, you're a former federal prosecutor as well, not only rare, but the fact that this would happen, what does that tell you about what could be there?",

It doesn't mean they have the probable cause for even a grand jury. But they have told these judges through the testimony they've given or evidence they've presented that, look, there is something there. And what was there is not allowable to allow him to say, look, this is my lawyer. It's all privileged communication. We don't want the attorney/client privilege doctrine to be used to further a crime or to be used as a vehicle to say, I'll do whatever I want. And as long as I tell my lawyer, I've got to get out of jail free card forever. We don't want that to happen. It's privileged for a reason.So, this court believes that whatever was presented (ph) to them was enough to say, we're going to pierce this. And not just pierce it for anyone. This is a former president of the United States. How many discussions have we all had about the idea of having a president have a kitchen cabinet conversation, have a White House counsel conversation, have the idea of an attorney/client conversation. You want them to have the same protections as everyone else, to be forthcoming. But the judges here said, look, there's enough here so far to tell me, you don't get to have that protection, to have an attorney testify, it doesn't mean that it actually, you know, implicates Donald Trump. It could mean he says, look, I certify that we got everything over to you, White House, and to you, National Archives -- excuse me, the DOJ, on this issue. And that's it. But we have to still know that. And whatever the Trump side has given so far has not been enough to convince the judge that this testimony is not crucial from an attorney.",

And there was speculation at the time about the him being distanced enough in delegating responsibility.This suggests, the courts are saying, it's not about delegating. It might be about using an attorney, possibly, to commit a crime or fraud, or to make sure they didn't have the information that they actually could have to certify it to the, what, to the DOJ on this issue and the National Archives.

How he explains a lot of things, including how they missed Silicon Valley Bank and how that may be hampering their attempts to bring inflation back down to the 2 percent level they've had.Look, they've been raising interest rates for a long time, for a year now, and that is revealing creeks in the banking system. I think today the expectation is that you could see 25 basis points. When we look at this sort of Fed guessing tool in the futures markets, it's showing a 90 percent chance that the Fed will raise 25 basis points. Remember, just a couple of weeks ago, the Fed chief had signaled that they would need to have interest rates higher for longer because inflation was such a problem. And, look, economy is strong. Since the last time the Fed met, you guys, the economy on almost every indicator has proven to be stronger than many people had expected. And the narrative has shifted from inflation peaking, to we could get a soft landing, to maybe no landing. The economy is really hot. And to now a banking crisis. So, it's just a lot to manage and balance here. It will matter for you if they raised another 25 basis points in a lot of ways, on credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, any kind of borrowed money will get a little bit more expensive, as it has been over the past year. It could help cool the housing market even further. But the big worry is that it doesn't roil the banking sector. And so that's -- that's that fine line the Fed has to walk here today.",

It's clear, based on my own reporting, that the Fed knew well - you know, more than a year before all of this blew up that there were serious problems at Silicon Valley Bank.

That doesn't necessarily throw a bunch of people out of work.

Shan, always great to see you. So, in terms of what we heard there, the judge actually called some of -- one of Fox's arguments, saying it doesn't seem to be intellectually honest. And they question specifically that Lou Dobbs, who had engaged - that he had engaged in legally protected neutral reporting, as they were saying, how that could be accurate when he was also signing his tweets with a MAGA hashtag. And they also pointed out that Maria Bartiromo had -- also pointed out had misled her audience, making it sound like she didn't know either way if some of these claims were inaccurate, but that she knew that Fox knew ahead of time before they went on the air. When you hear those questions, and we know what that line of questioning is, what does that tell you?",

That's a very rare standard to successfully win in the complex case like this because that standard requires that there be no issues of material fact and dispute, and one side or the other is entitled to judgment on the law. So they feel that they have so much evidence already that they can say to the judge, hey, nothing in dispute here, no need for a fact finder. You can make a ruling on the law. So, it's an unusual situation.",

Usually summary judgments fail because everyone says, look, there's lots of facts here we have to figure out. It's going to be a credibility determination. So, I think the judge is giving this some serious consideration.There's an interesting further kind of bifurcation here, which is the question of whether the parent company that Murdoch is the chair for would be liable or not, or whether they could potentially say, hey, that's a factual issue here, and maybe we all know that they can prove we knew what was going on there. If, on the other hand, they win on that point, and the judge agrees there wasn't enough knowledge for the parent company, then they could be out of the case and sort of leave Fox News to fin for itself.",
