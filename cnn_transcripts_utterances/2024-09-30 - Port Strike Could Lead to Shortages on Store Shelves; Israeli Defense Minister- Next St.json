Tens of thousands of U.S. port workers are preparing to walk off the job in a move that could have huge implications for supply lines and what you see on store shelves.Plus, crime has been one of the key issues on the campaign trail.

      "sentences": "Yes, well Brianna, I think what we're facing is something that truly is unprecedented. We haven't seen a stoppage at a port since 2002 on the west coast. That was an 11-day strike and that resulted in six months of backlogs and delays.So we're talking about everything from produce to energy to automotives, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals, health care and of course the things that are coming in for the holiday season. And some of those are seasonal goods that have been pulled forward. So normally the busiest shipping months of the year are August, September, October for the fall season and the holiday season. This year we saw that move back to June, July, August. So people did try to prepare. But in my conversations even with the CEOs of the largest retailers in the country, there's only so much you can do to prepare for this because some of these items either aren't ready to be shipped or they're not appropriate to be stored all that time. They can't be rerouted to the west coast for cost reasons. So they're going to have real implications if we shut the ports down.",

What's the effect on the supply chain which I think people's reference point is really the pandemic on bananas and more broadly going to be?",

      "sentences": "Well the east coast ports are responsible for more than 40 percent of what we bring into the United States on an annual basis. So it's almost half of what we're importing and the west coast ports are operating almost at capacity already although they've got the ability to take some of those goods that could be rerouted.But of course the things that we'll recognize and experience first are perishable items, food products, there will be beverages, the drinks product, the end of the year holiday season is a big time for celebrating various holidays and get-togethers and gatherings. So much of the wine and beer that comes into this country and spirits is imported as well. So I think there's a whole range of factors that'll happen and as customers move away from those items that in say in the perishables category that aren't available they'll substitute. And as they move to substitute for other goods then those goods will cost more. So it's going to have a ripple effect and I think at a time when we're just turning the corner on inflation after two and a half years of really high inflation what we're going to do now is raise prices again and that's the last thing the economy needs and particularly with their segments on what's happening in the southeast and the hurricane the worst possible time to shut these ports on the east coast when these people that are really in dire circumstances need relief.",

      "sentences": "Yes very good point there. So I mentioned what this is about it's about pay and it's about automation and what these port workers or the union representing them wants is a pay raise that ultimately will put them at a place slightly higher than what their west coast counterparts make. They're also opposing fully automated equipment which the shippers say hey we need this we need this to be competitive.Where do you see this landing? Is this a fair ask that they're asking for the workers?",

We've talked to the Council of Economic Advisors going all the way back to the beginning of this year. And official talks between the U.S. maritime shippers, USMX, and the ILA broke down in June so there haven't been any official conversations. We haven't weighed in on the issues involved here those are for theparties to sort out and settle. I think our view is to see the economy continue and the supply chain to continue to function effectively. We don't think it's appropriate to shut the economy down over a labor dispute. Anytime any bargaining unit closes an individual location whether it's a retail location a manufacturing distribution facility there are implications for those workers those families those communities. But this is on a scale beyond what a single bargaining unit could do anywhere else. If you shut the economy down over these issues it seems sensible to keep the parties talking to try to resolve this and not to bring the economy to its knees and crash the economy as a negotiating tactic.",

      "sentences": "It seems that the shaping operations are already underway, not just those limited elite commando raids across the border over the past couple of days targeting Hezbollah positions, but what we're hearing from the very northernmost point of Israel, Metula and a couple of the small towns nearby. The IDF has closed those areas. There's now a military closed zone.It is, if you will, the most vulnerable part of Israel to Hezbollah. It's surrounded, Metula itself, a tiny, tiny town. I was there earlier this year, surrounded on three sides, where in recent years the IDF has discovered Hezbollah trying to dig tunnels under the border. That is now a closed military area and from just a couple of miles away from there in Kiryat Shmona, the sound of heavy artillery fire can be heard. Now, that also is a potential shaping operation for a military ground force to go in. We saw it in Gaza. We've seen the IDF do this in Lebanon before, where they will pound an area where they think Hezbollah may be hiding out with heavy artillery before ground troops go in. The other indicators that we've seen beyond the defense minister in the last few hours saying the next phase steps in the war against Hezbollah are about to begin is the accumulation of military hardware along the border. Tanks, armored personnel carriers, the defense minister speaking earlier today with the Golani Brigade, one of the prime sort of infantry units that the has at its disposal. We know that further along the border, there's the 98 elite commando division as well. So all the units the IDF would need for a ground incursion are in place. The questions that stand out tonight are what is the aim of a ground incursion that the defense minister appears to indicate is imminent and close and how large would be the forces involved in it? And it really does just seem a matter of time before it begins.",

All the seats have been stripped out and there are these pressurized fuel tanks in that sort of narrow fuselage area.And at the back of this Boeing 707 is a feeder tube and a very experienced officer working that feeder tube to line it up to refuel F-35s. And that's what I witnessed. I climbed aboard that aircraft in southern Israel, flew out over the Red Sea, south, south, south over the Red Sea. I didn't know where we were going. F-35 after F-35 was nuzzling up to the back of this 707, filling up with fuel. And well, after about an hour and a half of that, the F-35s peeled off. And I was told that they had just conducted a mission in Hodeidah, Houthi- controlled part of Yemen. And they were targeting there a power station and a fuel dump. And the reason I was told, the IDF press officer with me said the reason they had done this was twofold. One, the Houthis have been firing ballistic missiles over the past couple of weeks into central Israel. We have certainly seen that. The Houthis had claimed on Saturday to have fired one at Ben Gurion Airport, main international airport. And the other message here was very clear. It was a message to Iran that Israel has a long reach. It can do these long, more than 1,000- mile raids with its fighter aircraft, pack a punch. And that's a message to Iran to stay out of the fight that Israel is about to engage in more deeply in Lebanon.",
