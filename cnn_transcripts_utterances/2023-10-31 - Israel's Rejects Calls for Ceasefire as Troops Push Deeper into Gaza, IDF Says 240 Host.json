I mean, obviously when you have 240 hostages, you have 240 families, and, you know, people all over the map, politically, people all over the map in terms of emotions. But the individuals with whom I've spoken, a lot of them feel you know that the number one priority of the Israeli government right now should be getting the hostages back, and everything else should be secondary, including going after Hamas, including the ground incursion, including every -- any other consideration.And so there is a degree of frustration. I mean, there are questions about whether or not Hamas has offered any sort of prisoner exchange for the Hamas individuals who are in Israeli prisons. There is a question about whether or not the ground incursion is actually making it more difficult to get the kidnapped victims, the hostages out of Gaza as opposed to whether it's making it more easy. There are some, of course, in the Israeli government, in the IDF, who argue that this force makes it easier to get them out. But a lot of the families are concerned about that. So, there's a lot of friction right now. I will say that the fact that four hostages have been returned and a fifth, that Israeli soldier on Sunday was rescued by IDF, does give sop hope to the families, but there's just a lot of anxiety about the fact that these individuals remain in Hamas custody, likely in the tunnels. And I will say also the fact that so many around the world are calling for a ceasefire and not calling for the hostages to be released as their number one call is also quite distressing to many of the families, Poppy.",

And I believe there's a fresh -- we just heard the thud of artillery and there's a fresh plume of smoke in the background near some of the destroyed buildings in that northeastern most city here in Gaza. Now, the IDF spokesman has been characterizing the fighting over the last several days as fierce battles between Israeli troops and Hamas militants, making clear that this will be a long battle and a costly battle, very much preparing the Israeli public for what is to come, saying that this will require resilience on the part of the Israeli public. The IDF says that they have struck over 300 targets in just the last day. And as I said, they appear to be closing in on Gaza City on several axis. All of this as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, makes clear there is a time for war and a time for peace. He said that now is a time for war, rejecting calls from other world leaders for a potential ceasefire. And amid the news that Israeli soldier was freed in an Israeli ground operation overnight, the previous day, making clear that he also believes that Israeli ground operations also open up the possibility of freeing additional hostages, effectively rejecting the criticism that this Israeli ground operation puts those hostages at risk, saying that it opens up the possibility to potentially free more and that it also ramps up the pressure on Hamas, strengthening the Israeli hand at the negotiating table.
