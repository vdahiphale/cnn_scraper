Wouldn`t you know it, all of these are named for a collective of penguins, but a raft refers to a group of penguins in the water. Up next, we`re taking a trip to see some penguins in need of some help. Now, first of all I thought all penguins lived in cold snowy regions but that`s not true. In fact, there are penguins that can be found waddling around the warm dry shores in South Africa with not a major snowbank in sight. We learn something new every day on the show. This particular penguin population though is dwindling in large part because they`re having trouble making their nests. So, humans are stepping in to build them some sweet new digs. CNN went to check in on the tuxedo birds and we`ll go there now to learn some more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But in the 19th century,humans began to exploit guano supplies and sell it as fertilizer, leaving penguins and their eggs exposed to predators and a scorching sun. KEVIN GRAHAM, ASSOCIATE CURATOR, DALLAS ZOO/AZA SAFE:  At one point in the colonies, it ranged from three to 10 meters in depth and even deeper in some areas. Right now, the deepest guano remaining in any of the colony`s measures in the centimeters, the only thing left is bare gravel, bare oil, nothing that they can burrow into and that took away their entire nesting ability.",

Its mission is to design and deploy artificial nests that give penguin parents a safe and cool place to raise their chicks. After two years of development and studying old guano nests, project experts settled on a final design which they started deploying in late 2018. The aim was to emulate mother nature as closely as possible.",
