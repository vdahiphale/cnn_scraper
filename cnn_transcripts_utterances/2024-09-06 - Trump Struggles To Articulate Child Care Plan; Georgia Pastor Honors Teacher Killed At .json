Despite the U.S. pumping more oil than any country ever, former President Donald Trump is attacking Vice President Kamala Harris on energy policy, and he is vowing to make gas cheaper.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I will end Kamala Harris' anti-energy crusade and implement a policy of energy abundance, energy independence, and even energy dominance. My plan will cut energy prices in half or more than that within 12 months of taking office. It will be an economic revival of our country like no one has ever seen before. Energy was what caused our problem initially. Energy is going to bring us back. That means we're going down and getting gasoline below $2.00 a gallon. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, John, this may be one promise that former President Trump hopes he doesn't keep because I know dirt-cheap gas sounds great but to get there you would need demand to crash likely in a global recession.Veteran analyst Tom Kloza -- he told me that chances are if we see sub $2.00 gasoline it will be because of some awful things taking place in the economy. So, yeah, gas could be cheap, but you might be out of work. And Trump also bragged about how gas prices were below $1.90 a gallon when he was president, and I went back and looked. He is right. They actually got to as low as $1.77 four-plus years ago. But here's the thing -- no one could take advantage of it because it was during the worst health crisis in a century. I remember driving on the New Jersey Turnpike with my family and there was no one on the road. It was a weekday during rush hour. So if you've ever driven in New Jersey you know that is not normal. Another thing that might sound good but in reality it's kind of scary. One other point here. Trump was talking about regulations here. He falsely claimed that Vice President Harris wants to ban fracking. She has said that she no longer wants to do that. He also said he's going to end her \"anti-energy crusade.\" That's another claim that just doesn't live up to reality when you look at the numbers because the U.S. is producing more oil right now under Biden-Harris than it ever did under Trump. In fact, more oil than ever before in the history of the country. So that just doesn't live up to his rhetoric.",

There was nothing there -- nothing to grip onto to say that he showed any kind of grasp of the issue. You know, the funny thing is the right and Trump -- they love to talk about how Kamala Harris speaks in word salad. Well, that was the mother of all word salad. He kept talking about the number. What number did he give us? There was no number. This was a missed opportunity of epic proportions and he's fumbling the ball. That's the candidate who he is nowadays. And yesterday, as a grandfather, he could have met the moment and talked about this issue. And from a place of strengthening the American family, which is what the Republicans of yesteryear -- people like McCain and Romney and Bush. We always originated with that at the core -- the messaging piece we did, whether it was from Capitol Hill or from a presidential campaign. I'm talking, we Republicans because the American family was central to everything we did. Nowadays, we have a divorce rate in this country of 42 percent. And single mothers overall earn 56 cents to a dollar that dads make. He missed that opportunity to speak about the problem and how he would fix it by delivering that word salad.",

And you look at those character attributes in polls and she outperforms Donald Trump. But (audio gap) she's trying to remain vague. Donald Trump is winning on the policies that are most important to the American people. So I do think a lot of folks are going to be tuning in.

You go down this rabbit hole and you dig yourself a hole that you just can't come out of. And so at the end of the day what she wants to do is essentially reintroduce herself to the public. But what she has to do is drill deeper. She has got to be more detailed in telling how she would be different than Biden. And she's got to do it almost breathlessly because Trump's got nothing else. We just talked about child care and strengthening the American family -- pro-parent centric policies of which both campaigns frankly haven't done the greatest job of differentiating themselves from one another. Trump said I did this $6,000 tax credit. Kamala Harris is, like, I want to do that. I'm going to do that. Well, tell me more. And so this is a 'tell me more' moment in which she can't worry about him. She can't worry about attacking him.

China now ending foreign adoptions of its children as the country suffers a sharply declining birth rate there. The only exception will be people adopting or stepchildren of blood relatives who are in China. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing is seeking clarification on what this means for families currently in the actual adoption process. All right, tragedy in Kenya. Police say 17 elementary school students have died after fire broke out in a boy's dormitory. Authorities say some of those students were burned beyond recognition. Fourteen others have been injured. Kenya's President William Ruto offering his condolences to the families after hearing the devastating news. The cause of that fire still under investigation. And Pope Francis is in Papau New Guinea right now for the second leg of his marathon tour of Southeast Asia. While he's there he'll be the first Pope to visit Vanimo located in the northwestern tip of the country -- extremely remote area. He'll meet with Catholic missionaries and charities that help homeless children and people with disabilities. The Pope is also expected to once again urge stronger action to protect the environment, John.",
