We don't know if it's a student. There are multiple injuries reported by campus police. They have been taken to a local area hospital.We are waiting a news briefing from the Michigan State University Police any moment now. It is supposed to start. We should be able to have many, many questions answered if they are willing to share the information. The last we heard was that the shooter had fled, that the shooter was still on the loose, and that police were still searching for the shooter. Students are still barricaded in some classrooms and some dorm rooms and elsewhere on the campus. Back with me now, Shimon Prokupecz, Charles Ramsey, Shawn Turner, who happened to be on campus when they got this alert, and John Miller. So, Shawn, let me just start with you. What happened at 8:15 tonight?",

To be really candid, I mean, we -- you know, we expected that this might have been a situation where someone may be heard something and thought there were shots fired, but it very quickly became clear that this was a real sort of tragedy unfolding on campus. I immediately got home. I still had people in my building on campus that were -- that were working late. So, for most of us here on campus in a leadership positions, we went through a mode of (INAUDIBLE) to ensure that not only our students but our staff members, all of our employees, were safe in either in the buildings they were on campus.",

He just confirmed for us that, yes, indeed, there has been a mass school shooting at Michigan State University.There were different location sites. We had known that, John, before that. That had been confirmed. There were multiple locations on campus. One was at Berkey Hall. They found, they said, multiple victims there. And then there was another one at the MSU Union Building. It sounds like a student union there. They got other reports of a shooting. They went there. There were victims in both of these scenes. He said five -- at least five victims have been transported to the hospital. They do have life-threatening injuries. They've already confirmed that one person was killed. Then they believe that the suspect left the student -- the MSU Union Building on foot. That's where he was last seen. They do have surveillance footage of the suspect which, of course, would be very helpful. They're going to release a photo, they said, very shortly after this. Ball cap, red shoes, possibly Black male. Everyone needs to continue sheltering in place. If you're currently sheltering in place in a dorm room, in a classroom, continue to do so.",

So, the preferred method would be shelter in place where you are, even if you're locked in a classroom, reach out and contact the police and say, this is how many we are, this is the room we are in and, you know, who is coming to get us, how long do you think that's going to be?

What makes this different than so many of the mass shootings we cover is that generally, it seems, as if the shooter is either killed or caught right away.I was just trying to think of the most recent mass shootings that we have covered and that we've done where the suspect was on the loose and there was a manhunt. One of them was Highland Park in Illinois, the fourth of July shooting, where it took until that night to apprehend that suspect. But then the other one that might be the most pertinent, we have an expert on it right here with us on set, is the subway shooting here in New York City last April. No one was killed, but the shooting, it was a mass shooting in a subway car where the suspect got away, and then by the release of the video and piecing together the evidence, they were able to catch that suspect relatively quickly.",

And, you know, we had a decision to make which was we got a very early lead on a name and a tip from a rental car place, a rent truck place in Pennsylvania, so we knew who we were looking for and we were trying to close that gap.But the moment of truth came when we said, we have the picture. If we put the picture out, he knows we know who he is and that, you know, we are closing that. But the decision that we made was the same that these police officers made which is it's great to have 3,000 detectives looking for him, but if you can have eight million detectives in New York City, among the populace of the city all looking for him at the same time, that kind of crowd sourcing is of infinite value, and they made that decision right away.",

We've seen in recent cases, even in the murder of the students, the college students out west where they funnel the tip line to the FBI's call center where they could handle the volume and put it into a lead tracking system.And right now, you have the FBI on the scene with their SWAT team in case it's needed, but also with their victim witness assistance people, with their technical people, phone tracking people, all the support people that they can bring to this if they are needed. So, these are going to be decisions that they're going to have to make early on in this investigation because once they have this picture out, the calls are already flooding in, once they get a better picture out. And I anticipate that they will, as they expand the video canvas, get a better image that shows more of that face, they will get even more calls. CAMEROTA:  Yes, indeed. Shimon, to that point, I mean, I know there are no guarantees, but the fact that they did this so quickly and they have such a good shot, still framed from the video, this guy is not long for freedom. I mean, they're going to be -- I assume they have surveillance video all over campus.",

So, they are still very much in the tactical part of clearing this situation and that might go on for quite some time. So, we'll probably need to buckle in and be prepared to kind of watch this for the next few hours.",
