This was all part of an overnight court filing just hours before suspect Jack Teixeira will stand before a federal judge in Boston today. Prosecutors say he stole and posted classified material online in a deliberate effort to disseminate this country's secrets.The court filing also reveals Teixeira allegedly had a history of racist and violent threats. Prosecutors say he spoke about wanting to kill a ton of people. These photos show what investigators found inside his bedroom. They say Teixeira had access to an arsenal of weapons and accessories, including handguns, rifles and a gas mask. At his detention hearing today, the judge will ultimately decide whether he will stay in jail as he awaits trial. CNN national correspondent Jason Carroll is outside the courtroom in Boston. Jason, what evidence do the prosecutors have that he was trying to hide what he was doing as well?",

This is a new number, not dozens but hundreds of classified documents. And prosecutors argue in this court filing that if he were to get out on bail their concern is that he, in some ways, still might have access to these court documents, which is why they want him to remain behind bars. They said the following, the defendant knows where the information is, he knows how to access it. And based on his specialized IT skills, he presumably knows how to disseminate that information without being immediately noticed. So that was one point.Also, they noted that right after he discovered that this leak had been publicized and that the authorities were on him, he did several things to try to cover his tracks. He got a new email. He got a new phone. He also allegedly told some of the people that he was conserving with, quote, delete all messages. And if anyone comes looking, don't tell them, expletive. The prosecutor is also alleging that, in terms of him trying to cover his tracks, when they got to his home, they also discovered that he had smashed a laptop, a tablet, a gaming console, all of this found in the dumpster at his family home. And what also that a number of us found disturbing as we were looking through all of these documents, Sara, prosecutors were alarmed at the search items that Teixeira had been searching. Things like Ruby Ridge, Las Vegas shooting, Mandalay Bay shooting, Buffalo Tops shooting, also Uvalde. And of this is going to be taken under consideration when this detention hearing gets underway at 1:00. Sara.",

Republicans arguing, however, that they succeeded in unifying their conference, showing Biden and Democrats over in the U.S. Senate that they have a plan that can work. And their argument is that it's the only plan moving through Congress right now.This came after months of negotiations, behind closed doors meeting, listening sessions with the whip team. And at the end of the day, Republicans were able to secure a victory, although it was the narrowest of margins that you possibly could have had to pass this bill yesterday on the floor. In fact, a person familiar with Kevin McCarthy's thinking said that as he was going to the floor he was pretty confident he was going to have the votes he needed to succeed, but he wasn't 100 percent sure. He had four Republicans voting against that proposal. And there's a bit question about even if he gets to the negotiating table with the White House, what he brings back is going to be far less conservative than what was passed yesterday, what wasn't conservative enough for some of those Republicans, John.

Pope Francis approved guidelines to include women and lay people at the October gathering. Until now, only bishops who were all male could vote. The Vatican says the move is not a revolution but an important change. CNN Vatican correspondent Delia Gallagher is joining us now. It might not be a revolution, but this is significant, is it not?",

He's walking the fine line between trying to keep people happy, that this is still a meeting of bishops, because, of course, this is a concern also for conservatives, this in particular, that bishops are still making decisions. But what Pope Francis has done here as opened up the process to -- he's asking for 70 non-bishop members, Sara, and he's asking that half of those be women. And he also would like young people included.Now, part of the reason that he's doing this is partially because of his vision, of course, of opening up conversation in the church to women and to lay people. But because the topic of this synod, which is a meeting, as you mentioned, of bishops, it's happening in October, is precisely that relationship with laity (ph), with the hierarchy of the church and those kinds of topics. As you can imagine, there have been women's groups in the church who have been pushing for this for some time. The Women's Ordination Conference said it's a significant crack in the stained-glass ceiling. A colorful metaphor from them. The thing we don't know yet, Sara, is what exactly are they voting on? This is a process that started in 2021 with listening sessions throughout the Catholic churches throughout the world in terms of what are Catholics feeling, what are the issues that are important to them? Now it's coming to the Vatican in October. We'll have the agenda from the Vatican in May. There's a month long discussion about it, and then those proposals are voted on and they go to the pope and he can do what he likes with them. So, it's a consultative kind of process for them until the pope decides. Sara.",
