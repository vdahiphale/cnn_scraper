She's had briefing books with the former president's commentary and criticisms of her so that she can be ready to respond to those attacks.Ultimately, the goal for the Vice President is not only to forcefully make the case against Donald Trump, but also to try to convince America that it is time to move on from the era of Trumpism.

This is Kamala Harris' first.And so while I believe that she will absolutely have the chance to offer her ideas a massive and stark contrast with where she wants to take the American people with her administration versus what Donald Trump has done in the four years that he was in the Oval Office and what he will do, given that we know the extremism of Project 2025, I still think that this is not going to be a slam dunk for her by any means. And they are prepping for that. Look, you know, we know the various versions of Donald Trump that have shown up. And we know that he will lie. We know that he will do insults, conspiracy theories. You know, he can't focus on one line of inquiry or one line of questioning, one line of answering. And that's what I think his folks are afraid of. But at the same time for Kamala Harris, it is tough to be there and be somebody who's going to have to fact check every single time. So she's going to have to focus on making sure that she has the opportunity to lay out her vision, not get baited into a back and forth on insults, which we know that he will try.

She might do a version of looking him - looking at him in the eye and saying, Donald, please, right? Let's not use that tired playbook. I'm going to take the opportunity to talk to the American people about what I'm going to do for them, about how I'm going to wake up every day and focus on making sure that they're able to provide for their families, that they're able to not just get by, but to get ahead and focus on those policies. She can't get baited into that because that's exactly where he will flourish. You can't outrump Trump, but what you can do is get under his skin. And if he does that, that is going to be a huge failure for him.

So I wouldn't take debate from a question. I wouldn't take debate from her. I would just bring it all back to one core issue. This is how he wins. People are not happy with the current administration. She is in the current administration. She represents a continuation of the same.

Obviously, no - without proof there. And he did it just a few days after AG Merrick Garland detailed what an alarming number of election workers had been facing since 2020.I mean, he really laid out some pretty stunning stuff last week, where he was saying that there were election workers who had to be assigned body armor. Their families were concerned for their safety. And this was obviously something that the Justice Department is moving forward on with their task force. Do you have concerns that Trump is making election workers vulnerable with these comments? JENNINGS: Well, I'm concerned that we have a lot of stress on the system. I'm concerned that this election is high anxiety. I'm concerned that emotions are running high across the board. And, you know, of course, the election workers from the volunteers at the local level, to county clerks, to secretaries of state, they're the ones who make our diffuse system of elections work and the diffuse system is what protects it ultimately. So I would hope that we respect the system, respect the people who make the system work and that we understand a lot of these people aren't getting paid to do it, but they do it out of the goodness of their heart and out of the obligation they feel to have a role in public service. And there can be no higher public service than making sure our democracy is functioning correctly. So I have a high degree of confidence in the system, honestly, from the constitutional system all the way down to the grassroots system of people who count the votes and make sure we get a free and fair result. So I just - I want everybody to respect those people, because having been around politics for a quarter of a century, I can tell you they're absolutely necessary. And most of them are absolutely salt of the earth, who are all in it for the right reasons.",

The problem is that Donald Trump doesn't care if he put those people's lives in danger, because that's exactly what he did in 2020. That's exactly what he's doing, underscoring that he still believes that that election was stolen.If he does that in the debate, I think that is a wonderful opportunity for the Vice President to underscore just how extremist Donald Trump is, just how much he lies, just how much the American people deserve much better. One of the key things that I - that was a takeaway for me in the CNN poll was that the vast majority of Americans already believe that Donald Trump's policies are way too extremist and that it's the Vice President's policies that are much more mainstream and in line with what the majority of the American people value and believe.

John Judge is his name. So, Judge Judge determined that the small community could not have a fair and impartial jury based on this pretrial publicity. But one other thing, it's not determined where it's going to take place because in his order, he's allowing the Supreme Court of Idaho to determine where it takes place and what judge will preside. Now, here is the Kaylee Goncalves' part of their family statement, incredibly disappointed about this ruling. Quote, \"The only good thing about this decision is that it will be Judge Judge's last decision in this case. As victims' families, you are left to just watch like everyone else and really you have little rights or say in the process and at the same time you are the most vested in the outcome. We have always felt that a fair and impartial jury could be found in Latah County and still believe that is where the trial deserves to be held to help the community heal.\" But one other thing that the judge looked into was the practicality that Moscow, Latah County Courthouse, it's very small. And the amount of law enforcement that would have to secure the safety of the judges and the jury and personnel that they would not be able to police the community as they are supposed to.
