We begin with breaking news out of New Orleans. As a man drove a pickup truck into a crowd of people on the famed Bourbon Street early this morning. Police say at least 10 people were killed and at least 35 are injured. And it happened just after 3:00 a.m. local time. There were revelers out celebrating the New Year. At that time, it was packed and according to the New Orleans police chief, the suspect was just hell bent on causing carnage. She says that the driver then shot two police officers, a federal law enforcement officials -- a federal law enforcement official, I should say, says that that suspect is dead. And we've been speaking to witnesses. One witness described seeing bodies on the street and a lot of people getting first aid. Take a listen to the emergency radio call. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So they're trying to figure out exactly where he came from. But it was around 3:15 this morning where police say that this suspect took an F-150 and started trying to intentionally hit people who were out there. We know 10 people are dead, more than 30 injured. And as you can imagine, we do have some new video in to CNN that is very tough to look at. We have blurred some of the images here, but you can see some of the carnage that was left behind. Obviously, some of this video is spreading over the Internet with bodies laying out there, and you can just feel for the people who were involved in this. At some point, that suspect did then start shooting at officers. Two officers were shot. We're told they are in stable condition. Outside of that, now we start building from the investigative points, just in terms of trying to figure out why the suspect targeted this area.

They put them in the bomb containment center and then tried to blow them up on -- on scene there.But at the same time, you've had people who could not return back to their hotels, people questioning, what should they do next? They've shutting down several streets around the area as this investigation continues. We know there's a massive presence of officers down there as they start this investigation. But again, it was 3:15 this morning when this truck went around barricades and started to try to drive over people. So many questions at this point as we continue to talk to law enforcement. There will be another 11:00 news conference. But we should take a listen to the chief who gave us this information a little earlier this morning. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUPT. ANNE KIRKPATRICK, NEW ORLEANS POLICE: It did involve a man driving a pickup truck down Bourbon Street at a very fast pace, and it was very intentional behavior.

We've been in touch with federal law enforcement sources.As Ryan noted, our colleague Evan Perez is told by one law enforcement official that the suspect is dead. And indications are, though, that this suspect acted intentionally. According to this federal law enforcement official. And that is something that local officials actually indicated earlier in their initial press conference. They said that the driver's actions were, quote, \"very intentional.\" Now, we know that the FBI and local officials are conducting searches of the vehicle as they seek to learn more about a potential motive here. We just got word, Pamela, that the attorney general, Merrick Garland, has been briefed on the situation, and the FBI is obviously investigating. Now as part of that investigation, they are looking at possible explosive devices used at the scene. As they said in the briefing earlier, there were improvised explosive devices that were found. And they're working to confirm if they were viable devices or not. So this is a quickly evolving investigation and requires cooperation between federal authorities and those on the ground to determine exactly why this happened.",

People need to understand, especially at the federal level, that terrorism actually has a legal definition and it's much more narrow than people realize, because there were some concerns that if you label certain acts terrorism or if you use that too broadly, it could conflict with some constitutional rights and particularly the First Amendment right.Again, it's very confusing. It's sort of an esoteric argument. But when people think of terrorism, they think of something like this. But when it comes to the legal definition, this is why you don't see a lot of cases charged as quote, unquote, \"terrorism.\" They're charged with, you know, using an explosive device. They're charged with other crimes because that's what is on the books. Those are the laws on the books. So I think the legal definitions, particularly the differences between what you might see at a local level versus the federal level. That's why there is this confusion over whether or not this was terrorism. I think most people would agree that this was terrorizing. But when it comes to the technical, legal -- legalities, that's I think, why we're getting these conflicting messages about whether this was quote, unquote, \"terrorism.\"",

It was terror for those there.But we are now in the investigation and prosecution stage. Look, we are you know, Evan is reporting that -- that -- that the suspect is dead. We don't know what kind of case follows. So -- so putting that aside and we'll just put that aside. These things should be tighter, that it wasn't, it's you know, its early in the morning. It's -- it's New Year's Eve. We understand that. Now focusing on the future. One is intent. That is going to matter. It's going to matter to the families. It's going to matter if he had any accomplices. This looks -- we don't know what the IED devices are. Is there a Federal Nexus that can go forward? The second is a big event tonight. The Sugar Bowl is huge. Lots of people will be watching. My personal assessment, doing lots of sports security is it goes on. This is a -- this -- this -- it should go on. The Police Department has lots of resources to draw on. It can protect the investigation and also draw on other local and state resources to protect people going to the Bowl. But I -- I -- that this is the way that big cities have to work. Unfortunately, you want to provide what might even be security theater at this stage. Lots and lots of -- of law enforcement presence to make the city and people attending understand that they are safe. To stop anyone who might want to copycat at this stage. And then you let the investigation, and the mourning continue simultaneously. It's just the nature of how these things happen is that you have both these horrible incidences, and then you have to prepare for the next big event.

We bring in the bomb technicians, the bomb robots, you know, and the manpower. We can throw manpower a lot of -- a lot of manpower downrange really quickly.And we -- and quite frankly, we -- we've been in charge of or involved in security at special events. I myself was at several Olympic games. I was at the Greece Olympics for a year consulting with the Greek authorities. I was at the Salt Lake City Olympics working in counterterrorism there. And so, we have that kind of background in terrorism and counterterrorism at big special events. And so, the FBI comes in to see if there are resources that we can dedicate. And if there's manpower, we can dedicate. And also, the assistant -- the U.S. Attorney's Office is probably working with the local prosecutors to see what types of charges can be brought. And so everybody should be working together. Thats the bottom line. Thats what should be put out at these press conferences. We'll sort out who gets charged at what level later. Right now, it's all about resources downrange. It's all about manpower. What we can do to investigate this as quickly as thoroughly as we can and make the crowd safer for tonight.

Andy just mentioned a moment ago, the Superdome, I believe, for -- for seating for indoor football is somewhere around 75,000 people. But that's not the only crowd there.In my experience with Sugar Bowls and Super Bowls, Super Bowl will also be there this year fairly soon and Mardi Gras coming up very soon. And Jazz Fest after that. This town handles massive, massive crowds, much bigger than most people are aware of. For a town this size, Mardi Gras doubles the size of the metro area basically. That's how many people come in. A million people or so. Police are very used to handling big crowds. They have made big efforts over the years, Pam, to prevent precisely the sort of event. There was a drunk driver back in 2017, I think, that ran into one of the parade crowds and injured a bunch of people, didn't kill anybody. But back then, we really saw a step up at Mardi Gras of putting many more barricades and big dump trucks and things in the way to stop a car from driving in. That's why it's very interesting that the mayor said, and the officials were saying that, that there was a concerted effort by this driver, according to them, to get around the barricade or any blockage there to head down the street really. And bear in mind, this is a 300- year-old street. Bourbon Street is, for many people, synonymous with New Orleans. They're like, this is what you go to New Orleans for. If you're a local there, you know how important it is to the identity of the street cutting through the -- the famed and beautiful French Quarter. And I was noting earlier, it's important to remember the French Quarter isn't just a tourist attraction. This isn't a resort somewhere. This is a neighborhood. There are many people who live here.
