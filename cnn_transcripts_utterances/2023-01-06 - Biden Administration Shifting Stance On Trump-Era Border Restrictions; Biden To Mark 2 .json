Again, I had that conversation with myself and Officer Harry Dunn, and Gladys Sicknick, the mother of Brian Sicknick. And we sat in Kevin McCarthy's office and he told us point-blank \"I can't control the fringe members of my party.\"And so, here we are about a year and a half out from that meeting and Kevin McCarthy is desperately seeking the speaker's gavel and cannot control the fringe members of his party. You know, by definition, a leader should have a firm grasp on all the members of his party. He doesn't. He's not a leader.",

The vast majority voted to overturn the election after the attack on the Capitol. And I think talking about Rudy on this day and CNN's new documentary also ties into that because that's about somebody who once was a law and order figure. Someone I had the honor of working for when he was mayor -- which I would argue, a distinguished record.
