      "sentences": "Rahel, good morning. So, the folks that live in Fort Myers, Florida are preparing for Hurricane Milton. This part of Southwest Florida is no stranger to powerful hurricanes. In fact, two years ago, Hurricane Ian destroyed a good portion of Southwest Florida, including in Lee County, which is where we are right now. And so, keeping that storm in mind, the folks out here have been preparing for Milton.To give you a sense of where their mind is right now, you can see, obviously, they've got their sandbags laid out, out here. But, we're told that during Hurricane Ian, about four feet of water flooded this part of Downtown Fort Myers. So, of course, the expectation is, with this storm at about six to 10 feet of a storm surge, the water level is probably going to be a lot higher than this here. This part of Downtown Fort Myers is also just on the other side of the Caloosahatchee River, which is a pretty important river that connects out into the Gulf of Mexico as well as Lake Okeechobee. And so, as the storm continues its path towards the Tampa, Tampa Bay area, and all of that water gets pushed in, the concern is that the Caloosahatchee River, as has done in the past, is going to rise. It is going to flood. It's going to crest. And then all of that water is going to get pushed into this part of Downtown Fort Myers. And so, to give you a sense of what folks are doing out here right now, you can see they're gathered around, trying to make some last- minute preparations, all in an effort to try to be as good of a position to weather this storm. Right now, if the path holds, of course, landfall is going to be to the north of here. And so, flooding really is the biggest concern. Mandatory evacuation orders are in place for parts of Fort Myers Beach, which was destroyed by Hurricane Ian, and a mandatory evacuation is already underway in Sanibel, another part of Lee County that was also just hit incredibly hard by Hurricane Ian.

And so, as you can imagine, that's led to a great number of folks trying to get onto interstates and trying to get out. That has led to, what we're being told are, some gas shortages. It is a problem that is significant enough that the Governor Ron DeSantis earlier today said that in an effort to try to maintain that supply, the state of Florida is tapping into its reserves to try to get some of these shipments out.One other point of concern is the Port of Tampa. With the storm expected to make a direct landfall in the Tampa Bay area, that port is no doubt going to be damaged, and that port is one of a couple in Florida that really serves as the main vehicle by which gas comes into Florida. And so, with the Port of Tampa being out of play, with hundreds of thousands of people hitting the road, and everyone trying to have a full tank of gas in preparation of the storm, you can understand, you can grasp just how much of a situation we have on our hands when it comes to gas.

      "sentences": "Yeah. Officials had been watching this pretty closely over the last couple of days, but they just made the decision this morning to pull down the President's trip that he was scheduled to depart on, on Thursday to Germany and Angola and Africa. Clearly, the scale of this storm lending some credence to that decision, the officials saying that the President would be needed here in the United States to monitor the recovery and preparation efforts for Milton, but also to keep tabs on the rescue efforts following Hurricane Helene last week. Essentially, it just wasn't a good time for the President to go overseas.Of course, they're also looking at the politics of all of this and recognizing that the President going abroad just as this hurricane was making landfall was just really not a tenable option for them, particularly when you already have President Trump saying that Biden and Vice President Harris are absent from the recovery efforts, which is false, but certainly they didn't want to provide any kind of window into that sort of criticism. And so, the President will be remaining here in the U.S. He is receiving a briefing right now about the hurricane preparations for Milton, but also the recovery efforts for Helene, and we should see him sort of in the next couple of minutes talking about those efforts. His goal right now is to make sure that enough aid is pre- positioned in Florida where this hurricane is set to make landfall. That includes meals, bottles of water, but also personnel. And what you hear from the administration is that there are already hundreds of people in Florida who are there to help with the recovery efforts for Helene, who will now pivot to turn towards preparation efforts for Milton. The other thing that President Biden is very focused on is this issue of disinformation, and you hear it coming from Trump but also on social media from the right, from accounts claiming that the, for instance, the federal government is not involved in the recovery efforts, or that people who are suffering from the storm can only get limited amounts of money from FEMA. That has caused some real, real concern inside the administration, that it will dissuade people who are entitled to these relief efforts from applying for it. And so, I wouldn't be surprised if we heard some of that from President Biden as well, trying to rebut some of that disinformation that has been swirling in the wake of these storms.",

Trump has said that, repeatedly, that Harris stole FEMA funds that should have been used for hurricane victims, a claim that the head of FEMA, Deanne Criswell, has dismissed as completely false.
