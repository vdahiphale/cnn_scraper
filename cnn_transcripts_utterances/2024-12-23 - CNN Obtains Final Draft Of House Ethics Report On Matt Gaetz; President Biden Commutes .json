I'm Eleni Giokos in New York.Straight ahead, the House Ethics Committee finds evidence that former congressman Matt Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on several occasions. Then, the health ministry in Gaza accuses Israel of placing explosive robots at the gate of a hospital. This, while several families of hostages say they have received \"signs of life\" from their loved ones, still held in captivity in Gaza. What we know, that's coming up next. Plus, Hollywood star, Blake Lively has filed a civil rights complaint against costar Justin Baldoni. We'll be live in Los Angeles with the details. Well, CNN has obtained a final draft of a bombshell U.S. health ethics report on former Representative Matt Gaetz. It caps a years-long investigation. The Ethics Committee finding evidence that gates paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex or drugs on at least 20 occasions, and that he paid a 17-year-old girl for sex back in 2017. The panel says Gaetz broke Florida state laws, including statutory rape law. The former congressman has denied all allegations. CNN's senior crime and justice correspondent Katelyn Polantz joined me last hour with more details. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress.\" They also detail in this report the situation with this 17-year-old girl, someone who says she had sex with Matt Gaetz, the former congressman while he was a member of Congress, twice at a party in July 2017 at the time, she was 17 years old. In one of those encounters, other people were able to see, or at least they were in the presence of this happening, and that she also remembers receiving $400 in cash from representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for the sex, at the time she was a junior in high school. So, that's all in the committee report. One of the things, though, is that the Justice Department looked at this and they did not charge with Matt Gaetz with any crime that allowed the House Ethics Committee then to pick up its investigation. The 17-year-old did not tell Gaetz that she was underage at the time. He didn't ask her age, and he has also said on X, he has responded to this and said, in my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated, but who asked. I dated some of these women for years. I never had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would have been destroyed in Court, which is why no such claim was ever made in Court. However, Matt Gaetz, on his own, is taking this to Court. Just this morning, just a few minutes ago, he filed a lawsuit against the House Committee, the House Ethics Committee, to try and block the release of this report on paper. He is also claiming defamation and an invasion of privacy claim there in Court.",

CHRIS COONS (D-DE): These are people who should never be out of prison, but Pope Francis has called on President Biden, as have many other criminal justice for foreign leaders, faith leaders, to step aside from federal death penalties.

LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: In one of his last major acts as president, President Biden is using his presidential clemency power to commute the death sentences of 37 inmates that are currently on federal death row to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Now, remember back in 2020, President Biden campaigned on getting rid of the federal death penalty, and in recent weeks, there had been a swirl of speculation about whether he might take this kind of action before he leaves office, particularly as he was under a good amount of pressure from human rights activists and a number of advocacy groups, some of whom have argued that the death penalty tends to disproportionately affect black people and other people of color. Now, President Biden, in his statement announcing these commutations, said this, \"Make no mistake, I condemn these murderers, but guided by my conscience and my experience, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\" That last reference there to \"new administration resuming executions I halted,\" that, obviously is a reference to incoming president, Donald Trump. Keep in mind that during his first term in office, there were 13 federal death row inmates who were put to death. And in his most recent presidential campaign, Trump has made very clear that he is set on moving forward with additional federal executions once he returns to office. This is a little bit of what Donald Trump has said over the last year on this issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we -- if you look at the video, they look like kind of wooden boxes, which are, I guess, the director is alleging have the explosives inside. As you noted, we have reached out to the IDF for any information about this, and we haven't received any official comment from them regarding these allegations. But I suppose it also just goes to show that whether it's what's happening in northern Gaza or those other -- that other incident in Nuseirat, we've seen quite horrifying footage, which we can't show. It's so horrifying of cats feeding on bodies following alleged Israeli operations there. That -- you know, so many dramatic occurrences in this corner the world, be it with the war and cease fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon, or the fall of the Assad regime.

What we understand, or certainly, what the Israelis believe, is that out of the 100 hostages being held in Gaza, 96 of them kidnapped on October the 7th, 2023, around a third of those Israel believes are already dead. And the negotiations that are currently taking place in Doha, the Qatari capital, are designed to try to secure some kind of ceasefire in Gaza, even if it's a temporary one to begin with, in exchange for the release of as many of those hostages as possible. But I would urge a little bit of caution, Eleni, because, you know, ever since the end of the one and only ceasefire that we had and a release of hostages that we had over a year ago, they have been on and off negotiations, been a lot of optimism that we were almost there.

And he entered that plea of not guilty to the state charges, those are 11 felony counts almost immediately off the top of the hearing. And then, there were time for the -- his attorneys to raise some issues, and she brought up a couple of things, both those federal charges and the state charges that he was pleading not guilty to today. She had accused the federal government and the state government of treating him, as she said, like a human ping pong ball by two warring jurisdictions. She also took issue with that very dramatic perp walk when Mangione arrived by helicopter on the pier in New York City, and then took that long walk down the pier with a heavy NYPD presence and security presence around him, followed also by New York City Mayor Eric Adams. His lawyer, making an issue about that. Saying, it could impact his ability to have a free and fair trial here, given the plebiscite around it and the statements that the mayor made. You know, she did bring up the fact that the mayor is facing his own federal indictment on bribery charges, and saying that he should know something about the presumption of innocence. And the judge saying that he will ensure that Mangione gets a fair trial inside the courtroom. And I don't know if you can see, but behind me, there are a number of people standing up with signs, some of them saying, free Luigi. So, there were a number of supporters here for this brief hearing. And inside the courtroom, there was space for about 30 or so members of the public, about two dozen of them young women. No one said anything inside the courtroom. The court officers keep it pretty under wraps inside there, keeping the decorum in place. But certainly, there is seemingly some support for Mangione that we have seen play out on social media since the CEO of United Healthcare was gunned down on the streets in midtown Manhattan. Now, there will be back in court now, set for February. That's the next time he'll have an appearance here. But there still remains this question, because of the federal charges and the state charges of where he will be held in custody. He is currently being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn. Today, there was questions about who would maintain custody if and whether it would be the state or the federal government.

Fans had noticed that Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni didn't pose together for a single picture throughout the press tour, they didn't do any interviews together. So, that is what had people talking wondering, what is going on behind the scenes here. Well, now, Blake Lively has taken legal action, escalating this from rumors of an onset feud to what she says are very serious allegations of sexual harassment. She alleges that she was working under unsafe working conditions, some of her allegations against Baldoni, who was her costar. You see him right there, and he also directed this film. She said that he wanted to add in gratuitous sex scenes that he, along with a male producer, walked into her trailer while she was breastfeeding her newborn. So, there was actually a meeting on the set of this film, which was revealed in her complaint, and during this meeting, they brought up new safety guards that everybody agreed to because of Blake Lively's complaints. Well, as you said, Justin Baldoni is denying all of these allegations. I want to read you part of what his attorney said to us. He said, \"It is shameful that Miss Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations as yet another desperate attempt to fix her negative reputation.\" Now, part of this complaint, aside from the sexual harassment allegations, is that Blake Lively and her team, they are alleging that it's not just that she was working in unsafe working conditions on set, but that after she had brought up these issues, that then she was retaliated again. She is alleging that Justin and his team coordinated a sophisticated campaign behind the scenes to essentially take down her reputation online. And this 80 page complaint includes a series of text messages between Justin and his team behind the scenes. Now again, Justin's team denies this. They actually have alleged that Blake's team was also smearing him and planting negative stories. But here's what Blake, lively told us in the statement. She says, \"I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on the sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\"",

They've said that the two U.S. Navy pilots were safely ejected after their fighter jet was shot down over the Red Sea on Saturday. Initial assessments show that one crew member sustained minor injuries. Here's what else we know right now. According to CENTCOM, the aircraft, an FA-18, was operating from the USS Harry S. Truman when it was mistakenly fired upon by the USS Gettysburg. The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser, is a part of the Truman Carrier Strike Group, which entered the waters of the Middle East one week ago. Now, as I mentioned, this investigation is ongoing, but CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton detailed the types of questions that could be asked in an investigation like this, including what the sailors on the USS Gettysburg saw, what they thought was coming toward them, and why they fired. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: When you are in a zone like this, where there is combat happening at one end of the Red Sea, and then there are other flight patterns that the folks on the USS Gettysburg, the sailors on the USS Gettysburg, have to deal with, it can be pretty easy to mistake targets from one to the other. In other words, is one a friendly target or is one an adversarial or a potential adversarial target.",

According to CENTCOM, the U.S. also shot down one-way attack drones and an anti-ship cruise missile. Now, those strikes did involve the use of the same type of fighter jet, an FA-18, but two U.S. officials have told our team that the downjet we've been discussing was not involved. In a statement on Sunday, Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed they shot down the FA-18 aircraft over the Red Sea. The Houthis said their strikes were in response to American and British forces attacking their drones and missiles. This group has repeatedly made false claims of striking U.S. warships in the area. And again, the U.S. is calling this an apparent friendly fire incident. At the White House, Julia Benbrook, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
