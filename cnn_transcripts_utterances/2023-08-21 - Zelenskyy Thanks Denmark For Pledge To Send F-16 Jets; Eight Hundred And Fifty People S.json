Plus, record flooding and dangerous mudslides in California after a rare tropical storm batters the coastline. We'll have the latest as the Storm Hilary moves north. And we begin right there in southwestern United States. That's where 16 million people remain under flash flood warnings as a record-breaking storm moves past California through Nevada, and up north towards Idaho. Hilary, a real Tropical Storm dropped a year's worth of rain on some parts of southern California. One particularly hard-hit region is the desert area east of Los Angeles. The intense rain and flooding turned local streets and valleys into virtual rivers. The Los Angeles mayor spoke out earlier today saying, despite the threat, the city escaped major damage.

We are standing on what should be a major way to get tothe interstate highway that takes you from all the way from California, all the way to the east coast of the United States. And it has been shut down for a good part of the night. If you look down there in the distance, you can see that there are still cars that are stuck there from last night. We talked to one man who's been out here doing rescues with his jeep, and he said that there were cars floating, semi-trucks that were getting pushed around in the mud, and just if you can see how thick and gross this mud is that I'm walking through, and it's residing -- it's receding a bit here. And you can see that it's going down, but it is still so thick. It's like - - almost like walking through quicksand in some places. And that's what's trapped cars like these here on the side of the road. Those two cars, a black and white car there together have been there since it was dark. We've been out here all night, and they've been there. This black car has been there going on five hours now because they flew by while we were standing out here, passed some police officers, and that's how far she got, and she's been stuck there now inside her car still all this time. That's why they don't want people to come outside. We're talking about so much water that fell so quickly, and the desert cannot accommodate this much rain at one time. And so, throughout the Coachella Valley, you're seeing scenes like this where cars are still stranded, and they're still working to free cars, and also making sure that everyone is safe. I can tell you they had three water rescues while the water was still flowing here, but other than that, it seems like no one has been -- has lost their life here. But just to show you, I'm just going to turn around here just to show you, how messy it is here. You know, people come to the desert, Christina, to get a mud bath, to get that treatment out at the spot in the desert. This kind of mud is not what they had in mind I'm sure.",

And he did because of this debate performance, really capture voters attention. And so, they will be making their case, and both candidates are trying to show Ecuador that they are the ones to lead this country during a very difficult period, but of course, will be leading for a short term because they are just taking over the outgoing president's Guillermo Lasso's final two years -- less than two years in office since he was about to be ousted by those legislatures.

So, I want to our viewers first the latest polling data out of Iowa that, as you can see, shows Trump here with a commanding 20 plus point lead over his rivals. How much are those numbers going to be playing into Trump's decision to not participate in this GOP debate? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, there's a huge part of why they decided not to participate in the debate. You know, this is something that Trump himself has said that because he had such an enormous lead, why would he go out there and risk it by getting on the debate stage? But when I talked to his advisors earlier today, they really laid this out for me. They talked about how they do believe that there is some risk in him not going. And that also means that there could be someone having a moment, getting a viral clip, getting some kind of rise, stealing the limelight in some way. However, when they look at those polling numbers, particularly the numbers you just showed, was such an enormous lead there by Donald Trump, they believe that even if another candidate was to have some sort of moment, that they wouldn't be able to catch up to the former president. So, that's what they're banking on. The other thing that I'm told by these advisors that played into him not showing up tonight or, excuse me, on Wednesday night is that they believe that if Trump was there on the stage, he would automatically become the punching bag. Now, they still believe that he will be the center of a lot of the insults that are slung around. He will still be a huge topic of conversation, but they believe optics-wise, it was better for him not to be there. They also are hopeful that without Donald Trump on the stage, that Ron DeSantis, Florida Governor, will be thrust into the spotlight and likely face more attacks, that's something that we know political advisors to Ron DeSantis have warned him about, something that his team has been preparing for. So right now, what we're watching is just to see how these other candidates navigate this, know that many of them were preparing for two scenarios. One with Donald Trump on the stage and one without, is anyone able to actually get any traction? As you show these latest poll numbers, you see that even Ron DeSantis is he was trailing Trump, but is next in line here in terms of rivals, that is still a 20-point difference, and some of the other polls have that margin even wider. So, is there an opportunity for some of these lesser-known candidates, some of these candidates that are polling at lower numbers, to actually get some traction with the voters to have again that moment? And that's something that's common in these debates. That is what these candidates are seeking, trying to get to know the American people and get the American people to know them.",

The White House later said that he didn't hear the question, but there was five days there of silence before he made another comment about the tragedy here. He's known as the Consoler in Chief, given all the personal tragedy in his life. So, he has some making up to do, and I'm sure that he will when he meets with people. He's scheduled to fly over Lahaina town here to survey the damage, maybe up in the Kula as well, and then actually walk the streets, Front Street of Lahaina later with officials before meeting with survivors and first responders in the main shelter here in Maui. A lot of questions, but the federal response right now is all hands on deck. A thousand personnel, seven million dollars in support, they're putting up people in luxury hotel rooms, FEMA is paying the bills for that. The president also expected to name a veteran FEMA official to be the permanent recovery commander here on Maui for the foreseeable future, maybe years. But when it comes to that number, the missing, that's -- that is what's so complicated for people here. The mayor of Maui saying last night that the original list of the missing was well over 2,000, but thanks to the FBI, they'd whittled it down to 850. That was a big drop when the governor told us just a day before it was over a thousand. And so at this point, with communications backup, you would think that most people would have made contact, but we were hearing of people in the hotels asking how do we get off of the missing list.

She is guilty of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others in what the judge described as cruel, calculated and cynical attacks. For sentencing, he addressed the court as if she was in the dock.",

But it's not going to do justice no matter what. She's taken lives. She's tried to take other babies' lives, so whatever sentence she gets is not going to be enough. LAL (voice-over): Today was, for some parents, the first time they shared how they felt in hospital along these corridors when their babies were attacked. One mother described how she walked in on Letby murdering her son, but left him alone with her because she was a nurse and she trusted her. She and others shared how they now live with their own guilt and how they are traumatized that the person they trusted to care for their babies betrayed them in the most brutal way. But she used her position to manipulate everyone around her so she could carry out her sadistic and malevolent acts. Escorted from court, Letby will never leave prison, now serving a whole life sentence, a serial killer who deliberately inflicted pain on the most vulnerable babies. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And they did it with a record number of their fellow Spaniards cheering them on. The final sets a viewing record in Spain with more than eight million people tuning in. But the victory came with controversy. The head of Spain's Football Federation is apologizing for kissing a player on the lips after the team's World Cup win. Video shows Luis Rubiales embracing forward Jenni Hermoso, then putting both hands on her head before kissing her. CNN's Don Riddell is joining us live with more on this. And Don, this kiss has been called inappropriate by many, including Spain's sports minister. I understand Rubiales has issued an apology, which, depending on how you read it, could read like a non-apology. Just give us the context around why this has sparked so much criticism and the back story, really, with the Spanish Federation and these women.",

Many people will see it as anything but and itwill only add to the story around the Spanish team who were already in dispute with their federation and their coach ahead of this tournament, but they've returned home as champions, despite everything that they've been through.",
