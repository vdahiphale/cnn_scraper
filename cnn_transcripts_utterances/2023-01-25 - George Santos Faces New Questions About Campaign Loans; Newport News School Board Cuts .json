The embattled Republican, who has been caught in a web of lies, as you know, previously claimed he made personal loans to his campaign totaling more than $700,000. But in new filings with the Federal Election Commission, Fox is indicating that loans of $500,000 and $125,000 had come from personal funds. Well, those were left unmarked.I want to turn now right away to CNN political commentators Jonah Goldberg and Ashley Allison, and national politics reporter Eva McKend. Eva, let me begin with you here about these new questions around these loans. What are you learning about the loans he allegedly gave to his own campaign?",

That was in the filing. He also has reiterated this. You know, he went on that podcast with Congressman Matt Gaetz not too long ago and suggested that this came from his personal wealth.In these amended filings, he's now changing his story. The boxes (ph) to indicate that these are personal funds are now not checked. But also, really crucially here, Laura, he's still listed as a source of the loan elsewhere in the filings. So, you know, I don't know if confusion is the point here, but that is certainly the outcome. Our colleague, Manu Raju, trying to get some answers from him today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

After junior high school, we kind of lost touch. We reacquainted ourselves in or about 2019. This case, Christian's case, occurred in 2018, but by the time it came to settlement, it was 2020. And as it got closer to settlement -- I mean, this was, you know, my first large case out of law school on my own. I was excited about it. I was telling everybody. You know, I worked in the past with different annuity companies. So, that's what George kind of represents it. As far as Harbor City Capital, I find so ironic that he says fake news, fake media, disingenuous reporting. He never said anything about Harbor City Capital at that dinner. He led us to believe, led Christian to believe and led me to believe, that at that time, he worked for Goldman Sachs and he was a personal banker on behalf of Goldman Sachs, and all his representations were on behalf of Goldman Sachs. In fact, after Christian -- I mean, so the red flags came up as far as you don't know you're investing in. For me, the red flags came up immediately when I hear $3,000 a month in interest on an investment. I mean, I've worked with several annuity companies with large investments. Three thousand dollars a month is unheard of anywhere. I mean, that was a huge red flag. And then, you know, thereafter, he followed up with Christian, sending confidential memorandums again from Harbor City Capital, but was acting at the dinner and everything as if that he was on behalf of Goldman Sachs. He made all these representations as if he was an employee of Goldman Sachs. In fact, when Christian declined to invest, he essentially called me and was very upset. I mean, that was the last conversation that we had over the phone, where he said he was very upset he used disbursements from Goldman Sachs, it was a company card.

But the lawyer for the teacher laying out today the different moments in time when it could've been prevented perhaps. I mean, why did the school not react? What are we learning? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: Yeah, I think the school still has a lot of questions to answer on, after all these warnings, they still didn't find the gun on the student. They had another student saying that he flashed the gun. They had school --other teachers saying, you know, search him, we hear he has a gun. They searched his backpack. But when it was said that he probably had the gun in his pockets, they didn't have permission to search the student himself. So, that leaves a lot of questions about not listening to the warning signs of an imminent threat, you know, even if they didn't think the student would actually point the gun at the teacher, which he did, obviously. But there are so many other ways that a gun in possession of a six-year-old is not a smart thing. He could have shot himself. He could've shot another student, even accidentally.

You're asleep in the backseat of your own car, your husband has just stepped out when a stranger jump into the car and then steals it, sparking a wild police chase. This happened to a woman in Wisconsin earlier this month, and the whole thing was caught on dashcam video. Michelle Baik of our affiliate WMTV has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHELLE BAIK, REPORTER, WMTV (voice-over):  Shown from three different cameras, this is the 4:00 a.m. chase to find a driver later identified as Kyle Wagner. He's accused of driving away on January 14th and someone else's car. In the back seat was a woman who woke up to the high-speed drive. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Columbia County 911. BAIK (voice-over):  This is her call for help. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Hello, I was in a gas station. My husband just get out from the car. BAIK (voice-over):  The victim told the dispatch that she does not know where she is, but then he heard her talking with Wagner. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  No, no, I'm not trying to do anything because I'm really scared. You know, you should get back. KYLE WAGNER, SUSPECT (voice-over):  I will. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Please, now. WAGNER (voice-over):  I will. Okay, I'm going back. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  No, you are not. WAGNER (voice-over):  I turned around. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  No, no, you are not turning around. BAIK (voice-over):  According to a criminal complaint, the victim said Wagner told her he was a truck driver and there was a conspiracy that people wanted to kill them so he was saving them. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Why you take the car from the gas station? WAGNER (voice-over):  Because they're following us. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  Who is following us? WAGNER (voice-over):  Your husband. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  My husband. Of course, it's my car. BAIK (voice-over):  The deputy behind the squad car footage cited in court documents. He details how Wagner drove at about 90 miles ab hour and on the wrong side of traffic. That is until a state patrol car used a chase tactic to cause the car to crash into a guardrail. Watch as the car lifted into the air and airbags exploded. The victim came out first from the backseat, crying. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  I am scared. I don't know who's this guy. Who is this guy? BAIK (voice-over):  Officers then took the 51-year-old man from New York into custody after admitting he used fentanyl and meth within 24 hours. Wagner now faces multiple felony charges.
