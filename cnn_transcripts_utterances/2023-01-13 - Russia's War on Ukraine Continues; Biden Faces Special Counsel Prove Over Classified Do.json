Our Scott McLean reports the new man in charge has his job cut out for him.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A major shakeup in the highest ranks of the Russian military. General Valery Gerasimov is the experienced commander Putin has now put in charge of the so-called special military operation. His predecessor was shuffled out barely three months in following setbacks on the battlefield. But the Kremlin says that it is making progress in the small but strategic town of Soledar, where both sides say the fighting has become intense. The situation is difficult but stable, this Ukrainian soldier says. We are holding back the enemy. Nobody leaves the positions. The positions are being held. We are fighting back. The Wagner mercenary group claimed to have taken full control of the area with Russian forces blockading the city's southern and northern access routes. Kyiv denies the town has been captured despite some indications it has lost considerable ground. HANNA MALIAR, UKRAINIAN DEPUTY DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): The enemy has high losses. The area outside the city is covered with the bodies of Putin's troops. Nevertheless, they are moving over their own corpses. MCLEAN (voice-over):  New satellite images revealed the devastation in Soledar: Craters scouring the landscape, buildings reduced to rubble. Local officials say hundreds of civilians are still there, most of them elderly. PAVLO KYRYLENKO, HEAD, PRO-RUSSIAN DONETSK MILITARY ADMINISTRATION (through translator):  As of now, there are 523 people there. It would be wrong to say that they don't want to leave now. We are doing our best to help people to leave. MCLEAN (voice-over):  For the Russians, victory here would be a morale boost for a stalled campaign. The Kremlin spokesman hailed the enormous effort in Soledar, but says that the main work is still ahead. It will only get tougher. For the first time since the war began, Ukraine will soon have tanks after Poland agreed to send the German- made Leopards. Germany and the UK are mulling the same decisio. Scott McLean, CNN, Kyiv.

Perhaps, this might be an attempt to bring some kind of synchronization, some kind of coordination between the management of the Russian armed forces and its command and troops, of course, on the ground. We've also heard reaction to the shift in personnel from the United States.

But we also heard reaction from within Russia. A top Russian military blogger taking to Telegram yesterday to offer his assessment. He has previously taken the lead in offering military analysis of the Russian operation in Ukraine, suggesting that this might be an attempt to stop the Russian command from blaming the generals in the field, from bringing responsibilities under one central figurehead. Of course, there is question around the motive behind the shift in personnel, whether or not this is an attempt to bring perhaps more control under the defense ministry, and also as you have there (INAUDIBLE). We have seen, of course, a more vocal and visible presence of the Wagner mercenary groups.

For the police, this was about projecting control and order, after growing accusations they colluded with rioters on January the 8th. Video shared on social media showed security forces talking to protesters. Some even standing idle as rioters stormed the three branches of power. Former policeman Cassio believe some of the criticism is unwarranted. CASSIO THYONE, FORMER POLICE OFFICER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT RESEARCHER (through translator):  Some policemen ended up not acting because they didn't think there was a risk of invasion. Also, we've had a big ideological influence inside the security forces, right-wing influence. I don't think it was incompetence. SOARES (voice-over):  For the last four years, Brazilian forces have taken orders from former president Jair Bolsonaro. But several sources here tell me what remains are accusations of a politicized police force. THYONE (through translator):  We have research results that show that between 50% and 60% of policemen were Bolsonaro sympathizers. But that doesn't mean they are against democracy. SOARES (voice-over):  President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has called for tough action to stamp out any acts of collusion within the security forces in Brasilia, and he has tasked this man, Ricardo Capelli, with doing it.

CAPELLI (through translator):  What happened on the 8th and today's operation clearly demonstrates that was the absence of command. The previous head of security was traveling. SOARES (voice-over):  The man he is referring to is Anderson Torres. Until December 31st, Torres was Bolsonaro's justice minister. After leaving office, he became head of security for Brasilia on January the 2nd. CAPELLI (through translator):  He changes the core of the leadership, travels, and leaves the office without command, allowing the unacceptable actions of the eight. SOARES (voice-over):  Torres denies wrongdoing and says on Twitter that he has always based his actions on ethics and legality. Despite that comment, authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest. His involvement and ties to Bolsonaro, too much of a coincidence, Capelli tells me. CAPELLI (through translator):  He was justice minister to Jair Bolsonaro. That is a confidence role and one of the highest importance. He would not be justice minister if he did not have President Bolsonaro's complete confidence. SOARES (voice-over):  A damning accusation.

Former labor minister has called on the president to apologize for the deaths of protesters and to call elections before April next year.At least 49 people have died in clashes between police and protesters since the impeachment and arrest of former president Pedro Castillo in December. Amid the turmoil, Peru's prime minister insists the country's president won't resign. We got more now from CNN's Rafael Romo. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The violent clashes erupted in the Peruvian city of Cusco, the latest wave of unrest following the ouster of former president Pedro Castillo. Anti-government protesters threw rocks at riot police Wednesday, who responded by firing tear gas and moving in with an armored vehicle. Video from the scene shows the injured receiving medical aid before being carried off. The turmoil follows demonstrations in the southern region of Puno. Eighteen people have been killed there since Monday night, including a police officer who was burnt to death by protesters. Prime Minister Alberto Otarola condemned the violence during a session of Congress. ALBERTO OTAROLA, PRIME MINISTER, PERU (through translator):  I deplore this aggression against the security forces. And once again, I call for order, peace, and tranquility for all Peruvians. We can't be killing each other. ROMO (voice-over):  The unrest began in early December when then president Castillo was impeached and arrested after he announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. Dina Boluarte, Castillo's vice-president, was then sworn in to replace him. Now, Castillo supporters are calling for her resignation along with prompt general elections on new Constitution and the release of the former president. But last month, the Supreme Court ruled that Castillo had to remain in pretrial detention for 18 months on charges of rebellion and conspiracy, which he denies. The new government won of vote of confidence in Congress by a wide margin Tuesday. A loss would've triggered a cabinet reshuffle and the resignation of Prime Minister Alberto Otarola. Meanwhile, Peru's top prosecutor has launched an investigation into Boluarte and her cabinet members over the deadly clashes as relatives and friends of the dead march through the Peruvian city of Juliaca carrying the coffins of their loved ones.
