The jury is weighing three felony gun charges against the president's son that together carry a maximum penalty of 25 years if convicted. CNN's Evan Perez is outside the court. Evan, it was a big day of closing arguments yesterday. What's expected today?",

And the judge said they would just come straight back into the jury deliberation room and reconvene this morning and go through these three charges. They -- they have a form that tells them the standards, the different elements that they have to unanimously agree on in order to reach a verdict. And those include, of course, the idea that Hunter Biden knowingly violated the law when he bought a firearm in October of 2018, that he knew he was addicted to drugs when he filled out that form, and, according to prosecutors, when he lied in be -- in order to be able to get through a background check. Those are the elements that are at the center of this.We saw the jurors yesterday after about an hour, you know, they seem to have started forming a bond. A couple of them walked out arm in arm as they exited smiling. These are jurors who have been very, very attentive. They've been taking notes during this trial over five days, over really not a lot in dispute in this case. In the end, you know, they're going to have to reach a verdict on someone who is very well known in this community. You saw the Biden family come out in force for them yesterday. Three rows of seats were taken up by members of the community, including an African American church that is doing a prayer service for him every morning, Kate.",

And so I would have done it by saying, you see he has a lot of support. We all know addiction is a terrible thing. You might find yourself sympathizing with him, but your job as jurors is to follow the law. You have taken an oath that requires you to put aside your sympathy and to look at the facts here.

CONRICUS: That's a good question. And I think that the Israeli strategy has been so far to try to get to Sinwar, get to the senior leadership of Hamas. So far not succeeding. Probably because he is hidden underground with lots of Israeli hostages surrounding him as human shields. And so far what Israel said -- hasn't been able to do is to advance fast enough and to get to Sinwar and basically decide the battle.

That means, of course, that they are confident that they have the support of their party moving ahead. But, you know, it is important to just point out what House Republicans are asking for is the audio recording of Special Counsel Robert Hur's interview with President Joe Biden. Now, the transcripts have been released, but this became a major topic of conversation last week when Merrick Garland came before the committee where many members brought up the fact that they want to check that transcript, that they want to hear the president, in his own words. They want to see whether or not he had any pauses. That was something that multiple House Republicans brought up when Merrick Garland came before the House Judiciary Committee last week. We do expect that if they can move ahead and pass this on the House floor it would then put the power in Speaker Mike Johnson to refer this to the attorney in Washington, D.C., who would make a decision on whether or not to bring charges against Merrick Garland. We should just point out that this has been tried by several congresses in the past. Nothing ever actually came of it when it came to the attorney general.
