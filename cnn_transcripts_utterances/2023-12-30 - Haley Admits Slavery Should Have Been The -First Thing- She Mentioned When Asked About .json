I'm Amara Walker, in for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with Nikki Haley's latest efforts to clarify her statements about slavery and the cause of the Civil War. For days, the Republican presidential candidate has faced backlash from Republicans and Democrats for not mentioning slavery as a cause for the Civil War when asked by a voter in New Hampshire. Well, today, she is admitting that slavery should have been the first thing she said when asked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes, of course, the first thing I should have said was slavery. I completely agree with that. It when you grow up in the South, slavery is a given like when you think of the Civil War, you know, it was about slavery. That's not, you know, that's never been in question. And, you know, you look at that, I'm a southern governor who actually asked and got the Confederate flag to come down in front of the statehouse. So, slavery, if you grew up in South Carolina, you know that that's a huge part of history. But you take it for the lesson that it is, which is, yes, that's a stain on our history. But where do we go with it from here? And that is what is the role of government.",

Slavery was wrong, but we need to make sure that the government is out of people's business. Of those two things, in my opinion, it does indeed seem like a dog was -- I mean, I think about the vice president of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens, and I'll just read a quote from it really quickly, Amara. He went on to say that slavery, the subordination to the superior race, is the natural normal condition for black people.\" This is someone who believe that no matter how much education an African American could receive, we would always be lesser than white people. So, when you talk about state's rights, removing government out of people's lives, but yes, slavery was wrong. Those two things, in my personal opinion, cannot go hand in hand.

And then, they would have that map to hand to know exactly where they're supposed to go.And then, they can make their own decision as to whether they want to go or whether they don't go. But what's happening right now is that it's just been posted electronically so far as we are aware, and it's unclear that, that message is getting through. So, people may decide to move or they may not. Ultimately, when they do decide to move, they tend to gravitate towards Rafah in the southern part of the Gaza Strip near the border with Egypt. But Rafah has already received more than 100 -- more than 100,000 Palestinians being displaced from other parts of the Gaza Strip in recent days. There's something like 12,000 people per square kilometer there. We know that there is overcrowding. The World Health Organization has expressed concern about the proliferation of diseases, such as diarrhea and respiratory diseases. And on top of that, prices are skyrocketing for ordinary goods such as yeast, salt, and flour. So, it's a pretty precarious situation that people find themselves in, which is, do they stay? Do they even know that they are supposed to go, and if so, where are they supposed to go?

And authorities found this contraption made from jumper cables, allegedly used to electrocute dogs inside the home of a pentagon employee. This CNN exclusive video evidence from a close case shows two dogs getting ready to fight. The illegal sport has spiked federal interest.

Tucked away in this wooded area, federal agents find the first of roughly 120 pitbulls that would be seized. And what will turn out to be South Carolina's second largest single day seizure of fighting dogs ever say investigators. They're photographed and loaded into trailers to get medical care and shelter.

The owner of a champion dog can make even more money on semen, stud fees and puppies.
