A Gaza official says roads were reduced to rubble, and 20,000 tons of waste accumulated in the streets causing rat problems. Separately in Rafah, hospital officials say eight members from one family were killed in an Israeli strike overnight, including five children.

Meanwhile, Qatar says it will evaluate its role as a mediator for a ceasefire and hostage release talks. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is joining us right now live from Tel Aviv. Good morning to you, Jeremy.

This is really interesting, particularly given the timing it comes as we have launched these negotiations butter and start over the course of the last several weeks. And in just the last few days, we saw a major backslide as Hamas offered less than half of the number of hostages that have been the basis of the negotiations over the course of the last several months, bringing down its offer from 40 hostages for a six-week ceasefire to less than 20 over that same period of time, also demanding more Palestinian prisoners be released in exchange for those hostages.And so, in light of all of this, Qatar is coming under enormous pressure, mounting pressure from the United States in particular, to apply more pressure itself to Hamas, which maintains a serious position within Qatar where Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' leader, currently lives. And so, Qatar's Foreign Minister, who also happens to be its Prime Minister, saying that Qatar is going to undertake a full evaluation of its role as a mediator citing a quote \"misuse of this mediation for narrow political interests.\" And it appears to be related to the fact that the United States and Israel are calling on Qatar to level serious pressure on Hamas beyond what it has already done, and suggesting effectively, as Steny Hoyer, a top Democratic political leader in the United States said, that if Qatar doesn't put enough pressure on Hamas, then there should be a reevaluation of the United States relationship with Qatar as well. So, amid all of that pressure, Qatar saying that it's going to reevaluate its role as a mediator. Unclear exactly where that will lead. Of course, we know that beyond Qatar, Egypt has also served the key role as a mediator. So, we'll see whether or not Qatar's status changes in the coming days and weeks.",

We'll check back with you.All right. It could be Democrats that save the Republican House Speaker's job. That's the question after Mike Johnson announced plans to hold a vote this Saturday on four separate foreign aid bills. The separate bills are aimed at satisfying far-right House Republicans, but Johnson says he will combine them before sending them to the U.S. Senate. And that may further anger right-wing Republicans who already want to fire him over his handling of the issue. If a motion to oust Johnson is put forth, he may have to reach out to the Democrats to keep him on the post. Lauren Fox is joining us now from Capitol Hill with more on this story. Lauren, Speaker Johnson seems to be on the brink of maybe losing his job, or maybe there is going to be an incredible save. So, why are some of these far-right Republicans so unhappy with him?",

And despite the fact that Johnson has tried to make this bill look slightly different than what the Senate passed, the reality is it's largely the same with a couple of small tweaks. One of those is the process of having this $10 billion loan program for Ukraine. The argument from Johnson is that this is an important development in this process. This is something that Donald Trump had suggested he was interested in. But, the problem for hardliners is that $10 billion loan is forgivable. The administration, Joe Biden, the President, can unilaterally decide to forgive that loan in about two years' time. That is not good enough for many hardliners.But, underscoring all of this is the fact that nothing may have been good enough for those hardliners when it came to Ukraine aid. This package is roughly $95 billion. $61 billion of it is going to Ukraine. And the expectation is that Johnson is going to need Democrats over the course of the next several days to get this to the floor and a procedural vote known as a rule vote. It's also expected he is going to need Democrats to pass this. It's also expected that he may need Democrats to save his job. There are already two Democrats who have publicly said that they would be willing to help Mike Johnson that they do not want to see the House devolve into the kind of chaos, a three-week Speaker race that they saw after Kevin McCarthy lost his job in October. But, the question then becomes, how effective can Mike Johnson be as a Republican Speaker? Does he want to stay in the job if Democrats were required to save him? These are all questions that depend on whether or not Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Republican who has been expressing frustration with Johnson for weeks, whether she actually moves forward with some kind of effort to oust him. She could bring that resolution. It's privileged at any time. But, she has not tipped her hat as to whether or not she is definitely going to do that. And if she does do it, just win.",

It is day three of jury selection. Seven jurors are already in place, and the judge thinks he may have enough jurors to allow opening statements to begin on Monday. Trump has complained about how fast the jury is being seated, and also says his defense team should be allowed to strike any juror that it wants to, even though that is not how jury selection is working, or works in this court.For some expert analysis of all of this, let's bring in Legal Analyst and Trial Attorney, Misty Marris. All right. There you go, Misty. Good to see you. So -- all right. So, he doesn't like that it's happening so fast. But, there are limitations to being able to strike jurors or prospective jurors. Also, many thought that this would be a very lengthy process, even weeks, but now, possibly within a week you may have all 12 jurors and six alternates seated.

It's one of the most highly publicized trial when you've got Donald Trump. There is not a soul on the planet in the world who doesn't know who he is, and have heard about some of his other legal troubles and other issues in this case.However, the reason that this is going so much faster is that the judge is doing something unique. When the jury pool comes in, he is asking that pool, who in here cannot go through this trial without bias? Who is biased in this room? Who needs to be dismissed for bias? And when those jurors raise their hand, instead of what would normally happen where each individual is called to the bench to explain the root of their bias and for the judge to determine whether or not that's enough for them to lead, he is dismissing those jurors. So, the only jurors that are going through the volunteer process are those that have already said that regardless of their feelings about Donald Trump, they can be impartial and unbiased and listen to the evidence. So, that's really helped to narrow those that are going through the remaining very rigorous volunteer process.",

And so, that's why the judge asked for these justifications. But, in this particular case, if somebody is going to outright say they are biased, it actually ignores to the benefit of the defense to just get them out of there. This is not the trial to have a question mark about whether or not a juror can come into the courtroom and base their determination on the evidence.So, yes, it's moving faster.

Now, here we are nearly two years later.And as you point out, a person familiar with those negotiations telling CNN the DoJ is now finalizing a settlement with survivors, that the details will not be confirmed until the deal is struck in court. This could absolutely mean tens of millions of dollars for the victims. Survivors previously filed $130 million worth of claims against the FBI, alleging that the bureau's Indianapolis and LA field offices initially failed to act on sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, basically failed to act in an adequate and urgent way. The lawsuit really built off of a scathing inspector general's report that found FBI agents made false statements, but they also failed to properly document complaints from survivors, Fred. We should mention, CNN has reached out to the law firm representing many of these survivors. As for the Justice Department, they're declining to comment. But, Fred, all you have to really do is look back to the comments that were shared in 2021 by the Director of the FBI when Christopher Wray called the actions, or in this case, inactions, inexcusable.

MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think it shows that he is well enough to go back to work. She is well enough, rather, to go back to -- for him to go back to work. So, I think it is positive news. You got to remember as well that their kids have been on holiday for three and a half weeks or so, and they went back yesterday. So, I think this was a diary event time for the school term. But, it wouldn't have gone ahead if Kate wasn't well enough for him to head out. So, we saw him arrive there. This is a really interesting project where they take surplus food into this distribution center and then prepare it and cook it. And we actually saw William chopping some celery. Who knew he could do that? They prepare it there and then they send it off to charity. So, he is going to go and see when these charities in London later on, a youth center that takes this food in. And I think the message here is things are OK, and that his work continues despite everything that's going on at home.",

But, it has been very positive news on his side because you saw him coming out on Easter Day, of course, and he shook hands with the public, which signified that he wasn't too concerned about picking anything up or his doctors weren't, and they allowed him to do that. He has been doing lots of work behind the scenes, but we haven't seen any more public events. But, I think people are really keen to see that. He is certainly out and about a lot more than Kate. We don't know whether that's to do with the treatments or how they're feeling. But, they're taking slightly different strategies here. But, they'd be expected to take different strategies as well because the King is the King. Kate isn't yet the queen. So, there is much more pressure on him to keep fronting up the monarchy.",

The move to endorse Biden is in part aimed at countering the campaign of another Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is running as an independent candidate.I want to take you now -- also, some new live pictures there of Donald Trump's, the former President's motorcade arriving at Lower Manhattan for his hush money trial. This is day three of the trial and jury selection continues. Again, seven jurors have been seated. Five more need to be seated. And we're hearing some real optimism for many surrounding the courtroom, thinking that that really could be achieved by the end of this week, which would mean putting them in the position to have opening statements on Monday. We'll continue to watch the developments there and listen for whether the former President speaks before or at some point today surrounding this trial. All right. Between campaigning and court appearances, Donald Trump has been meeting with some foreign leaders before he even formally accepts the Republican nomination. Brian Todd reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Hello everybody. BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Between court dates, he is acting like a man who is back in the White House. Former President Trump had dinner Wednesday night with right-wing Polish President Andrzej Duda at Trump Tower in New York, the latest in a series of private interactions Trump has had with foreign leaders or diplomats. He has basically been holding court at his various properties in New York and Florida, hosting Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at Mar-a-Lago last month, heaping praise on the hardline leader in videos posted on Orban's Instagram account.",

But, it's not just strong men who are queuing up to meet with Donald Trump. British Foreign Minister David Cameron came courting at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. Why this shadow diplomacy?
