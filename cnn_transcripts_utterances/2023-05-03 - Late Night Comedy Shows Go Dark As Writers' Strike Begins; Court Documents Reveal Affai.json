This again is a Russian claim there is a video circulating on Russian social media. There has been no independent verification of either the claim or these videos you're looking at.Russia calls this a terrorist attack and says it was an attempt to assassinate Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukraine says no information on this Kremlin strike, denies targeting Russia, and calls this all a trick. And I do understand Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is in Finland is talking about this right now. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, at that point, Netflix was still sending DVDs by mail, no one really could have imagined where streaming would be today.Today, the writers are trying to get ahead of another technological evolution, artificial intelligence, and it wants to regulate it. They want to make sure that it's not being used as the basis for film and television you know, content that they write and that they have jurisdiction over. The studios didn't really have a counter to it. They sort of, I think, according to the WGA offered a conversation or meetings about you know technology. But they've not really -- there was clearly no agreement on how that medium might be regulated going forward. So yes, it's a big concern for writers that that might take them out of jobs.",

But you know, none of the WGA are saying neither side is on the really length of -- potential length to the strike, but it could go on for a long time. It's very -- a lot of very complicated topics there. And you mentioned -- (INAUDIBLE) -- since 2007, Hollywood has actually stretched out across the U.S. You know, we have major film hubs in New Jersey, Georgia, and New Mexico.
