A close look at what went wrong. 13,000, that's how many e-mail messages Brazil's government says have poured in offering tips over Sunday's attack on all three branches of the nation's government. About 1,500 people were arrested of the Sunday shocking right-wing assault on key government buildings in the capital Brasilia. Brazil's leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and others are lobbying accusations its security forces suggesting police may have been complicit.

      "sentences": "Good morning, Bianca. Well, there's a lot of outrage, a lot of anger, a lot of frustration. Brazilians who voted for Lula are demanding that people be held accountable. And as you mentioned, right here on Avenue, the Paulista in Sao Paulo, this is just one of the many locations across the country that thousands of Brazilians took to the street, not only to show their support for Lula, but to denounce those attacks on Brasilia and really support democracy.You have to remember, it's relatively new here in Brazil, which came out of a military dictatorship in 1985. So for the people who were here last night seeing those attacks on these still young democratic institutions, has been frustrating, saddening, and worrisome. Lula himself spoke at a separate event last night, where he warned that democracy is difficult. We have to work together to make it function. And he also criticized the police and the intelligence in Brasilia where he said they did clearly not enough to prevent these attacks, which were widely publicized ahead of time, but also appeared complicit as thousands of people marched on the Capitol. We all know what happened next, they stormed the buildings, they stormed the Congress, the Supreme Court, to the Presidential Palace where they smashed windows, flooded the floors, destroyed property. All of these because those people who support the former President Jair Bolsonaro say that elections last October were rigged. They say, without providing any evidence whatsoever, that Jair Bolsonaro won. Now, the former president has done little to rein in these conspiracy theories. In fact, he's encouraged them. And instead of participating in the traditional change of power, where one president hands over the sash to the other, he left the country. And, in fact, yesterday he posted pictures from Florida on social media, where he says he was in the hospital to have his abdomen checked out. He's had to do this on several occasions after a stabbing event in 2018 during a campaign. So very much missing in action, while of course, the new authorities here are cracking down on the protesters. They've broken up camps that were set up after elections in front of military barracks to request and demand a military intervention. And now the hard work really starts for Lula who will not only have to set up his new government, but really deal with just this very divided country where unfortunately these conspiracy theories have taken root, reflecting so much of what we saw in the United States two years ago on January 6.

      "sentences": "Yes. So Bianca, you're absolutely right. The Russians have tried extremely hard to capture Bakhmut. The trouble is that the Ukrainians, obviously, realize the value of it and they have it extremely well-fortified, and so the Russians haven't had so much luck there.And so, it seems like they're going for the next best prize on the battlefield, which may be this town of Soledar. And if you believe the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, well, Soledar is almost now captured by the Russians though they have offered no evidence to support that, though, the Ukrainians are not exactly gloating about their success there either. President Zelenskyy last night conceded that the fighting was extremely difficult that in his words, he said, there are almost no undamaged walls left. He also said there was almost no life left and that the town is covered in corpses and scars from the blows. We also heard yesterday from the Deputy Defense Minister, Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister who said that the Russians after previously failing to launch a successful assault on Soledar, have regrouped added a ton of troops and equipment weaponry to the frontlines and now they are launching a new powerful assault that involves a heck of a lot of artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. She also says that it's not just regular Russian troops fighting there, it is also Wagner mercenaries who have really concentrated much of their efforts on taking that town. The head of that group gave a nod to the Ukrainians who he said were defending with honor thus far. He also said over the weekend, why it is so important for the Russians to try to capture Soledar. Part of the value here for them is that this town contains a mineshaft which leads to a vast underground network of salt mines which make ideal places for hiding troops, hiding equipment as well. The other strategic value of Soledar, Bianca, is that if the Russians were to be able to take it, remember, it's only 10, 15 kilometers away from Bakhmut, that would allow them to try to approach attacking Bakhmut from a different angle from the north because, so far, their efforts from the east have not resulted in any success just yet.",

A source tells CNN fewer than a dozen classified documents were found when the President's lawyers were closing up the D.C. office in November. They were reportedly handed over to the National Archives the next day. Mr. Biden's lawyers point out that the President immediately cooperated, unlike former President Donald Trump, who's being investigated over classified records found at his Florida home. Let's get some perspective on the situation with our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, tell us a bit more about what's going on.

The leaders will discuss trade and security and climate change, but migration tops their agenda.

And the Biden administration has repeatedly said that they expect that regional partners need to share the responsibility of managing migration.And they're going to roll out measures that are in line with that. For example, they plan to announce a virtual portal for migrants to apply for legal pathways not only to the United States, but also to Canada and Mexico. They also will be announcing a new center in southern Mexico, that Estacion Tapachula (ph) is a transit location where migrants can also receive information about applying to come to the U.S. or other countries. Now all of this is intended to make going to -- or illegally migrating more accessible for migrants and that's going to be a key issue today when these three leaders meet. It is a significant moment. Again, the U.S. President has not been in Mexico since 2014. So it is an important summit that comes at a critical time as all three nations try to tackle migration in addition to some of the issues you mentioned, like economic development, climate change and security.

      "sentences": "Well, the simple sentence that answers all that is space is hard. This is a difficult thing. Anytime you launch a space rocket, we get so used to watching them. We think it's not that hard anymore. But there's a reason people say it's rocket science because essentially what's happening is you have an -- a craft that is changing so rapidly, pressure, weight, speed, atmosphere, friction, temperature, all of that, that it effectively is becoming a new craft every few seconds.In this case, what happened, they took off with Cosmic Girl, the big plane there. They dropped the rocket as they have successfully five times before. They've had six flights before this one, five of which were successful. Four seconds after it takes off, the rocket ignites and it blasts off up into space. Why did they do it this way? Because it gets them through all that lower atmosphere where you spend a lot of energy trying to get rockets up, and it allows you to launch in different directions. What happened here? The first stage ignited, it made it to space, the second stage ignited on this rocket. And then sometime in there, we had the impression that the second stage had shut down, and it was coasting to its reignition. Now, a statement out from Virgin suggests that this anomaly occurred during that first burn of the second stage. They said they were already in space at that point. So what exactly went wrong? Well, we don't know. They probably don't know yet. They have to go through a lot of data sorted out. But the indication would be that somehow, they lost the rocket at that point, whether it blew up, or they lost control of it, and in some fashion, self- destructed, we don't know. But we know that at that point, that's when they say they had this anomaly and it's something went wrong.",

But it is a crucial one to understanding the situation, especially given the west's reaction to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sanctions that have crippled Russia's economy. Would China run the same risks given its own imports and exports, given its industrial economic power, or would it use those powers to try to control Taiwan without using its military?
