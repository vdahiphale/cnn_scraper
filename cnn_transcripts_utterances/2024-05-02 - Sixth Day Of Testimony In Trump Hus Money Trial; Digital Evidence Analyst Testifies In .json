I'm not saying it's the one that they are employing here, but yes, there's no love lost between the prosecution and the defense, right? The prosecution could extend the courtesy of revealing who their witnesses are. They're not doing that. And they say that they're not doing that because they're worried Trump is going to tweet about them or attack them, try to intimidate them. So the defense is frustrated about that. BURNETT: Now, OK, as a lawyer, can you say how normal it is to not have -- to not be sharing that list ahead of time? And then the second part of that is if Trump continues to obey the gag order by only maligning the district attorney and the judge, but not witnesses or the jury, can they go back and say, hey, we now want to force this issue so that we do get a list of witnesses ahead?",

We're trying to build some good will here. Would you do us the courtesy?Now, they tried to do this before the trial started, and the judge did not make them. So they're not required to. And I'm not going to force them to share. But this is an extraordinary circumstance because you have someone with this unbelievable bully pulpit who has used it at times to go after witnesses in this case and beyond just Michael Collins, also targeted Stormy Daniels, raised questions about the jury.

Again, if this is part and parcel to them getting evidence in or getting specific exhibits into this trial, keep in mind, one of the things that we don't have the best visibility into, as much has been reported about this, as much as Paula and Kara have broken about this from our team, is we don't know every recording they have necessarily. We don't know every email or text message they have.And so what they have obtained, as Daus is kind of explaining right now, about the process and what role that will play as this trial continues to move forward, as prosecutors try and make their case, will remain kind of, I think, the big outstanding question, at least in my mind, given so much has been reported.

Now, you might be asking, why would the DA's office call someone from the DA's office? There's a few reasons.So, evidence, in order to get into court, it's got to be admitted. Now, the parties can agree, they can stipulate to let something in, whether it's even that sheet of paper or whatever else it might be. They can agree. If the defense or the other side does not, then prosecution has to get it in through a witness. So, number one, he may be just admitting evidence. Also, authenticating some of the evidence they have. When you're dealing with things like he's talking about how he analyzed Michael Cohen's cell phone and so on, you actually have to establish that this is Michael Cohen's cell phone, that we know who reviewed it, who took a look at it, and so on. And what he's doing here with some of this evidence is establishing that it is what he says it is. It's sort of called authenticating it. And I think the last thing is chain of custody. This concept of when there is a piece of evidence, usually a witness has to come in and say, authenticating it. And I think the last thing is chain of custody. This concept of when there is a piece of evidence, usually a witness has to come in and say, I know what the chain of custody was from the time it got out of the hands of the defendant or somebody else. It came to me, I put a sticker on it, then I put it in a locker, then the day before we came to trial, I brought it here to court. That's pretty much establishing that this thing that we've talked about, each of the steps it's taken, and that no one's had a chance to tamper with it. So these little people that will testify for 30 minutes or an hour can actually be quite valuable for the purpose of getting evidence.",
