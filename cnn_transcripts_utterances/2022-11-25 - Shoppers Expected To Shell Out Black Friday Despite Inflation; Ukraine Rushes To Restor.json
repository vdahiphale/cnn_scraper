It is good to have you.The official start of the holiday shopping season now across the country and despite inflation driving up prices, people are still out there hunting for the best Black Friday deals. Turnout at a mall in Chicago reach capacity today, forced entrances to temporary close and police to redirect traffic. The National Retail Federation expects more than 166 million people will shop across this country this weekend. That's an increase of about 8 million over last year. CNN business reporter Alison Kosik is in the middle of the action. She's there in the madness at Macy's in New York. A lot of people around you, what are you seeing today?",

These crowds, Victor, they have not led up all day and I'm not just talking about outside here at Herald Square, outside the iconic Macy's department store here in New York City. Inside Macy's, if you walk in, take my word for it, you can barely move. It is just packed solid.So Black Friday, yes, it is the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season and it is expected, despite higher inflation. It is expected to be one of the biggest shopping days of the year with 115 million people across the country shopping. More than half are expected to shop in store, but interestingly enough, Adobe Analytics tells us that on Thanksgiving when people were supposed to be eating their dinners, they were shopping as well on their phones, $5.2 billion spent just in one day on Thanksgiving online. Now a lot of shoppers I'm talking with they tell me this year is a little different because it requires a little more strategy because of the elephant in the room, it's called inflation. It's cutting into their spending power. So lots of shoppers I'm talking with are telling me they are sticking to their budgets. They are taking a look at deals and discounts and making sure that they sort of navigate that C to figure out which deals are good enough to buy those gifts for the friends and family they want to buy for.  The NRF, the National Retail Federation, is pretty positive about how the holiday's shopping season will turn out, saying that spending should rise by 8 percent. Adding up to about $960 billion for the month of November and December, Victor.",

A cruise ship passenger is alive and responsive after going overboard and staying alone in the water floating there for hours. The man's sister says that she last saw him Wednesday night onboard the Carnival Valor, it was around 11 pm. They were sailing from New Orleans to Mexico. Well, yesterday afternoon the Coast Guard launched a search effort. That's when crews spotted him and pulled him to safety. Let's bring it out in Nick Valencia to tell us the rest of the story. Incredible to hear that for up to 20 hours this man was just floating and waiting, what do we know about the passenger and how we survived?",

The U.S. Coast Guard says that he was a passenger on the U.S. cruise ship, the Carnival Valor, which was scheduled to take off on Wednesday from New Orleans, five- day cruise. They were on their way to Cozumel, Mexico.And it was at 11 pm Wednesday night that this 28-year-old was at the bar with his sister when he tells her that he was going to the restroom. He never came back. His sister went to bed that night didn't report him missing until noon the next day. The cruise ship searched the vessel, they couldn't find him so at that point they reported it to the Coast Guard and a search and rescue operation was launched. The vessel, actually, the cruise ship stopped in its tracks rerouted and retraced its route to try to participate in that search and rescue to find him. He was eventually spotted floating in the Gulf of Mexico which had about 70 degree temperature waters by a vessel, crew members from a separate vessel, he was hoisted up by the U.S. Coast Guard transported to a local hospital in New Orleans where he was treated. He said to be in stable condition and it is just crazy to think about him being in the water for up to 20 hours as Victor mentioned and this is what the Coast Guard had to say in an interview with CNN earlier this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. SETH GROSS, SEARCH &amp; RESCUE MISSION COORDINATOR, U.S. COAST GUARD: He was able to identify his name, confirmed that he was the individual that fell overboard. He was showing signs of hypothermia, shock, dehydration. But like I said, he was ambulatory, communicative, but gave really no clear indication of why he fell overboard.",

The city of Chesapeake says this note was found on the shooter's phone. The note discusses God, the Holy Spirit and how the author felt that his associates at work were mocking him.Here's one passage from that note: \"The associates gave me evil twisted grins, mocked me and celebrated my downfall the last day that's why they suffer the same fate as me.\" Here's another: \"I wish I could have saved everyone from myself. My God, forgive me for what I'm going to do.\" The note also discusses how the author wished his parents had paid closer attention to what he calls his social deficits. And he said that he felt like he was \"led by Satan.\" Now the note says this attack was not planned, but the fact that there even was a note discussing what he was going to do suggests that maybe at least some planning was involved here and city officials say the shooter's name is Andre Bing that he used a nine millimeter handgun that was purchased locally on the morning of the attack, Victor.",

Erik Cantu was released from the hospital there this week. Nearly two months after the 17-year-old was shot in his parked car unarmed, he was eating in the car. A former San Antonio police officer has been charged with two counts of aggravated assault by a public servant. He said he thought he recognized Cantu's car from a previous call. Cantu's family writes on a GoFundMe page, we didn't know what the future held weeks back. Today we know with faith and prayers, family love amazing doctors and nursing staff along with tons of future rehabilitation, that our miracle stands a chance. Today is Mother's Day in Russia and President Vladimir Putin met with some mothers of Russian soldiers sent to fight in Ukraine. They gathered at Putin's official residence where he told them that nothing can replace the loss of a son. Well, this month the U.S. said it's likely Russia and Ukraine each have suffered about 100,000 wounded or killed troops from Putin's war. Satellite images, look at this, they show how much Ukraine's electrical system has been impacted from Russia strikes this year. The image on the left is from January. The one on the right is from this month. The major hits to Ukraine's energy networks are happening as winter sets in. CNN's Sam Kiley joins us now from Ukraine. How is Ukraine coping with or trying to compensate for this repeated loss of power?",

The swarm attacks using masses of cruise missiles, 70 they say, 70 plus in the last wave a few days ago, Victor, and they're aiming at - the Russians are aiming at breaking down the energy system here in Ukraine.Now, the Ukrainians are being remarkably resilient, they are now saying that they're hoping to get Kyiv pretty much up and running by tomorrow, even managing to connect Kherson City to the national grid. That's been disconnected now for many months after the Russians cut them off, destroyed the links and then on their way out of the city destroyed the generating capacity in that city, so close to a miracle there. The problem is, though, that even if they get it all back and kind of gerrymander to jerrybuilt to fix, it's not at full capacity, that is two years away. They say they simply cannot get the equipment anywhere in the world to repair their network back to a pristine level, but they are proving capable of getting it back. But every time they get it back, the country goes into scheduled cuts as they try to - power cuts as they tried to reroute electricity around the country, servicing the most important sectors, hospitals, public transport and so on. And the Russians know that every time they launch these mass missile attacks, they can degrade it that little bit further. Winter has not really set in, in earnest. They're as - they could plummet the temperatures at any moment. We could expect it to go down by a very significant level. We're above freezing at the moment and that is when things will become critical.",

NASA is circling around the moon taking those pictures and now it's going to get to this, what they call the distant retrograde orbit. And it's a kind of orbit that nobody's ever tried before and it's going to be essential to sort of having a human deep space capacity. So just like it took people a long time to figure out how to build the Pulaski Skyway in Jersey, which is, this long, elevated highway, the same thing is going on with NASA right now. They're about to try this new part of space to see how - will it be stable, will it be the kind of orbit that we could really use to maybe capture asteroids and park them.
