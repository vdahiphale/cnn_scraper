I'm Fredricka Whitfield in Washington, D.C.And we begin this hour with exclusive new reporting on the investigation into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Sources tell CNN that Georgia prosecutors now have text messages and e-mails directly connecting Trump's legal team to a voting system breach in Coffee County, Georgia, in January 2021. This comes as the district attorney investigating Trump in Georgia appears to be close to an indictment. Fulton County district attorney Fani Willis is expected to seek charges against more than a dozen people. And if she brings charges against the former president, it will be the fourth indictment of Trump since being voted out of office. CNN's Zachary Cohen on these stunning new developments now linking Trump's legal team to a voting system breach in a rural Georgia county. So, Zach, tell us all that you know.",

But we're learning that prosecutors here in Georgia have text messages that do connect members of Trump's legal team to the breach that happened in the Coffee County elections office where operatives that were hired by lawyers like Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani did gain access to voting systems in Coffee County on January 7th, 2021.But really what these text messages do is they show you the process and the planning that went in to this breach and how Trump attorneys were helping coordinate efforts to get access to this voting system in this rural Republican county. Now Rudy Giuliani is somebody who his lawyers vehemently denied that he had any involvement, actually pointing the finger at fellow former Trump attorney Sidney Powell saying that he had nothing to do with the breach in Coffee County, but these text messages do show that lawyers working for Rudy Giuliani were involved in that planning process. There's one that even mentions the mayor, which is something that we've seen operatives that have been working for the Trump campaign refer to Rudy Giuliani as in other communications. So really connecting some of the dots here and really drawing a more direct line between former President Donald Trump's attorneys and this breach that happened in Coffee County that is part of the Fani Willis investigation.",

It's not just the building that they're protecting but the very visible face behind this investigation, the prosecutor, the lead prosecutor Fani Willis. She has received, according to a source with knowledge of Atlanta law enforcement movements, additional security protection near her home. And Willis has recently also urged local officials to stay vigilant about possible security threats. In an e-mail obtained by CNN, she shared messages, sexualized and violent and racist messages that she had received, and included she also mentioned obscene voicemails that she had received. [16:05:13] Now, the man in charge of the security measures here is the sheriff of Fulton County. That is Patrick Labat. He says that his team is prepared and what helps with the legal woes really that Donald Trump has faced is that he's been able to take notes, the sheriff, in New York and D.C. and Miami, and he's coming back here and making sure that their security is solid.

It's so plainly something that a campaign can't get involved in. And we might have thought before then it had been on the ground, people who didn't know one from the other, but Giuliani, Powell, that really puts it up very high. And the third point is, nothing like it is in Jack Smith's indictment and this becomes one of the several details we expect to see from Fani Willis that will supplement and kind of reinforce the broad charges that Jack Smith has brought on the federal side. WHITFIELD: And is it your view because we're talking about, you know, the highest of the levels among, you know, Trump's legal team that would allegedly be involved here, is it your thinking that the prosecutors may have already connected any dots between them and any possible directives from Trump himself?",

Now, they're calling for 14 to 21.In terms of hurricanes, the previous forecast called for five to nine. Now, we're up to six to 11. In an average year, we would typically have 14 total named storms and seven hurricanes. So, why the change? Well, a lot of that really comes down to extremely warm sea surface temperatures. In some of these areas, they've been record-breaking extreme warmth, especially across portions of the Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Caribbean. However, here's the counter to that. Air also headed into an El Nino pattern. And, traditionally, in an El Nino pattern, the jet stream shifts farther south. When it does that, it begins to increase wind shear across the main development region, really suppressing a lot of tropical activity. In addition to that, you also tend to have fewer storms that will even form in the eastern portion of the Atlantic. So, traditionally, in an El Nino year, we would see those numbers go back down. But because of those warm ocean temperatures, this is where NOAA is saying, no, we think these numbers are really going to start to tick up. And keep in mind, we have yet to even get to the peak portion of the season. Statistically speaking, September 10th is the peak portion of the season. But, really, the back half of August, all of September, and even creeping into October, is when we really see the bulk of activity. We've already had four named storms so far this season. We typically don't get to that fourth named storm until mid-August. So, we're already slightly ahead of pace, even before we get into the peak season. So, the two main factors here really going to be focused over the next few months is how strong of an El Nino sets in, and how warm do those ocean temperatures actually remain. But the key takeaway is, remember, folks, it only takes one landfalling storm for it to be an impactful season.",

We have designed a van like a clinic. Depending on the person's condition, if the doctor needs additional labs work done, we have some point of care labs that we do in the van. We have medications. And so, it's like a one-stop shop for people. Up to date, we've served over 4,000 people. So, imagine if we had two or three vans. Our vision is to really expand.
