We'll bring you some of those remarks live in just a few moments.But in the meantime, joining me now, PBS NewsHour White House Correspondent Laura Barron-Lopez and New York Times White House Correspondent Zolan Kanno-Youngs. They're both CNN political analysts. Guys, thanks so much for being here. And we were just talking about this Iowa poll during the commercial break, and we could put that up on screen again and chat about it. I mean, I suppose -- I mean, first of all, the Des Moines Register, I always take their polling as being kind of the gold standard in our line of work and maybe it'll be a little off and maybe she won't win, but I always look at battlegrounds and trend lines in the last couple of weeks of the campaign and it just looks like, Laura, that the numbers are just sort of maybe inching in her direction a little bit. Who knows, we'll find out. But when you see something like Iowa, it sort of makes it feel that way. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ EXACTLY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  Exactly. Especially because when you look at the details of that poll, it shows that women over the age of 55 are moving towards her or are voting for her in double digit numbers. And so, that's really what the Harris campaign is betting on, is that women across the board -- across age demographics, it's not just those over the age of 55 and across race and ethnicity, that all of them are going to turn out more for her than for Donald Trump. And especially in states like Arizona and Nevada, they hope that in addition to that, the abortion ballot initiatives will help encourage more women and more voters to support Harris.",

I mean, that may be having an effect there that we just didn't pick up on until now.ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Right, right. Look, there's a lot we don't know here. And just when you see a poll like this, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's -- it means that the vice president might win Iowa here. We don't. However, you can pull big picture trends here. And for a campaign and a party that has made reproductive rights such a centerpiece of their messaging, you know, this has got to be positive news for you here, and it may be an indicator that it is moving woman in rural areas across, you know, the span of age as well. Especially as you have a campaign that's now trying to focus on these battleground states, not just in the cities in them as well, but expanding it to rural counties. This has got to be affirming. And remember, also, we have a gender divide in this election as well. And if this poll is indicating that some of that messaging has energized women in a place like Iowa, that's got to be positive news for the campaign.",

One of the more important states when it comes to the Electoral College. We're going to see in a couple days if that Madison Square Garden event, you know, was a pivotal moment for galvanizing a very crucial voting bloc in this election.",

He's claimed there's no verification for overseas or military ballots, there is. But make no mistake, these baseless claims are a major challenge for election officials, especially in the battleground State of Arizona. Its top election officials, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes joins me now.Mr. Secretary, as always, great to be with you. Thanks for coming on. What are you battling right now in terms of election misinformation? ADRIAN FONTES (D), ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, Jim, there's all kinds of stuff out there, particularly the notion that early voting is somehow nefarious. We've got a heck of a lot more Republicans using early voting in Arizona, and we kind of always have. That and you know, some other things that we're currently -- in fact, as of not too many hours ago, working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Critical Infrastructure Security Agency, CISA, on some misinformation that has very recently popped. We're going to be attacking all of this and we're going to be attacking it with the truth and the fact that American elections and Arizona's elections have been secured free and accountable for a very long time. they remain so in spite of the conspiracy theories and the lies.",

It's Russia, it's China, it's Iran. They want us to distrust one another. They want us to hate one another as Americans. They know they cannot defeat us economically. They know they cannot defeat us militarily. But the only way they can do it is to turn us against one another. And we've got plenty of examples of this coming from our foreign adversaries.

Recall that last week, a comedian referred to Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage at Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden. Trump still is not disavowed that insulting comment and veteran TV journalist Geraldo Rivera is now correspondent at large at News Nation, and Geraldo has some thoughts on all of this.Geraldo, you and I covered a lot of these campaigns. I'm just curious what you think about all this, because, I mean, when this -- these races are this tight, anything really can change the numbers a little bit. We saw that happen with Superstorm Sandy in 2012. We saw in 2016 the Comey letter changing the outcome of that race potentially. And is it possible that this insult was a game changing moment for Kamala Harris?",

You know, they -- those on the Island, the 3 million plus can't vote for president, but the 5 million plus here in the mainland certainly can, and I -- every indication is that they will be.

I wish he had not, you know, insulting immigrants as vermin and animals, poisoning the blood of the country, you know, genetically predisposed to murder.
