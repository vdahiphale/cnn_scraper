A searing hot summer breaking records and bringing home the reality of climate change. Britain's second largest city, Birmingham effectively declares itself bankrupt. And still rocking in their golden years, the Rolling Stones releasing their first album of new music in 18 years. Live from Dubai, it is Wednesday, September 6th. I'm Eleni Giokos. I'm in for Richard Quest. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. A very warm welcome to the show, everyone. And tonight, new data showing it has been the hottest summer ever recorded with extreme temperatures causing havoc across the world. The EU's Copernicus program says global average temperatures were significantly above the previous record. Estimates showed July and August were 1.5 degrees warmer than pre-industrial levels. Now climate scientists have long warned humanity must avoid heating the planet by more than 1.5 Celsius or the consequences could be catastrophic. The impact is being felt everywhere. The temperature in Beijing climbed above 40 degrees Celsius in June, and one town in northwest China shattered the country's all-time heat record hitting 52.2 Celsius, that is 126 degrees Fahrenheit. Meanwhile, in Spain, the Catalonia region clocked up its highest ever temperature of 45 degrees Celsius. Bill Weir is with me now, hopefully, to break down some of these numbers and what they mean for the world going forward. Bill, always great to see you. Look, we've had -- we have been having these discussions over the last few months. We knew that we were sitting at record temperatures for the most part of July and August and here we have it now. It has been the hottest summer ever. I'm curious to find out what this means for us in the longer term.",

It is also critical, of course, in terms of the message that Secretary of State Blinken is going to be taking back to Washington, the idea was that he would come here, hear about what was happening in the counteroffensive, and then be able to go back to the United States with that message. Of course, it comes at a time when American support for the continued financing this war effort has been softening according to some polls, so critical in a number of different respects. And what we heard from the American secretary of State was that renewed commitment, beyond the $24 billion that President Biden has asked Congress just less than a month ago, this is an extra billion dollars in financing that the United States has pledged now. Part of that is military, part of that is non-military aid. But in terms of the military aid, this is very much a latest round of aid that is designed to help them on the frontlines of this counteroffensive. So what we're talking about are the Pentagon's own stocks of things like air defense system components, munitions, all kinds of different forms of ammunition. That's one thing that the Ukrainians have been asking for over and over again, and more and more of. Also, multiple launch rocket system or HIMARS. They are providing extra support exactly targeted to what Ukraine needs, and perhaps most controversially, what we've now had confirmed is that as part of that package, the United States is going to be just a few months after confirming and beginning to send those controversial cluster munitions, now preparing to send depleted munitions. Now, these will be able to be fired from the Abrams tanks that are due to arrive in the autumn. They're controversial, of course, because what you're talking about is much stronger metal that can penetrate tanks, but because it comes from a nuclear power. Now, there is a bit of radioactivity in them. They are controversial as a result, when the United Kingdom announced they were supplying some back in March. The reply from the Kremlin was immediate, that if there was now that elements that contained radioactivity were being supplied, it was going to look again at its own stance on nuclear power. So they are controversial. Now, the United States and Secretary Blinken has confirmed that this will be part of this next round. And when you consider what they can do, which is break through the armor of tanks, this is really about helping Ukraine to break through those extraordinarily difficult, defensive positions that Russia has put up in so many different parts of the frontline -- Eleni.",

But his swan song was cut abruptly short, he moved his departure two months early following growing scandals surrounding the company. Last week, Australia's consumer watchdog launched legal action against Qantas alleging it sold thousands of tickets to flights it had already canceled. That's just one scandal the company is dealing with. The airline is also accused of sacking 1,700 ground staff illegally during the pandemic. It also faces legal action over its COVID refund policy. The company knows it needs to do better. That's the message from the CEO, Vanessa Hudson to staff yesterday. It knows it needs to rebuild trust with the Australian public and the Australian public on the whole do hold Qantas in high regard or at least they used to.

So Kenneth Chesebro's attorneys said not only he had never met Powell, he never set foot in Coffee County. The state pushed back and said, because it's a RICO indictment, evidence against one is evidence against all. And the over 40 counts, all of them was each in a furtherance of the overall conspiracy. They argue that was to keep Donald Trump in power. As it stands, these two codefendants will go hurtling into the October 23rd court date, just 47 days away. A lot of fireworks today, also insight into how Judge McAfee will handle the case and a sense of the potential timeline. The lead prosecutor working alongside the district attorney in the case said this trial could at least take four months and include 150 witnesses. And that is not counting the potential jury selection. So we're looking at a long road ahead in this case in Georgia.",

      "sentences": "A daunting task to carry out a case against 19 codefendants. And the point brought up by the judge of double jeopardy. The 11th circuitjudge in federal court still has to rule on the motion by Ken Chesebro to remove his charges from state court and put them in federal court. Those coming from the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, trying to change his case from state to federal court, arguing he was operating under his official government capacity. So he should have his criminal proceedings moved to federal court in an effort to get the charges dismissed. We're looking at a judge still not making a decision. So the judge here today bringing up the point, saying the state could be looking at the potential for double jeopardy and a judge ruling in the middle of a trial going on. That's a fascinating point and it's going to take a really long time to get 19 people to coordinate schedules. Four indictments in the last five months for Trump and he has a lot of court dates on his schedule. That is causing a delay here, his attorneys trying to get the court case here, trying to get the case in Georgia delayed to another day.",

It's also a manufacturing center. We've seen a lot of back-and-forth between the two economic forces in recent months and, as we reported last June, some Chinese ministers banned Teslas from entering the premises over security fears. And looking back to November 2022, the Biden administration, banning approvals of equipment from Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE over security concerns.

They had to close parks; people were not going to them. So that took a big toll on their business. Disney World has also seen a drop in attendance.

They announced its upcoming release at a press conference in London. \"Hackney Diamonds\" comes out on October 20th. The group says it includes contributions from Stevie Wonder as well as Lady Gaga. The Stones may be able to make a little bit of extra money from the album, thanks to some changes coming to one streaming service. Deezer announced a deal with Universal Music today that changes how much artists are paid based merely on their popularity. It is calculated by stream, which is any listening over 30 seconds. Artists with more than 1,000 streams per month will earn double than an artist who is searched for on the platform will earn quadruple. James (sic) Aswad is the senior music editor at \"Variety\" and joins me from New York. I spent a bit of time listening to the song; it's pretty awesome, I have to say. But a lot of Rolling Stones fans will be excited. But I'm wondering how much traction that we are going to get from this? How much are you anticipating? The reality is, for artists who have already put out six or seven great albums, their creativity, momentousness does tend to wear off a bit. Now there are certainly exceptions to that. JEM ASWAD, SENIOR MUSIC EDITOR, \"VARIETY\":  Bob Dylan has had a couple of later bumps in his career: Neil Young has. David Bowie's final album released two days before he died was the most innovative thing he had done in 35 years. On the basis of this song, it sounds like pretty much what we can expect. There's a big riff on it. I do notice that it does not seem to be Charlie Watts playing. So that's a big change for the Stones. But these albums tend to be an excuse to tour.",

And like if I can get somebody to stream it, I would get paid for it and that's ridiculous. And Deezer is taking steps to take care of that as well. One of the data points was to say that -- I think it's something like 2 percent of the entities that upload their music, usually record companies, get 97 percent of the activity. So that gives you an idea of how much trickery is going on, how many people are just like uploading nonsense, trying to collect royalties. And the streaming services and the record companies are getting wise to it. But it is very complicated. It's a game of Whac-A-Mole. So it is a start. And trying to put a number on what it's going to save them or how much more artists are going to receive is illusory. It is impossible to pin down at this point.
