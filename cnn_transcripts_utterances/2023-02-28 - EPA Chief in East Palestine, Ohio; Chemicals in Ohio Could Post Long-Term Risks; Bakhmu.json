There are also the rivers or the streams that run through East Palestine itself that are still showing signs of contamination that they have been on since day one trying to clean those up and trying to purify those streams again.The EPA is here in big force. Now, this is the third time the administrator has been here. They've now moved into a local business in the middle of town, literally the middle of town, and they're preparing for a press conference here. He is going to the scene, the site of the train crash to see what the process is and see what the progress is there. He's going to meet with business owners here in East Palestine. They've been very concerned because this has just been a massive black eye to the entire community and people concerned about the business prospects here. And he's going to meet with teachers and students as well. You know, the high schools and others have canceled sporting events here in the East Palestine area out of an abundance of caution, even though all the air monitors everywhere in town and around have showed no contamination.

He was obviously an FSB agent way back in the day. So, these are people that he knows and people that he trusts as well.And some of the lines that he said were definitely very interesting where he thanked the federal security services for their big involvement so far in what Russia calls the special military operation. Obviously, the war in Ukraine. I want to listen in to some of what Vladimir Putin said just a little bit ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): 2022 was a special year for the whole country and for your service. The FSB units were directly involved in the special military operation. They were solving complex, nonstandard operational tasks here, covering the state border, actively fighting terrorism, organized crime, corruption and extremism. I would like to thank the management and all employees of the department, especially those who acted at the forefront in the liberated territories, in the front line zone, and, I would add, behind enemy lines. I want to thank you for this work, dear comrades. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, that is a very important admission.I think one of the things that you guys said was also, obviously, very important, that he did say that there were operatives from the FSB who have been killed so far in the war in Ukraine. Obviously when he's talking about so-called liberated territories there, he means the territories that are occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine right now. The Russians, of course, say that they consider those territories to already be part of Russia. So certainly a very important speech for Vladimir Putin. But I think one of the other things that he also pointed out, which also really stood out to us, is that he called on the FSB and other intelligence services in Russia to step up their game because he says he believes that western intelligence services and Ukrainian sabotage units, as he put it, were active in those areas that are occupied by the Russians and, of course, active in Russia as well. So certainly Vladimir Putin saying that those special services, as he puts it, very important. And I think also important for us to point out that this really has been part of Vladimir Putin's game in the last couple of days, really in the last weeks, as he's been trying to drum up support and morale among those special services, just yesterday was the day of the special operations forces, Vladimir Putin speaking to them as well, guys.",

David, good to see you this morning. You know, interesting those comments, as Fred was just pointing out, and what we heard from Vladimir Putin this morning. When we look at the fact that he is admitting these losses, we also have been talking almost since the very start of this -- of this war, when Russia invaded Ukraine, about the low morale, about the poor training among Russian troops. They are still carrying out orders. Is there a point that you see any of that changing?",

How do you think the U.S. should be preparing at this point?",

It's hard for me to imagine, Erica, a negotiation with Russia on a replacement treaty. And the way the old treaty was written, there's no more extension. It was a one five-year extension that President Biden did in his first few days in office.Getting to the new treaty would be difficult enough if it was just with Russia, but it's pretty clear that China is building up its nuclear forces to a point that the treaty to make sense would probably have to include them as well, although there are some who dispute that case. I think we have to go into it with the assumption that we're going to be living for the first time in five decades with no nuclear arms limitations on Russia and the United States. Does that mean that we need to go off into an immediate arms race? Not necessarily. I think we probably have plenty to do what we need to do. But there will be a lot of pressure and a lot of political debate in the coming presidential election I suspect about whether or not we need to trigger (ph) a new arms race.",

Here is the problem. The issue is an escalation one. If the Ukrainians have F-16s, they can reach Moscow. And that could easily be used as an excuse by Putin to escalate, to make more nuclear threats and so forth. So, the administration's argument is, right now, at this stage of the war, there's no need for the F-16s.The middle ground, since it takes a long time to train Ukrainian pilots to fly the F-16, they don't have anything like it, would be to start their training now and make the decision later because it would take a while in any case for them to be able to fly them.",
