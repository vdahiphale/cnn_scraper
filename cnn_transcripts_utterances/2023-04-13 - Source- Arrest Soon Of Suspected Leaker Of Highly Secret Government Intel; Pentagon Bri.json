CNN has learned law enforcement is about to arrest a suspect tied to the leak of a trove of highly secret government intelligence, which has embarrassed the U.S. and strained multiple alliances. Today, several blockbuster reports expose who the suspected leader is. The New York Times has named him as a 21-year-old member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. CNN has not independently verified his identity and is not currently naming him. Both the Times and The Washington Post say the man is the leader of a chat group on the online platform Discord and is older than most members of the group of gamers who call him OG.",

We don't know exactly when but it is likely to be very soon. Now, this suspect, this 21-year-old Air National Guardsman, he was apparently the leader of an online group chat on a server called Discord. And he, according to a member of that group chat, who spoke to The Washington Post was the one who was posting hundreds of classified documents on this server over the last several months. Now, his motivation at this point is not totally clear. However, that friend of his did tell The Post that he believes that this leaker was highly suspicious of the U.S. government and believed that the U.S. intelligence community was hiding things from the general public. And he wanted the members of that group chat who were largely teenagers to be more aware of the world around them. Now, once these documents started to become public, members of that group chat, who were numbered in about the two dozens, they were very, very freaked out by this, to say the least. And they did not realize just how big this was until it all started spilling out into the public. Here's what one of the members had to say to The Post. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Some of whom appear to have been spied on based on these documents. Some of whose embarrassing secrets have been revealed through these documents.And then as far as the contemporaneous nature of this, look, I guess it depends on how you define contemporaneous, but certainly one thing that current and former officials have pointed out as one of the concerning aspects of these leaks is how fresh some of this intelligence is. Detailing, for example, dwindling Ukrainian stockpiles of munitions going back just to last month, and also talking about U.S. plans to help bolster Ukrainian defenses going into detail about U.S. intelligence collection efforts within the Russian military, all of which -- the revelation of which could potentially compromise the U.S.'s efforts to help Ukraine and to gather intelligence about Russia going forward. So certainly, U.S. officials are not downplaying this. But the president there does appear to be trying to at least downplay the consequential nature of these leaks. Now, going forward, what's clear is that U.S. officials do plan on clearly prosecuting this case and getting to the bottom of who leaked this information, potentially arresting that person at some point soon, but certainly, something that the president is staying close to even as he continues his trip in Ireland.",

And we're just not going to publish that. That's not the case here.If people are putting information out onto Discord or other platforms, there is no mediation. Whoever has access to that server can get that information. And in this case, it's not clear but from the reporting, we're seeing that appears to be largely teenage boys that this person was trying to impress. So, the information can get out there quicker. And it's also harder to detect than something that goes to a newspaper or to CNN that the publisher takes to the CIA and says, hi, we're going to report on this. Do you want to offer commentary?

We heard from Brigadier General Ryder really deferring a lot of the questions to DOJ and FBI but, Erica, making clear that he calls this and the government calls this a deliberate criminal act. And some of the steps that they are currently taking right now is tightening access to this type of classified information.I want to go now to Evan Perez, our CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent with some breaking news on this topic. Evan. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, that's right, Bianna and Erica. We believe now that the FBI has arrested the person who they suspect is behind the leaks of these documents. His name is Jack Teixeira, 21-year-old, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. There are some pictures there are coming in, I believe, showing some of the law enforcement activity there at the family home in Massachusetts where the arrest was made. This is now obviously in the hands of -- there you see the pictures of someone who's being -- we believe, to be Teixeira who is being taken into custody. The FBI was preparing to do this. They had hoped to have a little more time as part of this investigation. But the identity of this person was made public by some of the news media reports in the New York Times and of course, the Washington Post, which has been doing a lot of reporting on this over the last few days reported on his identity. So, I'm told by sources that the investigation kind of accelerated as a result of the -- his identity becoming public. So, now, we expect that he's going to be taken to a federal court there in Massachusetts in Boston where the procedure will begin to remove him and bring him down to the Washington, DC area where we expect that the charges are going to be filed for the -- again, for his connection to the leaking of these documents. At this point, there's not a lot we know about the exact charges. We expect we might hear more from the Attorney General and from the Justice Department soon whenever they decide to make public the charges that are to be announced. But we do know obviously that they -- as you can hear from that briefing just now at the Pentagon, you know they're treating this as a criminal matter, they believe that there's great some serious national security damage that has been done by the exposure of these documents that the Washington Post said that there's many as 500 documents that they had seen on various platforms, including on these chat rooms, Discord, which is a -- which is a gaming platform. And so, that's of course, now in the hands of the Justice Department -- of prosecutors who are going to be bringing the federal charges against this young man. Again, 21-year-old -- Jack Teixeira, 21 years old, a member of the Massachusetts Air National Guard. Again, those are pictures we believe, of Teixeira being taken into custody by the FBI and by the investigators there who've been working this case frantically over the last few days. Bianna, Erica.",
