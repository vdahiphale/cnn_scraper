And a warning to our viewers, some of the images you're about to see you may find disturbing, including a gruesome scene in Gaza. An Israeli strike hit a school in a Hamas compound. Gazan officials say the blast killed more than 90 Palestinians. And according to Gaza medical officials, those killed were sheltering from the ongoing war, including many children and the elderly. Israel Defense Forces say that compound was being used by Hamas terrorists, but today there is mounting international outrage about that strike. We have our teams of correspondents around the globe tracking all the late-breaking developments. But first, I want to bring in CNN's Clarissa Ward. She's here with me in Tel Aviv. First of all, you're doing a lot of reporting on this, Clarissa. What more can you tell us?",

According to Gaza civil defense, there were roughly 200 people in the room. This is the Taba'een Islamic school and mosque compound in Gaza City.It was a place where, according to Gaza civil defense, 6,000 people were sheltering, many of them displaced from their homes. The blast went off, rescue workers arrived on the scene. And honestly, Wolf, we've been looking through this footage all day. We can't show most of it, because these are scenes out of a horror movie. Scores of dead and injured, including children, which we have seen. The IDF has said that this was a strike on a Hamas command and control center. They are disputing the casualty figures. They are saying between 20 and 25 Islamic Jihad and Hamas militant commanders were killed. We obviously were not there on the scene. We can't confirm exactly, but having gone through that footage, I can tell you there were many civilians among those dead, and that is why you are seeing so much outrage. The other thing we noticed going through that footbridge is a U.S. made small diameter, it's called the GBU-39 small diameter bomb. It is produced by Boeing. This is one of the munitions that was used in this strike. And it's significant because of course, this has been a real issue of contention and debate in the U.S. And it was just yesterday that the U.S. finally agreed to release that $3.5 billion in military aid to Israel. I'm sure this will become another issue again in the U.S. politically and on the campaign trail. But for the people in Gaza tonight, this is really just casting a lot of doubt on the idea that anybody really wants peace at this stage.

Ben, Israel is preparing, as you know, to send negotiators to Cairo this coming week to work on a ceasefire and hostage deal.

      "sentences": "First of all, Wolf, let me give you an update of the situation here in Lebanon. Three-and-a- half hours ago, Israeli warplanes flew over central Beirut, breaking the sound barrier twice. That's the third time in the last five days. This comes on a particularly violent day along the border. Hezbollah claims that so far they have launched nine strikes on targets inside Israel, most of them military. The latest one, the ninth, they said it was a swarm of drones that were targeting Israeli military facilities not far from Lake Tiberias.And so, clearly, the situation here continues to be tense. Now we've heard from officials in the United States saying the strike going back to Sunday was going to be within the next 24 to 48 hours. So people here have been very much on edge. But at this point many are asking, is it going to happen? When is it going to happen? So we're just waiting to see. As far as the talks go, it probably will provide some impetus, certainly to the United States, to try to push all the parties to agree on a ceasefire agreement, as well as a hostage release agreement. But it comes at a very sensitive time when everyone is expecting Hezbollah to respond to the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander last week, and also to the killing, presumably by Israel, of Ismail Haniyeh in the Iranian capital. The Iranian and Hezbollah have made it clear that if the war ends in Gaza, if there's a lasting ceasefire, they will cease their fire. But there's still a lot of pressure on Hezbollah from the other members of the so-called axis of resistance to somehow get revenge for the killing of that senior Hezbollah commander. But of course, many people here in Lebanon are not at all eager for a war with Israel. Many would rather than Hezbollah do nothing and that people can simply get on with their lives. Wolf?",

We have learned in the last few minutes that three of them are were a Venezuelan family with double citizenship, and one Portuguese national.However, not many updates about what could have caused that tragic accident. The Brazilian authorities have said that they have recovered two black boxes. A couple of hours ago, we learned from authorities that the black boxes have been taken to Brasilia, the capital, where they will be going through examination to try and understand what caused that this tragedy. But now it's probably the moment for morning and a moment to take a minute to remember those tragic lives that have been lost. But at the same time, in the last couple of hours, Fredricka, we were able to speak with a few neighbors here.

They've had to other flights that were uncrewed to make sure everything was working to get comfortable with putting astronauts, Butch and Sunny, inside of it. So they really took the precautions they needed to do to make sure it was going to be a safe launch and rendezvous, and it was, Fredricka. They made it.But they did have some problems on the way up there. It's just a test flight. You expect to have a couple of little things here. But it's the problems that they had once they arrived to space and rendezvousing with the space station that they're still troubleshooting now.",

I think for each of them it has been around 10 years since they've had a chance to go to space again.I know them both very well. They're great astronauts and really wonderful people, very dedicated. They don't complain. They do their jobs. They're both military test pilots. So I think that they're enjoying their time up there. I think they want -- more important than that, I think they want the mission to go well. And for the mission to go well, they have to determine what's going on with the Starliner and hopefully be able to return. But I think they're about the job. I think they're maybe, probably more concerned about their families on the ground being without them for longer than expected. But I think overall, I think it's going to work out OK.",

The rivers have just received incredible amounts of rain, and they're still reacting.Here's a look at what's left of Debby. It got sucked up into a front that's now offshore. So again, the good news is a lot of that heavy rain is off in the Atlantic. But look at the footprint of what it left behind. Not only do we have the rainfall totals in Florida where it made landfall, but you're looking at 10 to 20 inch totals in the Carolinas, that footprint goes up through D.C., Philly, New York, even up to the Canadian border and parts of upstate New York. We're still dealing with residual flooding. There's still some watches in effect, and look at all of the river concerns, because we, again, just dumped so much rain into these rivers. They're going to rise as they get aggravated and need to spill out somewhere. For the Cape Fear River, you're looking at it in major flood stage right now, over 20 feet. Again, flood stage is 13 feet. Tarboro, North Carolina, we're not there yet. So again, still rising. We are right now in action stage, but the rivers will rise to moderate stage. So again, some additional flooding, even as we go into the weekend and early next week. Also, some heat advisories posted across parts of Florida and the Carolinas. Some of these people might not have power, so something to keep in mind. Next, chance of a storm developing is already there, a very high likelihood, 80 percent chance of some development headed towards the Caribbean as we go through the week here and look at this spaghettis. We'll have to track this one pretty closely. The next name on the list is Ernesto. That would be the next one that we have to track. And like we've been talking about pretty much all season, we're still dealing what's motion temperatures that are incredibly warm, three to five degrees above normal. That is what fuels this hurricane development. We're also on La Nina. That's also feeling that as well. The National Hurricane Center actually just updated their forecast for the season and we're still looking at a 90 percent chance that it is above-normal. Up to 24 named storms, average is 14. Up to 13 hurricanes, average is seven. So just incredible that we're really only just beginning, and we're already way ahead of schedule.",
