Police say that there are multiple victims injured following a shooting at the end of a celebration rally for the Kansas City Chiefs. The local fire department reports there were upwards of ten victims. We don't as of right now, know if anyone has died. But the shots were fired and police activity led to a chaos scene at this parade site. Police say the two people are now in custody and they are asking people to leave the area as quickly as possible. As all of this was happening, the Missouri Governor Mike Parsons and his wife were both in attendance at the Super Bowl parade, according to a post on his X account. Both are now okay and they are thinking law enforcement for their fast action in this incident. Let's go straight to CNN's Josh Campbell. He is following all of this for us. Josh, what is the latest reporting that you're getting about what may have happened here?",

This celebration that followed that American tradition of the Super Bowl has now been rocked by this other element that has all too American, that is mass shootings. We're seeing now upwards of 10 people have been injured following this celebration there in Kansas City.Now, we're learning minute by minute from authorities new information. We're told that this occurred at the conclusion of this ceremony when shots rang out, obviously that creating widespread chaos as people began to flee, police say that they do have two armed individuals in custody. Right now, there's no indication that authorities have provided indicating that this event was targeted. Perhaps this could have been to people exchanging gunfire with themselves and we have bystanders who were struck in the process. All of that right now, unclear. We're waiting for authorities to provide additional information on a possible motive here, but nevertheless, ten people are being treated. Authority said multiple people were struck. It's unclear whether that ten includes all the gunshot victims or, you know, you can imagine as people are fleeing a chaotic scene sustaining injuries in the process there as well. So authorities are now working backwards to try to determine how this began, why it started, and obviously whether there were additional victims. We've seen on our affiliate coverage, authority is going through clearing the scene. First of all, trying to get everyone out of there, but also looking behind trailers, looking in stairwells, doing they're clearing operations to ensure there aren't other suspects or perhaps injured people who are in and around that area. So still a lot of questions right now, obviously a very concerning situation here now, upwards of ten people injured following shots ringing out after this celebration for the Kansas City Chiefs. We're waiting for an update and authorities, we understand that hospitals around the area have indicated they are taking victims on last check, I've only seen one hospital actually indicate to gunshot victims, but again, were trying to determine the actual status of these injuries, the status of those who were actually transported. And then finally, its worth pointing out if we often seen in these shootings just because someone is in custody doesn't mean that authorities would be able to quickly glean what a possible motive is, Abby. So a lot of work going on behind the scenes right now to try to determine why this happened.",

John Miller is with us. John is the CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. John, you're always talking to your sources as these things happen, but I feel like moments like this, we have to look at the clues that we have so far.

We know two individuals have been taken into custody.As you point out, we don't know that they've been charged. They were said to be armed. But again, this information is so preliminary. We can't confirm that yet. We know that they have what they estimated as ten people shot. I am told that two of those people were in critical condition in that their injuries were more serious than other peoples. At the same time, since we got that report, what we've learned from following the events is that ambulances have come upon people in the street, one who had a gunshot wound to the foot, they have individuals with panic attacks who are hyperventilating and ran. You've got good news and bad news here in terms of in a terrible event, where and how it could unfold. The bad part for everyone is it's a massive crowd situation which adds to the panic, adds to the pandemonium, adds to the lack of clarity about what it started over. On the other hand, it came with a lot of planning and a lot of support. So one of the things that has happened here is gunshot victims and other injuries were taken to the medical tents that had been set up for the event. And many of them triage there where they were able to figure that out. There were ambulances all ready on the scene as part of the medical element of this large crowd event. And then of course, many, many more have responded. So, they had a lot of what they needed on the scene, but because of the crowd and the situation has been kind of very hard to sort out what it started it over n between whom.",

The large crowds causing people to have other injuries related to that, how complicate -- complicated is it for the reverse engineering of an incident like this to unfold? Now, given look, they were expecting 1 million people at this event. That is a huge number of people. MILLERlessons here will be the Boston marathon bombing also at the end of the event, not at the beginning. Also at the finish line as it was winding down. But one of the opportunities they took and you heard Josh Campbell say this already on our on our air is everybody's got a phone. Everybody is taking video. So they're going to end up putting out a call for everybody who's got any pictures that happened in and around this event in that timeline to provide those. If they think there have any value or even if they don't, they'll want to go through all of that. They'll also be going through their own cameras at the scene, pole cameras and whatever was existing there, security cameras. So the video canvas may give them a clearer picture than actually eyewitnesses who stories when you, when you have eyewitnesses in a crowd who see different parts of things.

So, there's no question that they went into this with all those plans in place and that helps them enormously when in a situation like this, something does happen. They've -- the folks on the ground who number certain only in the hundreds, maybe in the thousands depending on who they brought in to help them with this. They know what to do first.

I want to be real specific about the language that police are now using. They're saying that there have been to arm people detained for more investigation. And so they haven't provided any information confirming that these two people are associated with this shooting as Juliette was just mentioning, around area where gun laws allow for of the carrier -- open carry and concealed carry.You can imagine if someone was nearby a shooting, if they try to be a Biden standard or intervening there, that could be someone with a gun doesn't necessarily mean that that person was actually involved in this incident. So to be very specific, their authority say two armed people detained for more investigation. As you mentioned, we are now learning new information about the victims. One person as sadly died, there a possible nine others who are injured, authorities haven't said yet that that includes gunshot victims specifically for all of those or you can imagine in a chaotic scene as people are fleeing, the sound of gunfire our people could have sustained injuries in that process. And so, we're working to determine what the status of those injuries are. Authorities are also now appealing to the public for any type of information that they have -- may have taken there from the scene. John Miller was talking earlier about the Boston marathon bombing and all of these various entities. You know, in that case, I was in the FBI when that occurred. The FBI set up a special portal, a special tip line asking people if you were near that scene, we want all of the media that you have all of your photos, all of your videos. We will be the ones to decide what is actually relevant or not. And that information was critical and trying to identify the people who are responsible for that attack. And so what authorities here are trying to do just the same, they're appealing to anyone and who may have been around there. Perhaps if you were filming the celebration itself, not anticipating that there'll be some type of event, the moments leading up to that could be very critical and tried to determine the movement of the person or persons who may have been responsible. So all that's happening behind the scenes. Finally, ill have to foot-stomp just as I've been saying all along, still unclear right now whether this shooting is actually associated with the actual celebration itself. Police say that this occurred as this celebration was wrapping up there at the conclusion, no indication yet that it was specifically targeted, but you can imagine in the era of mass shootings in which we live, that is something that authorities quickly want to determine in and go after as far as a motive and that part of the investigation, trying to determine whether this was a targeted attack. All that's happening right now behind the scenes, Abby.",

Andy, I want to get to you on what Josh was just highlighting. There are always these uncertainties in the situation, but some key ones one, police are being very careful in how they described these two armed individuals who have been detained in the context of this shooting. We don't know if they are considered suspects. And as Josh has also pointed out, we don't know whether or not the shooting was targeted at this event or adjacent to this event. So given all of that, what do you think we can expect to hear at the stage from police as they anticipate to come out in the coming minutes to give us a briefing.",

This is a state with very loose gun laws. There's open carry laws, basically, anyone over 18 basically can carry a weapon anywhere they want to go.This is an outdoor event in a massive park in which, you know, tickets are certainly not required access to the event was open to the public. So it's likely that there were many people well in the crowd carrying weapons. So we don't know if the two people in custody if police have any reason to believe that they were the ones that fired these shots that caused the injuries. So in order to establish that, they'll be looking for eyewitnesses. There'll be reviewing security, any security cameras that might have been up in the area that might have seen the folks who were involved in this sort of thing. They'll want to talk to these two people as possible that there'll be interviewed and cooperate and explain whether or not they were involved or what their perspective is on the whole thing. So, hopefully, we'll hear some details about these two from law enforcement, although I have to say, we've done these things so many times before, Abby, we all know that the first press conference is often very sparse in terms of detail because its early on in the investigation. And law enforcement is reluctant to disclose the information that they know and they're very actively caught up and trying to sort these details out. So I hope can we will get some insight.

So for gunshot victims, eight other people who were not in injured by gunfire, as we've been saying all along though. And as Juliette mentioned, the number of barriers and barricades around that area, all sorts of danger areas as people were fleeing that may have resulted in something type of injury, but at least right now, four gunshot victims, eight other people that they're saying that there were injured, but not by gunfire. And as you mentioned, sadly, one person is dead. We are waiting to hear from authorities in that press conference that should begin moments -- we're moments away from, not only about the investigation. We've been talking about the nature of the two people that they detained and any information about the motive. But as we've seen so often in these situations, a lot of times after a mass event if someone is injured, they were all -- they will often what's called self deploy or are you report to the hospital? And so the number may actually go up. People who sustained injuries as part of this incident, were just waiting to gather that information. But obviously, a significant event occurring there. Too soon to tell whether this was a targeted type of attack, authorities aren't releasing any information about the two people that were detained, whether that they believe that they were firing going into this crowd, perhaps firing at each other, or perhaps just armed, but had nothing to do with a situation.

After I'm done speaking, Police Chief Graves will give details on the incident that happened earlier today. A few things that want to make sure we note at the outset. First, today, we had 600 Kansas City, Missouri Police Department officers, 250 from outside agencies. We went out today, like everyone in Kansas City looking to have a celebration. That celebration was marred by a shooting today and we recognize that there are some who are injured. We are praying for the safety of everyone. I have talked to a few different folks so far. One, we have spoken to the Kansas City Chiefs who made clear that their prayers are with everyone who was at the parade today, every one in Kansas City, and everyone who was touched by this incident. They also noted that there are players, coaches, and staff are all accounted for at this point and safe. We, however, know that this is a fluid situation, so all that we are sharing now may change as the hours go ahead. We've also received a call from the White House that offered all federal assistance in the investigation. We had federal agencies present today. We appreciate that, and certainly in the days ahead and the hours ahead, we will make sure we continue to do this work. I will say personally, first, a thank you to the women and men of law enforcement, to the women and men who worked with the Kansas City Fire Department and our other agencies. When the shooting started, I like many others, ran and ran for safety. I saw a number of agencies, including the Kansas City Police Department, officers with guns drawn, were running towards danger. We thank them for that. As I was leaving the scene, I saw members of our Kansas City fire department administering aid to folks who are seriously injured without not concern for the shootings and the challenges that were near them. This is absolutely a tragedy, the likes of which we would have never expected in Kansas City. And the likes of which we remember for some time. However, I want to say thank you to those who are making sure that we are safe today. Those were investigating this incident and those who will continue to make sure that those who committed these acts today are brought to justice.

And then the law enforcement officials went there.I will admit you that was much more hostile press conference and I was anticipating you have a thousand police officers there. You have a hardened area which appears to have remained safe, but a lot of people don't seem to understand how parades work. They are in cities. They are open for a reason because you want lots of people to come to them. The idea that there are going to be without risk its not the, is not, is not feasible if you want to have a city parade. It's just a risk calculation that every city is making. And I think that that's what the mayor was getting too. You know, we talk about the victims, which is of course the most important. The other is the social impact of this gun violence, the mayor and the police chief saying this is not Kansas City. We hope this doesn't happen here again. I hope so too.
