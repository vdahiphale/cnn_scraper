Well, it's 9 am in Wilmington, 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You are watching \"Connect the World\". And we are finding out more details about a daring daytime rescue in Gaza. It brought four Israeli hostages home but their freedom came at a very high price for Palestinian civilians. Plus, Emmanuel Macron calls for snap parliamentary elections as far right parties across the continent shake up the EU establishment. Right, let's get you a look at the stock markets, which will open in about 30 minutes from now. So we are taking a look at the futures markets for you, currently, the arrows all pointing lower. Remember red hot U.S. jobs numbers released Friday, seemingly dampening investor's hopes of this Fed rate cut that they had been anticipating this summer. More on that as we get these markets open for you bottom of the hour. Unbridled joy in Israel, how on earth is how Gaza is being described, extreme reactions after one of the most consequential events since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Over the next two hours here on \"Connect the World\". We're going to connect what we know about the dramatic rescue Saturday of four Israeli hostages from a refugee camp in central Gaza, health officials, in Gaza calling it, one of the deadliest days of the war, the rescue of those hostages, overshadowing the resignation of the centrist politician Benny Gantz from Israel's war cabinet. While the top U.S. diplomat is back in this region trying again, to broke a piece. While facing it has to be said increasingly long odds. Let's kick this off with Oren Liebermann, who has more on the dramatic rescue operation and the devastating toll it took on civilians caught in the crossfire. And I have to warn you the images contained in Oren's response report may be disturbing to some of you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In a hospital in central Israel, they hugged as if there was no tomorrow, because for so long, they feared there wouldn't be. Four Israeli hostages were rescued from Gaza in Israeli operation on Saturday after eight months of captivity. Among the rescued one of the most well-known hostages Noa Argamani reunited with her father here. Video from October 7 showed her pleading for help, as kidnappers drove her into Gaza. Her father thanks the Israeli military for the rest. But reunions like this remain all too rare. This is only the third successful Israeli rescue operation since the war began. Orit Meir reunited with her son Almog one day before her birthday",

But unity was fleeting as anti-government protests demanded a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages and a ceasefire. On Sunday, War Cabinet member Benny Gantz resigned from the government accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of slow walking to war for his own political gain. Netanyahu vowed to keep pushing towards total victory over Hamas, the cost of which was once again apparent. Witnesses in Gaza described Israel's operation as hell on earth, inside a dense residential area with the crowds of midday.",

The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza says more than 270 were killed in the Israeli strikes, 700 wounded, which would make it one of the deadliest days for Gaza in months. The IDF disputes those numbers, saying an estimated the number of casualties was less than 100. CNN cannot independently verify these figures. On Sunday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN's Dana Bash, that innocent people were tragically killed in this operation. He called on Hamas to accept a ceasefire that's on the table right now. JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: And the best way to end this war is for Hamas to say yes to the deal, President Biden announcing that Israel has accepted. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Oren, what more do we know about this rescue operation and indeed the fallout?LIEBERMANN (on camera): So one of the interesting elements that we've learned from witnesses with whom CNN has spoken in Gaza, is that Israeli forces went in effectively in disguise, according to those witnesses, dressed as either displaced Palestinians, or as Hamas militants. And that was how they tried to get as close as possible to the apartment buildings in which the Israelis were held in two separate groups there. Now, the IDF hasn't commented on this. And when we asked, we were told that the IDF used essentially ways and techniques, so sort of a non-answer there. But it is worth noting that the Israeli military has used this tactic before, for example, in a raid into in a hospital in the occupied West Bank in late January, the IDF went in dressed as medical staff and as patients to try to get access to the hospital where they then carried out an assassination of three Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants. So this is for the IDF, a tried and true strategy. In terms of the numbers killed here. It's unlikely we can get a better sense of the exact numbers here with the competing claims here. One from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza saying nearly 275 were killed, the other from the Israeli military saying less than 100 regardless of what the number is, it is still one of the deadliest days in Gaza we have seen in months.",

Blinken will also travel to Jordan and to Qatar this week to keep that diplomatic pressure up. This is Blinken's eighth visit to the region since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted in October. And it comes at what is a particularly tense moment. CNN's Ben Wedeman joining us from Beirut for a closer look at what are these ongoing diplomacy efforts and an Egyptian official that has told CNN that Israel's hostage rescue operation this weekend that we've just been reporting on will have an I quote here a negative effect on negotiations to end the war in Gaza.

But our understandingis that even though the war cabinet and Israel authorized the Biden ceasefire, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as Prime Minister has neither accepted nor rejected it. So it's very much up in the air. It's keep in mind that the demonstrations, the very large demonstrations we saw in Israel on Saturday evening, we're calling on Prime Minister Netanyahu to accept the ceasefire proposal. So both sides are having neither rejected nor accepted the agreement. And certainly, the Americans are putting the blame on Hamas. But Netanyahu, we know is under threat from the likes of National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir that, if he in any form, stops the war in Gaza, he will leave his government, his government will collapse. So the Israeli position is very ambiguous, despite what the American administration is saying, but obviously, at this point, with the death toll in Gaza, topping 37,000, this Israeli operation that left more than 270 people dead, more than half of them women, children and the elderly. Certainly the pressure is intense on the United States, which at the end of the day, has the leverage over Israel and can leverage also Hamas via its Arab allies needs to get this deal done because a ceasefire has never been more desperately needed, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think right now, the appeal of the far right in Germany to many people is thatthey are not Olaf Scholz, and they're not anybody from Olaf Scholz's governing coalition. I think most people will agree here in Germany that what this election showed was really that a lot of people are not happy with the work of the governing coalition. The far right party, the AFD, the Alternative for Germany, did get more votes, substantially more votes than they did in the last European election. But it by far wasn't the kind of situation that we're seeing in France, where -- which Melissa is going to be talking about here, they got a little bit under 16 percent, almost 5 percent, more than in the last European election. So certainly substantial gains, but they are still well behind the Christian Democrats, the party, as you mentioned, of Ursula von der Leyen, the Former Party of Angela Merkel, as well. But of course, for Olaf Scholz, this is a resounding defeat, not only because his party didn't do very well at all, and came in third place. But of the parties of the governing coalition, which is Olaf Scholz, the Social Democrats, the Green Party, and the Liberal Democrats, not even a third of voters here in this country chose any of these parties. And if you look at the Green Party, which had been flying high on a European level, in the last European election, Becky, they lost some 8.6 percent. And there are certain trends in Germany that have a lot of people concern, for instance, in the east of the country, what used to be the Communist East Germany, the AFD, the Alternative for Germany is by far the strongest political force there. And then also, and this is something a lot of Europeans are going to be talking about. A lot of young people move from voting for parties, like the Green Party to voting more conservative and even voting for the right wing parties, Becky.",

      "sentences": "Becky, I think first of all, on the question of their support, Emmanuel Macron is remarkablyunpopular President here in France. Remember, in 2017, when he took power, it was by sweeping aside the traditional left, traditional right, since then what has happened? You've had yellow vests protests. You've had pension reform protests. He has achieved a lot in terms of the reforms in France he wants to carry out. But at the expense of a great deal of popular anger out there add to that, things like -- high inflation, cost of living concerns, and, frankly, the electoral success of the far right. It's transformation into a party that appeals to the young, that speaks to the young through the personal showdown about the law that many feel could be. The next prime minister if the parliamentary elections go their way. And to your question on the gamble, I think the announcement last night of the snap elections really took not just people around Emmanuel Macron, but the French center, traditional parties, the French political press really by surprise, given what an extraordinary gamble it is. The fear that it could precipitate what many had seen as the continuing rise of the far right. The strategy behind it, of course, is to take the wind out of their sails ahead of the next presidential election in 2027. Meanwhile, though, should they win, as the polls suggest they might, the largest majority of the other standing of the parliamentary election? And the next prime minister is chosen from Manchester ranks, it will be another several years of cohabitation, as they call it here in France between a French President and a far right Prime Minister. And that really is something that I think no one could have imagined only 24 hours ago before he called this election. The question I suppose longer term is will it take the wind out of the sails of the far right ahead of the next presidential vote or on the contrary, when it simply further their rise, but a gamble that I think took everyone by surprise, and can be partly explained also by the fact, Becky, that really since the start of his second term, Emmanuel Macron, has struggled to govern insofar as he lost his party, lost its absolute majority. The French Parliament that had made it difficult to pass specific bits of legislation. They'd had to resort to special mechanisms, very controversial ones to get their bills through. And a big vote on the budget was looming that threatened not to pass at all. So some say he wasn't throwing away very much by deciding to call the elections, other say it is playing fast and loose with the future of French democracy itself, Becky.",

And there were some surprising gains from parties that had not been predicted to do particularly well, from the left and the center. And yet, what it does speak to our difficulties, no doubt going forward to the European Union as the blocks second group, the far right is going to hold a great deal more sway than it did. Now, it's a fairly disparate bunch. They are not all aligned on things like the level of their euro skepticism, they're not all aligned on things like their proximity to Moscow and their opposition to the continued support in Ukraine. And yet, they are going to weigh heavier than they did on things like European immigration policy and other issues here in the European Union.

I mean, U.S. regulators are really closely monitoring some of these dominant techcompanies are concerned about just how dominant they've become. So we need to watch that carefully, because this is a company NVIDIA share price has just enjoyed a meteoric rise. Look at trade chart that shows what the stock has done over the last 10 years. Just 5 years ago, it was trading just around $5. Then as of Friday's close, it was above 1200. Now you can see the split adjusted price $120. It's been absolutely incredible. It's worth around $3 trillion right, just to put some context around that. That is equal to the combined market value of Starbucks, Boeing, Citi, AT&amp;T, JP Morgan, Tesla, Exxon, Home Depot, and Walmart. Again, all of those companies combined, are worth what NVIDIA is worth. That is just shows how dominant and valuable this company has become. And part of it is because they made this massive decision about a decade ago, to become kind of the brains of AI. And that proved to be a brilliant move, because there's just so much demand for the company's computer chips now. And you can see that it's now worth more than Amazon, more than Alphabet, which is the owner of Google last week, it briefly past Apple. And it's really not far behind Microsoft as the most valuable U.S. Company. And don't forget Microsoft, that's another AI play, right. They've got their own AI ChatBot. They're also under some regulatory scrutiny. And Microsoft owns a massive stake in open AI. That's the company behind ChatGPT. What's interesting is that one of the reasons why NVIDIA has been so successful is because in NVIDIA powers, ChatGPT. Right ChatGPT uses NVIDIA computer chips. And so as we continue to see this AI arms race and investors just scrambled to bet on the next big thing in AI, it all just continues to fuel demand for NVIDIA where their share price obviously has gotten so high that they had to do this 10 for one stock split, Becky.",
