A violent day in the war in Ukraine with a deadly attack reported in the east. All flights canceled at Munich Airport as a mega strike hits Germany. \"Madness and a loss of control and direction,\" former Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid using those words to describe what is happening in Israel right now after his successor, Benjamin Netanyahu, sacked the Defense Minister for wanting to halt the judicial overhaul plan. That, in turn, set off scenes like these that you are seeing here. Mass protests, a general strike called, impacting everything, from medical workers, to universities, to restaurants. And flights to and from Israel's main airport, disrupted. Let's get you more on this with Danny Danon. He's Chairman of World Likud and Former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. He's joining me from Tel Aviv. There have been reports, Danny, that Benjamin Netanyahu will speak today. Do you expect him to do so? And if so, what do you expect him to say?",

It will allow our people, our nation to sit down, to reconsolidate, to talk about the future, and to think about ways where we can move forward with the judicial reform, but maybe to think, what about unity. What we have seen in the last few days is massive demonstrations. Tonight, you will see demonstrations from both sides, from the right and left coming to demonstrate in Jerusalem, in front of our parliament, the Knesset.

But in general, I do believe that the legislative branch, the Knesset, the parliament, should be the one to decide about the main issues in our society, and not the Supreme Court.

Look, you know, frankly, I think he, you know, he's putting a certain gloss on the concerns that many have about Israel's relations with not just Washington, but the part of the world where I am here in the U.A.E. in the Gulf. How much concern is there in Washington, Kylie, over this crisis? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, U.S. officials are definitely not saying that they aren't concerned about this reverberating into something bigger, or this hurting Israel's reputation abroad. What they are saying is that they have deep concerns about what is happening right now, that is from the NSC Spokesperson yesterday, after the Prime Minister fired the Defense Minister, what they're doing is calling on Israeli leaders to find a compromise as soon as possible. And very clearly stating that central to the U.S.-Israeli relationship are democratic values. So, the message coming out of Washington is pretty clear right now. Another situation that we are watching is the fact that the Israeli embassy here in Washington is closed today. And according to the spokesperson for the embassy, it's closed until further notice, that's because the diplomats are U.S. -- I mean, excuse me, Israeli government employees. And so therefore, they are following the instructions of the largest union in the country that has told its members, including these diplomats to go on strike. So, they are partaking in the strike. Now, whether or not we see those diplomats actually out in the streets, partaking in any, you know, global protests, like we are seeing happening in Israel, that's something, of course, that we'll be watching for. But interestingly enough, the ambassador here in Washington, D.C., is staying at home as well. According to the spokesperson, he is following the union's instructions. Now he is a political appointee. So, I don't believe that he is a part of that union, but he is demonstrating solidarity with the rest of the diplomats at the embassy. So, that is pretty significant. And, of course, what we'll watch for today is what more U.S. officials say about this. And, of course, the further reverberations that this has around the globe, you know, closing the embassy is one thing, but when this is shutting down Israel's capability to engage in diplomacy around the world, that is a really significant thing.",

And then what Russian state media has described as an assassination attempt in the Russian-occupied city of Mariupol people, apparently targeting the car of the city's police chief. The Ukrainians would look at this individual as basically a collaborator for working with the Russian occupation forces. We've seen images of a car damaged there. The Ukrainians are saying that there are resistance forces in these occupied towns, and that they argue there is nothing wrong with them targeting the Russian occupation administration in these cities as they vow to liberate them sometime in the future. In the meantime, there have been very serious Russian missile strikes reported by the Ukrainian authorities against two eastern Ukrainian cities. That is Sloviansk and a town called Druzhkivka. The Ukrainians say that Russians used S-300 missiles. These are supposed to be surface-to-air missiles, but they've been repurposed to attack targets on the ground with huge impact. The Ukrainians are saying that the administrative center of Sloviansk was hit. Serious damage to buildings there, at least two people killed, dozens reported wounded, and also in Druzhkivka as well, damage incurred there. Meanwhile, the Flashpoint towns of Avdiivka and Bakhmut are also the scenes of intense fighting with authorities, and Avdiivka telling civilians to evacuate and warning that utilities will be cut off as the Russians continue to press their offensive to try to capture that town.

We'd been expecting it all of last week but under cover of an international break, Sunday night, late, late after the newspapers had already been published, Spurs finally made their announcement, putting out the announcement basically saying that Conte had parted ways with them by mutual consent, but the question is where do they go from here?
