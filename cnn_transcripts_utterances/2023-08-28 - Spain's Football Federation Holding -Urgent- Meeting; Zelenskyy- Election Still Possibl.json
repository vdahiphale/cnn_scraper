The Spanish prosecutor's office opens an investigation against embattled football Chief Luis Rubiales. Also this hour, two key hearings in Donald Trump's legal drama are set to get underway. A record number of migrants arrive in Italy after dangerous Mediterranean crossings. And a gunman in the United States kills three people in a racially motivated attack. Well, an extraordinary and urgent meeting. That is how it's being described happening right now in Spain to address the status of Luis Rubiales. The head of the Spanish Football Federation is refusing to stepdown for forcibly kissing player Jenni Hermoso on the lips after Spain won the Women's World Cup. A kiss that she says was unwanted, but that Rubiales insists was consensual. Well FIFA, provisionally suspended Rubiales for 90 days. Spain's football federation is so far refusing to take punitive action. And add to all of this, just moments ago, we've learned the Spanish prosecutor's office has now opened an investigation. Atika Shubert has more from Valencia. And this investigation that we are just hearing about by the Spanish Prosecutor's Office could end in sexual aggression charges as we understand it. This is Atika's report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Euphoric celebrations for an historic Women's World Cup quickly turned into a moment of reckoning when Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation, planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso during the medal ceremony in Sydney. The kiss, she later said, she had not consented to.",

His motherapparently has gone to a church and is holding a hunger strike until, as she puts it, there is justice. And they have demanded that Hermoso, in their words, tell the truth. So it doesn't seem to be dying down anytime soon, Becky, but a lot is going to depend on this emergency meeting by the Football Federation and what they decide to do with Rubiales. Becky?",

Atika will be back with us in the next hour of Connect the World when we look at the broader social implications of what happened on the podium in Sydney and why so many are calling this unwarranted kiss the latest example of the struggles female athletes face in a sporting world dominated by men. World Sport Amanda Davies joining us for a discussion on that later. And I'm going to talk to a female football presenter in Spain. So we are well covered on this story. Ukraine says it has retaken more areas along its southern front. Meantime, officials say Russia struck an oil facility in central Ukraine overnight. Two people were killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says next month should be productive, as he calls it, in terms of securing more defense packages. Now he told Ukrainian television that he's hoping elections can be held next year as scheduled, although he admits it will be tricking during a war.

Under that martial law, the idea of holding the parliamentary elections that were due in the autumn, or indeed the presidential elections that were due next year seemed extremely unlikely, indeed impossible, as long as martial law is there. And bear in mind, this is a country 20 percent of which is even now in Russian hands. Therefore, there had been from different parts, some criticism that President Zelenskyy might not be willing to hold those elections. What he said today to Ukrainian television is that far from that, more than willing to do it, as long as given the funds with which to do it. Have a listen to what the Ukrainian president had to say, Becky. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): We need a legitimate choice. We need this choice to be made by society so that it does not divide our people. We need the military to be able to vote. They are defending this democracy today and not giving them this opportunity because of the war is unfair. I was against the elections only because of this issue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The incident, which took place on Thursday according to CNN affiliate, CNN News 18, has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread outrage and condemnation. In the 39 second video, which CNN has viewed shows classmates take turns to slap the boy on the face, forehead and his waist. The teacher, who can be seen in the frame, asked for the students to slap the boy harder for allegedly forgetting his time's table. The boy can be seen crying through the video. According to a statement released by the police, the teacher made some objectionable comments in class. She said, quote, \"Mothers of Muhammad and students don't pay attention to their child's studies, which impacts their performance. On Friday, the police issued a statement saying that a case has been opened against the teacher and that legal action will be taken. However, the teacher, Tripta Tyagi, speaking to CNN News 18 on Friday, said the video that has been circulated online was edited. She claims to have been under pressure from the student's parents to be strict with him. She said she's disabled and unable to get up. She instructed the other students to discipline him. Tyagi has issued an apology. Speaking to CNN, the father of the student denied the teacher's claims and said his son has been moved to another school but feels restless and scared. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has blamed the Modi government for inciting religious violence in the country. In a post on ex-formerly known as Twitter, Gandhi said, quote, \"Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like school into a marketplace of hatred, there is nothing worse than this that a teacher can do for the country. This is the same kerosene spread by the BJP, which has set every corner of India on fire\". The state of Uttar Pradesh is governed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu Nationalist Party Janata Party. Its controversial chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, has often been criticized for his anti-Muslim rhetoric. CNN has reached out to Uttar Pradesh police officials for more details.

The protest erupted over worsening living conditions caused by a sharp increase, this time in gasoline prices. Well, at least seven people are dead in Haiti after a shooting at a church led protest. Human rights groups say hundreds gathered to march against gang violence outside Porto, France, Saturday when a gang opened fire with machine guns.

Up to this point, the Spanish Football Federation have stood by their man, Luis Rubiales. UEFA, European football's governing body, of whom he is a vice president, have said absolutely nothing. The only people thus far in the footballing community who have taken action authoritatively have been FIFA, world football's governing body. They have suspended him from all football activity for a provisional 90 days. So what we know is that the Spanish Football Federation have called this urgent and emergency meeting, as they've put it, of their regional members. They've said to look at the decisions or actions to be taken, but we don't really know whether that means we're going to wait an hour, whether we're going to wait three hours, whether we're going to wait three weeks. But we do know that pressure is mounting. Rubiales himself has very much stood firm. He has allies in the world of football. We know that, and particularly in European football.
