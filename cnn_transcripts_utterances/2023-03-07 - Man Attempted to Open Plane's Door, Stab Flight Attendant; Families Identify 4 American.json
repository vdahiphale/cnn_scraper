(END VIDEOTAPE) LEMON: Rosa, I know you know the border well, and I'm wondering how common is it for Americans along the border to go to Mexico for medical care? FLORES (on camera): You know, Don, it happens every day. I grew up in the Rio Grande Valley. I grew up going to Mexico for medical care. When you're a border kid and you don't have money for medical care in the United States, that's what you do. That's what a lot of families do. Now, of course, word has spread, and there's medical tourism, if you will, individuals from other parts of the country that go to these Mexican border towns to get medical care, to get procedures. But I can tell you from growing up there, when you grow up there, when you know people on both sides of the border, the way that it usually works is you have the cell numbers or WhatsApp numbers for individuals who live on the Mexican side. And what usually happens is you call a few people, and you say, Hey, how's it going? How's the situation in Mexico? If everything's OK, you cross. The other thing that -- that I know we did growing up is you also determined what bridge you're going to cross over, based on how safe it is. Now, what I mean is, this happened in Matamoros, Mexico. Just about 35 miles to the West is Progresso, Texas; Nuevo Progresso, Mexico. So Don, what happens in that location, is you can drive to Progresso, Texas, park your car on the American side, walk across the bridge. And just yards from that international bridge, there are dentists, general practitioners. And so, again, there's a lot of local knowledge that is exchanged when individuals go and get medical attention on the Mexican side. But again, a lot of that is information that the locals have. These individuals were coming from out of state. I don't know what kind of connections they had. But again, back to your question. It is very common. People do it every single day.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST (voice-over): The crowd was enormous. A small percentage of them were hooligans. They committed vandalism. We've seen their pictures again and again. But the overwhelming majority weren't. They were peaceful. They were orderly and meek. These were not insurrectionists. They were sight seers. Footage from inside the Capitol overturns the story you've heard about January 6th. Protestors queue up in neat little lines. They give each other tours outside the speaker's office. They take cheerful selfies, and the smile. They're not destroying the Capitol; they obviously revere the Capitol. (END VIDEO CLIP) COLLINS: Of course, many of the people that you see in these videos here, as Poppy was just referencing and as we've covered here on CNN, were actually charged with crimes for what happened on January 6th. Three hundred and twenty-six people were charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding officers or employees. The Justice Department says 140 officers were assaulted that day at the Capitol. Some left with head wounds, cracked ribs, smashed spinal disks, and burns. Joining us now to talk about this is CNN media analyst and Axios media reporter, Sara Fischer. We knew this was coming.

Don just was holding up a \"New York Post\" that shows the \"Tour de Farce.\" This is an example of when you give an exclusive, how the narrative is set for the next day and the next coming days.
