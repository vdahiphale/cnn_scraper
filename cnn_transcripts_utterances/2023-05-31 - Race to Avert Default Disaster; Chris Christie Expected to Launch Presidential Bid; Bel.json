Democratic congresswoman Debbie Dingell says she will vote in favor of the deal.This came moments after congresswoman, Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus said she would not vote for it. Count her as a no. As Democrats are meeting behind closed doors before the House is set to vote on the bill, it needs a simple majority to pass, 218, if everyone is present. The division right now, 222 Republicans and 213 Democrats. Republican leadership had told the White House they could get 150 of their members to vote yes. That's a high mark for them and that would mean the Democrats would have to make up some of the rest. When asked if progressive support would be needed to get this through, congresswoman Jayapal, who again says she is a no, she said she didn't think so. She did not think the progressives would be needed. Let's get right to Capitol Hill. CNN's Lauren Fox is there. As I said, they really are naming names and lining up who is a yes and who is a no at this point, Lauren.",

And they are going to lose some members on the hard right and progressive members, like Jayapal announcing that she was going to be voting against this bill.But this was always going to be a coalition of the members in the middle. And that is how they will get this across the finish line. In a closed-door caucus meeting, one thing that became clear is Jeffries argued to his caucus that they believed this was the best deal that they could get, that this is the option of a default or nothing. And so that is why they are arguing that this is a bill that they should all be backing. I want to just note one other important thing that will happen today. There is a vote on the rule to bring this bill to the floor. Usually that happens with the majority party. You can expect that, according to Republicans, they'll do that. However, Democrats are prepared to help them if they fall short of votes to get it past the finish line. Once they pass it in the House of Representatives, which will probably happen around 8:30 or 9:30 tonight, you can expect it to go to the Senate. Once it gets over there, it becomes a question of how fast it will move. And any one member can slow it down, John. We are we are pushing up against the June 5th headline.",

One thing that the White House has been arguing to people in one-on-one phone calls and in these briefings is that, ultimately, this is an agreement and a bipartisan agreement to avert a default.Since the beginning of these negotiations that were occurring between the White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, officials you talked to have been making very clear that this would need to be a bipartisan agreement. Democrats weren't going to get everything that they wanted in this bill. But what the White House wanted to stress to officials is they need to look at what didn't make it in, that they were able to hold off some of the Republican priorities when it came to even tougher work requirements and when it came to even bigger spending cuts. So the White House is closely watching this later today and then they'll watch the vote that's expected in the Senate. And they've started making phone calls to senators as well as everyone is very aware that this could go down to the wire with the June 5th deadline looming.",

It would end that about August 30th and that means people would have to start back up with payments after that. And they would start to be charged interest after then. The moratorium started in March of 2020 and that was with the pandemic. And it's been extended since then by the Biden administration. The House Speaker touted this as a Republican victory on Sunday.

And it does seem he's gotten to that point. Over recent days, allies have launched a super PAC; that gives an indication for supporters of where he sort of fits into this race. And the person who runs that super PAC put out a statement that reads, \"Governor Christie has proven he's unafraid to tell it like it is and he's willing to confront the hard truths that currently threaten the future of the Republican Party. \"Now more than ever we need leaders to have the courage to say not what we want to hear but what we need to hear.\" Over recount months, former governor Christie has not been shy in attacking Donald Trump, saying that Donald Trump has failed this country.

But it's also going to be really important to watch how Chris Christie embraces this role as presidential candidate this time around. Is this somebody who is seeking to run this campaign in the pursuit of the Oval Office and to govern the country? Or is this somebody who is going to be on a mission to rid the Republican Party of Donald Trump? Because everything in the months during his consideration of this, leading up to it, indicates his singular focus at this point has been to try and knock Donald Trump off course here and get him to a place where he has no longer got a grip on the Republican Party.",

And I bring up the Florida governor because I think one of the open questions over the last few months is how would governor DeSantis campaign against Donald Trump? How would he differentiate himself from Donald Trump? I think for the first time we have an answer to that. DeSantis campaigning in Iowa has been giving these speeches, where he lays out distinctions between himself and Donald Trump. And I think we can put those up on a screen right now. Number one, Ron DeSantis points out Trump comes from money. He has blue collar roots. Ron DeSantis says, that he would have gotten rid of Anthony Fauci during the pandemic and Donald Trump did not. And Ron DeSantis claims that Donald Trump allowed lockdowns and he did not. So you can sort of see drawing lines there, DeSantis is. How significant will this be?",

She was on the stage, clearly indicating she will be a critical part of this DeSantis campaign. As you noted, he touched on his biography a bit. And also this vision, John, that I think will be a twofold message for him. One, that the elites in Washington are not representing the people. He believes he's got an ability to do that. Two, that he can defeat what he sees as a dangerous, leftist approach to American politics and the so-called \"woke\" ideology that he sees and that he's proven he can beat it electorally, like by 19 percentage points last November in his re-election race, as well as in his string of legislative victories in Florida. But when he took reporters' questions, he was not shy about going directly at Donald Trump -- on COVID, on abortion, saying Donald Trump is trying to attack him from the Left.

Then in Krasnodar we've got the oil refinery on fire again. The Ukrainians are not claiming responsibility for these. But added up, this looks like, as a Zelenskyy adviser says, an escalating campaign directed inside Russia. In the last couple of days, the British foreign secretary said essentially if Ukraine wants to attack military infrastructure in Russia, it's free to do that. The problem is Ukraine has agreed with many military donors that it wouldn't attack with donated weapons. It can use its own weapons for that.
