A third straight day of attacks on the terrorist group Hezbollah. The Israeli military, striking targets in Lebanon as Hezbollah continues to reel from the back-to-back attacks targeting members of Hezbollah's electronic devices such as pagers. There are hints that more is to come. And the mayor of Springfield, Ohio, is giving himself emergency powers after weeks of false claims about Haitian migrants in his town, eating cats and dogs.

But first, I'm going to walk people through just some of them. Take a look right here at this one in one post, Robinson called himself a, quote, black Nazi. And when describing then President Barack Obama writing, quote, I take Hitler over any of the shit that's in Washington right now. It even goes beyond that. Another disturbing post, Robinson defended slavery, writing quote, slavery is not that bad, and I wish they would bring slavery back. I would certainly buy a few all of these comments and many others that you can read on saying at CNN.com were made on the message board of a porn website called Nude Africa. And, Jake, in addition to those posts, he also expressed views on Nude Africa that sharply contradict his current policies as a socially conservative candidate for governor. For example, he has been vocally anti-transgender, but look at what Robinson wrote on the porn message board more than a decade ago, writing that he quote, liked watching transgender porn, adding quote that f-ing hot and called himself a quote, perv. And another thread that was discussing the story of a woman who said she was raped by her taxi driver while drunk, Robinson wrote, quote, and the moral of the story, don't F a drunk white bitch.",

Given what you've just described.I mean, to Dianne's point, we should stress -- this was one of the most high-profile gubernatorial contest of this entire election year. And it was largely due to Mark Robinson and his nature, his comments, what he said in the past and the way he put portrays himself on the campaign trail now. But this has been a race he's been losing. Most recent poll, Quinnipiac University last week had to pull out, he was losing by 10 points, 51 percent to 41 percent to Attorney General Josh Stein. So, this -- this is a race that was already a loser for Republicans, probably now, even more so. The question is, what about the reverse? Not just the down-ballot damage. What about to the top of the ticket? David Plouffe, Kamala Harris adviser, just tweeted \"16 important electoral votes\" in response to this story. We know that both campaigns, Trump and Harris, are very focused on this state. I -- this has always been the case of, can he lose the governor's race so badly that actually Harris could flip this state blue for the first time since 2008? We don't know what the outcome of the presidential will be in North Carolina, but it's looking more and more likely there's going to be a very uphill battle for Republicans in that state.",

The last time I sat down with Israeli or Israeli American hostage families, there were five Americans still being held by Hamas in Gaza, five who were presumed to be alive. Sadly, that number is now four after Hamas's brutal murder of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was born in California and lived in Virginia for awhile before moving to Israel. In addition to those four, Hamas continues to hold the bodies of several other Americans or American Israelis that they've murdered as I recently discussed with, several of these families.
