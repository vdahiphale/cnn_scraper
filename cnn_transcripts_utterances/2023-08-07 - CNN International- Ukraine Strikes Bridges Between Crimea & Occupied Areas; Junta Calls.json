We're learning about a foiled assassination plot on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy details of that just ahead.Niger's coup leaders call in troops from around the country and close the country's aspects mid what they say is the threat of foreign military intervention. And extreme flooding in Slovenia, what people are calling, the country's worst ever natural disaster the dramatic situation coming up ahead. Ukraine Security Service says an enemy informant is being held in connection with a plot to assassinate Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The SBU claims that the woman was preparing a Russian air strike during the Ukrainian President's visit to the Mykolaiv region in late July. Meanwhile, Kyiv is confirming strikes on two strategic bridges between Crimea and Russian occupied areas nearby. Ukraine says both bridges are key logistical routes used by Moscow's military and to discuss this CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me now. Clare, what more do we know about the women? The woman involved sorry, and the details of what were plotted?",

      "sentences": "So we don't know much about this woman. They say the Ukrainian security services that she was the resident of Ochakiv, which is a town in Mykolaiv in the same region where they say the alleged plot unfolded, what they're accusing her of is essentially trying to collect information about Zelenskyy's itinerary when he made a visit to that region, in late July.Locations, times where he was going to visit they published screen grabs of text messages with, you know, allegedly have Russian sort of handlers. And that also they continue to track even once they knew that she was doing this and discovered that at the same time she was allegedly also trying to uncover the locations of electronic warfare systems, ammunition storages, things like that. So I think like obviously, they ended up taking extra security measures, eventually detaining her visit went off without a hitch. I think the main questions from this are why now is this because they are at this critical point in the conflict trying to create an extra deterrent against collaboration with Russia? Is it because Zelenskyy now with Ukraine's attacks, getting bolder with him doing more and more visits around the country? Is he more vulnerable at this point? Are there more threats to his life than they previously had been? And we know that he's been under threat of this conflict?",

That's what we're seeing. I think, from the point of view of the boldness is it is interesting that we're increasingly seeing them claim directly responsibility for some of these attacks like the military did for those two bridges, which of course Russia say we're only for civilian use.",

And Kyiv is calling a summit held in Saudi Arabia over the weekend productive, honest and open.But Moscow was not present at the talks blasted them is nothing more than a doomed attempt by the West to mobilize the global south. CNN's Nic Robertson is here with more, Nic, what was actually achieved here because with Russia not present in agreements being made, but only between the countries themselves that aren't direct participants in this conflict.

[08:05:00] But so they were in the last round held in Copenhagen a month ago and the conclusion was let's keep talking it's good perhaps no surprise, you know, maybe in a few years when we look back and peace might seem closer in Ukraine, then the relevance and the role that these talks played in shaping positions will be informative. But what we can judge today, there are double the number of countries and representatives there in Jeddah as they were in Copenhagen a month ago. There are a couple of nations there that stand out I think, that are interesting that the Ukrainians clearly would want to have an impact on India, China, South Africa. You know, to try to win them over a little bit would have been important and you're of course suffers economically because of Russia's war but at the same time, bias Russia's coal and gas and oil. So you know, trying to get them off track from that and take a more, firmer stance against Russia. Or at least be a voice in Putin -- that says this war cannot persist. That will be part of Ukraine, Zain, but we don't know what was achieved. I think perhaps what was achieved for the Saudis is very significant. Look at the position of the Saudi National Security Adviser and one of the photographs we have from the summit and is sitting on one side of him is the Chinese Representative Li Hui, who is the Eurasia affairs lead for China. And on the other side, the United States National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan. Wow, what a position for Saudi diplomacy to have that role of bringing these countries around the same table and hosting that and trying to get them on the same page. So there was something and this was Saudi too.",

Now, Niger's military junta is calling in reinforcements from around the country and that is according to a military source.It comes one day after a deadline set by regional bloc ECOWAS was passed over the weekend. The bloc had given Niger one week to reinstate the President or face the potential use of force. The Junta closed Niger's airspace Sunday to prevent what it calls the threat of intervention from neighboring countries. Larry Madowo is following the story from Nairobi. He joins us live.

Or they will extend the deadline or continue to pursue diplomatic or political options. But in the meantime, the military junta in Niger is keen to show just how much support they have. They fill the stadium with supporters. They will receive like heroes, some of these cool leaders when they arrive at that stadium. People were denouncing friends there were especially denouncing ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States that threatened this military intervention in the first place, and the mood from some of the people listen.

And it was not notably a part of the tensions, of course, that now exists between the U.S., China and Russia. So they were kind of downplaying this as a kind of a threatening the activity against the U.S. and Canada. But what the U.S. is saying is that, look, this was something that merited U.S. response. And they did just that U.S. Northern Command and other military assets. They were deployed, including boats and planes to monitor the activity of these Russian ships and Chinese vessels. They were very close to Alaska. They were just off the Aleutian Islands there. And it caused a lot of concern among the U.S. senators for Alaska, Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski and they issued pretty scathing statements about this yesterday, saying that they had received several classified briefings about this issue about the transit of these vessels near Alaska. And noting that this was an example of how Beijing and Moscow feel that they can operate in this area, because they're acting as authoritarians essentially, and basically that they are able to operate there with impunity. But they said that they were relieved to see that the U.S. response was a little more robust than the last time this had happened. Chinese and Russian vessels did a similar joint patrol back in September, in roughly the same area and that was met simply by one Coast Guard vessel that was on a routine patrol. So now, Dan Sullivan, the Republican senator from Alaska saying that he is happy to see that the U.S. responded with those four U.S. Navy destroyers. But ultimately the U.S. military is saying that these ships did not pose a threat to the U.S. or Canada, and importantly, that they operated the whole time in international waters. And they reaffirm their right to navigation there something of course that the U.S. has sought to do around the world as they, the U.S. operates in similar areas off the coast of China and Russia, Bianca.",

First of all, the January 6 case that we've been talking about, that's a federal indictment, also, another federal indictment also from the Special Counsel relating to mishandling of classified documents and obstruction of justice at Mar-a-Lago.And then finally, and the first one that was ever returned was an indictment from a Manhattan District Attorney charging Donald Trump with mishandling hush money payments made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. So those three indictments are already on the books. There's a fourth one, probably coming soon from the Fulton County DA relating to Donald Trump's attempt to steal the 2020 election, specifically in Georgia. So there's a little bit of a scheduling logjam now forming before the 2024 election. Various trials we're seeing are getting scheduled, but they're sort of jockeying for position, there's really only so much time in which to try these four cases.",

We are not going to have a trial going on in the months immediately leading up to that no judge is going to hold a trial in let's say, October or September 2024.It's just too close to the election. Now, the two other indictments already occupied essentially, all of March through April, May, June and July. And so unless one of those trial dates moves, and they can move trial dates do move quite frequently here. [08:20:00] I don't see an opening for the January 6 trial but important to note the Manhattan DA who currently has March and April. He has signaled publicly that he would be willing to move his trial date if necessary to accommodate the January 6 trial date. Of course, Trump's team is trying to get these pushed off until after the election. Judges so far have not been on board with that.",

But the motion to get the case out of Washington D.C. is going to be doomed to fail when Donald Trump files it.Courts like to keep the cases where they're originally charged, unless you can show some overwhelming bias. The fact that Donald Trump is not particularly politically popular in D.C. is not enough. The attacks on the judge are completely unfounded. Yes, Judge Chutkan is a nominee of President Barack Obama. That does not mean she is biased any more than the judge in Florida, by the way, who is appointed by Trump himself is improperly biased in his favor. The judge has been tough on January 6 cases that she's received. But again, that doesn't signal the kind of bias that would merit her recusal. So I think both of those motions are doomed to fail.",
