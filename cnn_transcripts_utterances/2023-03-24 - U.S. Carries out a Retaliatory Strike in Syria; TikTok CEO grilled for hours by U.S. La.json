This retaliatory strike is being called proportionate, it's designedto avoid read escalation, it's intended to avoid casualties, it appears or perhaps if the location is on buildings in a rural area. But if it follows the pattern of what the United States has done when it's responded to this type of attack on its troops by the Iranian process in Syria and in Iraq before, what it tends to do is strike ammunition stores, and sort of collections of equipment used to sort of use if you will, to sort of sustain these property groups on the ground military equipment. So this is perhaps what the target is this time, it isn't clear. But what Lloyd Austin, the U.S. Secretary of Defense has said very clearly and this isn't this is an ongoing and very clear United States position, he said, we take all measures to defend our people and will always respond. bond at a time and place of our choosing. No group will strike our troops with impunity. So it has been a very quick response. A measured response in the past, retaliatory strikes like this have caused casualty -- casualties and deaths among Iranian proxy groups in this particular case again intended to send that very clear message to put off any further attacks like this. The U.S. has about 900 troops in Syria right now, and this isn't the first incident like this. There have been 78 drone and rocket attacks on U.S. service personnel and their bases inside Syria, since the beginning of 2021. That's about one strike every 10 days.",

NEWTON: Both the President and Prime Minister, though, do intend to make news during this visit, and one of them has to do with the regular migration hot topic in the hemisphere. It seems that there is a deal for Canada to take in migrants legally from the United States to try and shoulder some of the burden of the great migration going on now in the southern hemisphere.
