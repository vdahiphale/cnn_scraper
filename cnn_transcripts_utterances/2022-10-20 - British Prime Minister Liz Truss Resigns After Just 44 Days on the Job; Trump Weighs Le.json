And newly released emails between Trump and his former lawyer proving his voter fraud claims were indeed bogus, a federal judge calling it evidence of a conspiracy to degree fraud the United States.But let's begin this hour with the breaking news out of the U.K., Prime Minister Liz Truss resigning after six weeks, 44 days in office. Our team is following this breaking story. CNN International Correspondent Scott McLean is outside of 10 Drowning Street and CNN's Richard Quest is standing by as well. Scott, first to you, six weeks in office and gone after a disastrous budget plan. So, what happens next?",

But, really, one can't overstate the damage that ensued following the introduction of her economic plan. It sent the pound going down drastically, markets tumbled as well, a pension plan near disaster in the country. The Bank of England was forced to intervene and you even saw the United States really stress test our system in case we could possibly experience something similar. Talk about that impact that has really had for the country globally on an economic front. [10",

      "sentences": "This was, Bianna, a totally utterly, completely self-inflicted wound. The prime minister didn't put this policy to cabinet. She didn't put it through the testing measures of the budget responsibility team, she didn't do it with anybody. She and the chancellor announced it out of dogma and out of some right wing views on free markets, and they didn't make sure the markets were ready. So, not surprisingly, interest rates went up as the Bank of England then tried to bring them down and failed necessarily to do so.Why this is particularly significant for global markets? Let's take for example the U.K. Unlike the United States, where people have mortgages that are fixed for 15, 20, 30 years, in Britain, most mortgages are only fixed for a few years. So, there are millions of people who this year will suddenly find their mortgage double, not because of Vladimir Putin or because of much of anything else, but because of this government's policies. There is going to be massive difficulty, financial difficulties as a result. And, again, this was all because of a policy that wasn't put forward. So, you know, Liz Truss, in being the shortest prime minister in history, as she leaves number 10 next week, they will be sweeping up the broken glass for months and Britains will be paying the cost of it for years and the reputation of the country will be in tatters for a great deal longer.",

The incompetence that we've seen from the prime minister on domestic political issues versus the policies on Ukraine, on dealing with Putin, on the Middle East, all of the other things, for instance, the defense secretary has been in Washington meeting his counter parts to discuss greater cooperation over Ukraine, greater cooperation on cybersecurity. You have got the new pact with Australia that is coming in. You've got the very close security links. So, I'm not worried about that. I think that that is pretty rock solid.What I would say is how that the U.S., the administration looks at the U.K. and says, can you be a reliable partner elsewhere? Can we have shared values? Yes. But are you strong enough to execute them? At the moment from Liz Truss, it is no. So, there is a lot of damage. Look, in 35 years of covering this sort of stuff, I've never seen anything remotely bordering the level of incompetence and simple mismanagement and malmanagement that we've seen at the British government in the last three weeks.",

Joining me now is Elie Honig, CNN Senior Legal Analyst and former assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Elie, great to see you. So, this was the argument that the January 6 committee had been making through all of their hearings, but now you have a judge really siding what he says are facts via emails. And you've noted one of the most important things in this filing from Judge Carter was that President Trump knew alleged voter fraud claims were wrong. Why did that stand out to you?",

One of the key thrusts of the entire January 6 committee presentation is Donald Trump knew, here is the all of the people who told him he had lost. How many people did we see testify about that? That was one of the main points they are trying to make. And now we see a judge not just concluding that Donald Trump knew but describing emails that the judge has said now these have to go over to the committee.Now, in the opinion, the judge doesn't actually show us the emails, we don't see them, but the judge describes them. In one of the categories of emails, the judge says, these emails demonstrate that Donald Trump knew that his claims of voter fraud were false, therefore, they go over to the committee. So, the committee has those emails, prosecutors can get them really quickly if they don't have them already. That could be crucial evidence as to his state of mind.",

And, by the way, the vast majority of the documents at issue were, infact, covered by attorney/client privilege. But there is an exception to the attorney/client privilege called the crime fraud exception.So, if an attorney and a client are talking strategy, what do we do in court, what should we argue, how should we approach this case, that is all privileged, it is confidential, nobody gets to see that. But if they cross a line and start talking committing a crime or an ongoing crime, hey, why don't we do this crime together, how should I commit this crime, and the attorney is giving advice, that is not covered by the privilege. And so the judge here looks at a universe of 536 documents and says most of them are covered but eight of them, eight of these emails, are not covered because of the attorney/client exception. So, in a sense, Eastman prevailed on most of his claims, but, boy, to have eight documents singled out by a judge as potentially evidence of a crime, that is a big deal.",

And it is important to the Georgia investigation too because the crux of the investigation in Georgia is did Donald Trump knowingly try to steal this election. Did he ask Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, when he said, find me those votes? Did Trump already know that he had lost, did he know that his claims of fraud were untrue? And these documents, as described by the judge, actually pre-date that call that Trump made to Raffensperger.So, prosecutors may be able to look at the emails. Again, we haven't seen the actual emails, but say, look, he knew, according to these emails, he had lost and yet he still calls up the secretary of state for Georgia and urges him to find these votes when he knew he had lost. Prosecutors could look at that as crucial on intent.",

So, Nic, two major things beginning today.

In Kherson, the Russian- installed deputy governor there said that 15,000 people were evacuated yesterday. And I think best to put the word evacuated in parenthesis because the population there under martial law is not getting a lot of choice.What we've been able to see video clips coming out of Kherson today, far fewer people are leaving. But that same deputy Russian-installed governor there is vowing that the Russian forces will come back and continue to take more territory, that they will go as far as taking the city of Odessa on the Black Sea Coast. So, there is no sense from this particular official that they're on the back foot but I think the evident belies that. And the country, the people of Ukraine are somewhat being put on the back foot in terms of electricity supplies. As you say, there are now controlled power outages, up to four hours in some areas. Kharkiv, Sumy, as well, just to name two regions in the north, where they are now having these controls, electricity controls, with areas without water, some areas where street lighting will be switched off, some areas with sort of electrical-driven public transport, trolley buses won't be running. And the advice the government is giving to people is quite serious and stunning. They are saying, store water and stock up with blankets and socks, charge your phones, keep your power banks charged up and ready. They really are preparing the nation for the possibility that the electrical situation could get worse. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here say they're working with NATO and the European Union to try to get energy-generating supplies into the country. But as we know, these repairs and new equipment take time. And that seems to be what Ukraine doesn't have in a way at the moment because the Russians, in the space of just about ten days, have imposed a quite severe electricity restriction on the country that just was unimaginable two weeks ago, almost.",

But they use water -- I mean, ships, small ships to evacuate people from one bank of the River Dnipro, to another. So, I think it is about maybe 5,000 at most. The main thing why they do this, why they evacuate civilians, Ukrainian civilians, which, for sure, the Ukrainian army won't harm, I mean, we won't kill Ukrainians because they're our people and they're under occupation and under occupants.
