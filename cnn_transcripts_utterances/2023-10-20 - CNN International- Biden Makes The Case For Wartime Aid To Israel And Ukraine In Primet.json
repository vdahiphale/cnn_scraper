All of this sounds reasonable. But as you mentioned and a lot of analysts have pointed out, this is far disconnected from reality. So a lot of people see similarity in terms of the Chinese response to this conflict versus their response to the war in Ukraine where their good old friend Putin launched. In both cases some analysts say China seems to be more interesting projecting this image of being a peacemaker than acting as one. Of course they're saying they're sending their special envoy to the region and also calling for a peace conference. But we've also seen their foreign minister in the past few days expressing a more hardened position towards Israel. Saying the Israeli action has gone beyond self-defense while they have still refused to even name Hamas in any of their condemnations and statements. This is also reflecting their state media coverage, they're selection of sources. And it is very much focused on the Palestinian cause. And also of course in their tightly controlled social media we have seen this explosion of anti-Israel and often anti-Semitic views and post. Remember this is a country where the authorities can literally flip the switch to shut down any conversations they don't like. So the fact that these comments are allowed to exist and flourish, according to some experts is a reflection of where the government's positions truly lies despite their official pronouncement Now all of this, of course, is also very much connected to these tensions between Washington and Beijing. We have seen their officials, and state media increasingly turning their fire Washington, really blaming the U.S. being the ultimate culprit here and that, you know, really driving home the point of U.S. being the factor of instability in contrast with China being the factor of peace, John.
