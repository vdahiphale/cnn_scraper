      "sentences": "Happening now, as Democrats celebrate important new election wins, Republicans are about to hold another presidential debate without their frontrunner. Both parties studying the results and assessing their 2024 strategies as Donald Trump's GOP rivals are getting ready to take the stage.President Biden is touting his party's new wins as defeats for Trump and MAGA Republicans. Democrats' political hopes rising amid fresh evidence their defensive abortion rights is a winning issue, even as the president's bleak poll numbers are raising some serious red flags. And the state of New York just rested its case in the civil fraud trial against Donald Trump and his family business, this after Ivanka Trump's testimony and her attempt to downplay her involvement in the Trump Organization. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, Donald Trump is deflecting blame for new Republican election losses as he's set to skip another GOP presidential debate tonight. We're tracking the fallout for Republicans and the bolstered hopes of Democrats right now with the first contest of 2024 just around the corner. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is following it all for us. He's in Miami. That's the site of tonight's GOP debate. Jeff, the candidates are coming into this debate with a political environment very different from just, what, 24 hours ago. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, it is a very different view in a much more challenging view for the Republican Party. That is why I am told that to a person, the candidates will argue on stage tonight, that it is indeed time to have a new face of the Republican Party, a new leader of the future of the party. That argument, of course, though, is complicated not by the rivals on stage but by the one who is not on stage. That, of course, is former President Trump. He'll be holding a competing rally just miles away from here in Hialeah, Florida. He'll, of course, be making his case that he should still be the leader of the party. Of course, he has a commanding lead in this race. That, however, will not change the dynamic on the stage. So, for the third debate of this primary cycle, Wolf, it is a much different atmosphere, a much different time and tone. The dynamics going into this include five candidates on stage. That is much different than the eight on stage at the first debate and the seven at the second debate. That will give all of the candidates more time to make their pitches and their claims and then go after their rivals. Nikki Haley comes into this debate riding a wave of momentum. Also an argument which she has been making from the beginning that she says Republicans as a party must stop losing the popular vote, that they have lost in the last seven of the eight presidential elections. So, she is casting herself as a new leader for this time. Of course, she is on a collision course with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. There's no question that those two, they've been going after each other for weeks. So, we're going to see it up close center stage. But, Wolf, because of the outcome of the elections last night, no doubt, abortion is front and center in this debate tonight. Nikki Haley has been talking about trying to find a consensus on the complicated and very personal issue of abortion. That's putting her at odds with some of her rivals' views, including DeSantis, who has signed a six-week abortion ban right here in Florida. The other rivals also have different views. So, Wolf, look for that to be front and center as well as many other issues. But there is no doubt, time is running out for these candidates to make their own claim to be the leading alternative to Trump all the while he, of course, will just be down the road.",

And also what's going to happen here is what you're going to see is Joe Biden running against an opponent.Now, presumably, it's going to be Donald Trump. There's no indication at this moment despite what may or may not happen on the debate stage tonight that it's not going to be Trump. And when he's running against an opponent, he's going to have incredibly sharp contrasts to draw. He's going to have really sharp contrasts to draw. On abortion, we saw in the CNN poll last night, people far and away believe that Joe Biden is more trust worthy and honest. There will be a real character component there, which I think will be good for Biden over time. You have to remember Trump has sort of weirdly been in the background here. I mean, to the extent that he's been front and center for people, it's been in the context of these trials, not in the context of him making his kind of most bombastic and inciting, shall we say, political statements. So, I think as Trump comes to the forefront, the Biden campaign has an enormous opportunity to draw that contrast and to build on the success of last night, where we saw these issues are popular and they turn people out to vote for Democrats.",

Frankly, I think the Youngkin team may have gotten a little out over their skis, set expectations too high. The reality is that Republicans in Virginia last night did better than perhaps Trump did back in 2020. It wasn't enough to hang on to the legislature. But right now, the biggest benefit that Donald Trump is getting is the fact that Joe Biden continues to poll so low. It has really undercut Republicans' ability to say, oh my gosh, we have a big problem, we need jettison Trump and turn the page. Right now, there's still too much finger-pointing about, well, gosh, what happened last night, what is going to happen coming next fall for them to clear the decks and set a new strategy.",

There's a lot of Asian voters now, right, Asian of every persuasion. Some of them are open to Trump or Republican messages on small business, on lower taxes and the crime issue is playing in the suburbs. So, the Latino vote has been drifting. Black men have been drifting away.So, the complication for the president, he doesn't just have one problem to fix. It's the many different issues within coalition. Now, again, he has a year to do it and he doesn't have an opponent right now, but it's the depth of it from traveling, if you to go places, this is my tenth presidential election. I remember George H.W. Bush, the incumbent president, 90 percent after the first gulf war. We had what was a pretty mild recession. The American people just didn't believe he was the guy they wanted to fix the economy. If people reach that threshold opinion, we want something new, it's hard to get them to change their mind. And I think right now, the country is thinking maybe we should have somebody new. And the president better get at that, changing that psychology, forget the specifics.

Then as a campaign, the Biden campaign has to take it seriously. I know they do. But to look at one poll a year out and compare it to voters who actually went to the polls 24 hours ago and overwhelmingly embraced the Democratic agenda, I don't think, I think that the president -- I think the president has a very clear pathway here. He's got to do the work. But it is clear that those issues motivate voters. And, again, I would go back to we have not even begun the true head- to-head contest between the president and presumably Donald Trump, who also, in that poll, has enormous vulnerability and has enormously high unfavorable ratings.

Kennedy Jr., or a variety of whole constellation of third party options that wind up garnering about one in four voters, and especially among young voters that's particularly high. So, this dissatisfaction, I don't think we're likely to see the Trump generation as Generation Z, but I do think that younger voters are frustrated with the options they have available to them.

Ivanka Trump testified that she had set up a relationship with Deutsche Bank through one of these bankers and that she was involved in these loans that she said a high level.But when it came down to the nitty-gritty details of it, she said she didn't recall much of that, including a lot of detail about what was required under the personal guarantee that her father had agreed to in order to get these loans. And they focused on the old post office building and pulled up an email that indicated that the GSA, which was involved in this deal, that they had identified that Trump's financial statements did not comply with all accounting rules, and there were exceptions to that. She was asked if that came up during an in-person meeting that she attended in Washington with her father meeting with the GSA. She said she didn't recall the financial statements coming up in that meeting, distancing herself from it. And the key allegation in this case is that loans were decided based on these allegedly fraudulent financial statements. She said she didn't remember that coming up and that the discussions then were about her vision for the project. Now, she was also asked about a penthouse apartment she has here in New York on Park Avenue. And she has an option to buy that apartment for $8.5 million on Trump's financial statements for that same year. It was listed at 2.5 times that amount, more than $20 million. Ivanka Trump was asked about that. She said she didn't know what went into the financial statements. She didn't prepare them, she didn't review them, she didn't approve them, so, again, distancing herself, like her brothers, Don Jr. and Eric Trump, did when they testified last week.

Her father was supposed to make a personal guarantee. They confronted her with evidence that the father turned around and demanded that his kids guarantee him for the guarantee.

And I also think -- and Ivanka Trump touched on this point a little bit today but in a more subtle way than her father and her brothers, this idea of a victimless crime. Donald Trump talked about it a little bit suggesting that, well, no one was really harmed by their misrepresenting and misvaluing their properties. She said, and Ivanka Trump made a note today that banks were eager to keep doing business with the Trump Organization, therefore, they couldn't have been harmed that much.

CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has a closer look at their harrowing journey. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocent. Now, we're supposed to be in the safe area but you can hear the bombs behind us, he says. All of our houses are gone. Nothing is left. The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the strip to move southward, most recently opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time, pushing thousands here to Salah al-Din Street, where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. We saw along the road destruction, dead bodies everywhere and the Israeli tanks would demand to search the youth, she says. We saw one young man stripped naked. We witnessed unbearable scenes. The only way the reach the route is by foot or cart for those that can find room. There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there's no fuel, he says. They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza City. As Israel's defense minister apparently declared the entire city, the whole of the enclave's largest population center, a legitimate target.",

And many fear they will never be allowed to return home. Some here say this is reminiscent of the Nakba, the Arabic term for the expulsion of Palestinians from their towns during the founding of Israel. We walked a very long way. It felt like the Nakba of 2023, she says. We walked by dead people who were ripped to shreds. Children were very tired because there was no water. People were dying and there were elderly who couldn't walk. And for those who do make it, bombardment and siege await them in the south, too. There is no true escape. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I'll talk politics with a Republican governor from the key early primary state of New Hampshire. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:48:09] BLITZER: Five Republican presidential candidates will be taking the debate stage in Miami later tonight where one of the topics will certainly be the GOP's losses in yesterday's elections. Let's discus this and more with the New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu. Governor, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, Trump won't be debating but he's still dominating the race. In our latest CNN poll, he's at 61 percent. Is there anything -- really anything realistic that any of these other candidates can say or do tonight to change the course of this Republican primary or is it for all practical purposes, already a done deal? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: Definitely not a done deal. There's no doubt. These guys are trying to figure out who's going to lead that pack to go one-on-one with Trump prior to Super Tuesday. Iowa will be a big part of that, New Hampshire, even South Carolina will be a big part of that. And these debates are a very big part of it. You know, you have someone like Nikki Haley whose numbers really moved after the first debate. A lot of folks thought DeSantis was going to do well, he actually did very well in the first two debates. We had eight candidates about a month and a half go. We're down to five candidates now. So, the field is winnowing. So, as we get closer to that alternative to Trump within the GOP, which, again, would garner 40, 50 or more percent of the vote, then it becomes a real race. If Trump runs the table on Super Tuesday, you know, later on by March of '24, that's probably it. But this is a chance for them not to say I'm -- you know, I'm going to beat Donald Trump per se, but I'm the best and going to show a more optimistic profile of the Republican Party.",

And I think they're realizing their strengths on the trail.I've been at the town halls, in the living rooms, in the diners with both of them. They both have compelling cases to make. They both come from somewhat different backgrounds. But the best similarity is they're both governors. They both have executive-level leadership and accountability. They both have a record of success. And that's I think what's translating a lot with folks. At the end of the day, it's not just about, you know, who's the best alternative to Trump, but who can make sure we win in November of '24. Trump -- all the latest polls show Trump cannot win in November of '24. Biden is likely not going to be on the ticket. I think the Democrats are going to be much smarter in either the Bidens or the party or however it's going to work out, the Democrats are going to find somebody else. That latest Times/Sienna poll shows that Trump is the one that loses to the alternative. So, winning is really the issue of the day, but they have to kind of find their own pace (ph) on the ground. They're both doing very well in both Iowa and New Hampshire. And that's why they've kind of surged as the top two contenders here.",

You got to do the media and hit the trail and make the introductions, knowing that most voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, most voters in the GOP primary still haven't decided, right? The polls are where they are today. But those can move drastically, especially after thanksgiving.
