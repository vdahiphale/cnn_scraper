It is Wednesday, September 4th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Ukraine, where the country's top diplomat, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, has just tendered his resignation ahead of a major cabinet reshuffle expected this week.The Speaker of Ukraine's Parliament says Kuleba's request will be discussed by lawmakers soon, and he's not alone. Kuleba is one of several ministers to recently offer their resignations. According to Ukraine's parliamentary majority leader this week, more than 50 percent of the cabinet minister's staff will be changed and new members appointed. This comes as Russia continues its relentless air assaults on Ukraine. In the past few hours, Moscow launched an attack on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Officials say at least seven people were killed. One of the victims is a 14-year-old girl. Dozens of people have been injured, including a number of children, and five people were wounded in the central city of Kryvyi Rih when a hotel building was destroyed. Well, let's go straight out to CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour who is joining us now live from Kyiv. Christiane, good to see you. I understand that you spoke to the foreign minister just yesterday for CNN. What do you make of this news, Christiane, and why it is happening now?",

      "sentences": "Well, as far as we can tell, this is a formality associated with what President Zelenskyy has said publicly now in an address to the nation overnight that he wants to do, which is at this state of the war, there's now 30 months or so since the full-scale invasion began. He wants to reshuffle the cabinet.This is not unusual. He's changed cabinet members in the past. For instance, the defense minister was changed in the last year. However, some of these resignations will be accepted. Some will be moved elsewhere to other ministries. Some will maybe be moved out altogether. We do not know what's going to happen to foreign minister Kuleba, but of course I have spoken to him. I spoke to the minister of procurement, who resigned also just the day before. When I spoke to Kuleba, it was right after we had heard about the catastrophic attack on Poltava in central Ukraine, where the Russians launched ballistic missiles against a military academy and a hospital. To this point, we know that there's at least 50 dead and more than 100 injured. Those numbers may climb because it was really a devastating attack, and it punched a gigantic hole into the side of this academy all the way through. But what I asked Kuleba about was, what is the effect and the kind of reason, does he believe, for this uptick in Russian assaults, which has happened over this last week? And does the Kursk incursion, the Ukrainian Kursk incursion into that region of Russia, signify something particular? What was the message they wanted to send? Here's his response.

They are under huge pressure, the Ukrainians on the east, in the Pokrovsk area, as you've been, we've been talking about for the last week or so, huge pressure there, a major logistical hub. [04But both Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, and of course President Zelenskyy, has said repeatedly, this week and before, that they need the kinds of sophisticated air defense systems, at the very least, to be able to knock out ballistic missiles. They can't do that with their own, what he told me, mobile missile defense or anti-missile defense. They need something like a Patriot or the other sophisticated systems, because these ballistic missiles are the most ferocious. They're the fastest. It's very difficult to get out of the way in time between an alert and the ability to get to shelter. So they create a really, really huge damage. So this is the message that Zelenskyy, Kuleba, and his government are sending out. The Irish prime minister is here today meeting with the president, Zelenskyy. It's been the Dutch prime minister who was here earlier this week. So that is the message that they are trying to send to their allies right now -- Christina.",

As you're saying, they literally had minutes to run for cover. Overnight, we've seen more attacks on the western city of Lviv, which is considered by many in Ukraine to be a bit more of a safe haven, because it is on the other side of the country. It's where many displaced Ukrainians have traveled to.What is your sense, Christiane, that Zelenskyy and Kuleba will get what they want in asking western allies for these long-range missiles to be able to strike into Russia, when we are seeing such an uptick in fighting and missiles coming from Russia?",

And they believe, at least this is what Kuleba said, and I'll quote him, they're in the last mile, he said, of trying to make that point and get an affirmative answer. Because what he says is that we are not talking about, you know, sending in weapons to destroy Russian people, Russian civilians.What we want to do is be able to, A, attack the source of the weapons that are attacking us. That's one thing. Those come from bases inside Russia, whether they're airbases or artillery or missile-launching pads, etc. That's one thing. The other thing is, they say we need to be able to shoot down these ballistic missiles. Again, we need the sophisticated technology to do it. Again, that is not attacking Russians, that is attacking the hardware that they're sending to kill us. So that is how they are trying to frame it. Now, it is definitely a step up in the attack on the cities here over the last week. I mean, almost relentless, nightly. It's really spread around the country now. And again, I asked the foreign minister why he thinks, and he basically said, well, there are many reasons, but the big reason is because he said the Russians know that winter is coming, and their aim is to, again, try to cripple our infrastructure, cripple our energy grid. And remember, according to the stats here, Ukraine has lost at least half of its energy capacity since this war started because of the attacks. And they're happening so fast that it's difficult to repair them in time.",

He's one of the main salesmen, if you like, of Ukraine's war effort to Western Allies.So do you sense this is a bit of a gamble from Zelenskyy to be changing up his cabinet so extensively at this point?

She has historically been a studied person, and no doubt she's going to spend a lot of time trying to be ready for possible debate scenarios.

They are charged with terrorism, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals and use weapons of mass destruction resulting in death.The charges filed back in February were kept under seal in case the Justice Department had an opportunity to arrest any of the defendants. But an official said that with three of the Hamas leaders charged now dead, it was no longer necessary to wait. The complaint also follows the money trail and zeros in on those financing Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: As outlined in our complaint, those defendants armed with weapons, political support and funding from the government of Iran and support from Hezbollah have led Hamas' efforts to destroy the state of Israel and murder civilians in support of that aim.

It's the first criminal step that they've taken to try and hold those responsible for October 7th accountable. Now, it does focus on those attacks where more than 40 American citizens were killed. There was more than or at least 10 American citizens taken hostage as well. But it does span several decades. So we have heard in this complaint that there are several decades of alleged terrorist attacks against American nationals and against others in the region. So as you say, this was originally filed in February. It has been acknowledged now that since the death in particular of the former leader, Ismail Haniyeh, assassinated in Tehran recently, that they decided to unseal this document.
