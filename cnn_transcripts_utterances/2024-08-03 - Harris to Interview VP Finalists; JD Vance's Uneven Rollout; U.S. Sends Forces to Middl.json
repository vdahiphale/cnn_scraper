Haniyeh was killed less than 24 hours after Israel eliminated a senior Hezbollah commander in Lebanon. As Ben Wedeman reports, that country is uneasy about what could happen next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  A sense of dread is dawning on Lebanon as the region waits for Hezbollah and Iran to make good on their threats to take revenge on Israel for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander Tuesday evening in Beirut. Followed hours later by the assassination, presumably by Israel, of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied his killing Haniyeh's funeral was held Friday in Hutta (ph),  attended by the Qatari emir and prime minister, in addition to Halil Haya, deputy Hamas leader. Prayers for Haniyeh were held in, among other places, Turkiye, Pakistan, Indonesia and Jordan. In Amman, the prayers were followed by a massive demonstration condemning his killing. The rising tensions have prompted several airlines to extend their suspension of flights to Beirut. Other flights have been canceled. While getting a flight out of Beirut is becoming difficult, a host of embassies have already urged their nationals to leave Lebanon now. In a speech Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned that retaliation for Israel's killing of commander Fuad Shukr is inevitable. And he also threatened those behind Israel, presumably the United States. Israel carried out a series of air and drone strikes and artillery barrages Friday along the border with Lebanon, while Hezbollah resumed its strikes on Israeli positions after a two-day lull. But these are what has become the daily and sometimes deadly exchanges between the two sides. The leader of Hezbollah has made clear his group's response to Israel's deadly strike on Beirut will be of a much greater magnitude -- I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Beirut. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The problem with rate rises is they were cumulative and, over a period of time, the effect of them got ever greater. So we call it the monetary lag. It's the time between the rise and its effect. And this is what it looks like over the course of this tightening cycle. Only now are we feeling the full force, the cumulative force of all these rate increases. The result, an increase in unemployment. Has the Fed got there in time by cutting rates next month? We won't know because, once they start cutting, we'll have to wait and see if the snowball of job losses gets ever greater, of course, if they've managed to put it to rest -- Richard Quest, CNN, New York.
