So your initial reaction to the speech?REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): Well, as you said, there was a lot of opening shots. And, you know, I just wish one day that we would see the State of the Union as a State of the Union, because I could have read all that and a fundraising e-mail from the Biden campaign, about how terrible we are, about how we want to take away women's reproductive rights. I got it. You say it all the time. Not true by the way, I'm not really sure what Bill he's referring to from a Republican-led House that would do any of that. There's no bill to repeal the ACA. In fact, because I'm on the Health Subcommittee on E&amp;C, I know exactly what we're doing on that Committee. We're doing a lot of bipartisan, great stuff to improve people's health care. So there's some factual problems with it. But I think just from a strategy perspective, this is an election year, you're not winning over a single voter with that speech. And so maybe they -- maybe they switch the speeches, maybe that was supposed to be the Democratic convention speech. And instead they put it in the State of the Union teleprompter because it was divisive. It was an attack out against Republicans.

People know that it's his fault.Like two things can be true at once. Republicans should be trying to get new laws in place. But also Biden has done a lot to make the situation worse. I mean, it happened as soon as he took office, because he rescinded all of Trump's old policies and rescinded those executive orders, whether that's Remain in Mexico, whether that's the Northern Triangle Asylum Cooperation Agreements, those things were working.

He talked about how aid cannot be, quote, a secondary consideration, or a bargaining chip. He impressed upon them the need to get aid into Gaza. But I have to tell you, Anderson, that is actually not a popular viewpoint here.We attended a protest yesterday, where people are trying to block aid from getting into Gaza. And you might think that that's sort of a fringe movement. But according to the top polling agency here in Israel, some 68 percent of Israelis believe that aid should not be getting into Gaza. And that is because of a conviction that they hold the belief that there is no evidence to support but that they hold that all the aid is simply going into Hamas's hands now, the construction of this pier that President Biden talked about that obviously would provide much needed direct access to get that aid in. You might remember that the U.S. had sent a huge ship full of flour that was sitting in Ashdod, the Israeli financial ministry -- minister rather, blocking that from getting into Gaza. So this pier would potentially circumvent the kind of politics around this. But the timeline, we're talking 30 to 60 days, potentially, that's potentially two months away, Anderson. The situation in Gaza, obviously, deteriorating by the minute, and you know, just really desperate situation. I think, for Palestinians listening to this speech, they will see it as too little too late. And, you know, they believe firmly that Biden's policy of publicly supporting and privately pressuring Israel has failed. And that that is why we are seeing this catastrophe unfolding in Gaza, Anderson.",

And what can happen in America is Donald Trump could be a dictator, you know why?

I think the other thing about the speech tonight is that Joe Biden had a really important task to talk to the issue around Israel and Gaza. We heard reporting, people don't like to see people killed on October 7th, and they certainly don't want to see innocent Palestinians killed, day after day. 300,000 and he -- and or 300,030, excuse me.

The federal deficit is indeed more than a trillion dollars lower today than it was in President Trump's last fiscal year in office. But President Biden conveniently never mentions why? And that why is overwhelmingly simply because bipartisan emergency pandemic spending from 2020 expired as planned in the Biden era. So spending skyrocketed then it fell on schedule. That's not a Biden fiscal achievement.And especially because I think here's the key, experts at places like Moody's and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have told me in detail that Biden's own actions, executive actions, laws, have worsened the deficit picture. So Biden is patting himself on the back for fiscal prudence, but his actions have clearly added to deficits, not improve them. A couple more claims I think we need to break down.
