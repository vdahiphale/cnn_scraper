And the victims had brought a class action lawsuit against the bank, accusing JP Morgan of enabling Epstein by ignoring warnings that he was trafficking girls and young women for sex and also overlooking red flags because he was a wealthy client. The amount of that settlement has not been disclosed. Before reaching the deal, the bank insisted it did not help Epstein commit his heinous crimes.",

All lanes were closed after a tanker truck that may have been carrying hundreds of gallons of gasoline caught fire.Now, the cause of the fire, still under investigation. The National Transportation and Safety Board is sending a team out there to help in that investigation. Authorities are now working to identify if anyone was hurt in the collapse. I-95 is a critical artery on the East Coast. It stretches from Florida to Canada. The destroyed portion of that highway is said to see around 160,000 vehicles daily. Officials say it could take months to rebuild.",

The billionaire media tycoon and founder of Italy's largest commercial broadcaster went on to become the country's longest serving prime minister. This despite a career tainted by sex scandals, allegations, and even a tax fraud conviction. Berlusconi was often considered the kingmaker in Italian politics. He had been battling leukemia.

Scottish investigators arrested and have released former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday. Local media reporting they were questioning Sturgeon over possible financial misconduct by the Scottish national party. Now, she was released without charge pending further investigation. Sturgeon maintains she's done nothing wrong.In this country, while Donald Trump is the first former U.S. president to face federal criminal charges, he is certainly not alone on the world stage. He joins the ranks of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva, and a handful of others. For a closer look at the international perspective we're joined now by CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour. Christiane, when we look at all of this, there's certainly been a reaction here in the United States. Some of it anticipated. Perhaps some of it not based on just how detailed this indictment was. How is this playing overseas, especially given that those details includes references to materials that, you know, could compromise foreign relations and detail some potential vulnerabilities for allies?",

It's happened throughout the world and in democracies and allies.One of the NATO allies is Hungary. Allies might be a little bit of a strong term at this point. But I was struck by Viktor Orban's response. He -- putting out a tweet saying, your fight is a good fight, real Donald Trump, never give up. Look, there's a lot going on behind the scenes and a lot of history here. What was your response, though, to that?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's really actually very interesting, this, because you have different types of politicians. So, Viktor Orban is a classic populist, just like Boris Johnson is, just like Donald Trump is. And during the Trump presidency, the populists did rally around him, including President Putin. Nationalists, populist. And so they have always been, even throughout his presidency, much more sympathetic to him than perhaps other leaders who recoil against these sort of, you know, populism, the martyrdom that these people do invoke, the fact that they say it's me against the establishment and without me you're all, you know, going to hell in a handbasket, which is pretty much what they all say, including Victor Orban, including Donald Trump, including Boris Johnson. So it's not surprising that that cadre of populist leaders have come out and at least verbally said that kind of thing, or at least, you know, on social media.But the vast majority of world leaders realize that these are very serious possibilities that can happen. Whatever they do in office or out of office can come back to haunt them if there are credible charges, done usually by bipartisan investigative committees and then put to -- in the United States you have grand juries. Over here it's somewhat different. But these are credible charges that are put to a so-called jury of the peers to see whether charges can be levelled and whether they can go to trial. And as I say, around the world, this is kind of durger (ph). It's true that in the United States it's the first time such federal charges have been leveled, but many here have also said, Donald Trump, it appears, had it coming. As you know, this is not the first of the charges leveled against him. The most serious and the 37 charges include really serious charges. But, you know, you've been reporting on all the other legal woes that he's got himself into.",

That was almost double among Republican voters.Back with us, Audie Cornish, John Miller, Sara Murray. We're almost done, guys, but I really enjoy having you around me constantly. It's a lot of fun. Audie, the view seems to be, we know how this is going to be. This is like every other time. There's a playbook. There's a core group. He won't lose his 35 percent.

And how the media sort of works with him in a way in that.If you take his whole speech and then he spends half the speech bashing Trump, that's just free air time campaign speech smuggled in through the trojan horse of your indictment.
