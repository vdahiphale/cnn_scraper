Capital buildings stormed by the supporters of the ousted president who had challenged election results.And what could be better than the bills winning for number 3, Damar Hamlin himself expecting to get out of the hospital. All right, welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans, good Monday morning to you. President Biden on the border visiting the U.S.-Mexico border area, Sunday, for the first time since he became president. He spoke with border patrol officers, he visited a migrant center in El Paso. Well, the president apparently did not see or meet with any migrants. CNN's Jasmine Wright for us this morning from Washington. Jasmine, Republicans have been criticizing this president for not coming to see the migrant crisis firsthand until now.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christine, and it's unclear whether or not President Biden's Sunday trip to the border as first as president is actually going to end that criticism because of what you just said, because he did not see any migrants while on the ground for several hours.Now, we did see him talking and meeting with border patrol, assessing the security situation, which is what the White House said that the president wanted to do. We saw him looking at equipment and meeting with elected officials here. We've seen him coming off the plane. But we did not see him, despite him going to that migrant center, meeting with any migrants. Now a senior administration official told CNN that, that was purely coincidental. And of course, I have to note that while the president was in El Paso, the city which is known really as Ground Zero of the migrant crisis because of the influx of migrants that they've seen over the course of the last few weeks was having a low dip period in border crossings and in border apprehensions. But still, it really demonstrates, Christine, how kind of politically fraught the migration issue has become for the president, and what a political liability it has come -- it has become. Now, while on the ground there, reporters asked the president the key question, what he has learned from his time on the ground. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And when it comes to what the President Biden just announced a few weeks ago, which was to increase migration from key areas like Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela, while also punishing more severe consequences for those who try to circumvent the rules. Now, of course, this will be something that looms over the president's head over the next two days as he is in Mexico where he wakes up this morning, and he will meet with the president to talk mostly about immigration.",

Brian Walsh is expected to be arraigned today.All right, Bills safety Damar Hamlin is expected to be released from the hospital in coming days. A source with the team tells CNN. Carolyn Manno has morning's \"BLEACHER REPORT\". And what an amazing opening storybook opening to that game too.    CAROLYN MANNO, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, absolutely. The kickoff returned for the touchdown. I mean, his recovery has captivated the entire country all week long, and so it's great to see. He has a long way to go, of course, but what a way to end the week for both him and the Bills after what has been such an emotionally-draining couple of days. Just six days after Hamlin collapsed on the field, the emotional epicenter of the NFL was in Buffalo. The perfect ending as you put it, Christine, to such an incredible day. Everywhere you looked, there were reminders of the Bills' 24-year-old safety, his number 3 stitched onto his teammates' jerseys, on the flag they captioned, Josh Allen carried onto the field, on the countless home-made signs by fans. And the Bills training staff was also honored before the game as you saw for that life-saving effort six days prior very first play of the game against the Patriots, Nyheim Hines sending the stadium into a complete frenzy, taking back the opening kickoff, 96 yards for the touchdown. And the first kickoff return for the Bills -- and get this, three years and three months. Really, truly, I mean Damar Hamlin loving it, tweeting from his hospital bed in Cincinnati. He said that God's behind all of this, no coincidence. And Nyheim Hines, by the way, not done. They were trailing by 3 in the third quarter, he does it again. This time, 101 yards for the score. Hines saying after that this day was bigger than him or anybody on the field, but he was at the center of all of it. Buffalo wins 35-23. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He suggests that because she was aware of her villainous reputation, because ever since Princess Diana had famously said in her Panorama interview that there are three people in her marriage, and actually that tarnished Camilla's reputation. He said that members of his family got into bed with the devil, why he gave stories to the British tabloids and British media if it would help their reputation. And so the implication being that if she felt that she could get better press for herself, she would be prepared to allow other people's reputations to be jeopardized. That's the essence of the claim. And beyond that, too, Harry also suggests that the royal family were not welcoming when Meghan became a feature in Harry's life, and that they, in fact, were guilty of stereotyping her. Take a listen.  I don't think we have that sort, Christine.
