But with the reversals of the fortunes, instead of Biden being the incoming president, Trump will be the incoming president. But we are hearing from Trump's team he has accepted the offer that was extended by President Biden during that phone call today to have the two of them meet. We are told it will happen in short order. Obviously, we'll be watching that closely if Donald Trump does go to Washington to meet with him. We don't exactly see, you know, envision President Biden coming down to Palm Beach to do the reverse. But that moment in and of itself, just speaks to the way the dynamics have shifted four years later. And, Kristen, looking at this, if Trump does go to Washington to meet with Biden at the White House, one, it's a moment we did not see in 2020. I was there that day of Biden's inauguration, and Trump instead got on Marine One, then Air Force One, and flew here to Palm Beach, and, you know lived a very different life, obviously. But having that meeting happening in Washington, where when Trump does go back there in January, when he is inaugurated, it is going to be so different than when he entered in 2016 or even when he left in 2020 in terms of the balance of power, especially in the Senate. I mean, you look at the Republicans in the Senate right now, it is such a different world than it was before in terms of either being obstacles, as the White House often saw them, or as guardrails and stabilizing forces as critics of the White House saw them.",

And when he shows up in January of 2025, he will be essentially going to a homecoming, and he will have control of the House. He will have control of the Senate, and he will be in the White House.And the real thing to focus on is what we were talking about which it comes down to the Senate. I mean, he still did not have support of so many senators when he entered Washington in 2017. Marco Rubio, for example -- I mean, that was someone who was one of his biggest critics. They had run against each other. Now, Marco Rubio is looking at positions like secretary of state. He's going to be serving in the administration. Now, the people who are actually in the Senate, Bernie Moreno who was just elected, that was a handpicked candidate by Donald Trump and his allies. This is a very different makeup of Washington and of the Republican Party. You've really seen the full transformation with this election. You know, we've been saying it again for the last six years. But the big question was, was Donald Trump actually going to be reelected to the White House? He was. On top of that, were his allies going to be put into the Senate? Remember 2022, almost none, except for Ted Budd, none of his endorsed candidates actually made it into the White House. Dr. Oz, for example, in Pennsylvania. That is not what we saw this time around. He is going to have a Senate that is full of people who are Trump allies.",

I'm clearly standing by him. Marjorie Taylor Greene obviously being another very rabid Trump loyalist and supporter. Mike Johnson owes a lot to Donald Trump, and his career is on the line.

[19:10:04] MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right, Erin. In the race for control of the United States House, CNN can now project that the Democrats will hold this seat in a closely watched district in Central Virginia, the seventh congressional district. Eugene Vindman, the Democrat, defeating the Republican Derrick Anderson in that closely watched race. Vindman, a former legal adviser in the National Security Council, whose brother actually played a key role in the first Trump impeachment, Eugene Vindman beating Derrick Anderson in that key race. So what does this all mean for the overall balance of power in the United States House? Remember Democrats need to pick up a net of four seats to take back the House. But right now, they are falling short. There are six Republican pickups so far compared to two Democratic pickups. There are 36 seats remaining and really just very few opportunities to pick up seats. Now, why are Democrats falling short? Let's break that down a little further. Look at Nebraska. This is a seat that is now currently occupied by Congressman Don Bacon who is a Republican. It's a seat that Joe Biden, in a district that Joe Biden carried by 6.4 percent in 2020. Democrats thought they could pick that up, but they are losing in that race 8,300 votes. Tony Vargas, the Democratic candidate is behind Don Bacon with 95 percent reporting in that race. But that's not it. Also in California, another key pickup opportunity for Democrats. They thought they were going to be able to beat John Duarte. He's an incumbent Republican, that's a district that Joe Biden carried by 13 points in 2020. But look, Duarte is ahead by 3,100 votes against his Democratic challenger Adam Gray, with 48 percent reporting. Still a long way to go, but one that Republicans think they can hang on to. And this is also just a recent change in Arizona seat. Juan Ciscomani. He is an incumbent Republican, a freshman Democrats had hoped to pick him off his seat as well, but now he is ahead because there was a new batch of votes that just came out. He's ahead by 417 votes. Obviously, a razor thin margin. It could potentially go either way. There's still a lot more to go. So, where do other races stand at the moment? Right now Democrats are leading in four Republican seats. That's perhaps good news for the Democrats but this is the bad news for them two seats Republicans are leading in Democratic districts, which shows you, Erin, why Democrats' path back to the majority is so fraught. Yes, they're up in some but they're down in some in getting that net of four seats is going to be very difficult. But one thing is very clear, even if Republicans do maintain control of the House, Erin, Speaker Mike Johnson would have a very narrow majority like he had in this past congress. Once again, could have that in this Congress. And that's not always an easy recipe to legislate. BURNETT: No, not at all. Manu, thank you so much. And it's so important to lay all that out because its complicated but still unknown who will control the House. Joining me now is Joe Manchin, the retiring senior senator from West Virginia. So, Senator, I'm glad to talk to you. And wow, what an historic moment we are in the midst of even now. SEN. JOE MANCHIN (I-WV): Good to be with you, Erin.",

He was able to have a program that basically more people bought in than what Kamala did. And that's the middle, the power of the middle is unbelievable. I just hope when they get to Washington, they remember how they got there. They got there by appealing to reasonable responsible, sensible people that are in the middle. I'm in the middle. A lot of people, Democrats have become homeless and a lot of Republicans became homeless and we weren't Washington Democrats. We weren't Republican Democrats. But we wanted to get things done. You get things done from the middle. So those are the tight races that can barely get by. And when they do get by, remember how you got elected and who voted for you?

What happens we get off, and the politicians get off so much on all of the intricacies of how people are going to live their life and this and that and everything, and forget about those who are actually working every day to live their lives and I think that swing area, President Donald Trump has to understand that's where he won.

He writes: Donald Trump has no greater friend than the far left, which has managed to alienate historic numbers of Latinos, Blacks, Asians and Jews from the Democratic Party with absurdities like defund the police or from the river to the sea or Latinx. There is more to lose than there is to gain politically from pandering to the far left that is more representative of Twitter, Twitch, and TikTok than of the real world.

He pitched it with a more, I think, fringe version of his message than even the ads four years ago or even back eight years ago.I think what we see is a middle rejection of the administration actually was really interested in the report from Kayla Tausche that she said a couple of minutes ago talking about the friction between Biden and Harris, possibly around her distancing from him. If anything Harris was overly deferential to Joe Biden. I think what we see from the results this week is a story that the unwillingness to break from the administration, whether it be on inflation or Gaza or immigration is a central problem with the candidacy. The second thing that I think stuck out to that stuck out on that front was they were saying that, you know, they think maybe they were slightly underrating of Biden's unpopularity. I mean, of course, that's the lesson from this week. I mean, if they did not see that that is an ignoring of evidence that have shown him as a historically unpopular president for years. And so, partly, even hearing the postmortem coming from the Democrats is a reminder of just how far they were from the baseline feeling of the electorate. It is not a thing they should have figured out the day after the election that Joe Biden was unpopular. It was the fundamental fact of this election was it was a was a status quo that we are seeing consistent evidence that people didn't like. And that included the middle.",

What I do worry about is if that's the situation, I don't have much doubt that Donald Trump is going to make a phone call on day one and say, you guys get rid of the filibuster. And if they get rid of the filibuster, of course, it is open field running for the Republican Party.

There's a couple moderating factors the filibuster, the fact that if they do have a house majority, it'll be 1, 2 or 3 votes, tops, right?They weren't able to manage a house with a four-vote majority. So they're going to have all kinds of problems associated with actually governing. Remember, the House was not governing in the last Congress because the Senate was Democratic and the president was Democratic. So that's really, really hard to do, and could be a moderating factor. There's going to be a lot of nervous Republicans. If Donald Trump really lets his freak flag fly and goes extreme, you know, people like Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania are going to say, wait a minute, this is the end of my career if you do this stuff.

Historically, their strategy in that case and really all the cases has been to delay, delay, delay but this time they're going to argue to the judge that as a president-elect, Trump is entitled to the same protections as a sitting president and should be protective from any state prosecutors, from any action in a state level proceeding.Now, the judge, Judge Juan Merchan, has given himself a deadline of November 12th, to weigh in on whether this entire conviction should be tossed after the Supreme Court's immunity ruling this summer. If he does that, the sentencing will go away. But the Trump team again, they're not even just trying to delay this. They're going to try to get this canceled.",

Now, they've been talking about internal guidance. Justice department guidance around, you know, whether a sitting president can be indicted or prosecuted and how that applies to a president elect.Now, I'm told these conversations will likely continue for several days. It is complicated. He has codefendants. Also, questions about what happens to the special counsel's office. But it is expected that Trump will not have to order his Justice Department to fire smith, as he has said he would do, or dismiss the case as it is expected at this point that these will be wrapped up before he gets to the White House.",

That case that we spent all those days attending court as did the former president in this spring. So how do you think that's going to go?",

I'm going to go ahead and impose sentence.On the other hand, if he's looking at the practicalities, I can see him concluding, look, no matter what I sentence Donald Trump to, he's not going to serve a day behind bars. He's now the president elect. He's going to spend the next four years as president. Why bother? Why even get into this mess?",

First of all, he's just come through four criminal indictments. He's not going to spend a day behind bars.Second of all, the immunity ruling you just mentioned, it's very broad. It's brand new, but essentially it says anything that he does that can be tied to his official acts as president he cannot be prosecuted for. Third of all, let's be realistic. There's not going to be a federal investigation of Donald Trump while he's president. There's not going to be a special counsel this time. He and his attorney general are not going to allow the next Robert Mueller to be appointed. And on top of that, he's got a Republican Senate now, could end up with a Republican House and the Supreme Court 6 to 3 in favor of conservatives. So we're going to have to rely on the nonpolitical people who work in government and perhaps the courts and the good faith of the people who Donald Trump works picks to work in his administration.",
