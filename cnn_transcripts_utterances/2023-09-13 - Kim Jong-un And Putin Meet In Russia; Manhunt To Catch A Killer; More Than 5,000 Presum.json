Pardon me, this is footage that was taken earlier. Earlier this day, they shook hands, they greeted one another. They toured the facility and talks are indeed underway. Kim, he signed the guestbook. He was seen on camera writing this \"Russia, which gave birth to the first conquerors of space will be immoral.\"And his sister who is also a high-level official, Kim Yo-jong, she was seen on camera as he signed that guestbook. Now, according to Russian- state media, Putin was asked the question this, \"Will Russia help North Korea build satellites? And Putin responded, that is why we are here at the Vostochny Cosmodrome. Now ahead of the meeting, Putin said that Kim showed great interest in space.  Putin also said that the leaders will discuss all issues \"without haste.\" And this meeting comes just hours after North Korea fire two short range ballistic missiles into the waters off of the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. That's according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. And analysts point out that this is indeed the first time we have seen a missile test without the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the country that we have to bear in mind. This is a leader who rarely travels abroad. Now, this meeting that is currently underway between Kim and Putin. It comes as U.S. has been issuing its warning, saying that these two nations are actively advancing their talks over another potential arms deal. We know that Kim arrived in Russia very early on Tuesday, setting foot some 6:00 a.m. local time Tuesday in Hassan, that's the main rail gateway to Russia's far east. And Kim, decked out in his suit smiling as he stepped off the train onto that red carpet. He was welcomed by the Russian delegation. He left Pyongyang days ago on Sunday to go to Russia by private train that famous green train. Also on board with him and also at this meeting underway, North Korea's leading officials, including its top military leaders, his chief diplomat is present as well. Now this is Kim Jong-un's first overseas trip since 2019 when he traveled by train to Vladivostok for his very first meeting with Vladimir Putin. The U.S. says it remains concerned that North Korea will provide arms to Russia. And what is North Korea want in exchange? North Korea is seeking advanced technology for -- like nuclear powered submarines satellites. It's also seeking food aid which it desperately needs. Out the Russia, North Korean relationship has been deepening in recent months and it is taking a significant step with this meeting currently underway in Vostochny. Back to you.",

U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has ordered a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. This despite any direct evidence that actually links Biden to corruption or any illegal acts, or any evidence to prove allegations that Biden profited from his son's business deals. The White House responding with a social media post, saying McCarthy \"vowed to hold a vote to open impeachment, now he flip flopped because he doesn't have support.\" Also calling the move extreme politics at its worst.

Over 10,000 people that are missing. And again, as you say, the full extent, the human cost, we just don't know yet. Very difficult to verify these numbers. But what we do know is even the Libyan National Army that governs the eastern parts of the country has said that they weren't prepared for the scale of devastation.It is absolutely catastrophic with bodies lying around the morgue full. You've got hospitals that are not in service, you've got power outages, very difficult to communicate. Roads that are impossible to go to the most affected area. And of course, that is the city of Derna where entire parts of the city just melted away. I mean, literally going into the sea and the two dams that burst also causing muddy waters to flow through the city. No evacuation orders, no warning systems that were put in place. But the government in the West has also stepped in. This is the rival government to the east. They're sending plans and aid. They're also sending generators to try and get power back up and, of course, communication as well. And we've also just heard from the government emergency and Rapid Response Team saying that what they need right now is surgical supplies and kits. Other blankets, food, shelter, and they don't need more -- they need more technical help than actual goods. You've got Turkey stepping in, Malta, the UAE, Qatar, Egypt as well. Really important assistance that will be needed at this point of time. The Facebook page of Derna said that they -- the situation is completely out of control. And they're calling for more international assistance. To give you an understanding of how much rainfall we saw in just one day, 414 millimeters of rain. That is more that is, you know, falls down into the area in eight months. So, it gives you a sense of just the catastrophe and of course, the lack of warning systems because possibly of the political scenarios playing out, remember Libya has been in turmoil for a very long time. Lack of infrastructure maintenance causing the situation to spiral basically out of control. For now, though, people are desperately trying to find their loved ones. People are searching through the rubble. Rescue teams have this Herculean task of trying to get into the city itself to work through the rubble and what is left. We also know that shelter is required at the stage. Paula, the next few days are going to be absolutely critical for the people in Derna and for the people overall in eastern Libya.",

      "sentences": "Well, obviously, there are very good reasons why Libya was included in the Global Fragility Act voted by the U.S. Congress, you know, two years ago, I do think that the political -- the fragility in Libya in general, whether coming from the political context, but also from governance issues, infrastructure issues, the economic model, et cetera. So, you have several elements or buckets to -- how fragility is being defined in Libya. The other thing, why Libya is important to deal with is that there are a lot of subversive actors in Libya at this stage. You know, then that itself was occupied by ISIS for five years, it was liberated only in 2019. And terrorist groups are still around, that now has been liberated. I think a lot of Libyans sacrificed their lives to liberate Derna. But this doesn't mean that the problem is away. Terrorist groups are still active in Libya.You have Russian mercenaries still in Libya. So, a lot of subversive groups would definitely like to see the response being less than what needs to happen. And therefore, try to, you know, reestablish themselves in that part of Libya. On the political sides, specifically, you know, so far, we didn't see any immediate result of the political division. I think the west-based government has provided support and they're taking -- they're not taking the lead. So, they -- basically, they let the space for the east base government to take the lead. I think this is a good sign. However, there are some parts of the Libyan administration both the east and the west are still dealing with, you know, petty procedures. I definitely hope that the impediments to access will be lifted by the Libyan authorities as soon as possible. The international organizations have been banned from getting visas for the last year or so. And this has contributed a lot to the lack of preparedness on the ground. So, I think it helps the Libyan government right now to give us unrestricted access to Libya.",

Yes, they are talking about the space program.Yes they are talking about relations, food security, all these kinds of things, but really the reason why Putin wanted this meeting is because of the war in Ukraine, and his desperate need to secure further ammunition to ensure that he can continue this war. Because, again, we have been seeing a lot of support from the West for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been very capable at home, talking to the West about various ways in which he wants to secure this further weaponry. And he has managed it with this $1 billion assistance from the United States. Now Russia is looking around, trying to find where it can secure this ammunition and North Korea may be the answer. This is what U.S. officials have been warning about for quite some time, that there may be an arms deal on the table, this is what they may be discussing today. And the reason for this is because North Korean weaponry -- ammunition, would be very suitable for Russian weaponry. They could put North Korean ammunition into some Russian weaponry directly, and use it on the front lines of Ukraine immediately. But the issue is going to be getting that weaponry to the frontline, because where they are, very near Vladivostok, is thousands of miles away from the front line. And transporting that weaponry is likely going to be on railways, Cold War era railways that are not very secure, not very stable. And so transporting them is likely going to be quite challenging. But of course, really, the thing here is messaging. Showing the world that Putin has allies, has ways of securing further support, further ammunition as well, and really in the past couple of days when we look at his recent statements on the war in Ukraine, he's talked yesterday about the Day of Reunification, declaring these regions of Ukraine, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, all very near the frontlines where Russian forces are very much still fighting and Ukraine has been making some progress recently. Russia is saying these regions are now going to be unified as part of Russia, they are going to celebrate this with the Day of Reunification on September 30th. All of this is about projecting confidence at a point when maybe the war is not necessarily going Russia's way. This is part of this deal. Showing the world that Russia still has allies and it's still continuing with this war.",

SYDNEY SEILER, KOREA CHAIR SR. ADVISER, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Well, first of all, again, Paula, thank you for the invitation. We can see that there are some opportunities in here on both sides and parts, and I think a degree of, not desperation so much on the DPRK side, certainly a degree of desperation on the Russian side.
