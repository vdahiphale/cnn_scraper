This was the first and probably only time that he will ever speak publicly on Capitol Hill about the conclusions from this investigation, which found some evidence of wrongdoing by President Biden, but not enough to charge him with any crimes. That was the bottom line conclusion. What we saw throughout the day, Julia was both sides, Democrats and Republicans trying to stretch those conclusions and twist them and distort them to fit their political narrative. Republicans tried to elicit responses from Special Counsel Hur that would confirm their allegation that he is senile. This is a huge campaign issue for the 2020 election, Joe Biden's age, his memory and questions about his ability and fitness for the job, but he wouldn't do it. The special counsel would not cave to their demands. He did not give them a soundbite that they could use on the campaign trail about Biden's age. On the other side, you had Democrats that were trying to distort in some ways the conclusion of this report. They said that this was a complete and total exoneration for Joe Biden. When the special counsel heard that characterization he said no. He said, I did not exonerate Biden. I didn't find enough evidence to charge Biden, but I did not exonerate him. So there was a lot of political theater throughout the day and you had Special Counsel Robert Hur trying to straddle the line and play it straight as he delivered this performance on a critically important issue for the country -- Julia.",

First and foremost, President Biden cooperated almost right away when they found classified materials at his home. They called the government, they called FBI.

She said: \"When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful.\" When we stand together, no force on earth is more powerful. I believed that then and I believe it now. And we see it in Polish-American troops serving side-by-side NATO on the eastern flank including in Poland. And we see it in our commitment to strengthen NATO's collective defenses, and I want to pause here and note that Poland is spending nearly four percent of its gross domestic product on defense, much of it purchasing American weapons systems and aircraft. And that's double the NATO commitment, four percent. We also see it in our support for Ukraine and the force of Putin's vicious onslaught against Ukraine in a way that is just border -- I won't even describe it. I want to thank you both for Poland's unwavering security and humanitarian assistance, including welcoming about one million Ukrainian refugees. As my mother would say, God love you. You're doing God's work. You really are. It is incredible what you're doing, what the Polish people are doing. Today, the United States is announcing an emergency package for Ukraine using cost savings from previously approved Pentagon contracts. The package includes munitions and rounds to help Ukraine hold the line against Russia's brutal attacks for the next couple of weeks, which I have the authority to do without asking Congress for some more money right now. Well, I've asked them for a lot more money and so -- but it is not nearly enough what I am announcing today. Congress must pass the bipartisan national security bill now, which includes urgent funding for Ukraine. We must act before it literally is too late, before it is too late, because as Poland remembers, Russia won't stop at Ukraine. Putin will keep going, putting Europe, and the United States, and the entire free world at risk in my view. So thank you both again for being here at this critical time and with that, Mr. President, I hand it over to you. The floor is yours.",

Nobody poked a substantial hole in anything he said in his report and he didn't come out with any new remarkable revelations which you don't want. Here is where I think both sides sort of had it right and had it wrong. Democrats were right to point out that the bottom line here is no criminal charge against Joe Biden. However, Democrats and the White House throughout the day have overreached. They've argued that this was a complete exoneration when it was not. At times, they tried to suggest there was no evidence of wrongdoing when in fact there was some substantial evidence that Joe Biden knew he had sensitive classified documents for several years. I think where Republicans made a good point was really what I just said, Joe Biden did do wrong here. He did wrongly possess at least some of the classified documents, but I think where Republicans overstepped is when they tried to suggest that what Joe Biden did, and what Donald Trump did are really one and the same. And why was one indicted and not the other? I think the answer there is self-evident. Donald Trump obstructed and Joe Biden more or less cooperated. So I think both sides had some important points to make, but both sides also as I guess, are members of Congress want to do did overreach at times.",

It is not as if you take the inputs, you run some calculations and then it tells you charge or no charge. There is a substantial middle-ground, a gray area here, and that is clearly where Hur's investigation fell. Now, he could have said this is an indictment. He could have indicted, but you can't indict a sitting president under long-standing DOJ policy, but he could have come out and said, I find that this is  indictable conduct by Joe Biden or on the other extreme, he could have said, I find that Joe Biden did nothing wrong, that would have been an exoneration. Instead, he said, well, there is some evidence that Joe Biden knew he had these documents, but ultimately where Robert Hur exercised his discretion and I don't think  inappropriately, he said, I don't know that I could bring this case in front of a jury and convince 12 of them unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt to find him guilty, given some of the lapses in memory and given some of the other what we would call soft factors.",

Prosecutors assess people's intent all the time. I do think however, Robert Hur's language in the report was a bit over the top, a bit unnecessarily colorful when he said something, I am paraphrasing here -- but an elderly, well-meaning man with a poor memory. I mean, that felt like he leaned into it a little bit. In terms of the ultimate conclusion, I agree with Robert Hur. I think Robert Hur was correct that there is substantial evidence of wrongdoing. I think that Robert Hur's report establishes that the White House and Joe Biden have not been fully honest with the public. They've maintained for a year or so now that it was all unintentional. But I also do fully understand Robert Hur's decision not to bring charges. This does not strike me as a case where you had to charge it. As a prosecutor, it strikes me as a case where reasonable prosecutors can differ and I think the more cautious approach is the one that Robert Hur ended up taking of no charges.",

And I think there is a couple of things that are really interesting here. When I talked to the Trump campaign about the different races today. Like I said, they already view him as the presumptive nominee. They want to cement that status with him as being officially having enough delegates for him to go on to the convention and be declared the nominee. But they really want to see how much support he could get in each state, and I think, you mentioned Georgia and that is a crucial state that they will be watching tonight as well, Joe Biden's team and his campaign. That is a state that Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden less than four or roughly four years ago by less than 12,000 votes. And so that is a state that both Joe Biden and Donald Trump are going to be running hard at. We saw them over the weekend, both of them in the state on Saturday hosting dueling rallies. It is going to be a state where really, it could come down to just a couple thousand votes or excuse me, a couple hundred thousand votes, and Georgia will be one of those states that that will be very crucial to their campaigns. And the other thing I just want to mention, Julia, is that after tonight, we could see again formally this rematch between Joe Biden and the former President Donald Trump and that would be the first time we saw an incumbent president and a former president in a rematch since 1892. And when I talked to voters across the country, I have to say, a lot of them are dissatisfied that both of these candidates are going to again, be going head-to-head. A lot of people were hoping there might be some fresh faces that were going toward a general election, but it is very much going to be Donald Trump and Joe Biden as we look ahead to November.",

My guess is, is that we are going to be looking at a clear air turbulence issue, which took the pilots by surprise. But in any case, the New Zealand investigative body, they will find that out and we will know about exactly what happened on that in the very near future. In terms of the audit, this is just the start of a series of examinations that Boeing is going to be facing, the NTSB is digging into this Alaska Air issue and they have not been happy with the way Boeing has responded.

That's a tenth of a percent higher than the January reading and just more than economists expected just a little bit. Gasoline prices and shelter, a big reason why the gasoline prices rose nearly percent over the past month alone. Investors though, unfazed. All three U.S. averages finishing higher. And the S&amp;P 500 hit a new record close. Catherine Rampell is with us now. Catherine, great to have you with us. Never mind the markets, we care about consumers. It is just one data point and nothing moves in a straight line. But how fixated should we be on this particular number, and the impact on the Fed who is looking to cut rates? CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL COMMENTATOR That's an excellent question. So again, the reports are noisy, just as you explained. You should never put too much emphasis on any one data point. That said, we've had a couple of months now of relatively hot inflation above -- well above at this point, what the Federal Reserve wants to see. The debate right now, I think is not so much whether the Fed will cut the expectation -- cut rates, rather, the expectation is still very much that the Fed will reduce interest rates. But the question is when? And if you look at where markets were forecasting that initial rate cut to come about a month ago, they had, you know, market participants had placed the odds at around 50 percent chance by May. Now, the same market measure suggests about a 10 percent chance by May. So, the idea being that the Federal Reserve will cut but they may hold these rates higher for longer as they wait to see a lot more data come in to be sure that the economy, in fact, could withstand less restrictive financial conditions.",
