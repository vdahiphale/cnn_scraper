Both were fired into the waters east of the Korean Peninsula just a short time ago. That says South Korea wraps up its joint military drills on the East Coast. The North has called those exercises a provocation. By CNN's count, this will be North Korea's 28 missile tests this year alone.

It comes just days after the start of the South Korean Jordan Marine, Navy and Air Force amphibious landing operation drill that's due to wrap up today. And it also took place today's missile launches ahead of a planned U.S.-South Korea Air Force military drill, a large-scale drill that will kick off on Monday October the 31st.This is what we learned from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff earlier today. Two short range ballistic missiles were fired by North Korea roughly around noon local time. We do have a statement from the JCS, saying that they are indeed on alert. According to the JCS, quote, \"Our military has strengthened its surveillance and vigilance and it is maintaining a fully prepared posture while closely cooperating with the U.S.\" After the launches today, the U.S. military is of course consulting with its allies, watching the situation while also saying that these launches pose no immediate threat. According to the U.S.-Indo Pacific Command, quote, \"While we have assess that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies, missile launches highlight the destabilizing impact of the DPRK's unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. The U.S. commitments to the defense of the Republic of Korea and Japan remain ironclad.\" North Korea has been carrying out a flurry of missile tests. Just a few weeks ago, a fire to missile over Japan, the first such missile test since 2017. This year alone, it's fired more missiles. This highest level of missile tests since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011. Intention in particular is rising between the two Koreas. Earlier this week, we had North and South Korea have that exchange of warning shots at sea and that followed another provocative event where in mid-October, we saw South Korean warplanes scrambling in response to North Korean military jets that were touching too close to their shared and heavily fortified military border. Look, the world is also watching for any possible nuclear test to be conducted and led by the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He has been giving more harsh rhetoric, suggesting that they have the capability to do so. If such a nuclear test takes place, that would be the first such nuclear test to be conducted since 2017. The U.S. and its allies in the region, Japan and South Korea have said in the event of another nuclear test, they have agreed upon what they call an unparalleled response. Back to you, John.",

These are the very conservative populist governments that are popping up in NATO countries in the West, this populist movement, which is oftentimes much more culturally traditional, and is also uncomfortable about things like the gay movement, and being gay.

Yet another example of the excessive and lethal force being used by the Iranian security forces against protesters who have been taken to the streets over the last six weeks in response to the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, many now calling for regime change. There are also concerns that the regime could now be setting the pretext to double down on its violent and brutal crackdown following an attack on the Shah Cheragh shrine in the Shiraz southern city on Wednesday. According to the authorities, this attack has been claimed by the Islamic State. According to state media, the regime has now identified three key assailants who they say open fire on worshippers on Wednesday evening, killing at least 15 people and injuring 40 more as foreign nationals. But this could essentially play into the narrative that the regime has been pushing forward for weeks now that the protests that we're seeing across the country have been stoked, encouraged and facilitated by foreign agents, namely the United States and Israel, who they accused of encouraging unrest and creating instability in the country. On Thursday, Iran's Armed Forces said that the attack on Wednesday which they characterized as a terrorist incident was a product of these protests and that those taken to the streets are complicit in this violence. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said the Iranian regime will respond directly to this incident and they have called now for a rally to be held on Friday against the violence that we've seen. But there are concerns being expressed by human rights groups across the board, that this could set the pretext for the Iranian regime to really double down and intensify an already brutal and deadly crackdown on peaceful protesters who continue to take to the streets demanding regime change, demanding that their fundamental human rights are upheld and respected and crucially demanding that the rights of women across the country are also respected.
