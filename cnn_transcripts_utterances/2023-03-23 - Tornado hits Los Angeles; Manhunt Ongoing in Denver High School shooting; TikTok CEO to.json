One person was hurt, more than a dozen buildings were damaged, many beyond repair. Meanwhile, torrential rain created a muddy mess for these farm animals in San Bernardino County.

JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it's resilient. It's got strong capital liquidity. We took powerful actions with treasury, and the FDIC, which demonstrates that all depositors' savings are safe in the banking system is safe.

Now, when the fed raises rates, it makes borrowing more expensive for consumers, which leads to less spending, which ultimately brings down prices.But higher rates also makes existing treasury bonds less valuable and that can create issues for banks that are holding a lot of these bonds if they need to sell them anytime in the near future. That's part of what happened to SVB, and there's also fear of banking concerns grow. Another bank could also fall. So that's the tightrope for the fed to walk.

This is the grand jury investigation into the potential mishandling of classified records at Mar-a-Lago and possibly obstruction of justice.
