And millions left picking up the pieces from Hurricane Beryl in record-breaking, life-threatening heat. All right, 6 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at the White House on this Thursday morning. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. President Biden started this week writing to leaders in his own party, demanding they stop questioning his position at the top of the ticket. \"It's time for it to end,\" he wrote. But on this Thursday morning, just hours from when he'll take the stage for what is perhaps the highest stakes press conference of his half-century career in politics, it has not ended. Nancy Pelosi is still asking questions. So is Democratic Senator Peter Welch and George Clooney. Yes, that George Clooney, writing this brutal assessment just weeks after he posed for this photo with the president. Clooney says this, quote, \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man that we witnessed at the debate.\" Vermont's Peter Welch on Wednesday became the first Democratic senator to say that Biden should step aside, writing, quote, \"For the good of the country, I am calling on President Biden to withdraw from the race.\" Those comments make Senator Welch the tenth congressional Democrat to call on Biden to step aside, with similar statements on Wednesday from Representatives Pat Ryan and Earl Blumenauer. But it was these comments Wednesday morning from the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who is someone whose counsel Biden actually values, now sounding open to the possibility that Biden could change his mind. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to -- to make that decision, because time is running short. I want him to do whatever he decides to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are others, though, publicly supporting him, but you can really see the division. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

You know, I think they are in a position right now where there are a lot of people -- I mean, you heard, you know, obviously, Senator Fetterman has stood very strongly by him. You've heard others say, you know, he can win this race. I'm actually somebody who believes that he still can win this race. This is a moment where people want to rally behind him, I think. And the campaign needs to give people a reason to do that. I mean, I think all of this anger and frustration, it all comes from a shared desire to beat Donald Trump. Democrats feel that Trump is an existential threat. They are scared about the prospect of losing this election. They want to win. I think the Biden team would serve Joe Biden well to put forward some data that shows, here's our path, and help people rally around the idea that he can win. Because the public data right now isn't good for him. And that's influencing the way people are thinking, because it's politics.",

SARAH LONGWELL, REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTdone nothing but focus groups. I've just listened to voters. I've talked to black voters, to swing voters, to Democratic voters who voted for Hillary Clinton and then Joe Biden and are now undecided. And here's the main takeaway from the voters that Joe Biden desperately needs: these swing voters, these double-haters. He was already behind with them. They already had concerns about his age. That has now calcified into a belief from these voters that he cannot do the job for four more years. And they are desperate for a change. They actually think that a change signals strengths, not weakness. And they're sort of begging for an alternative. I mean -- and look, the language that they use is tough. They -- they are extremely unhappy with this choice, and they say things like we've got an insurrectionist on one hand and somebody who's not there on the other hand. Or they even -- they use much more unflattering terms than that. And it is -- it is all around this sense that Biden can't do it. And the thing that I'm seeing in the public polling, as well, that's got me more concerned that I don't think people are talking about enough is the race is tightening in places like Minnesota; in places like Virginia; in places where the map is expanding for Donald Trump in ways where, as somebody who's also a strategist who is actively running a campaign, Republican Voters Against Trump, who was trying to rally people to vote against Trump, to build an anti-Trump coalition, I am watching states that were not on the table, not on the map that were -- that were not even thought about as competitive getting competitive.

I wanted this campaign to play offense for a long time, but you cannot ignore the fact that these -- everybody saw it.

But at the end of this week, whatever he decides to do -- it's still his decision -- this is a much more complicated race for him. To Sarah's point, I was talking to Democratic advisers in Minnesota yesterday. They are very worried about Minnesota. You might ask, why Minnesota? Think back to 2016. Minnesota was the closest defeat for Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton by about 1.5 percentage points. So, I always call it the reddest blue state in the country. So, Minnesota is an issue.

It's a real issue. They have built a very big campaign, a robust Biden campaign with these offices and a huge advertising budget. Right now, they will not be able to keep the lights on with the amount of money coming in. So, at the end of the day, does a press conference even change this? I'm not so sure about that. But my eye is on the Senate lunch. We've all covered a lot of those, been to a lot of them. It is absolutely pivotal today. When Jen O'Malley Dillon, and Steve Ricchetti and Mike Donilon, three top Biden advisors, go to the Senate Democratic lunch, the message they get, I think, is one that we know, because we've talked to these senators.
