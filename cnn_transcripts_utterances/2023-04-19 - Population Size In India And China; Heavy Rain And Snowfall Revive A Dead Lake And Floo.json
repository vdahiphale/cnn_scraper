That`s 1/6 of the world`s wealth counts daily. (Voice-over): Already more than half of all Indians are under the age of 30. That means a huge potential to grow the national economy, but education and investment need to keep up if there are going to be jobs for a new generation. India`s new global title will mean little if it doesn`t come with fresh opportunity. Vedika Sud, CNN, New Delhi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But thencame this winter of relentless rivers in the sky, enough to bring a long dead lake back to life and drought over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop. (On camera): It is mind blowing to realize that if you`d stood here for the last couple of generations, he`d be watching the sunset over dusty fields of cotton or alfalfa or pistachio trees. And now it is waterfront property. I had no idea Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi, but it was dammed and dived and drained to build a $2 billion agriculture industry. And now it`s back. It`s proof that water never forgets. And this may just be the beginning because behind those clouds over there, the Sierra Nevadas are so packed with snow, 260% above normal, and sooner or later that`s going to melt which is only going to make this flooding worse and last longer. The last time it flooded this dramatically here was 1983 and it took two years to dry out. You were telling me about the effects in `83?",
