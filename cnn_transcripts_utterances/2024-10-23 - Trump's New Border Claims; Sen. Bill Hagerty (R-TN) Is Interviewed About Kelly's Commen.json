And then it was now the - the Congo is delivering people to the border. There is no evidence for any of those claims about the Congo and prisoners.I spoke to the representatives for both the Democratic Republic of Congo and a smaller neighboring country, the Republic of Congo. Both of them were just befuddled. The spokesperson for the DRC said to me, \"everything he is saying isn't true.\" Then the ambassador to the U.S. for the neighboring Republic of Congo, said, \"there is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.\" Now for skeptics who say, well, of course they're going to say that, I also spoke to independent experts on both countries. They say they see no sign that either country is emptying prisons for any reason, let alone to somehow send criminals to the U.S. as migrants. And I also reached out to, of course, to the Trump campaign itself repeatedly. They have not been able to provide a single shred of corroboration for these claims.",
