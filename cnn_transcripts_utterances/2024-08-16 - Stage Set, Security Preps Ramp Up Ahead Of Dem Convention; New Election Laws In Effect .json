The DNC just released those new images of the setup at Chicago's United Center, ready for Vice President Harris to formally accept her party's nomination for president. Law enforcement says they've spent a year preparing for this and are ready.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEREK MAYER, SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE, U.S. SECRET SERVICE: As far as the DNC is concerned, obviously with the whole government approach, there's a lot of precautions that we use. You know, we use security perimeters, we use credentials, we use badging, we're screening everyone who comes in. So, I think to compare a national special security event to a lone wolf attack at a campaign event is much different. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It looks very tight, Dana. And what -- that was the deputy special agent in charge for the U.S. Secret Service out here. His name is Derek Mayer. He has spent more than a year developing the plans for the security perimeter and what he has made very clear through several briefings that we've been to is that this -- the physicality of this is very different than the January 13th rally, because what they know is that the long shadow of that failure now casts a shadow over all of their major events.You know, it was certainly a question that was top of mind of the RNC. It remains a question here. But again, what they have stressed is that this is very different. And Dana, let me show you why. For example, for several blocks, the Secret Service is deploying these non-scalable fences. This is going to happen here at the United Center, as well as at McCormick Place. This is some of the most visible security, Dana. Law enforcement is also going to be getting support in the air. They're getting support on the water. And in addition, Dana, this is going to be a ground game because law enforcement is bringing out thousands of law enforcement officers days off for Chicago. Police department officers have been canceled. Vacations been canceled. They are on an all hands on deck posture. In addition to that, Dana, more than 500 mutual aid officers from surrounding areas are going to be assigned to the DNC. And so certainly the major concern here is how to secure both McCormick Place, which is the other location for the DNC, as well as the United Center. But the other big question, Dana, is how to make sure that the rest of the city is safe throughout this event because you can't pull resources from other neighborhoods. They have to have the same level of policing response that they expect. And then additionally, Dana, there's an expectation that tens of thousands of protesters could come out and use the DNC spotlight to shine a light on their cause, particularly people who are protesting the war in the Middle East. What we've seen over the last several months in Chicago is thousands of protesters taking to the streets. That has happened since October. We certainly expect that will continue here, Dana. And with the spotlight of the DNC, there is going to be a lot of visibility, law enforcement trying to figure out how to maintain the safety for those First Amendment activities while also maintaining security for the rest of the city, Dana.",

The big ones, I think for voters who are showing up, you need a photo ID now, if you are going to vote.There are also changes to mail-in ballots. Before, if you mailed your ballot in, it came in a day, two, three election day, that was OK. Now they're tightening that process. And if you have a mail-in ballot, it has to be in by the evening of election day. Georgia, as you pointed out, that is a law that got a lot of attention, a lot of flak. A lot of the big changes there are really around mail-in ballots, really tightening the rules for mail-in ballots. And that means limiting a lot of these ballot drop boxes, the locations, and the hours. Obviously, this was very popular during 2020, during COVID.

And the example they use there is sending a mail-in ballot to a voter who did not affirmatively request one. And of course, Dana, as you know, these kinds of changes come at a time where election officials faced a lot of flak in 2020 and again in 2022.
