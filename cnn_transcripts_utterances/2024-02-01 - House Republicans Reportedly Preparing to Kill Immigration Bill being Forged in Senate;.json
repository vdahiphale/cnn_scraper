Moments ago, President Biden arrived on Capitol Hill. He will be giving a speech at a National Prayer Breakfast as he faces multiple crises here at home and overseas. And right now the world really is watching and waiting to see how the president has decided to retaliate for that drone attack in Jordan that killed U.S. troops, allegedly launched by Iranian-backed militants. Reporters peppered him with questions about when that response will come, and about House Republicans lining up to kill a border security deal in the Senate.",

But you can really hardly think of a more discordant moment for that message to try and get across.Of course, election year politics are always toxic in Washington, particularly when you have an incumbent who is running for reelection. And you really do see that illustrated in the debate over this immigration bill on Capitol Hill. It's not just divides between Republicans and Democrats, but even within the Republican Party you see the split between House Republicans and the House Speaker Mike Johnson and their Republican counterparts in the Senate. Certainly, that intervention by President Trump had the effect of essentially scuttling the bill all together. You also see divides among Democrats over the issue of the Middle East and the Gaza. Certainly, many progressives dissatisfied with how Biden is handling that. And it will be interesting later today when he heads to Michigan to talk to autoworkers, that state home to a large Arab American population who has been outwardly angry about how he is handling this. so certainly, a fraught environment for the president to be speaking about unity on Capitol Hill today. President Biden, of course, is something of a throwback in this regard, openly nostalgic about his own days in the Senate, what he thought were better days, more unified days. And it was interesting. I went back to read his speech at this event last year. He said he bemoaned that we see each other as enemies, not neighbors. It is hard to see how much has changed in the last year, Phil.",

I want to start where Kevin left off. I think it is fascinating reporting from Barak Ravid yesterday about the State Department weighing whether or not to have the two-state solution to move forward on the discussions related to that.

Go ahead, make Donald Trump's day. We're not recognizing a state of mind.To recognize a state, there actually has to be one in existence, and right now there is no Palestinian state. The British foreign secretary said something very similar to what the White House is leaking. I really think it is a mindless approach. It is actually much the same as what the PLO used to do, trying to get recognition as a state in the hallways of the United Nations, as if that would make for a difference on the ground. I think that kind of position pushes the Israeli government into an even firmer resistance to negotiating that point.",

It's possible it will happen if the White House can break Israel's resolve. Yes, there might be a big deal. The difference I think is that the Biden administration is so gravely concerned about its political prospects in November, it's nearly paralyzed about what to do about the larger conflict. It simply will not recognize what has been obvious I think since October the 7th, that the cause of these conflicts across the Middle East today is Iran.

Now, I'm not saying that an initial attack on assets in Iran has to be regime threatening. In fact, I would say the contrary.

They are not deterred by the United States. So if you want to reestablish deterrence, there are ways to do it.
