That shelter has been housing migrants. But first, we want to play the moments leading up to the incident in Brownsville. You have to look very closely at the scree, but you'll see what happens here as this car plows into what is believed to be a group of migrants.Now we've frozen that video right before the most graphic moment, but this video comes from Congressman Henry Cuellar's office, and I'll be speaking with him later on this hour, but for the moment, let's go now to CNN's Rosa Flores. And, Rosa, when you look at that video and it's a little grainy, a little difficult to make out, but my goodness, it just -- what it tells you is that these migrants were the folks who were waiting there on the side of the street there, really didn't have any chance whatsoever to get out of the way.

Now this director says that some of the migrant witnesses say that it looked like an intentional act. So I asked him, based on what he witnessed in that surveillance video, to the director, if he thought it was intentional. And he said no, that, again, what this video shows from his angle, from his surveillance camera is that this vehicle ran a red light, hit a curb close to the migrants, and then hit the migrants as this vehicle got out of control. And again, that it was very fast. Now police say that the driver was arrested and is being held on reckless driving charges. That those charges could be escalated. And that the individual is not cooperating with authorities. This individual has given authorities multiple names and so they're having to fingerprint him to get his identifying details. Now, police say that they're still investigating the motive. They have not released a motive, but they are investigating, and the FBI, Jim, is also assisting in this case -- Jim.",

Just minutes ago, CNN learned the name of one of the eight people killed. His name is Christian LaCour. His family tells CNN he was a sweet and caring young man who was greatly loved. Like all the victims, he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. A dashcam video captures the moment the killer hops out of his car. We are pausing it before you see him gun down men, women, and children on a busy sidewalk there at that outlet mall. A police officer already at the mall on an unrelated call, we're told, killed the shooter. And CNN obtained this photo that appears to show the dead shooter heavily armed and dressed in tactical gear. A senior law enforcement official source familiar with the investigation tells CNN that the gunman is 33-year-old Mauricio Garcia. And CNN's Ed Lavandera is at the scene of this senseless attack. Ed, there's a lot more that we're learning about this gunman. What can you tell us?",

And you can walk up to a mall with a displayed gun, and you're just, you know, exercising your Second Amendment rights until you use it, and then you cross the line into criminality. So these things aren't black and white where there are good guys andcriminals. The truth is most mass shootings are actually perpetrated with handguns, but the deadliest mass shootings, the ones that we're all familiar with, Sandy Hook, Sutherland Springs, El Paso, Buffalo, Uvalde, those are all perpetrated with these semiautomatic rifles. And it's because they're designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.",

If there were police stationed there all the time, there is a good chance that there would have been casualties before the gunman could be taken down.And that's where the logic of that argument kind of starts to fall short.

And in the wake of yet another mass shooting, the same questions are being raised again. How does this keep happening? How should we respond as a nation?Let's dive into this more with Dr. Jonathan Metzl, he is the director of Vanderbilt's Department of Medicine, Health and Society. He's also a professor of psychiatry. Dr. Metzl, I mean, we were talking to a gentleman in the previous hour about what he and his daughter went through. I just can't imagine the fear and the anguish that people are going through after something like this. And you have previously said that you think that the country, the U.S., has PTSD as a nation due to this rampant gun violence. What did you mean by that? DR. JONATHAN METZL, DIRECTOR, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, HEALTH AND SOCIETY: You know, I have been studying mass shootings for about 15 years now. And what I meant was that the original studies of post-traumatic stress disorder were done with Vietnam vets. And basically, it was the amount of time you were in combat, the amount of time you thought you were going to die, that correlated with the percentage chance that you were going to develop something like post-traumatic stress disorder. [19:30:02] So if you were in combat for 10 hours, you have a 10 percent chance; if you were in combat for 50 hours, you have a 50 percent chance. And, and now, we feel like we could die at any moment. And so people are living through a world in which just dropping your kids off from school or going shopping on a weekend or going into the office, this threat that something bad could happen leads to a kind of hyper vigilance, a kind of despair, a kind of being on guard. And really, that's what we know from warzones, and so really, what we're doing, I think, is turning our civilian engagements really into warzones. That's the framework.",

We knew nothing about what caused the shooting in Texas. We actually had no information whatsoever, and before we had any details about what motivated the shooter, what the effects were going to be, the right-wing talking points were all this is about mental hospitals and there were politicians who were out there saying, this is about untreated mental illness. And I can just tell you, having studied mass shootings for quite a long time now, that if you look at kind of the hundred leading factors that lead to many of these high-profile mass shootings, there is no doubt that there are some psychological issues for people. But usually, that's like, case number 50 of other kinds of factors like access to firearms, being radicalized on the internet, a history of violence, a history of misogyny, a history of substance abuse. There are so many factors that have nothing to do with mental illness. And really, it just becomes this kind of catch-all phrase that fills the gap and plays to stereotypes. And as you say, it's often not true. It's often not true, people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators of violence.

You saw Laura there, she is one of the three, and their journey bringing suit against this multibillion dollar corporation, which has really been an institution, a trusted brand in America and we examined some of what they say bolsters their case. We look at internal documents within Johnson &amp; Johnson from the 1950s when the executives were talking about the concern of liability from the talc-based baby powder because of the potential for asbestos. We look at the FDA finding in 2019 in one sample, a finding of asbestos. Johnson &amp; Johnson counters for both of those and say that there was no -- never been any asbestos in any of its baby powder and that its product is safe -- Jim.",
