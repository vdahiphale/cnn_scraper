But we hadn't had what was referred to as a \"progressive senator\" in Delaware for a while because it was a very conservative - it was - it used to be a red state. We didn't call it that then.And so - but a group of senators who were, really, so good to me - saved my sanity - starting with Mike Mansfield and Tom Eagleton; and the distinguished senator from South Carolina, Fritz Hollings; and Tom Eagleton. And they all said, \"Come and just stay six months.\" And at the time, I thought they needed - they said, \"You have to help us organize.\" We had 58 Democratic senators. That shows you how smart I was. But the point was that I started commuting every day, 260 miles a day, on the train to come home with my kids. And that's because I was really, really lucky. I had a sister, who's my best friend, and a brother, my buddy - five years younger. And they gave up where they lived and moved into where I was. They helped me raise my kids. And every morning, I dropped my kids off when they were little at my mom's house, not far from ours. And I thought to myself: I was able to continue to work and continue to be paid because I had the option of being able to - I had a family that was so supportive and a universal family just around me taking care of everything. And I swore that since I was able to - and, by the way, when you're a senator and you only have one - you have a thousand bosses, but you only have one of you, and you make a decision to - if you're going to vote or not vote, and sometimes when there was an important event, a teacher meeting - not a joke - or a foot - a baseball game or whatever, I'd look and see what the votes of the day were. And if they weren't consequential, they were going to pass overwhelmingly, I'd stay with my kids. I'd go to the teachers meeting. And I thought to myself that, you know, if, in fact, I could do that - I could do that - I was going to make sure everyone in my office is. Everybody who works for me gets a memo. And the memo says, \"If you ever need time, you never have to explain why.\"",

They contact the authorities. You go out there and you try to get it back. And while you're doing that, you want to make darn sure that you have recovered everything that's there.

GEORGE SANTOS SCAMMED HIM: He was going to pay me back for the trip to Long Island to bring the dog up to his veterinarian. He was going to pay me for gas, lunch, tolls. I was even gullible enough to give him my bank account routing number and my bank account number because he said he was going to directly put that money for the trip right into my account. That never happened. Santos really took a piece of my heart when he did this. I - my opinion of humanity was very, very extremely diminished crashed into the floor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as a crime, as a criminal matter, it could be a federal criminal matter, because if Mr. Santos convinced this gentleman to participate in establishing a GoFundMe site ostensibly for the purpose of medical attention for his dog, and then took those funds, and never follow through on whether what he was supposed to do them, but instead kept them for himself. That could end up being a fraud, a wire fraud, a mail fraud depending on how the logistics worked out.However, the amount is not an amount that would normally gather the attention of federal investigators and federal prosecutors. So therefore, in this case, I think the fact that FBI agents may - conducted this interview is a sign that they are likely looking at a broader scope of activity that Mr. Santos may have been involved in. We have all sorts of information now that indicate that he may have been involved in campaign finance fraud or other types of frauds connected to his alleged misrepresentations about himself. So I think it's much more likely that the feds are looking at this as one part of a much broader fraud investigation.",

That's the part that might apply to the computer repairman.It is also a - it could be a federal crime to steal electronic information and then profit from it, use that information. It's essentially like using stolen property, so there are a number of different potential crimes here. I think what this really is, is an effort by Mr. Biden and his attorneys to recast his role in this whole saga as a victim of a crime rather than someone who, you know, this - the material on this laptop points to some sort of alleged malfeasance on his part. And quite frankly, I'm surprised it's taken them this long to get around to it. It's a very calculated and I think effective strategy. It's one that reframes the controversy around the laptop in a way that's potentially very beneficial for him. So I think it's probably a smart move at this point and it's as effective as a public relations tool and as a tool managing his contentions with Congress as much as it is likely to inspire an independent federal investigation.",

Biden is clearly saying and has explicitly said, he understands that with Republicans in control of the House, he needs to have a conversation with them about fiscal policy and that he is perfectly willing to do that. What he is not willing to do is to tie that conversation to a threat of defaulting on the nation's debt, which could have catastrophic consequences both for the domestic and the global economy. Now, I wrote a very detailed piece last week going through the evolution of the thinking in the Obama administration, because Obama in 2011 did have the kind of negotiation with John Boehner that Kevin McCarthy is now demanding, but that was so tumultuous for financial markets and brought the country so close to the brink of default that Obama said never again. And in fact, through his second term, took the position that Biden is now that he would not negotiate over the deficit. Like he'd negotiate but not with the gun of default held against his head and I think that is the position that Biden is sticking to, and we will see whether Republicans can ultimately come up with even a plan that can get 218 votes that they would demand as the price of raising the debt ceiling.",
