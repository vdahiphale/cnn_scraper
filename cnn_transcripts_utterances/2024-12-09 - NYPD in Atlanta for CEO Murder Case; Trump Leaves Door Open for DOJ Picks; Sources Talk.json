The manhunt is now in its sixth day, and sources say that NYPD, New York City Police officers, are in Atlanta now investigating.You're looking at one of the two new images released by officials. One appears to show the suspect riding in the back seat of a taxi on the day of the shooting. Another shows him walking down the street. Authorities say the shooter's backpack was found discarded in Central Park, filled with Monopoly money, but not a weapon. Divers have been searching ponds in Central Park under the idea that maybe he threw the gun into the pond, but so far they have not recovered anything. With us now, John Miller, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst. So, New York City detectives are in Atlanta, John. Why?",

So, if it originates in Atlanta, where did he get on?

But they've also been checking airports and cameras and looking for - for hits there, trying to figure this out.And, you know, the FBI, which is because so many of these leads really at the request of the NYPD saying, if he's not here, we're looking for people from other places who recognize this face. The FBI has taken on the role of running some of these leads out of town. In fact, crossing state lines with the intent to commit a felony, even a felony that's not a federal crime, traveling interstate to do that is a federal crime.

And so you - the investigators have to concentrate, not just on Atlanta or the stops that they've got, but they have to realize that he may have flown somewhere using his normal I.D. to Atlanta and taken the bus up from there to throw it off.

      "sentences": "Now, Trump had previously said that he would support trying to protect dreamers during his first term as well, but then he also tried to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that really would have protected dreamers. That was later struck down by the court. So, we'll see what this could look like in a second term. But I think it's clear that Donald Trump, as he's having these conversations since he got elected, he's having some political considerations about what this could mean as well.Now, I also want to talk about another major issue that Donald Trump addressed during this \"Meet the Press\" interview, and that was whether he wanted to double down on his claims to seek retribution against political opponents. Trump said that he does not plan to go after directly President Joe Biden. However, he did leave the door open to allow some of his political appointees and people like Pam Bondi, his pick to lead the Department of Justice, as well as Kash Patel, who's picked to lead the FBI, really giving them kind of broad authority to go after whoever they believe maybe had committed crimes or acted in a corrupt manner. He also talked about wanting to issue January 6th pardons on day one. Again, this is something that Donald Trump had repeatedly vowed to do throughout his time on the campaign trail. But it's been unclear really, ever since he won the election, how he would do that. He didn't really get into the specifics during this interview, but I will say, from my conversations with Trump's team, there's two different thoughts about how to go about it. Some people believe that really he should have these wide pardons, sweeping pardons for anyone who was convicted for what they did on January 6th in the Capitol attack. Others, however, saying it should be on a case by case basis, specifically looking at the people who did not, you know, attack police officers or weren't committed on seditious conspiracy charges. So, some considerations there. But again, this is something that Donald Trump said that he will do very early on once he assumes office. And I'd also just add here that this is also a promise that I'm told he needs to follow through on. He didn't just make this promise broadly throughout his time on the campaign trail. He also promised this to specific people, to their families. And so, this is something I am told that he is expected to follow through. The question is, what will it look like? DEAN: Alayna, thank you. And this morning, several of President-elect Trump's picks for key national security positions are heading to The Hill to meet with top GOP senators as they prepare for confirmation fights. And they include Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, Tulsi Gabbard, who's been tapped to be the next Director of National Intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's pick to lead the FBI. Patel is widely seen as a controversial figure with a deep disdain for Washington elites, with one former colleague saying the former mid- level Justice Department lawyer is the kind of person who, quote, \"sees enemies everywhere.\" CNN's Zachary Cohen has new reporting now from Washington. Zach, you and our colleagues doing a deep dive into the background of Kash Patel. What did you learn?",

Something that Donald Trump has already spoken publicly about as well.And that could raise questions when he's on Capitol Hill from senators who, while publicly have rallied around Patel's nomination as Trump has sort of urged them to confirm all of his nominees, but privately has expressed concerns about his experience and also his public comments about going after these political enemies. So, we'll have to see what the reaction is when he meets with these senators on Capitol Hill. But there will have to be some swaying that goes on, on Patel's part.",

This was an insurrection. It was violent. And it took lives. And so, for him to say this on - yesterday simply reinforced what he's been saying throughout the campaign.
