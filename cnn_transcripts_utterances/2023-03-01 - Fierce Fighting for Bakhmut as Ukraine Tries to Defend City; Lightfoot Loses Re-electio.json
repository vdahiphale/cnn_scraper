It is the site of the fiercest fighting in the country, according to President Zelenskyy and top military commanders.Ukrainian forces appear to be on their heels as Russian forces press forward. There has been no decision whether to pull back by the Ukrainians, whether to surrender the city according to a military spokesman in this part of the country, but the Russians do appear to be trying to encircle the city. They have taken some areas north of Bakhmut. Those forces have been primarily made up of those Wagner mercenaries and convicts for the past few months leading that fight. They have been backed up by regular Russian forces. Now the Ukrainians say that these are the top Wagner fighters that are leading this push. Now we did hear from a Ukrainian soldier in Bakhmut yesterday who said, despite the dire picture that has been painted by Ukrainian officials, the actual situation is 100 percent worse. So Ukraine trying to hold on as their defensive positions get pummeled. If Russia were to take the city, it would be a significant victory. As you know, we've been talking about this fight for Bakhmut for months now. It would be a boost for Russia, a real blow for Ukraine. Both sides have lost thousands of men. It would give Russia another foot hold here in the Donbas, in Eastern Ukraine, but Ukraine will try to make that as much of a symbolic victory as they can rather than a strategic victory. If Russia were to push them out, Ukraine would dig in just to the west of the city. And at this point, in this very bloody fighting, they are trying to weaken the Russian forces as much as possible so that even if they did take the city, that there wouldn't be in any kind of condition to press forward after that.

You know, in this war of attrition right now, the side that wins, attacks the other side's capability to wage war. Right now, Ukraine doesn't have that capability. Russia does. Russia is inside Ukraine and is attacking their infrastructure. So the F-16s, while they might solve a problem in the short term, if they're there right now, they're just not going to get there on time and I just -- I just don't believe they're going to have any impact on the battlefield.",

But now, the situation has changed on the ground. I think that both of them need to go in at the same time, the alliance has got to be strong. And then eventually now I could even see go five years down the road, once there is a peace settlement that Ukraine does get more security assurances from NATO eventually and maybe eventually 10 years is in the alliance itself.",

Lynn, always good to see you. So when we -- when we look at what happened here, what stood out to me, I have to say in Lori Lightfoot concession speech last night is she specifically touted her record number of guns -- getting a record number of guns off the streets, reduced homicides and progress on public safety is what she noted. It's impossible to ignore, though, these are some of the very things that she faced a lot of backlash over, crime and public safety. You spoke with voters, what did they tell you? [09:10:01] LYNN SWEET, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"CHICAGO SUN-TIMES\": Well, public safety or crime is public issue one, two or three. That's how Paul Vallas' campaign manager explained the issue to me and their focus on making law and order a major issue. You know, Lori Lightfoot didn't catch a break in the four years she was mayor. She had the COVID pandemic, where at one point, she almost seemed like a hero, closing the lakefront, issuing this order and that, but it was that kind of dictatorial style that played well at the very beginning of the pandemic that ended up hurting her. And then she was hurt during much by the civil unrest and the backlash after George Floyd. That left the city throughout many neighborhoods on edge, big parts of the downtown area obviously where you walked down that you see retailers gone, and there is, many places just more fear now than ever of carjacking. So there's a perception about crime and numbers and that's what she was up against.",

So you have in this backdrop two unions at odds with each other running in the background of this race. And that might not be true if we want to carry what happened in Chicago too far. Brandon Johnson was bank rolled by millions of dollars from the Chicago Teachers Union and its parent, the American Federation of Teachers.

So we are ways from the Antarctic Peninsula.What they are seeing down in South America are melting glaciers on land and the risk of this glacial outburst floods in communities that live below melting glaciers. But this new report is what's making headlines as we make our way there actually with whale scientists. We got new word out of the National Snow and Ice Center in Colorado that for the second year in a row, Antarctica set a record low for summer ice extent. Now this is the bottom of the world here, so their peak summer is in late February and that is when the ice around this continent at the bottom of the world shrinks to its lowest level. Now for perspective, in 2014, that ice was about 7 million square miles but now it's less than 700,000 square miles, over 90 percent disappearance there, which opens up the ice shelves around Antarctica to more sea wave action and weathering which attacks those shelves that keep all that land ice in place. If that melts and slides into the oceans, it will forcibly rearrange every coastal city from Miami to Shanghai to Boston and New Orleans. And that's just for starters, not to mention the ecosystem collapses at the bottom of the food chain and all of that. So scientists once again sending a warning that we have to pay attention to this most remote corner of our planet. We didn't discover Antarctica until 40 years after humans discovered the planet Uranus and we are just learning about what's going on down there and all the warning signs as they put sort of robotic cameras under these glaciers and seeing how they're melting from the bottom and from inside out. It really is another red -- blinking red light at the bottom of the planet. Meanwhile, the top of the world, the Arctic melting twice as fast as the rest of the planet, all adding up to some pain.",

And then you've got Southern California, which is expected to get hit again today with a whole lot of snow. This latest winter hit with these back-to-back storms, parts of the Golden State, as you know at this point, already buried under more than 6 feet of snow. That storm system is now moving across the southwest and it's increasing the threat of severe weather east of the Mississippi. SCIUTTO",
