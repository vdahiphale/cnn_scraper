He said he's almost never worked on a trial or seen a trial that didn't have some sort of delay or hiccup often at the start.So that's what's happening in court.

So let's back up to this purported Pentagon leak reported in \"The Washington Post.\" We haven't seen the actual document itself. We've reached out to the Pentagon for comment on this.Well, what \"The Washington Post\" is reporting is that the document argues that, for example, Taiwan's Air Force that only about half of its planes are fully mission capable, that there are all sorts of kind of logistical issues like the air defense lacking, compatible secure radios, arguing, assessing that in the event of a full scale conflict with China, Taiwan's air defenses would be overwhelmed and China could somewhat quickly establish air superiority over the self-governing island. It goes on to say that the U.S. intelligence community is having a harder time assessing China's military activities around Taiwan because it has picked up the tempo of its exercises and flights and the ships moving around. But also because it's using civilian ships that make it harder to assess whether or not China's preparing for an invasion or an assault. The whole region has been tense. You mentioned these exercises China was conducting. And just yesterday, you had a U.S. guided missile destroyer sail through the Taiwan Strait as part of what the Navy describes as a freedom of navigation operation. Beijing doesn't like it.

I want to get your reaction to this reporting from \"The Washington Post\" because as Ivan and John were just talking about, it paints a pretty grim picture of Taiwan's military readiness against a Chinese attack. Is that your assessment as well?REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Let me first say I think the leak done by this U.S. Air National Guardsman has caused grave damage to our national security, not only what you just heard this report, you know, damaging our foreign policy, damaging the security of Taiwan, also damaging our sources, methods and assets on the ground. This is not a game to be played in some chat room. He put American lives at risk by doing so in a very inflammatory to make the comments he has about Taiwan, I just got back. The island was surrounded by 10 battleships, and aircraft carrier of Chinese and 70 Chinese fighter jets. This was a live fire exercise drill done to determine both China's capabilities but more importantly, Taiwan's vulnerabilities. And we've seen this in the past when Speaker Pelosi visited as well. We do have concerns about the ability of Taiwan to deter an invasion. I'm not going to confirm this document. I have participated in red team exercises. We come home to see how prepared Taiwan would be and what our response would be to an invasion. But first and foremost, as I've talked about, 22 weapons systems that I've signed off on in the past three years ago, have yet to go into Taiwan. And it's absolutely paramount that we get those weapons in as soon as possible to provide that deterrence, along with combat training, and along with intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance by bringing something like a Starlink system into Taiwan.",
