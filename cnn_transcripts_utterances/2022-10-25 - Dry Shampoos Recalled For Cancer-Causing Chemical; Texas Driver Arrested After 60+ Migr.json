Jacqueline, the chemical of concern behind this recall is the carcinogen, Benzene. What exactly is it?",

It evaporates into the air quickly.The way you can be exposed, it can be inhaled, consumed, or you can have exposure to the skin. And this carcinogen has been linked to leukemia, for instance. Signs or symptoms of Benzene exposure include headaches, tremors, confusion, dizziness, irregular heartbeat. So you can imagine it can be inhaled. So if it is sprayed through a dry shampoo, for instance, as part of this voluntary recall, that's one way of possible exposure -- Ana?",

Well, I'll first tell you naturally Benzene can be founding in cigarette smoke or crude oil or gasoline, for instance.But how there might be accidental exposure is sometimes Benzene is used as part of making chemicals for other items like plastics or synthetic fibers. So part of that manufacturing process can lead to possible accidental exposures here, Ana. But the concern is really focused on this voluntary recall. You mentioned the products earlier.

Here Kanye is out there saying Adidas is never going to drop me, and they certainly did.As for why it took so long, we don't know but there's a lot of layers there. I think they just said they're going to lose over $200 million in revenue alone just by cutting ties and that's just in the interim. And it was a very lucrative deal that they had with Kanye. His line of shoes was incredibly successful. But you've seen a lot of companies distance themselves from him, from Gap. Creative Art Agency, his Hollywood heavyweight agents, have now dropped him as of yesterday. So you're seeing all this work that he put in for decades, it's all crumbling around him. You haven't heard him come out and apologize. You haven't heard him come out and say anything. Instead, he's choosing to turn to the conservative social media platform, Parler, saying he's going to buy that platform. But again, when it comes to Adidas, this is a big moment. And I think that instead of focusing on what took so long for that to happen, they did the right thing cutting ties with him.",

      "sentences": "Well, Ana, these reports show that the economy is stumbling a bit.Let's start with consumer confidence, which is basically how people feel about the economy. The conference board said that after two straight months of gains, consumer confidence took a hit in October. Inflation concerns went up, vacation plans went down. You know, this matters. Because the better people feel, the more likely they are to spend. And consumer spending is still the biggest driver of this economy. Consumers are also feeling a little bit worse about the future. Let me read you a key line from this report. \"Consumer expectations regarding the short-term outlook remained dismal. The expectations index remains below levels associated with recession, suggesting recession risks appear to be rising.\" Now, the housing market is clearly getting hit right now by this one- two punch of very high prices and soaring mortgage rates. We learned today that home prices in August went up by 13 percent year over year. That is a big gain. But that is also a big slowdown. We were seeing 20 percent-plus gains earlier this year. The deceleration between July and August is the largest slowdown since S&amp;P/Case-Shiller started tracking this in 1987. Ana, bottom line, home prices got unsustainably high. They are now succumbing to gravity. And this correction is not done just yet.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. ASHISH JHA, WHITE HOUSE COVID-19 RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We're seeing the rise of three viruses, circulation of three viruses at increasing levels, RSV, Influenza, and COVID. The good news here is that we're not powerless against this. For two of them we have very high-quality vaccines, both influenza and COVID. So the first and most important thing people can do is go out and get vaccinated because that will keep people, kids, adults, everybody out of the hospital at very high rates. So that is probably the most important thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's certainly something they are tracking. It's something they are concerned about. And it's something they are now going to try and change with a series of new efforts, beginning today, by having the president get this new bivalent COVID booster vaccine, which targets the Omicron variant, very publicly on camera. And also delivering remarks about what the administration is going to be doing to try and increase those numbers. I think we can put the numbers on the screen right now in terms of the percentage of people who've gotten that updated booster, and it is still very low. While 68 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, less than 10 percent of the eligible population has actually gotten that updated booster shot. And that's about 20 million Americans. The administration does point out that it's about one in five seniors who have gotten that updated booster shot. That's certainly the population that they're most concerned about. But they will be launching a series of public relations efforts, including targeted television ads for the black, Hispanic communities as well as rural communities as well -- Ana?",
