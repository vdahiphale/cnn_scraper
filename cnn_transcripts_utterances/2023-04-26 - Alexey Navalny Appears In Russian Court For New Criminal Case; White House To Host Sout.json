Today, the Oklahoma parole board meets to discuss the fate of death row inmate Richard Glossip who is set to be executed in May on a capital murder charge.

Hutchinson, a Republican, made an appearance on \"CNN THIS MORNING\" on Tuesday saying that no one wants a Biden-Trump replay of 2020. This morning, President Biden will host South Korean President Yoon at the White House. Yoon began his six-day trip on Tuesday, making a trip to the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and a visit to the Korean War Memorial with Biden. They will have formal talks in the Oval Office before holding a joint press conference around 12:30 today. Joining us from Hong Kong is CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. Good morning, Kristie.

You know, the White House had declined to comment whether the recent leaks would be a topic of discussion between the presidents of the U.S. and South Korea when they meet later today. One of the leaks describes in tremendous detail a conversation between two South Korean security officials over concerns over a U.S. request for ammunition for Ukraine. Now, the White House, instead, ahead of today's visit and summit just reaffirmed the ironclad alliance with South Korea. Now, today marks the first state visit to the U.S. by a South Korean leader since 2011. There will be the welcoming ceremony at the White House followed by a summit, and then a state banquet. Now, earlier on Tuesday, the South Korean president addressed a business forum. He talked about the alliance and he said that it should leap into a new phase. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I believe that the U.S. alliance must leap into a new phase of alliance to overcome such complex crises together. What started as a military and security alliance should evolve into a supply chain and future- oriented innovative technology alliance, one in which our two countries grow and act together.

In fact, what was once a fringe issue in South Korea is now a mainstream issue.
