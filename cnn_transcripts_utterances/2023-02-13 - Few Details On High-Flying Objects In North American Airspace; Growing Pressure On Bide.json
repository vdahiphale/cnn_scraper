Then, the White House said the objects they shot from the skies did pose a threat to air traffic. We'll get the latest from Washington D.C. Plus, the head of NATO says we are already, quote, \"seeing the start of a new Russian offensive in Ukraine.\" We'll have the latest on the battle raging in the east of the country. But first, for you this hour, the U.N. says the rescue phase in Syria and Turkey is coming to a close. As teams begin to wind down the search for survivors.

His parents didn't survive the earthquake. The three-month old was rescued by neighbors who brought him to this ICU. In the room next door, we find Halia(ph), the 26-year-old will never walk again. The earthquake brought down her family's home, and crushed her back. Her stepmom tells us Halia(ph) and her three children were under the rubble for 18 hours. The children survived, but they don't know where they are. In every room of the Syrian hospital, a bitter-sweet tale of survival. Many more should have been alive today to tell their stories. Doctors say they tried to save them, but didn't have enough supplies to save everyone.

We've seen four of these objects, a little more than a week as you can see there on your screen. An unidentified object was shot down over Lake Huron on Sunday afternoon over northern Canada on Saturday and over Alaska, if you remember, on Friday. The weekend before that, a Chinese spy balloon was taken down off the coast of South Carolina. But so far, there is no indication the more recent unidentified objects have any connection to that balloon. Well, just minutes ago, a White House official was asked, why the sudden upticks in U.S. shoot-downs. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In the last 30 minutes or so from John Kirby there, who gave us I think, it's fair to say more insight into what they believe this may have been, and the intelligence. Do we know though where these objects came from, and why the U.S. felt they needed to shoot them down at this point? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. SECURITY REPORTER:  Yes, Isa, so still no determination of where these objects came from, but we did get a bit of an explanation from John Kirby there about why the U.S. felt the need to take them down. And it was primarily because of the risk that these objects posed to civilian aircrafts. All three of them were flying at a potentially dangerous altitude, including the one that was shot down yesterday, which was about 20,000 feet in the air, which, of course, is pretty close to where an aircraft fly at, which is about 30,000 feet. Same goes for those objects that were shot down on Friday and Saturday. Both of those were flying at about 40,000 feet. So, the rational that has been given pretty consistently by the administration is that it was decided that these objects, not only potentially could be surveilling the United States, it is unclear whether they had those capabilities. But primarily, because they might have been in the way of civilian aircrafts. And so, the question now, however, is given that the U.S. is now looking more closely at its airspace, and is able to detect these objects with more frequency, does that mean that every time the U.S. detects one of these objects, we are going to see a similar type of shoot-down. And that is a question that the administration has not really given a fulsome response to. They say that they will be judging each of these incidents on a case by case basis, and determining from there, whether or not it will be appropriate to shoot it down. But a lot of questions this afternoon about whether this is the new normal, especially after of course, the administration faced such strong political backlash over that Chinese spy balloon incident where the balloon was allowed to pretty much transit the entire United States before of course, it was ultimately shot down off the coast of South Carolina.

Because without going into military secrets, it is one of the main means of communications that the Ukrainians are using to fight the Russians. Now, if they were to lose that means of communication, it would be perceived not perhaps unreasonably by the Ukrainians as an effort that would be in support of, albeit unintentionally of the Russian campaign. Now, Elon Musk is saying he doesn't want to be responsible for contributing to the beginning of World War III. Arguably, a war in Europe and most certainly is already underway. And if more Ukrainians are going to be killed, it could be -- it would be a consequence of -- from the Ukrainian perspective of cutting off their ability to communicate using the Starlink.

So, that puts it near the top and near the bottom, which means it traveled right through the space, that commercial aircraft use. The other altitudes that they saw were lower than the 60,000 to 65,000 feet, which is above commercial aircraft zones that the original Chinese surveillance balloon was flying in. So, what you're really seeing, Isa, is a re-tweaking of the radar so that they are looking at objects that were written off before as debris, or anomalies. And they're going after them to see what are they, what do they look like, and if they look suspicious, and they're still flying, unless they can discern what they are or what their purpose is, they're taking them down to get a baseline sense of, what are these things?

My former employer, the Director of National Intelligence, issued this report on these what they call all- domain anomaly resolutions where they try to figure out what these things are. But 18 incidents out of the 500 and some that they counted were really interesting because they found vehicles flying through the sky that could stand still, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, and operated speed.

      "sentences": "Well, cyclone Gabrielle had seen power outages to more than 50,000 properties across the northern part ofNew Zealand's North Island today, as strong winds bring down trees and heavy rainfall sees floodwaters start to inundate properties. Now there are strong wind and rain warnings across much of the North Island of New Zealand at the moment, including our strongest possible heavy rainfall warning and our strongest possible wind warning. For Auckland, Northland, and the Coromandel, those three regions expected to be the brunt of Cyclone Gabrielle. Now here in Auckland, we've already seen evacuations at an apartment tonight as residents are urged to leave their homes for safety. Auckland, a major city, more like a ghost town today with people urged to work from home where possible train lines and trains canceled for the day, and all domestic flights in and out of Auckland cancelled. Of course, the city just a week and a half ago saw a major flash flooding incident. There's concern now that Cyclone Gabrielle will exacerbate some of the slips and flood damage from that event, but everyone on high alert across much of New Zealand's North Ireland as the cyclone intensifies, moving down the country towards Auckland, and inches ever so close to the coast.

      "sentences": "Well, as far as we know, the legislative action is still starting. As you noted today, the committee passed the billthrough its committee hearing. And we are expecting a first reading out of three that are required, potentially as soon as Wednesday, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his supporters, they say that these are long-needed reforms, that they need to rebalance the power of the Supreme Court that they believe has grown too powerful, too elitist. And this would allow the parliament with just a simple majority, which would mean essentially the party in power to overturn Supreme Court decisions. It's the most drastic overhaul of Israel's judiciary in Israeli history. But protesters out on the street today, we were there with them, told us that they believe that this is a moment of crisis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (voice-over): By the tens of thousands, protesters streamed into Jerusalem, with drums, flags, signs, chanting and singing songs. One of the largest demonstrations for Jerusalem in years, as these protesters skipped work in school to stand against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's sweeping judicial reform plans, fundamentally altering the balance of power by allowing parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with a simple majority. Now for weeks, tens of thousands of Israelis have been coming out to the streets of Tel Aviv to protest. But on Monday, on the day these judicial reforms were first formally introduced in the Israeli parliament, they decided to come here to Jerusalem so that the shouts of the tens of thousands could be heard in the halls of the parliament.

Changing the spirit and the life of thecountry from a democracy to a totalitarian regime, we don't want to go there. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOLD (voice-over): Inside the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, the reform passing its first legislative test in a committee hearing to ferocious protests from opposition lawmakers who jumped over tables yelling shame and disgrace before being forcibly removed by security. Netanyahu accusing opposition leaders of deliberately dragging the country into anarchy, urging them to show responsibility and leadership. The night before, Israeli President Isaac Herzog plea in a televised address for consensus and a warning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ISAAC HERZOG, ISRAELI PRESIDENT (through translator): We are at a moment before a confrontation, even a violent confrontation. The Powder Keg is about to explode. And brothers are about to raise their hands against brothers. (END VIDEO CLIP) GOLD (voice-over): Even U.S. President Joe Biden weighing in, saying it's the genius of American and Israeli democracies that were built on strong institutions on checks and balances and on an independent judiciary. Perhaps the message received Monday evening after the protesters cleared the streets, an announcement from the Minister of Justice, Yariv Levin, that while they weren't going to stop the legislative process, they will meet with opposition leaders to at least start negotiations. (END VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (on camera): And Isa, I think the big question now is these negotiations that the government Minister of Justice has called for. He wants to sit with opposition leaders along with the Israeli president and start these talks. But they haven't said anything about freezing the legislative process. So this legislative process will still sort of move on within the Israeli parliament. And the big question is, will they actually come with anything out of this? Will they actually come to any sort of consensus that will help calm the fears and calm the concerns from both people who are in favor of these reforms? And those who believe that, as we've been saying, they believe it could be the beginning of the end of Israeli democracy. Isa.",
