A bill that Texas Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign would give law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and would allow judges to issue orders to remove them from the U.S. CNN's Rosa Flores has that story.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROSA FLORES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: This bill is sending ripples of fear throughout the Latino community in the state of Texas. Latinos make up 40 percent of the population in this state. But let me take you through this bill. What it does is it creates a state crime for illegal entry into the state of Texas. And it gives law enforcement the power to arrest. And it gives judges the power to issue orders to remove individuals from the state of Texas. Now, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has maintained that all he's doing is dealing with the crisis at the border because the federal government is not doing its job. Now, this bill has many critics, including thirty former immigration judges. Now these judges issued a statement saying that this bill is unconstitutional because the power to issue immigration policy and law rests with the federal government. And these judges, these former judges, point to a portion of the bill that says that state judges will have the power to issue removal orders. That's a really fancy way of saying deportation. These judges have and will have the power to deport individuals from the state of Texas. One other big concern is that this could lead to racial profiling of Latinos in this state. Now, one of the things that this bill specifically states is that this applies to law enforcement in the state, including local law enforcement. And that's one of the big concerns.
