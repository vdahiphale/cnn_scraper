Any comment on the new charges against your son? Those new charges laid out in a 56-page indictment unsealed Thursday. Prosecutors allege Hunter Biden engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. They allege the younger Biden had money, but spent it on drugs, escorts and girlfriends, luxury hotels and rental properties, exotic cars, clothing and other items of a personal nature. In short, everything but his taxes. The case was supposed to be resolved with a plea deal that fell apart over the summer. HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON: I'm cooperating completely.

I want to go now to CNN Military Analyst, Retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton. Colonel, thank you for your time. Let me read you those comments from the Israeli ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan. Obviously, he had some pointy remarks aimed at the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres for invoking that rarely used Article 99 of the U.N. Charter to convene this vote and he said this: \"Israel's defensive war against Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, was a catalyst for activating Article 99. The irony is that regional stability and the security of both Israelis and Gazans can only be achieved once Hamas is eliminated, not one minute before. So, the true path to ensure peace is only through supporting Israel's mission, absolutely not to call for a ceasefire.\" Do you agree the only option for peace is to eliminate Hamas?",

So, Hamas says, you know, Israel is certainly in its rights to defend itself and to, in essence, counterattack Hamas's efforts. On the other hand, Israel's efforts to destroy Hamas aren't going to meet, I think, with their expectations. It's going to take a long time to root out the political and military leadership of Hamas, which is a single goal of the Netanyahu government. But it is also almost impossible to eradicate the idea.

As far as our isolation is concerned in this particular situation, it's going to be a bit of a problem.

And then now, all the sudden, people see them answering a question that most people think should be simple. And now, they are looking at their free speech policies. Now, to be clear, the free speech policies are good calls general sort of abstract calls for violence or genocide or talking about war. Those are protected by the First Amendment and by Penn's policies. Penn and MIT and Harvard and lots of other schools also have policies that protect students from things like discriminatory harassment, true threats, incitement, those are on the books, but this is one of those situations where nuanced context, it really does matter. That's what the law tells us. The Supreme Court decades of First Amendment jurisprudence say when you're looking at incitement through threats, when people are worried about discriminatory harassment, you have to look at the facts, you have to look at the context, because as a -- you know, a free society, as a democracy, we want debate about these incredibly important issues to be as robust as possible.",

I mean, that's some of what we're seeing in terms of students say, I don't feel safe on campus. I can't talk to people on campus. Universities have modeled that we shouldn't be talking to each other that we should be trying to censor each other. That it's dangerous to hear thoughts you disagree with.
