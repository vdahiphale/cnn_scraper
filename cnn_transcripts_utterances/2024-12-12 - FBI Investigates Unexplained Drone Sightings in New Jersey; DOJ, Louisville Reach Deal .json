And most importantly, in my perspective, aside from the safety and security of our residents, Naval Weapons Station Earl, which is a munitions depot run by the U.S. Navy. So for that amount of time, we've been seeing drones.In fact, just yesterday, I saw another one right over top of Route 35 near one of our electrical panels, electrical substations here in town. So it's concerning for a lot of residents.",

So when we all drove out to Ewing Township yesterday in Mercer County, we all sat there and were absolutely confused as to why we were not being briefed by the FBI, but instead by the state police and the Department of Homeland Security. And they said that that was an oversight.So I think it's a little unacceptable to sit there and not have the investigating agency give you that briefing. And I think it's about time that the federal government realized that it needs to get up and start reacting to what has been now a nearly a month of time that these drones have been hovering over New Jersey.",

They were unable to tell us because they have not been able to chase or pursue any of these drones from the time they launched to the time they land somewhere, which is certainly concerning and that the battery life of these drones is lasting anywhere between six and eight hours. But the Coast Guard is apparently along our 130 mile coastline here in the state of New Jersey, looking for any type of vessel that's able to serve as that platform for these, you know, SUV sized drones to take off and land, which is obviously incredibly concerning because that, you know, obviously shows that this may be more of a foreign actor than anything else.",

This follows a federal investigation spurred by the botched raid that left Breonna Taylor dead in her own home. A police report last year found that Louisville police have engaged in a pattern of violating constitutional rights and discriminating against the Black community.CNN's Nick Valencia is following this story for us.

Now, the mayor of Louisville says that these reforms that the DOJ is asking for will just be added to those that are already in place since her death, Breonna Taylor's death, that is, in March of 2020. One of those changes, you may remember, includes a city law banning no-knock warrants. Now, some of the other changes that the DOJ is asking for in their report here that we just got our hands on are appropriate de-escalation techniques, an attempt to resolve incidents without force, and also very importantly here, non-law enforcement deflection teams to situations involving people in a behavioral health crisis, so people going through a mental health crisis. It's important here that this agreement is just in principle and still needs to be approved by a judge. But once that does happen, it's just only, it seems, a matter of time, then a federal officer will be sent to Louisville to make sure and monitor that these changes are put into place. But very significant here in the aftermath, in the wake of the death of Breonna Taylor -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "The United Kingdom is banning puberty-suppressing hormones for people under 18 indefinitely now. The order cites expert advice that there is an unacceptable safety risk to minors. A freeze on puberty blockers for the treatment of gender dysphoria has been in place since earlier this year in the U.K. And a case involving a similar matter was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court last week. And a conservative majority on the court appeared sympathetic to backing a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, specifically its ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez is with us now. She's a pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.Doctor, thank you so much for talking with us about this. First, just walk us through what these drugs do. DR. EDITH BRACHO-SANCHEZ, PEDIATRICIAN, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY IRVING MEDICAL CENTER: Absolutely, Brianna. Thank you for having me. So these medications are known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, which is a mouthful. What they do is that they block the release of estrogen and testosterone. And those are the hormones that are known to trigger puberty and many of the physical changes that we have come to associate with puberty. So they are puberty-delaying medications that have been used in this country for many, many years. They've now, of course, come under political scrutiny. But that is essentially what they do, Brianna.",

      "sentences": "So I do want to point out, and it's hard, I think, for people who are looking for answers here, because the Pediatric Endocrine Society says puberty blockers can carry some risks. More long-term studies are needed. The American Academy of Pediatrics says long-term studies on fertility and bone health are limited and provide varied results.So what are the risks, at least what is known about them? BRACHO-SANCHEZ: Brianna, I think you are absolutely right that people may be left feeling confused, right? There's some guidance that's coming out of England. There are different organizations that are weighing in. Let's focus for a second on the medications themselves and the risks of them, right? So the medications have been used for over 30 years in this country. They're used to delay puberty. So I have kiddos who I see who are school-age, 5, 6, 7 years old, who are entering puberty too early, too soon. And we need to delay it, right? Imagine a 5-year-old, a 6-year-old entering puberty. Those medications have been safely used in those kids for over 30 years. We're talking side effects that may include bone density being affected, growth spurts being affected. We're still learning about the long-term effects on fertility. But the medications themselves are generally safe and, again, have been used for many years in this country -- Brianna.",

A planned National Health Service clinical trial on puberty blockers is allowed to proceed despite this indefinite ban, and the ban's going to be reviewed in 2027, taking any new evidence into account then. How important is that?BRACHO-SANCHEZ: So important, and I'm so glad you're bringing it up because the headline that we're hearing is the U.K. has banned puberty blockers, right? And what's getting lost in translation and in the headline is that they're continuing to allow it under clinical studies, right? So they are saying for some kids this needs to be studied. Some kids need to continue to have access to this. So I do think there is an understanding there that for some kids this is beneficial, that there is a need to continue to study this. And they're saying for those kiddos, go ahead and enroll them in these protocols and these studies, which in my opinion, and here's an opinion, right, does pose a number of ethical issues, right? Like now you have to enroll and the process of consent gets a little bit jeopardized if you want to continue to receive this care. But even in the U.K., which is getting lost in the headline, it is continuing to be available for the purposes of clinical studies -- Brianna.",
