Trump had been and was indicted last March. Obviously, we were all covering it live when that happened as all of this was going on. But Todd Blanche, one thing that is clear as he's beginning this cross- examination is he's getting into the substance of Michael Cohen's interactions with the district attorney's office.

Because on Tuesday, he tried to throw Cohen off his game by asking him questions that were sort of all over the timeline, not really about allegations of falsifying business records, and it's not clear that really got them anywhere.

We know that he's going to try to paint Cohen as a liar, that he's going to go back to some of the comments that he's made, that he's going to once again delve into his book, but this now goes to the heart of the investigation, and he's trying to undermine the investigation using Cohen and using Cohen's dislike of Donald Trump.",

There's a plethora of information for the defense here to use because Cohen has spoken so often and so repeatedly in public about Donald Trump. And Blanche is pulling up a clip of Cohen's podcast, Mea Culpa, in which Cohen gives his reaction to the indictment.
