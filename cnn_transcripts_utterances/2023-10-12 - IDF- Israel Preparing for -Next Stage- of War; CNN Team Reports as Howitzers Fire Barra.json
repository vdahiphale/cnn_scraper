So they do seem to have a feel and a sense for the situation. But they are not in one place, and that, obviously, complicates what you are dealing with right now.As you referred to it, the airstrikes throughout the morning on Gaza. You hear those thuds in the distance from where we are now, and a lot of fire back and forth from south of here just along that Gaza border. We are also understanding as Israeli Defense Forces, Phil and Poppy, are clearly building up and posturing for a possible ground assault, a full ground assault on Gaza, we don't just know that there's about 300,000 being massed along that border. We also know that Israeli Defense Forces are sort of pushing that border out to create essentially a buffer zone for military operations. So a lot of those areas that had been attacked, kibbutzim by the Hamas militants over the weekend, pushing out that barrier bit by bit to keep it for Israeli military use as they, obviously, are clearly in a position, in position and preparing for an assault. And we are hearing that, you hear that from Nic Robertson miles from where we are, that back and forth, heavy artillery strikes on Gaza, we can hear those thuds now, all of that going throughout the day here as it's right now midafternoon here in Israel.",

WARDabout the fact that there were other children believed to have been killed in that kibbutz. They haven't yet been identified yet, which makes it, obviously, much more difficult to know the exact details, the exact numbers. And I would just say more broadly that there has been a real lack of clarity, and that may be due to continued confusion around the issue of how many people were killed versus how many people were captured versus how many people may still be alive. So he really in this moment, I think, is focused on being strong for his two older children who are flying from overseas to be with him now. But let's be clear.

He said, it's very simple, don't. And we hope that they're getting this message loud and clear because Israel is ready, the IDF is ready.

We are a nation in deep mourning right now, but our resolve is very clear. This is time for moral clarity.

It's a war between the civilized world represented by Israel here and Hamas's savages. BURNETT: Tal, a follow up to that, though, of course, Secretary Blinken also said, while he completely made those -- compared to ISIS and said the United States has Israel's back. He also said how Israel does this matters, that striving for a different standard and a value in human life is what distinguishes a democracy from the forces of terror that were just unleashed upon Israel.

This is a very big concentration of Israeli firepower here. We covered the situation in Gaza in 2021, where there was an exchange of artillery fire rockets by Hamas.

You've got drones that could observe them. Of course, you could do counter-drone activity against us, and you could have your own drones, which the Israelis certainly do. Then, most importantly, you have tunnels. And I know Aaron mentioned some of this earlier, but there are going to be a lot of tunnels in Gaza. It's not just in the border area, but throughout the city of Gaza and in other areas. Tunnels are very, very important for their defenses and possibly as locations where the hostages are. Anti-armor attacks are possible they're going to use snipers. Look at, for example, buildings like this one that would be a perfect window for a sniper to shoot from. And that's the kind of thing that you're looking at. And of course, using the hostages as human shields, those are the critical elements that the Israeli Forces are going to have to really consider as they go in and move forward with every facet of this operation.",

      "sentences": "Well, Israel has a lot of experience with urban warfare, and what that means is 90-degree angles. Every angle is a point of cover, every angle is a place to stay concealed. So, every room has a dead corner when you walk into a room.And what Israel is really, really good at did a lot of this in my unit, which operates plain clothed and in a SWAT capacity if you will. When you're going after terrorists is are able to move around those angles with the least amount of exposure possible. And with the most amount of cover so that you have good shots and I don't mean to be graphic, but have straight shots with 90% of your body covered. And Israel invented a room entry system called \"Limited Penetration.\" And it allows the Israeli operatives from the four major special operations units which are the General Staff Reconnaissance Unit Bibi's Unit, the Entebbe Unit, and the Shaldag which is the Air Force Special Operations Unit. Shaldag in English means \"Kingfisher.\" So, imagine those missiles that are coming down strategically and selectively, there are guys on the ground putting those missiles into those Hamas infrastructure buildings so as to reduce collateral damage to civilian buildings. Remember, Hamas is going to bring civilians to those rooftops and essentially, they're trapping them in Gaza. That's a separate company we'll get to that. The other unit is the Israeli Shayetet Shaloshisl, which is the S13 or the Israeli Seals. That unit is conducting reconnaissance operations right now along that coastline to be able to map the car's topography so that we can feed that back to the Givati Brigade, which is staged with those 300,000 reservists on that border with Gaza. And then you've got other elements combined. But that limited penetration room-clearing technique, which all of these special ops' units are trained in, allows an Israeli Special Forces operative to clear 90% of the room without ever having to step foot in it. And why is that important for terrorists? Because they will booby-trapped. They want Israel to get sucked into this monster vacuum. And so, these techniques have been designed specifically to do what's, what we call in Hebrew a \"Zira\" or a safety clear, but they have to do it quickly. It's a lot of training, but it allows these guys to be able to fight safer. And so that's a big piece of how they're going to go into Gaza and be able to clear these pockets. Do it safer, but do it with a high degree of aggression. Aggression is a tactic, it has to be, especially when you're getting pulled into this pressure cooker. So that limited is a big one, and all these units are getting ready to deploy that.",
