That's the longest stretch since the 1960s.All while labor force participation rate remains at all-time highs.

The health benefits, the retirement that they want, and need and deserve. That's also increased Union's bargaining power.And we're seeing that, as you mentioned, right at the ports, where the parties came together over 13 months and negotiated a tentative agreement. We saw that with UPS and Teamsters, right? That, you know, many people were worried about how that would land, and those parties reach a tentative agreement as well. That also means that some workers are going to strike if they're not getting what they need at the bargaining table. It's all a part of the process that the President believes in.

She moves pretty fast. She's familiar with Trump as a litigant before. She has had a Donald Trump case before her before on the civil side related to the House inquiry and documents he wanted to hold back. And she is already sending a message through this court hearing yesterday that she's going to be ready to set a trial date whenever that hearing happens on August 28. And so right now we're looking to see exactly how the arguments might shape up in the coming days. There are some filings do before then. How fast the initial parts of this case move. But here's what Donald Trump's lawyer, John Lauro was saying yesterday on Fox, it's some sentiments he also had to say in court itself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LAURO, ATTORNEY FOR DONALD TRUMP: They're attacking other parts of the constitution, because they want to take President Trump to trial in a few months. They want to deny him his sixth amendment rights to counsel, to give me and my co-counsel Todd Blanche and opportunity to prepare. They want to deny President Trump his due process rights, to look at documents, to get witnesses, to use our subpoena power. They want to deny all of him those rights in a rush to judgment for one political purpose, and that's to uphold the Biden Administration. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I guess kind of the some of the strategy that they're laying out in this political prosecution, as they call it, saying that the Special Counsel's team is trying to deny Trump, all of these rights as they push -- as they push this trial forward.

He does have an important point though when we talk about any defendant, Sixth Amendment right to due process, and to prepare for trial.And I know there's a great appetite, certainly with prosecutors, with much of the public to make sure Donald Trump gets tried before the election, and there may well be a genuine opportunity to get one, maybe two of these what will soon be four trials in but we also have to be really careful. We collectively, including the judiciary, not to just rush this thing to trial on a frantic schedule, because of the approaching election. And by the way, the reason we're in this conundrum, in part is because DOJ took so long. Merrick Garland, there's no way around this. He wasted a year and a half before he appointed Jack Smith, Jack Smith got his job done very quickly. But because of that lost year and a half, that's why we're having to deal with this in an election year. So there is some legitimacy to that part of the argument.",

They're going to point first of all, to the fake electoral scheme.

ROBERTSON: Yes, we're learning that this sea drone has targeted at a longer range than any previous Ukrainian sea drone that we're aware of. A massive Russian target, this huge warship. We understand that there were about 1000 pounds of explosives in this -- in this marine drone. You can see the video of it here, moving in on that massive warship. Now the Russians are saying that they repelled it. They clearly weren't prepared for it because the ship has been hit at port such a long way from Ukraine. But the video this week was seen this morning appears to show the same ship being towed into port but listing heavily, taking on a lot of water. So it does appear that the massive explosion that happened there has ripped a huge hole but below the waterline there in that very important navy ship for Russia and remembering that it was a year ago or so that the Ukrainians were able to take out the Moskva, one of the prize warships in Russia's fleet. The Ukrainians as well in perpetrating this attack apparently used a number of drones, aerial drones rather than the sea drones to draw the Russians' attention away from what was happening here. So a real sneak attack, but reality is the Russians are going to get dialed in to what the Ukrainians are capable of and create defenses for it.
