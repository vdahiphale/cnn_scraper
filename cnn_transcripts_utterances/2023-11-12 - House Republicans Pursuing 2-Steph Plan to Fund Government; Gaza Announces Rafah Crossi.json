We're already hearing opposition from Speaker Johnson's right flank, in his first big decision as speaker to move forward on this plan, because it does not include spending cuts, that have been demanded from whole wide range of members on his right flank, really the same issue that led to the ouster of Kevin McCarthy, who advanced a bill without spending cuts to keep the government open, temporarily.That's exactly what Speaker Johnson is doing, at this moment. He made that choice, to avoid a fight with Democrats. But he's also moving forward in these unconventional approach, funding some other government agencies through mid-January, other government agencies through only February, Democrats and the White House did not like that two-step approach. They call it a recipe for more chaos, but will they actually block this, and prevented from becoming law? That is going to be a huge question this week. So, ultimately, will they get the vote on the House floor, where they have to rely on a significant number of Democrats to come along, or Democrats to extract anything. But one thing is very clear, time is of the afferent essence. This government will shut down at the end of the day, on Friday, if no deal is reached, if Democrats don't go long, if Republicans don't -- if Republicans can't agree with Democrats on a final way forward here, that's what will happen. But Johnson, making a big decision on his first test as speaker, take on his right flank by not pushing forward spending cuts, but also irritating Democrats by his approach here, still the question is going to be, can the votes come together within the next few days.

Where Israeli officials are saying, they claim they are not engaged in seizing, and in siege of the hospital, but intense fighting around it.There are other officials who say differently. But clearly, a great deal of fighting going on around there, in a very dangerous and deadly situation for Gazan civilians, that are inside that hospital. As you mentioned, this is one of those places where many civilians have sought refuge in these hospitals. But this particular hospital has been of a focus of the Israeli military for years. They have said the Hamas military fighters of use this particular hospital as one of the center pieces underground where they launch much of their military operation, and that's why you're seeing such intense fighting around that area. And also this afternoon, clear signs that the fighting continues to intensify throughout the day, Israeli forces say they are reengaged in firefights just north of Gaza City, trying to weed out Hamas fighters that have been using buildings there, trying to create corridors for civilians to escape through, but that has become, you know, a very treacherous situation as well. So, all of this continues, even as Arab countries have come together over the weekend to denounce what Israel is doing there on the ground, saying that because Israel is guilty of war crimes, but Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister here in Israel, says they will continue this military operation for full force.",

It's the same for a patient that might be in, as you say, in a life support machine such as a ventilator, such as controlled intravenous treatment, and so on. Moving those patients, moving critically ill, or unstable patience, is always a tricky situation. I'm an emergency physician. I've done a lot of the many medical evacuation in my career. Moving one patient requires specialized staff, equipment, supplies, a clear passage, and then you've got to have a hospital that can receive them at the other end.

For the past two years he has not reported any assets and has never even reported a checking account on financial disclosure forms. The Speaker's office says he has a personal bank account which is exempt from House reporting rules because it is non-interest bearing, meaning he does not have to disclose this type of account under House rules. While it's unknown how much is in that account, a source with knowledge of his financial situation tells CNN that account is not big enough to be leaving large sums of money in interest on the table. All this as Johnson's liabilities are plenty. A mortgage for his family home valued between $250,000 and $500,000; a personal loan from 2016 between $15,000 and $50,000; and a home equity line of credit taken in 2019 for less than $50,000. As a congressman, Johnson was making $174,000 a year. His salary will now jump to $223,500 as Speaker. And he has made over $100,000 teaching online courses at Liberty University since 2018. Last year alone Johnson collected nearly $30,000 from the college. On Capitol Hill, to save money on steep D.C. rent, Johnson is one of the many members of Congress that sleep in their offices.
