And that's a good thing. We wanted this humanitarian pause to facilitate the release of our people.And we want this to go ahead without any glitches. Yes, we want to see those 50 people out in the next -- over the next four days. And then we -- well, remember, Kaitlan, there's an option to extend this humanitarian pause for another day and another day, if they agreed to release more hostages. Another 10 hostages for every day. Now Hamas won't do it because they've suddenly become humanitarian. And let's be clear. They're the opposite of humanitarian. So the sort of violence they committed is inhuman, both their violence against Israelis and the way they treat their own people, the Palestinians of Gaza. But maybe they have an interest. We've been putting sizable military pressure on them. We've taken out their underground fortresses. We've taken out and eliminated senior commanders. They're under a lot of pressure. They need that pause. And if that's a way for us to get our people out, so be it. And once again, we want to see more people released. They have an opportunity to do it. They want this pause. They want this time out from the fighting. And so maybe this is a way to expedite our people.",

And diplomatic correspondent for the Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, Amir Tibon. Good to have both of you with us this morning. Amir, just to start with you. From what we've seen so far, this truce is holding at this moment. We just heard from Mark Regev, who's just speaking, of course, with Kaitlan Collins.

And I feel it personally because apart from my work as a journalist, who is covering this, I'm also a resident of the Gaza border area. My community is one of the border communities that were attacked on October 7 and we had several of our neighbors kidnapped into Gaza. All of them civilians, husbands, fathers, a grandmother and two young girls to sisters. So we are so anxious to know that actually we're going to see this first batch of our hostages released. And that this deal will go as planned and we'll see the next phase of it tomorrow as well.I'm relieved to see that so far the ceasefire is holding, but we will not feel any kind of relief until we actually see with our eyes the first group of our hostages.

I think since this -- since this deal was announced.What does it look like moving forward if and when you get to that point? You know, Israel has promised that the fighting, Amir, will in fact resume, has been very clear in that. What has not been clear is the role of the Red Cross here. And I'm sure you have been pressing for information on this as well. Mark Regev just saying that it's the obligation, just a few moments ago, of the Red Cross. And that if Hamas hasn't allowed that to happen, that that's on them. But he said this was absolutely always part of the original deal that the Red Cross would be needing with the hostages. Is it clear to you where the disconnect is here, Amir? Is this, hey, it's Hamas' fault. They won't let the Red Cross in. Is it really that simple? TIBON: First of all, we have to demand it. I don't know whether it was agreed or not in the deal. I'm not party to those details. And I was not involved in the negotiations. But it's clear we have to demand that the Red Cross will come in and see the hostages who are not being released right now. I understand that Hamas doesn't want it, because Hamas is playing a very, very ugly and vicious game here. And just trying to torment the Israeli population at wide with the way that it shares information and disinformation about the state of the hostages. But I think it's very important to continue demanding this. I don't know if we can promise it. I know the Prime Minister, two days ago, actually, made it a promise to the public. And I don't know if that was backed up or not, but we have to demand it. We have to demand it. From a place just of sheer humanity that these are women and children and husbands and fathers, civilians. And we need the Red Cross to come in and see their status and see if they need any medical help and give some kind of update to the families.",

That's how it's been described, places where they can hopefully see the enemy coming in case any of the Hamas militants or the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants want to take a chance or take this opportunity to strike them.And they're not going to stay static. They've already said they'll move around in preparation for the next phase. And while they don't have drones in the air, you can bet that the U.S. has re-task satellites to soak up the areas of Gaza where Hamas and other militants might be moving around to try to find the location of the different hostages. Hamas itself, I understand from current and former Israeli officials, might not know where they all are, because they keep that compartmentalized even within their organization. So this is going to be a time of great movement within the Hamas organization to try to locate all the hostages. And so the possibility is even once fighting starts again, that Israel will have a better idea of where to go, where to raid to get their people back.",

We've been talking to the staff inside. They said they haven't slept. There's a huge amount of tension. Also, excitement and hopefulness that tonight that some of these hostages will arrive here with their mothers. This is also the point where some of them would be reunited with their families. We don't know exactly when they would arrive. We don't know how they would arrive. Obviously, it's a major hospital. There is a helipad over there. No indication as of yet, though, that they would be arriving in a helicopter. But you are starting to see a lot more journalists arriving here now. There's been quite a few sort of curious onlookers as well and passers-by as really just anticipation growing around this moment and around what the next few hours could bring.

But let's be clear about this.
