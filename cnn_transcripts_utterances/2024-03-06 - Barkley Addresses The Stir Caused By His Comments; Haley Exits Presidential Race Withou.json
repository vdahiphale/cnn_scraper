When you don't have hope about tomorrow, then you say, make America great again. That sells. When you say, make America great again the way it was just five, six years ago. When you don't have hope for tomorrow, nostalgia sells. And so, I think that he's playing that nostalgia card. And everybody forgets how bad it really, really was during the Trump years. Yes, some of the numbers look good, but most of us thought bad every day. That's getting washed out.
