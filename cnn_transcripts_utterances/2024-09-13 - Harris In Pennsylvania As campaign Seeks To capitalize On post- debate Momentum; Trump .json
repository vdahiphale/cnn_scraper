And she is looking to push through these neck and neck polls with breakthrough moments and innovative appearances according to new CNN reporting. Today, she's in the critical battleground of Pennsylvania, where we expect that she will be arriving any minute. She'll be speaking directly to voters there, specifically targeting two counties that her rival, former President Donald Trump, won in the last two presidential elections.Trump, in the meantime, is also on the trail right now. He's expected, or he is speaking, I should say, to reporters at his golf course in southern California. Then later, he'll be heading to Las Vegas for a rally. CNN Senior Reporter Isaac Dovere begins our coverage here. And you have some really interesting reporting that I mentioned, which is that she's skewing, as we know, sort of the value of traditional media, but she's looking at kind of innovative appearances.

The last two and a half weeks since then have been a little slower, a little lower intensity for her. A lot of that's because of Labor Day. And then she was in debate prep building up to Tuesday. What the campaign looks at now in these seven weeks that are left is how to get that energy to carry through all the way to focus more on that, getting people to feel good about Harris, and feel like they know her in that way, rather than things like deep policy rollouts or those sorts of things.",

But the hope that some Democrats, leading Democrats have is that they can get Swift to be doing things on the campaign trail and even to get Beyonce out on the campaign trail. Remember, there was that rumor that she might show up at the convention, She didn't. But could they figure out how to get Swift, how to get Beyonce, maybe together, maybe separately doing events, building this sort of cultural phenomenon, very much like the 2008 campaign for Barack Obama, should be said, Obama will be part of this, too, with an aide to the former President telling me that they're looking to do things that they're going to have some fun.

She traveled with him on 9/11. She has suggested that 9/11 was an inside job, but it was also recent racist comments about Kamala Harris that got a lot of attention. He said he hasn't heard the remarks. That's just not believable because this is not a new controversy. It has roiled allies in his party. So this is something that's been getting a lot of attention.
