Tonight,negotiators meet in Cairo in a desperate attempt to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas with just days ahead of Ramadan. We'll have the very latest for you. Then a major legal victory for Donald Trump after the Supreme Court rules to keep him on the ballot in Colorado. We'll have all of the reaction to that decision coming up soon. Plus, spiraling gang violence and a state of emergency in Haiti after thousands of prisoners escaped from jail, we'll have a report from inside the country's violent gang lands. We begin with a historic decision today by the U.S. Supreme Court and a massive legal victory for former President Donald Trump. Justices unanimously ruled that Trump's name can remain on Colorado's Republican primary ballot despite claims he violated the so-called insurrectionist's clause in the U.S. constitution.

      "sentences": "Yes, that is significant that all nine justices, Bianca, agreed that Trump should remain on the ballot,and they really stepped in at the 11th hour here to really add some certainty to voters in 15 states here in the U.S. who will head to the polls to vote tomorrow in the primaries for what's known as Super Tuesday. So, the outcome of this ruling is that those voters, they know that Donald Trump will be on the ballot, and if they vote for him, their votes will count. That's what all nine justices said unanimously. What's interesting is that there was a bit of a split, a 5-4 split in the particulars here. Five of the justices said that states can't take this unilateral decision to take presidents or any federal officers off the ballot, and instead, that's a decision that Congress would have to make in the form of legislation to decide which candidates could be disqualified by the 14th Amendment's so-called insurrectionist ban. And that's the ban and the clause that's at issue here. It says that \"any officer of the United States who engages in insurrection can be barred from holding office.\" And what we saw over the last several months were Colorado, Maine, Illinois, they all acted via their state's courts to take Trump off the ballot because of that clause. But now the Supreme Court stepping in to say, no, a state cannot decide who is on the ballot in federal elections. Now, we saw Donald Trump weigh in on this today, he said on Truth Social, it was a big win for America, we saw him give that lengthy talk at Mar-a-Lago. On the flip side, though, the Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, who is involved in at least the K sound Colorado. She spoke out on social media saying she was disappointed and she argued that Colorado should be able to bar what she called oath-breaking insurrectionists from their ballot. But of course, Bianca, this is a unanimous decision. It puts some certainty going forward into Super Tuesday that Donald Trump will be on the ballot in all of those states. That he'll remain on the ballot if he's the nominee, the Republican nominee for the general election. So, a big ruling today, and now what we look toward, Bianca, is this hearing at the end of April about whether Trump is immune from criminal prosecution. So, the Supreme Court continues to be embroiled in what is a big election year as we barrel towards the general election in November, Bianca.",

Donald Trump will likelytake a huge step forward toward the Republican nomination following tomorrow's Super Tuesday with 15 states holding primaries. The former president won all 39 delegates over the weekend at the Michigan Republican Convention. Nikki Haley won for the first time in the race, taking the D.C. Republican primary. On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden takes center stage when he delivers his State of the Union address. It's a critical test for Mr. Biden who is facing sagging poll numbers and anger over the U.S. stance on the war in Gaza. I want to welcome in Larry Sabato; he's the director at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Always a pleasure to speak to you, sir. Let's begin talking about the Supreme Court ruling. Now, this is a vindication for Donald Trump, not in just the immediate literal sense of the fact that his name can appear on the ballot, but also potentially in terms of him spinning it or the interpretation being that Donald Trump has been unfairly targeted in this election campaign. LARRY SABATO, DIRECTOR, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA'S CENTER FOR POLITICS: Well, you're right, that's what he'll say. Of course, that's not the truth. The truth is that if you read the plain language of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. constitution passed after the civil war, ratified after the civil war, one would think as a layman, that it fit him perfectly. He was an insurrectionist and he organized January 6. But the Supreme Court has spoken, although there was, as your correspondent suggested, a clear split between the six conservatives or at least five of the six conservatives and the three liberals. Having said that, this was widely expected, no one thought that Donald Trump was going to be thrown off the ballot once the Republican Party chose him. And he hasn't been, he'll be the Republican nominee. He's going to sweep or almost sweep the primaries and the delegates coming tomorrow on Super Tuesday in 15 states and American Samoa. So, not much has changed except that Donald Trump as usual will exaggerate the result and claim that he's been exonerated, nothing of the sort happened.",

Now, you talk about a court that's disconnected from reality, I think even people abroad have recognized that the American Congress is broken, they can't agree on what day it is, much less get something significant done. So, this is a solution that really isn't a solution, for Donald Trump, it's a solution. It may not be the best to answer for the country as a whole.",

The Israeli military for its part hasn't commented directly on these allegations leveled by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, that this aid truck was struck, but they did release drone footage of a strike that CNN geo-located to that very same coastal road in central Gaza. And the Israeli military says that in that strike, it killed a Hamas terrorist, a man who they said was a recruiter for Hamas. Now, this of course comes after those reports from last Thursday as we saw hundreds of people massing around the aid trucks in northern Gaza. Israeli gunfire also involved in that situation, although depending on if you ask eyewitnesses on the ground who say that gunfire sparked the stampede and aid trucks driving into the crowd or the Israeli military, which says that the gunfire happened after and to a separate group of people.

And this meeting couldn't come at a more critical moment in this Israel- Hamas war. For one, the humanitarian crisis, of course, in Gaza could not be more dire as you were laying out before with the human suffering and the casualties that we're seeing across the Strip just intensifying with each day that this conflict drags on. And with the U.S., as we saw over the weekend, even resorting to air- dropping aid, including food into the Strip. So that just captures how badly the situation there has completely deteriorated. And then of course, the other factor is the growing calls that we have seen for a ceasefire in Gaza, including from the U.S., the president himself calling for a temporary ceasefire to go into effect immediately as a part of that hostages deal that the U.S. has been trying to mediate and get across the finish line. And then, of course, there is the very complicated Biden and Netanyahu relationship, which has been complicated for some time and has been quite rocky throughout the course of this war. And the fact that Benny Gantz is here, you know, that's not a move that is in any way sort of endorsed by Prime Minister Netanyahu. In fact, he has made clear, his displeasure at the decision by Gantz to come and have these high profile meetings. You know, the comments that the vice president, Vice President Kamala Harris made over the weekend about the situation in Gaza were probably some of the starkest that we have heard from any senior U.S. official. I just want to play a clip of it because it was notable. You know, she not only called for an immediate ceasefire, that six-week ceasefire in the war, she also just went into such painstaking detail to describe in really graphic terms what the situation is like in Gaza right now.

In recent months, gangs have seized more and more control over this country, including the roads leading to Port-au-Prince. Officials estimate that gangs now control as much as 80 percent of the capital, even the U.S. Embassy and International Airport are mostly surrounded by rival gang territories. It's led the Haitian National Police to create an undercover unit. We go with them to the front lines.",

And we were on the ground just before this most recent outbreak that we've been talking about over the past 72 hours. And what stood out to us is the amount of control that the gangs have seized over the country and as we pointed out there, over the capital, Port-au- Prince. I mean, the U.N. estimating the gangs now control 80 percent of the capital, it's incredible. Our driving route through the city would change hourly at times, giving gunfire and violence would erupt randomly. You've got kidnappings and extortions that are rampant right now. It is a desperate situation. And so over the weekend, you've got more than 3,000 inmates who are estimated to have escaped from Haitian prisons. A Haiti police union warning that if those numbers are accurate, this is what they say, \"We are done. No one will be spared.\" So most concerning for the government is that the gangs have actually started coordinating with each other. And it's showing a unified force against Prime Minister Ariel Henry. And many folks were chanting as we were there, that they want Henry to go. Late last week, and this is to your point of really what sparked this, Henry signed this agreement for a thousand Kenyan police officers to deploy to Haiti and this all part of a multinational security support mission, the U.S. funding this in part as well. The Prime Minister also said that elections would not happen until August 2025. You're right, that angered a lot of the folks on the ground there. And that's fueled these protests and it's created, Bianca, this situation that is critical right now.",
