Democrats have actually urged House Republican leaders to dis-invite him to this hearing over his documented history of pushing dangerous conspiracy theories. Just this week, he was rebuked by his own family for pushing an unfounded conspiracy theory that COVID was actually targeted to hit certain ethnic groups while sparing Jewish and Chinese people. In his opening remarks this morning, he insisted he's never been racist, anti-Semitic, or anti-vaccine.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've never been any vaccine. But everybody in this room probably believes that I have been because that's the prevailing narrative. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, Mr. Kennedy says he's not anti-vaccine because he just wants safe vaccines to which anyone who has followed his public remarks should respond. Come on. Kennedy has spent much of his recent public life attacking safe vaccines, basically calling them unsafe. And in addition to that, Kate, falsely linking vaccines to all kinds of diseases that actually have nothing to do with vaccines.I could cite dozens of examples. He is maybe most famously insisted on a connection between vaccines and autism. There was zero basis for this claim, but he's done it for years. You've probably heard him baselessly attack the safety of the very safe COVID-19 vaccines. He's made numerous false claims. I won't repeat about the extent to which vaccines are tested. And that is far from all. He is deep down the anti-Vax rabbit hole. He's made all sorts of obscure claims. You probably will never have seen yourself unless you are immersed in that world. For example. He's been saying this spring and summer that there is strong evidence that the 1918 flu pandemic was not actually a flu. That it was caused by vaccine research. This is out-and-out nonsense that has circulated in long-ago debunked Facebook and Instagram memes. The flu pandemic was indeed a flu pandemic. There was no vaccine research that couldn't even possibly cause it. He also claimed at a recent public event that there is convincing evidence that HIV originated from a vaccine program. That claim to has been thoroughly discredited. So, what do you call someone like Mr. Kennedy, who devotes their time, energy, and public remarks to promoting entirely fake claims about vaccines, killing people in all manner of ways? I think anti-vax is a fair descriptor.",

An EF-3 is the strongest tornado to ever hit this area at this time of year.And when it was over, it left a path of destruction that is 16 and a half miles long, and about 600 yards wide. There were no fatalities but 16 people were injured, and it will take days to assess all of the financial damage. Let's bring in CNN Dianne Gallagher.

This is what that EF-Three tornado left in its wake as it came through almost 24 hours ago.Now, according to the National Weather Service, it started here in Dortches. And I'm going to get West of Hanover across the street here. You can take a look at that home. There were people inside when the tornado came through. They escaped unscathed. The home, a total loss. And it looks like this all through this community. We're on Town Hall Road. The people who live here I spoke with them. They said they're still traumatized. They don't want to speak on camera yet but it was a woman, her daughter, and her small grandchildren. They survived. They're OK right now at least physically, she says. The tornado continued this way for 16.5 miles, as you said, into Edgecombe County, and look, destroying buildings just like this, more than 80 structures, homes, and businesses at this point. And look, that is another concern here. In Nash County, one of the largest employers, Pfizer. They have a large manufacturing site here that produces more than a quarter of all of the sterile injectables that are used by hospitals in this country, significant damage that you can see in aerial footage that we have of that facility. Now look, Pfizer tells us they are still assessing that damage. But I will say that supply chain experts are concerned because they fear that the damage to this facility may further exacerbate the drug shortage that the country is currently impacted by. Now, look. Back out here in Dortches, the family that was in this home. They told me that she looked outside, the woman who lives here, and said that she noticed it was dark but -- and that there was a storm coming but didn't have any sort of real warning at that time. She says that she saw some trees flying. She got in here. She was able to again be with her grandchildren and her daughter and they escaped without physical injury. She says about two minutes after that storm -- that tornado came by, her phone went off with that warning telling them that there was a tornado in their area. She's asked, Rahel, she says right now, she's just trying to figure out what to do. She's waiting for insurance adjusters to come and survey her property. And she's asking for people to just pray for the people whose properties and homes have been destroyed.",
