The administration also offering a briefing today to all senators, and most who attended emerged calmer than they entered, though they still said there are many unanswered questions.Our CNN National Security Analyst Carrie Cordero joins the conversation. So let's start there. Two senators here, let's listen, the Democrat and Republican and they reflect the consensus opinion. They get this briefing and they come out and they say, OK, I feel better. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I think it was helpful today. Again, I'm not unnerved by anything. I'm confident this wasn't a, you know, an attack on the country. But I think it probably served the country well to have the President explain what's going on. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D), CONNECTICUT: I am not in any way afraid that we are under a threat of attack, or physical harm to our homeland. That's my personal feeling. But the American people need to be reassured with more facts. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Reassured with more facts. One of the points that White House officials and Canadian officials are making, Carrie, is that one object shot down Friday way up here, above Alaska and the Yukon in Canada. Another one shot down in the Yukon in Canada. Now other one shot down over Lake Huron in Michigan.They say they've actually done a good job. The first thing, remember, was the Chinese spy balloon, they've done a pretty good job pulling up the debris there. And they say they'll get an intelligence bonanza when they look at that. But the other three identified objects shot down in places that are just inhospitable anyway, especially at this time of year. Is it possible never recovered that debris, and we'll never know exactly what these were? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it's possible given the location that they are and the nature of the environment and the difficulty in obtaining them. I think that outcome from the briefing looks good from a bipartisan perspective, the fact that those two senators were pleased with the information that they heard. But look, the communications from the White House on this has not been good, because what they haven't been able to do is demonstrate the logic behind. There are items and objects in the sky that we felt we needed to shoot down and so we did, but we don't know what they are, and they didn't pose a threat. So those things are inconsistent. If the issue was that they believe they were a threat to civil aviation, then that is one explanation. But the reason the Chinese balloon as we had discussed on prior days made sense the way they let it, traverse the country until it wasn't a place that they could obtain it made sense was because they could collect intelligence, presumably, and then they identified a location that they could recover it. These are now unrecoverable, raise the question as to why is this all happening at one time, and so they need to be able to communicate that more effectively to the public and to broader members of Congress.",

      "sentences": "Yes, there's two key explanations that I've been getting from the White House, the first of which is that, look, there are a lot of unknowns here still at play. And there is a concern about the President getting ahead of where things actually are in terms of what the intelligence community knows, or initial information proving to ultimately change, which as we know, can happen with these intelligence assessments.The other question here is that they really feel like the leading explanation right now is that these are most likely benign balloons that pose the potential threats of commercial airspace because they were flying much lower than that initial Chinese a balloon, but that ultimately that this is likely a benign situation. And they don't want to make it seem much bigger by having the president come out and talk about this. Now, we'll see if the pressure changes or not, and they feel the need to ultimately do that. It does seem like that briefing today on Capitol Hill may have brought the temperature down a little bit in terms of providing these explanations about the likely benign nature of these balloons. But nonetheless, we're seeing John Kirby come out every day now and talking about this provide some potential explanation.",

It came in at 6.4 percent in January, that's the seventh straight month that annual inflation has declined. But, and it's a big but, some of the individual price trends are eye popping.Look there, the price of eggs up more than 70 percent from last year. Butter, up more than 26 percent. A 17 percent increase in the price of lettuce plus coffee jumps nearly 13 percent. Our great reporters are back at the table. And so, if you're the president of the United States and you're preparing to launch your reelection campaign, it's a good sign that the overall trend is coming down. Prices are still high, but it's coming down. And the President says, \"Inflation in America is continuing to come down. There's still more work to do as we make this transition to more steady, stable growth, and there could be setbacks along the way.\" It's that last part, this is a choppy report, the trendline is good, but there are some individual wows to that still uncertain territory for the President.",

But there is always that caveat of, there is more work to do when we're going to continue to do the work.And one of the things that the White House really wants to do over the next year as they implement some of these big bills, like infrastructure, like chips, which don't deal directly with inflation, but they do deal with the economy. And they're going to try and paint a broader picture of trying to talk about not only the impact of these projects directly, but the knock-on effects on the local economies of these places. And so that's I think some of the economic messaging you'll see from the White House as they continue to cross their fingers for that soft landing that they so desperately would like to see.",

Yes, the unemployment rate is down. But I think that resonates less to people than what they actually experience on a day-to-day basis.

She served in both the Obama and the Clinton administrations. And in those jobs, Dana, I remember in the Clinton administration, she helped China joined the World Trade Organization. Then in the Obama administration, when our views of China and the global economy changed a little bit, she was fighting with China all the time, about why it wouldn't tie its currency to global currency rates.

And whatever the courts ultimately decide, the challenge could drag on for months.Back to help us in this conversation, our CNN Legal and National Security Analyst Carrie Cordero. You could argue he was vice president, therefore his conversations with President Trump are shielded by White House executive privilege. Instead, he's arguing, I'm the president of the Senate, and you can't have senators or congressmen hauled into court on most matters, so I'm protected. Does he have a case?",

And you're right, it is the exact opposite argument that we have seen former Trump administration officials make in connection with January 6 investigations and congressional inquiries. So in that case, they were arguing executive privilege, the prerogatives of the executive branch.Here, former Vice President Pence is doing the exact opposite. He's looking to his role, presumably, if this is the challenge that he makes. He's looking to his role as president of the Senate and the function that he was performing in connection with the certification of the election. And so it's a really unsettled area of constitutional law and constitutional law scholars will find this all very interesting, but it could delay things a little bit -- KING: To the delay things part, correct me if I have the process wrong. Normally, you'd go to a U.S. District Court, the lowest level and oppose the subpoena, that goes up to the appellate court. Whenever that court decides, this party loses goes to the appellate court. And then you could end up with the Supremes and maybe a second appellate court level, if you go to the full panel of judges there.
