Tomorrow, Donald Trump will appear before the Manhattan criminal court for his arraignment. Trump is the only former president in American history to face criminal charges. Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg has been investigating Trump's alleged role in paying hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels. A Trump aide tells CNN that Trump has been meeting with lawyers and political advisers tonight, one of whom describes him as quote, defiant and focused. We will tell you what we've learned will happen tomorrow. Plus, Senator John Fetterman opening up about his downward spiral that landed him in Walter Reed Medical Center for six weeks being treated for depression. We will discuss why inpatient treatment was necessary for him. And Mike Rowe is here to talk about why a college degree may not be the best route to success for our kids and what jobs he says are needed over the next decade. But let's begin with what we know about Donald Trump's arraignment tomorrow. My panel is standing by. We have the world's best law enforcement analyst, John Miller, our old friend, Anthony Scaramucci, the former Trump White House communications director who lasted for 11 days, or one whole Scaramucci, also the man who somehow knows every lawyer involved in this case, Eli Honig, and the smartest woman on earth, okay, person on earth, S.E. Cupp. But, first, we got CNN's Jason Carroll, who is live for us at Trump Tower. Jason, good evening. Tell us how the NYPD is preparing for this unprecedented event.",

First and foremost, the former president spending the night here at Trump Tower, where we have seen in so many times in the past, a lot of questions about what will happen in terms of security out here tomorrow.Right now, I can tell you a lot of steel barricades out here on 5th Avenue, the same steel barricades that we've seen downtown at the courthouse. The NYPD has made it very clear, Alisyn that there has been no specific or credible threats, but the NYPD, as you can imagine, is prepared just in case. And by preparedness, we mean that mobile units are on the standby, if necessary. They are prepared to set up roadblocks, if that ends up being something that they need. They have a complement of transit officers at the ready if that should be something that should be needed as well. When the president leaves Trump Tower here tomorrow and makes his way down to the courthouse will be part of that motorcade. The Secret Service will be there with him. But, once again, you've got the mayor, you've got the police commissioner saying that this is something that they have been prepared for. And when you think of the NYPD, think of it in this way. This is a department that is really the standard bearer when it comes to security here in the United States. They are accustomed to security challenges. They are accustomed to working in tandem with the Secret Service. So, once again, no specific or credible threats, the NYPD says they are ready. Alisyn?",

So, it might be semantics. There's something called active suicidal ideation. That's where you're actively coming up with a plan to kill yourself. But then there's passive suicidal ideation, which this might actually fall into that category where you're sort of indifferent whether you die or not. So, if someone is trying to harm you, you might not actually defend yourself. Because if you think about it, you know, it's very competitive to get a hospital bed, right? If you go to the emergency room, you could be really ill and people will send you home anyway, maybe with nursing, you know, maybe with equipment. Same thing if you have a major surgery. So, to actually get a hospital bed, you have to be pretty sick and in a really dangerous situation because you're competing with everybody else. So, he had to be in a dangerous situation. And usually it's because you're in danger, you know, either to yourself or you're posing a danger to others. So, in this case, it's that he's in danger. And then to stay hospitalized for approximately six weeks, that danger had to persist. So, this is actually a treatment refractory depression in some sense. It wasn't something where they could start a medication say okay, everything looks good, the plan looks set, he can be set up to follow up with outpatient psychiatrists. It looked like it was pretty intense, and he already had some structural changes in the brain from his stroke. So, it's probably a major obstacle.",

Look at this, electricians, growth by 7 percent, construction equipment operators, 5 percent, construction laborers and helper's 4 percent.

Or the welder or the HVAC guy. And so, people began to suddenly realize, hold on, it's not just the employer over here in the employee over there were labor and capital or union or nonunion. We're all kind of in this together. And a healthy workforce is a workforce that values the skill trades. I'll say too, you know, the problem with those studies is that they do reflect a macro issue, but the opportunities that are buried in those facts, that's what's interesting. For the individual right now, who wants to learn a trade, there are people falling over themselves to help pay for that including me. My foundation gives away a couple million bucks a year in work ethics scholarships specifically for these kinds of jobs. We're overrun this year. It's just anecdotal, Alisyn, but I'm telling you, I've been doing this for 15 years, and this year we've seen more applications in a relatively short period of time that I've ever seen before.
