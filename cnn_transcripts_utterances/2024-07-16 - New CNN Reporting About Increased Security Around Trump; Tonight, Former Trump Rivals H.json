The campaign directing us to Secret Service saying they don't comment and anything involving Trump's security detail.But when I spoke to folks that are close to the former president, including those people who actually work for him, many of them were shocked to hear this report. Some of them said they believed the Secret Service would handle it, but others were incredibly angry and very concerned after what we saw on Saturday. There are a lot of questions remaining as to how that could happen on Saturday, particularly now that they know that there was an increased amount of security. One of his advisers saying to me, so you're telling me that there was more people there and they still. And that is, appears to be exactly what it was. One of another source telling me that while they had learned that there was increased security, they had noticed it themselves, but they just believed it was because he was going to be the nominee, that that's why they had beefed up his security. So, not really any clue as to why exactly that was going on or about this incredibly significant plot from Iran.",

She is someone who only months ago, Wolf, said that she believed Donald Trump was diminished, that he was unhinge, that he was unfit for the office, and now she will be coming out to speak at his Republican convention, a floor that is certainly in the grasp of his hands, and a party that also is as well, Wolf.

And that will be a centerpiece. But we do have some key political moments here, seeing Nikki Haley on this stage tonight addressing this convention after their bitter primary. She released her delegates. She said she's going to vote for him. And tonight, she's clearly going to make the case to others, supporters of hers, as to why they should come along on this journey with her. So, you got the political piece on his former rivals.And then we're going to hear from a slew of Senate candidates, Republican Senate candidates. and this is fascinating, Wolf. A lot of these candidates are running in states that overlap with the presidential battleground map and where Trump is right now ahead of Biden in a lot of these states, it's the flip. The Democratic incumbent senators are performing well against these Republican challengers that we're going to hear from tonight. Biden is not dragging them under thus far.

He would have to pick up that congressional district there. That is Biden's path to 270.But Donald Trump, if you project he could get 330, think about how many states he could lose from that collection and still get to 270. So, Trump, you could write six, eight viable paths for Donald Trump to get to 270. You can write one, maybe two, for Joe Biden. And, you know, the Democrats are saying, oh, 16 weeks, plenty of time. If you look at the approval rating, Wolf, if you look at some of these other numbers, it is hard to bend numbers like that when you see the structural underpinnings of the race. It doesn't mean it's impossible but no one has ever done it before. From where we are now to where we will be 16 weeks from tonight, no one's ever changed numbers like that in that period of time.",
