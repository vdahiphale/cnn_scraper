And if those crimes were relevant enough by the Southern District of New York to hold against me, then certainly it should be -- it shouldn't matter that it's Donald J.

The next person hearing is set for December 4th.Joining us now is Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and founding director of the Center on U.S. Politics At University College London. Great to have you on the program. Thomas, I noticed yesterday, I'm sure you did too, a decisive shift in tone with regard to how media and people from all sides of the political spectrum were talking about the former president. It was in a more human way. It was as though it was just a very sad day for American democracy and slightly less targeted and politicized. Would you say that was your assessment? THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LONDON: Well, I think you're absolutely right, Bianca. And thanks so much for having me on the show. I think it goes without saying that prosecuting not only a former president but also the de facto leader of one of the country's two major parties isn't a sign that America wants to project. You know, whether you think the charges are appropriate or not, it's still tarnishing to the country's reputation. And we've obviously seen former heads of state face criminal charges in other advanced democracies, but this is unique in the United States, and it does shatter a longstanding executive norm. For that reason, it is unprecedented. It's newsworthy, and it's a big issue.",

In the end I think Trump got what he wanted purely by dent of the fact that this was inherently a political moment. And we saw that with his speeches, his tirade.Trump exploited that to lash out at the prosecution, to denigrate other ongoing investigations. Trump clearly knows how to activate his supporters and raise money. That's obvious. But it's also important to highlight I think that his primetime speech was not coalition building in anyway. So, Trump is really doubling down on a strategy that might earn him the Republican nomination. But in some sense, I think yesterday was also instructive because it's getting harder to see exactly how he can translate his sort of brand of grievance politics into, you know, a broad enough support to win a general election. And for Trump I think that's the real challenge as he gears up for this legal battle.",

Same threats -- long lived dangerous tornadoes a possibility, especially across southern Michigan, back down into northern Ohio and northern Indiana late afternoon. Wind and hail some of the bigger threats here and again over 75 mph and two inch in diameter -- hail a possibility. Timeframe, Wednesday morning, 9:00 that line really starting to move through the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes. The real brunt of it picks up through the afternoon. We get the energy. We get to lift, then moisture. All the right ingredients there so 2:00 to about 4:00 Central time these storms really ramp up across the Ohio Valley.

They say, out of fears that Jewish extremists were going to try to come up to this compound. Which is known as Temple Mount to the Jews holiest site in Judaism. But the place al- Aqsa mosque compound, the al-Haram al-Sharif is also, it is the third holiest site in Islam. And, of course, right now is the holy month of Ramadan. But also tonight is the first night of Passover. And so, this morning Israeli police entering the mosque itself. They say that they were met with fireworks. They responded with stun grenades and rubber bullets. We see some very violent images there overnight, and there's not only those injured and of course, the 350 or so who were arrested, but also the damages to the mosque itself. Which from videos we've seen do seem to be quite extensive. Now to give you some context about why this is so significant, not only because of the violence. Because of the status quo, because of the sensitivity of the site. Israeli police even stepping foot into the mosque is by itself considered offensive. And so to see them entering like that and using force in the way they did in arresting people in the mosque that is seen is even further offensive. And so that's why we're seeing condemnations from across the Arab and Muslim world. Because what happens in Jerusalem, of course, has ripple effects all across the world. We're hearing condemnations from the Jordanians, from the Egyptians, from Saudi Arabia and of course, from the Palestinian Authority. Now then what happened is after these events at al-Aqsa rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. Israel -- the Israeli military responding with airstrikes on what they say were Hamas targets. So far though, we've had no injuries from either those rockets or the responding airstrikes. And so far today, things have been calm. It's a very tense calm. There's already been Jewish visitors up onto the site. They're allowed during certain hours.
