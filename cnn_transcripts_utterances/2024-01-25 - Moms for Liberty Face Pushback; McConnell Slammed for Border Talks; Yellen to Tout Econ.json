Really just laying out the reality to his conference, which is that given the fact that Trump is opposed to the deal so far, even though a deal doesn't actually exist, given the realities that House Republicans are assailing this potential deal, even though a deal does not exist, that the path in the Senate is extremely narrow, and that timing right now is of the essence.I think that McConnell wasn't saying that he was opposed or for anything. He was really just reminding his conference, in his sort of soft touch way that he's used over the last several decades in the Senate, that this is a good opportunity. But if there isn't a path forward, perhaps this is as far as lawmakers should go. He also acknowledged that there's a quandary when it comes to whether or not the issue of Ukraine aid should be linked to the border at all. If that border deal can't get through, McConnell has always steadfastly been behind getting more money to Ukraine. And that is one of his top priorities. So, he's sort of openly acknowledging that that is a real possibility that these two things may not be able to move forward together. And I think that that is a really interesting moment. And it's important to keep in mind that he's not particularly saying this is how I think the conference should do thing one way or another. That's not McConnell's style. I think he was really laying out the reality in conference. And I should note that many Republican senators stood up in that conference meeting, made their opinions known. This was not just McConnell lecturing his conference. He just spoke briefly.",

But they're going to come off as tone deaf if they only focus on those positives because there is an affordability crisis in this economy. And so that's why in this major speech by Yellen today, in Chicago, she's going to flat out say, quote, \"it is still too hard to be a working parent.\" She's going to focus on childcare, housing, education and note that millions of children were plunged back into poverty when the expanded child tax credit went away.
