And I understand that there is a much better chance through the Egyptian channel. But today, you also learn there might be another third track going on, which I can't give details about, which the Americans are actually indirectly involved in if started. So, these are very intensive talks. The time is running out clearly.

That's a much more limited release. But that's the one that Hamas should be making immediately, without any question, because it's against the Quran.

I think that the government of Israel at the end of the day will be willing to pay a very high price to bring them home.But we have a problem in Israel, because currently we have a very weakened prime minister, and a government of ministers who do not necessarily support any deal with Hamas of any kind. The only way to bring all the hostages home will be through an agreement with Hamas. There is no way to rescue them all. We might be able to rescue some of them. But surely, many of them will not be rescued in military operations. So, we have to pursue and exhaust every possibility of any kind of agreement with Hamas, even though we know that the final goal of Israel in this war is to dismantle Hamas' ability to govern and to threaten Israel ever again.",

Most notably, the Egyptian foreign minister, the Jordanian foreign minister, who he spoke with at this press conference, all again called for a ceasefire. This is something the U.S. continues to oppose. They say it would give Hamas leverage to regroup and attack Israel. Again, they are instead calling for these humanitarian pauses.

And they are seeing that this is not being done. Actually, there see, also the conversation within the state department where criticism of these kinds of approaches are being silenced, people are resigning. I mean, the administration is violating America's own law. The Leahy law that indicates that any recipient of military aid cannot violate human rights, civil rights -- cannot commit war crimes. Yet, in the case of Israel, there is strong indication with the images of bombing of hospitals, of schools, of refugees, of refugee camps, of honor, you know, shelters, you're seeing an indication that there is no proportionality. That yes, in the name of killing one military leader, they are willing to wipe out entire families. And that is the issue at the heart -- at the heart what leads those protesters.

And in that moment, the President acknowledged the protester and said that he thinks there should be a pause and that was an extension of what U.S. officials are saying privately to their Israeli counterparts behind the scenes. We know from sources that President Biden his top advisors are warning Israel, that they may not be able to reach their military goals as this global outcry intensifies.

He's also a former senior officer at the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Andrew, thanks so much for joining us. What do you think we can expect to see in the coming week with Israel shifting potentially, to a more tactical ground operation and slowing down its air campaign? ANDREW BORENE, FORMER SENIOR OFFICER, U.S. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR FOR NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Yes, that was great question, Wolf. And thanks for having me on. I think it's really important that we back up. And remember, every human being under the laws of armed conflict, who is not a combatant has certain human rights under international law. And it doesn't matter who they are, if they are Israeli, or if they are Palestinian, or if they are one of the 30 plus nationals that were taken hostage or murdered October 7, or if they are someone who's stuck in Gaza. So I think first and foremost, what IDF and the Israeli forces will need to do is really be conscious of separating their military campaign against Hamas, from the effects and ensuring that it separates from the Palestinian people and the civilians on the ground. And I think that's probably at very top of mind, for their planners at the moment is how to target Hamas terrorists, and again, with not only international pressure, but from a military planning perspective. It's not going to be successful strategically if they don't also separate those fighters from the civilian population.

And I think what lessons we're going to learn now are largely about fears. There's a regional kinetic fear of expansion from kind of this axis of Hamas, Iran back to militant and terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, Palestinian, Islamic Jihad, and others.But then much more broadly through the internet and through real time dissemination of information, were concerned about either lone wolf terrorism, small group terrorism, threats to public safety, and threat actors from countries like Iran, or potentially even Russia affiliated groups, accelerating violence between protest groups in peaceful nations. So, there's a lot of challenges for counterterrorism. I think, like the key lesson that I think will get taken from this for the future is to protect all innocent people, there's going to need to be really good public private information sharing, and then we're going to kind of probably need to read up a call to public action. If you see something say something. In London Underground, they say see it, say it, sort it.

His statements to me indicated that he was not taking responsibility, that he was not tying Iran to planning funding for the October 7 attacks.He certainly praised those attacks in very uncomfortable disgusting ways, for those of us that do believe in rule of law and defensive civilians. But I do think the remarks I heard in that hour long speech, as translated to me indicate that they may not be hungry for a fight. And that is actually probably not a bad thing for the world.
