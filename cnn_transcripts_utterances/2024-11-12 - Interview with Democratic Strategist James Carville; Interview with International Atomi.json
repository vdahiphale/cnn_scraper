I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Now, it's said that personnel is policy, and with his cabinet picks, Donald Trump is laying out his agenda. Hardline on national security and foreign policy, including Ukraine aided skeptics like Senator Marco Rubio, who's tipped to be secretary of state, and Congressman Mike Waltz, who's been selected as national security adviser. Deregulation on environmental protection measures with Congressman Lee Zeldin picked to lead the EPA. And a stepped-up crackdown and deportation at the southern border, as Stephen Miller, Trump's extreme anti-immigration adviser, will wield important influence as the White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Elections, as they say, have consequences. And as the incoming Trump administration rapidly fills up with loyalists, can Democrats do any more than watch it all unfold? Allies overseas are also buckling up and seeking favor with the new administration while also trying to Trump proof. And who better to offer advice than longtime Democratic Strategist James Carville. He's the architect of Bill Clinton's decisive victories in the 1990s. He popularized the line, it is -- it's the economy, stupid. Carville seems to have an instinct for winning, although he failed to predict the Harris loss. Now, he's the subject of a new documentary on Max, \"Carville: Winning Is Everything, Stupid.\" And he joins the show from New Orleans. James Carville, welcome to the program.",

But it's really just -- it laid out by what happened yesterday in Gaza, 14 aid trucks from the World Food Programme finally got authorization to go to Northern Gaza.

And then, once they actually made it there, this morning -- they made it there last night, and this morning there were reports that that the Israeli military moved in near these sites where the aid was delivered, forcing hundreds of people in those very same shelters where the aid was delivered to flee. Now, Israeli government officials are still meeting with U.S. officials to try and find ways to, you know, accede to some of these demands that the U.S. has been making.

But it's a very important one because of the many circumstances, some of those you were discussing in the show just now. And in the world, we are in a moment of particular tension. We are in a moment where the -- precisely the possibility that Iran might take certain decisions could trigger responses from Israel or perhaps some others as well. So, our job at the IAEA is to relentlessly look for diplomatic, reasonable, strong solutions. And this is what I need to do. It will be my first time with the new president, Pezeshkian, and the foreign minister, whom I know very, very well. He's an experienced former nuclear negotiator.

LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, CO-CREATOR, \"WARRIORS\":  Yes, you know, I think everyone has that movie they saw when they were growing up and then they also have the movie they saw without their parents' permission growing up. And \"Warriors\" was that movie for me. You know, it's been a touchstone for hip hop culture and New Yorkers, because it's such a snapshot of 1979 New York. It's about, you know, all the gangs in the city going to a peace summit and truce in the South Bronx. The charismatic leader who calls that truce is assassinated after a really impassioned speech. The assassin blames the Warriors who are from Coney Island, and they got to fight their way from the Bronx to Coney Island, which every New Yorker knows is quite a journey.",

When Gamergate was unfolding, I remember -- and people were doxing innocent women and saying, here's their home address. Go get them. Go do what you will with this information. I connected the dot. I thought, that's such a Luther act. You know, Luther, in the movie, shoots Cyrus, points at another gang and says, they did it. And then, they're left to fend for themselves for the rest of the movie. And so, just connecting those two dots flipped the gender of the \"Warriors\" for me and it also complicated every plot point, every subsequent plot point for me, like, oh, well, if the Warriors are women, how would they deal with this scenario? How would they deal with this undercover cop? And so, it did two things. One, I think we carve out our own lane. This album is very much a love letter to that movie, but it will also never be confused with that movie as a result of our decisions. And I think it allows us to find fresh terrain in our adaptation. I think in so many adaptations of work when they're very, very faithful, you either meet the standard of the original film or you don't. But when you change key things, you know, both the newcomer and the fan of the original don't know where it's headed, and that's very exciting to me as an artist.",

And he and I were talking about him kind of developing a one-man show around the -- his incredible catalog of music. And offhandedly, he said, what else are you working on? And I said, oh, I'm writing a Warriors concept album with Eisa Davis, and his eyes popped out of his head and he said, \"Warriors,\" that's my favorite movie. And so, his buy in -- because he just really wanted to see it exist, really opened a lot of doors for us, particularly within the hip hop community and understanding we're looking to sort of create our best sonic love letter to this movie that hip hop culture loves. And then, you know, there are the folks that, you know, are not necessarily stars yet, but we want to be like a lot of the women playing our Warriors were really friends of ours. We asked them to come in and do demos of our material.

Because, of course, I want us, as artists, to be free to do whatever we want to do.

My aunt talks about that all the time, about cultural work being a prong of what it is that we're trying to do when it comes to achieving social change. And so, I would never say that an artist has any duty to, you know, say anything that it does not come, you know, full bore from their imagination. There has to be that freedom at all times.
