I'm Paula Reid in Washington, in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour with a dangerous near collision between Chinese and US warships. Accusations are flying between both sides after an incident during a joint naval exercise between the US and Canadian Navy in the Taiwan Strait. Video showing the near collision was captured by a news crew on a nearby ship. You can see the Chinese destroyer cutting directly across the front of the US ship. We've got full coverage of this story. CNN Pentagon correspondent, Oren Liebermann is with us. Also joining me is David Sanger. He is a CNN political and national security analyst and a White House and national security correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" All right, Oren, both sides are blaming each other for this incident.

They've got two entirely different narratives about a single incident as if both are describing something completely different.US Indo Pacific Command says, what a ship a US destroyer, the Chung- Hoon was sailing through the Taiwan Strait with a Canadian ship in an exercise in international waters, which ships including the US military have the right to do. It is during this transit that a Chinese military ship got 150 yards in front of the US ship, then circled back and cut in front once again this time 2,000 yards. The US calls it an unsafe maneuver carried out by the Chinese vessel, one that endangered mariners, not only Chinese mariners, but also US and Canadian mariners. For the Chinese, it is an entirely different narrative, a different way of describing what happened. They say hours later, it was China's Defense minister who had spoken at a Defense conference who said it was the US that was acting provocative here and wasn't just there for a transit. There is a fundamental disagreement about what happened here, China largely viewing the Taiwan Strait as its own waters, while the US has said and continues to say that it views it as a free and open Indo- Pacific and commercial traffic is allowed to go through there and so is the US military.",

For China, it appears this is essentially trying to establish that this is Chinese territory or areas with Chinese sovereignty. China claims much of the South China Sea as its own territory or its own sovereignty, the US and others not recognizing that under international law, and according to the US, it is part of what they're doing here to make sure that these airways, these waterways stay free and open.",

And so, China and Russia are wise in some ways to bide their time. What is interesting, though, is that you would have thought after the balloon incident, and after some of the conversations we've seen take place between US diplomats and the Chinese government, that they would have looked for an opportunity to begin to invite people back, try to get the Treasury secretary, the Commerce secretary, and ultimately Secretary of State Blinken back on the schedule.

On Saturday, eight GOP presidential hopefuls gathered in Des Moines, Iowa. The expanding GOP field is expected to get even more crowded this week, as three more candidates including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Trump-ally turned critic, Chris Christie are poised to officially join the race. Current frontrunner, former President Donald Trump chose to skip the Iowa gathering, giving his challengers an opportunity to make their pitches and take their shots at the former president. The Republican presidential race picks up more steam tonight, as CNN hosts a townhall with GOP candidate, Nikki Haley in Iowa. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Des Moines for us. Jeff, give us a recap of how events are playing out there this weekend?  JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Paula, the Republican candidates have been fanning out for several days, but they descended to the same room on the same stage on Saturday at Senator Joni Ernst Roast and Ride. Of course, she's the Iowa Republican senator who is playing a bit of host, if you will, for this growing field of Republican presidential candidates. These candidates were introducing themselves to voters they are sounding some themes that may work in campaigns, of course, they are joined in unison in their criticism of the Biden administration. Most of them held their punches when it came to try to define themselves or distinguish themselves with former President Donald Trump. But take a listen to former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley. She was urging Republican voters to look forward, not back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've got to start doing this in a way that we can win a general election. It's time for a new generational leader. We've got to leave the baggage and the negativity behind. We've got a country to save. Don't complain about what you get in a general if you don't play in this caucus, because it matters.

These Republican candidates, Paula, are all trying to walk a very fine line here into firing up voters and inspiring voters without turning off Trump supporters, but it is one of the central points here. Many Republican voters are looking for a new choice. Some of course are staying with the former president, but that's what the challenge and burden is for some of these candidates and Nikki Haley will be here at Grandview University, on the stage you see behind me here this evening with our own Jake Tapper taking questions from Iowa voters as this campaign intensifies as the summer begins -- Paula.",

Also, it threatened violators with a misdemeanor, repeat offenders with a felony, and the ban specifically included, \"male or female impersonators who perform in a way harmful to minors.\" This law was originally set to go into effect April 1st.

So to hear like such a negative connotation brought in towards drag, I wasn't extremely surprised, but at the same time, it was a little bit more of an alert that we were being compared to such sexually explicit references. You know, for me, obviously working on \"We're Here\" with HBO Max, we work in a sense where we really try to uplift communities that we go into and drag is such an expression of who we are and freedom of who we are.

And it just goes to show that through all politics, that there are people paying attention to all sides and the true fairness of it, but if we do have the Tennessee attorney general who want to appeal and move this to a higher court, it really just starts our process all over again and it can trump anything that has been decided so on and so forth.

Meantime Ukraine says, a two-year-old girl was killed and 22 others were injured in Russian strikes in the Dnipro region.CNN's Sam Kiley is in eastern Ukraine. Sam, what do we know about the shelling?  SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the shelling of Ukraine overnight last night into the small hours of this morning hit not only Dnipro where that two-year-old child was killed with an Iskander missile that hit yet another residential building injuring more than a dozen others, but very unusually, the Ukrainians also admitted that two airfields were hit. I think this is part of their ongoing campaign to point out to the international community, their continued vulnerability to airstrikes. They did say that they needed to get more air defenses, a need that grows with every day that the Russians soak up those air defenses with these very substantial missile attacks. They did manage to shoot down all of the missiles that were headed for Kyiv, but at the same time, there is this ongoing fight essentially inside Russia being conducted by Russian dissidents backed by Ukraine that is appearing to escalate. There is now the local authorities inside Russia, the local governor of Belgorod saying that they've had to evacuate some 4,000 or more people from a large number of villages close to the border areas that both sides have been posting social media pictures of the damage done as a result of the fighting and the exchange of artillery and mortar fire. And on top of that, the Russian dissidents back by Ukraine have been posting social media now, two separate posts saying that they've captured Russian prisoners, the first occasion they posted. They are offering to hand those Russian prisoners over to the local governor. He said he would come to the meeting to do so, but he didn't make the rendezvous. So they then posted a larger number of prisoners saying that they would then take them into custody and hand them on to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Now, we've got no independent whatsoever proof of the veracity that they do indeed have these prisoners, although there has been some confirmation that at least one of them is indeed a member of the Russian Armed Forces that's coming from Russian media. But what they are very quick on, very quick on the draw, indeed, is to get this sort of information out true or false onto social media.

But whenever you do that, like one of the things we do at Jumpstart Nature is we help people get informed -- JumpstartNature.com -- we help people get informed on how to act around animals and how to help them because when you get that close selfie, and then it attacks you, you know who's going to get punished? Well, you're going to get a little fine, but that bison might get euthanized, or that wild animal might get euthanized, like they don't get fair representation in court.So you really want to be mindful. You don't want the animal to die. Do you really need a selfie that bad of the animal? But I appreciate people that want to do that because it means they're interested in wildlife, and I don't want to discourage that. I just want to encourage you to be informed so the animal doesn't get punished for your ignorance.  REID: That's some great advice. Keep your distance. Leave it to the professionals.
