      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, while they may be discussing North Korea's space program, economic cooperation, humanitarian cooperation, really for Putin, there is one thing and one thing only. And that is ammunition. He needs ammunition for this war in Ukraine. He is clearly scouting for people that can provide it, and he's been witnessing Ukraine get plenty of support from its allies. If you look at the United States with their $1 billion package for Ukraine. As well as Secretary Blinken in town in Kyiv last week. All of this showing Ukraine is shoring up support as we head into the winter months in this counteroffensive.Russia needs ammunition, it is depleting its stocks and this war has potentially gone on a lot longer than they anticipated it would. And if you look at these southern frontlines, this progress has been marginal. Ukraine actually has been making some gains in the recent weeks as we've been discussing. And North Korea may fit the bill in terms of solving this issue for them. Because they have ammunition. They have industrial production capacity in North Korea to provide this ammunition. [04:35:00] And some of this will actually fit into Russian machinery directly. You can slot it in the front lines and it would work immediately. Now the issue is getting it there because North Korea, of course, is thousands of miles away from this Ukrainian frontline. Most of it would likely be transported in railways, on trains, probably Cold War era trains. So not necessarily that's sturdy, that good for transporting over such a long distance. But definitely this is what Putin is likely to be aiming for. This is what the U.S. officials have been warning about, for weeks, that there is potentially an arms deal on the table. And the concern really is where this takes the war next. Clearly, it's going to prolong the conflict if they get more weaponry. How long for, we don't know. And will it significantly change the course of the war? We don't know that either. And it's clear just at this stage that this is the tactic from Putin, renewing support, gaining more stocks that are desperately needed for his side of this conflict.",

Saying: House Republicans have been investigating the president for nine months and they've turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. His own GOP members have said so. He vowed to hold a vote to open impeachment. Now he flip-flopped because he doesn't have support. Extreme politics at its worst. The Biden campaign, also using the development to try to tie Speaker McCarthy more closely to former President Donald Trump, issuing this missive, saying: Kevin McCarthy cemented his role as the Trump campaign super surrogate by turning the House of Representatives into an arm of his presidential campaign. Now the White House and the Biden campaign are now on the defensive, but they're looking to shift into offense. The White House has been hiring dozens of staff members in recent years, preparing for the onslaught of investigations and yes, an impeachment inquiry after Republicans retook control of the House of Representatives. The expectation was that this would reach a fever pitch going into the 2024 election and a senior Biden aide says that the White House is going to be developing an impeachment playbook with Democratic allies on The Hill. We expect more in that space to come. Kayla Tausche CNN the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And what the Supreme Court was listening to was arguments about its own power, about what the Supreme Court does, and whether it should continue being able to strike down laws as it used to be able to do until this law was passed in July. Now what happened in July was that the Israeli Parliament, theKnesset, that is now controlled by Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition? They passed a law that strips the Supreme Court of its previous ability to nullify government actions that the Supreme Court deems unreasonable. This law was an amendment to a basic law. It's the closest thing Israel has to a constitution is this series of basic laws. Now the Supreme Court has never before nullified or struck down a basic law. But that is what they're potentially considering doing as a result of this hearing today. The government was represented actually by private counsel. And their argument was that the Supreme Court should actually have no authority in reviewing basic law and that should rest with the people and who and the people that they democratically elect to the Israeli Parliament. That the Supreme Court should have essentially no power to be able to change the basic laws if they are passed by the Israeli Parliament. The petitioners in this case are arguing that this law damages Israeli democracy and that it harms the authority of the judicial branch. Because keep in mind that in Israel there is really no other check on the executive or on the Parliament, which are run by the same party usually, except for the Supreme Court. It is interesting to hear the questions that some of these judges posed to the attorneys. They were asking the attorneys who were representing the government. OK, so fine, if all of this power should rest with the people, then what is the check on the power if, let's say, the government decides that there should be no elections for 10 years, for 20 years, what will be the check on what is reasonable or unreasonable? Who will be able to check that on them? And the government -- a lawyer for the government, said that this, that the law does not undermine democracy. And this response is really telling from one of the judges. They said democracy dies in a series of small steps. And I think that will be one of the main quotes that will be taken away up from this hearing. Now, although this hearing was a marathon hearing, that doesn't mean necessarily that a decision will come quickly. The Supreme Court judges have some time before they need to make that decision. That's expected to come before the deadline that is in mid-January. But there is still a looming, a very big looming question. That is whether the Netanyahu government would even abide by a Supreme Court ruling that that strips this law away, that nullifies this law. Because so far, they have yet to commit to even adhering to a Supreme Court ruling that nullifies this law. Hadas Gold, CNN, Jerusalem. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
