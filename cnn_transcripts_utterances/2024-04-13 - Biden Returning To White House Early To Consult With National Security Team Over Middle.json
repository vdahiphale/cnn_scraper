We're going to start with breaking news.President Biden is returning to the White House from Delaware a day early to consult with his national security team about the intensifying situation in the Middle East. Now, a meeting that will include Secretary of State Antony Blinken. And sources say the U.S. expects Iran to carry out a direct attack on Israel in the coming days in retaliation for the killing of senior Iranian military officials in Syria last week. Also new today, Iranian authorities have seized a container ship near the Strait of Hormuz. Now, the ship, which Tehran links to Israel, has been directed toward Iran now. And overnight, Israel and Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah exchanged attacks across the border with southern Lebanon. CNN's Kevin Liptak is at the White House. Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem. Kevin, we're also learning that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is speaking with the Israeli Defense Minister today. What -- what do we know about that conversation and about what's expected to happen at the White House with the President?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, those two men discussing what the Pentagon is calling urgent regional threats. Secretary Austin reiterating steadfast American support for Israel amid these threats of an Iranian counterattack potentially in Israel. And this is just the latest sign and the clearest indication that we have to date, that U.S. officials do believe that this attack could be imminent.The decision by President Biden to return to the White House only lending to the sense that this attack could happen very soon. And we did hear from President Biden yesterday saying that he believed this attack could occur sooner rather than later. Now, how this attack unfolds exactly remains to be seen, where it occurs, when it occurs. But we can report that American officials have detected movement of military assets in Iran, including drones and cruise missiles. This could mean any number of things. It could be an attempt at deterrence. It could also mean that Iran is preparing for a strike from Iranian soil, which would be a watershed moment in this conflict that hasn't happened yet. And it could lead to a greater escalation of this war, potentially dragging the United States closer into direct conflict with Iran. Now, what we have heard from American officials is that they are preparing contingencies atop General Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, has been in Israel over the last several days discussing contingency plans with his counterparts. In this phone call that Secretary Austin held today, he said that Israel could count on full U.S. support to defend Israel against any attacks by Iran and its regional proxies. Now, one thing American officials have been clear is that they do not expect Iran to attack U.S. forces in the region. But nonetheless, this does place the U.S. in a precarious position. Certainly, the U.S. is Israel's top defender, top ally. But it does come at a moment of growing tensions between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Now, what we have heard directly from the President over the last several days is that the U.S. is steadfast in its support and that it will continue to defend Israel against Iran should this attack happen.",

It's careful calculations, normally to respond in like and in kind. An eye-for-an-eye type attack would be to hit an Israeli diplomatic facility somewhere in the world. And that's why Israeli diplomats have been told to be on high alert ever since the strike on Iranian Quds Force commanders at an Iranian diplomatic facility in Syria that I have to mention Israel hasn't officially acknowledged.",

You don't want to be on the beach while bombs are falling anywhere. That said, I do think that Tehran is in some ways enjoying watching the U.S., Israelis, the Israeli public, all on high alert over what it might do. That demonstrates a certain amount of power. But Iran knows that even if it hits military facilities, not civilianareas inside Israel, say naval ships in Haifa or the Israeli Pentagon, which is in the center of Tel Aviv, it still risks hitting civilian areas and it risks escalation, which wouldn't be in keeping with past practice. So I hope that the U.S. is red teaming, thinking of the worst possibilities. But like many in the region and here, I'm hoping that's not what comes to pass.",

But anyway, look, we got a lot of news to get to, so let's get serious here.In just two days, former President Donald Trump returns to court and the stakes couldn't be higher. Jury selection is set to begin on Monday in his new New York hush money trial. Trump's indictment stems from his alleged role in a scheme to silence salacious details about alleged affairs with adult film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy Model Karen McDougal before the 2016 election. Now, Trump has denied all of that. But it's an unprecedented trial, the first time a former president has ever faced criminal prosecution, and with it, unprecedented security. The NYPD, Secret Service and the New York Court System are taking multilayered steps to ensure all parties stay safe. CNN's Mark Morales is standing outside the courthouse where Trump is set to appear on Monday. Mark, look, the courthouse knows how to handle high-profile witnesses and defendants here. How are police, though, preparing for this, and how different is it when you're dealing with a former president?",

But there's a key difference now from all those other times. Now, he's the presumptive Republican nominee, and because of that, law enforcement officials tell me that it does two things. It not only raises the stakes, but it also raises the threat level, and you're going to see this, what they're calling a robust security package, different from last time in that there's going to be more of some things that we're always seeing when we imagine security. That's boots on the ground, so we'll see a lot more officers.You'll see barricades. You'll see a lot of the high-tech electronic equipment that law enforcement is known for, like drones, like cameras in the sky. You'll see a lot of this happening, but what you'll also see, or what you'll also understand is happening at the same time is the intelligence arm of these -- of these branches of law enforcement. Their job is to look through and to find out if there are any potential threats and to dig into those threats to see if they are exactly things that they should be worried about, and that could be anything from lone wolf potential attacks or lone wolf threats that are being made online to even protests or disturbances, things of that nature. So all this is going to be happening at the same time, and law enforcement themselves acknowledge that this is going to be a big challenge. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In other words, some jurors are going to feel like this is just overwhelming. They're going to feel like it's going to threaten themselves. They're going to be nervous about it. So there's a whole process of sort of self-evaluation of this even before you get down to a pool where jurors are going to be filling out questionnaires. And then once the jurors fill out some questionnaires, then the parties do have a time to actually discuss it with them. Now, that moves into a phase we call the jury selection or the voir dire phase where the parties have the ability to talk to the jurors themselves. They will have their questionnaires. They may have done some social media searches to look into the backgrounds of some of these jurors, you know, just obviously publicly available information. And then they get to ask those questions, those core questions about really how do you feel about Donald Trump and talking to jurors about whether they feel they can actually be a fair and impartial juror in a case like this where obviously everybody has very strong opinions of this.",

But jury selection is kind of an art and a science in terms of how you look at the jurors themselves.And there is a process by which you're really trying to study who are the people, what are the decision-making process. He is correct that in Manhattan, Manhattanites have a very long experience with Donald Trump, even beyond what most of us in the public do, having him as a president. So there's a lot that goes into discussing what their knowledge is of him, what their experiences and what their opinions are. But that being said, a pretty remarkable thing happens when jurors get together in deliberations and a diverse group gets together. They do manage to focus on the evidence. And Donald Trump, he actually made a change of venue motion to say it should be moved out of Manhattan. He found that 60% thought he was guilty. But quite frankly, I've done a lot of high-profile cases, and 60% is actually not that bad for a lot of high-profile defendants. In Casey Anthony's case, 80 to 90% thought she was guilty, and yet she was acquitted in that case. So it's an interesting process.",

You're really trying to identify the people you want to get rid of and hopefully end up with those people that you do want and are going to be receptive to your case. So it's kind of carving away, essentially, those people that you hopefully are going to be negative towards your case.So it's to a certain extent, jury selection is a kind of an exercise in masochism where you want jurors to talk about their biases and their negative impressions so that you can then make a cause challenge and preemptory strike. The profile here is both sides are looking for high-risk jurors. In other words, obviously, jurors who have an agenda one way or the other. I want to convict Trump because I think our democracy is endangered or I think Joe Biden is terrible and Trump needs to save our democracy. So those people who come with agenda, both sides are going to be looking for. I think President Trump is going to be looking for very individualistic, highly not following the crowd, really opinionated, somebody who's going to maybe hang this jury. Because let's face it, he just needs one or two people to hang the jury and then he gets to push this beyond where the election is. So that's them. Obviously, the prosecution is looking for people who can get along and come to a unanimous verdict themselves and also can get past the difficult thing of, is hush money actually fraud on the public?

Memphis Mayor Paul Young is speaking for many when he says that enough is enough. According to Memphis police, the shooting happened at about two in themorning on Friday. Interim Police Chief C.J. Davis said that it all started with a report of a suspicious vehicle they believe to be stolen. Davis said that as officers were approaching the vehicle, they were fired upon by the two suspects and the officers then returned fire. The suspects, age 18 and 17, drove off but were then arrested less than a mile away. Five people in total were struck, including three officers and the two teenage suspects who fled in the car. The fallen officer was identified as 26-year-old Joseph McKinney, who joined the force in 2020. The second officer was taken to the hospital but has been upgraded to non-critical condition. And the third one was treated at the scene and is now in stable condition. The teenager who was killed was identified by police as 18-year-old Jaylen Lobley, who, according to police, had been arrested last month by MPD in a stolen vehicle with a modified semi-automatic weapon with a Glock switch attached, which is illegal. Interim Police Chief Davis said the Glock switch converted the weapon to a fully automatic machine gun. At that time, Lobley was also charged for two stolen vehicles and having a programming device commonly used to steal cars. Davis added that Lobley had then been released after that arrest without bond, a fact already raising many questions, Omar, in the law enforcement community and beyond.

Their concern comes amid several outbreaks across the U.S. By the end of March, more cases were reported in 2024 than there were in all of last year.Now, the highly contagious disease can cause serious health problems, even death, especially for unvaccinated children. I want to discuss this more with my next guest, Dr. Sujatha Reddy. Now, Dr. Reddy, measles was eliminated in the U.S. over two decades ago. Why are we still talking about it now? How worried should we be? DR. SUJATHA REDDY, OBSTETRICIAN- GYNECOLOGIST: Yeah, great question, Omar. So what's happening is our status of being eliminated as far as measles is in jeopardy because we're seeing so many cases. And a lot of that has to do with vaccination rates dropping. The aim for vaccination rates for children is about 95%, and last year it fell to 93. So as we have more unvaccinated people, we're at risk for having more outbreaks, and thereby our elimination status is in jeopardy. Measles may be something that pediatricians and doctors in the country start seeing more commonly if we're not careful.",

The majority of people who got measles this quarter were traveling or they were from abroad, and almost 90% of them either had no vaccine or had inadequate vaccine, meaning they didn't get the complete series.So you're right, elimination means -- doesn't mean that you'll never see a case, but it means you'll see very few, and we're seeing more than we expect to see or more than we've seen in years past when we've had adequate vaccination. So really the take-home point is we really need to get people to step up and really encourage vaccination to be at the rates that we need it to be to keep measles a thing of the past.",

I think there are concerns, and a lot of them were ill- founded about vaccinations in general, but I think the whole COVID vaccine process brought some of these things to light.And, you know, we live in a country of free choice, so people are going to be entitled to their opinion, obviously, but what happened with measles, too, dates back several, a couple of decades ago where we had that whole concern of the MMR vaccine, which is the measles vaccine, leading to autism. While that study was proven, you know -- disproven, it was not scientifically sound, that fear has been in parents. And I think the COVID vaccine kind of brought that back to the surface, it kind of resurfaced after that. So you're exactly right, I think vaccines in general became much more talked about, and I think there's, in some people's mind, a lot of fear and doubt about vaccines in general, and that may be spilling over into vaccines for children, but measles, and mumps, and rubella, the MMR, has been around for decades. And that is why we can say measles is eliminated in the U.S., but again, with the vaccination rates dropping, that may not be the case down the road.",
