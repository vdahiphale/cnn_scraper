We spoke with one survivor.I want to talk to you about the death toll because it is officially 36 at this point in time, but as we've been talking to people from the Lahaina area, they're telling us, you know, they have to go to certain little areas just to be able to text family or just to be able to call. And one survivor told us that he believes there are still hundreds that are missing. How concerned are you that the death toll is going to rise and maybe considerably?",

You know, all these things just happened in the last few days, as of yesterday morning, the lives lost was six, and then by yesterday afternoon, late into the evening, it was confirmed 36. Search and rescue teams are still on the it ground looking for individuals that they can help. But at the same time, we are also getting calls from individuals. In fact, we have gotten calls nationally, family members looking for individuals that they cannot connect. And the fact that we have Coast Guard helping, we have National Guard helping, we're just so thankful for the federal support.This morning the president signed a national declaration signifying that this is a disaster area, and with that we will get much more federal support. But clearly, as you recognize, the cell service is down, internet is down, because all the infrastructure is burnt down. And because of that, people are having a hard time making calls and they need to get to a satellite station or we need to actually go and do -- take a satellite phone from places to places just to connect people. And this is just so difficult and so tragic. And you know, we have -- we're sending individuals to help from other islands. We're deploying people, so this is just --",

They were moved from Tehran's notorious Evin Prison today and the fifth American who also has not been publicly identified was also under house arrest.We're joined now by someone who knows what it is like to be wrongfully detained at that very prison. Jason Rezaian, who was Tehran bureau chief when he was detained. He's now a columnist for the \"Washington Post,\" he was held there for a year and a half between 2014 and 2016. Jason, thank you so much for joining us. What is your reaction to this news? JASON REZAIAN, WRONGFULLY IMPRISONED IN IRAN FOR 544 DAYS: Well, I'm cautiously optimistic, Brianna. This is a day these families have been waiting for, for a very long time. But as you indicated in the introduction there's still a long way to go. They are not in the Evin Prison. And any day free from that hell hole is a good thing. But you know, they are far from completely free. And they won't be free until they've left Iranian air space. And I know all too well from my own experience that, you know, the last hours, the last days, you know, there can be complications in these cases. So I'm hopeful. At the same time, you know, the tension and the anxiety for these five Americans and their families is going to remain high until they're all out of Iranian air space.",

And that, you know, Korea had every right to send them back to Iran early. Other countries who have had similar sanctionable accounts in their countries have given, you know, direct access to Iran to those funds. So you know, it's not a gift to Tehran or, you know, a payment from the U.S. government.But you know, aside from that, you know, the question that folks keep asking me, you know, is the merits and the wisdom of doing these kinds of deals. And the reality, Alex, is that if you don't do a deal, you're leaving Americans behind. And unfortunately, this is a phenomenon that is affecting American citizens, citizens of many of our allied countries on an increasing level, and I'm hopeful that Biden administration is doing more to cultivate deterrence to the horrible practice of taking hostages.",

I think I remember having that conversation with you about four years ago now, Brianna, and the experience of being in Evin, you know, it's more than seven years since I was released, it's still with me every day. And during that time that I was there, you do whatever you can to sort of maintain a sense of basic humanity, right, and agency. All choice is stripped from you, all opportunities to connect with the outside world are taken away from you. All of your rights are denied during that time.So to come out of that is, you know, on the one hand very exhilarating, but at the same time, quite confusing and jarring. And these Americans have a long road ahead of them. And as I said, you know, they aren't free yet. Once they are, there'll be a lot of work to be done, you know, individually and I hope that they all are able to recover from what is really a kind of abuse of power that very few people can fully understand.",

      "sentences": "Well, I would say a couple of things. Take it slow. As someone who has been on the other side of this and now reports on these cases, I never ask for an interview of a hostage until they make it clear that they're ready to talk. Because you don't really know what your experience means to you until you have some distance from it.And also, just, you know, take your time, be deliberate. Make the choice to be with your family as much as possible and gravitate towards people who make you feel good and avoid things that don't make you feel good. It sounds really simple, but, you know, when you come back to a sort of tornado of requests and information and access to information that has been denied to you for so long, it's not something that anybody is really naturally equipped to deal with. So the learning curve is steep, and it takes time, and I urge them to give themselves that time. But again, we're not there yet. KEILAR: Yes. Look, we're hoping that is advice that they are going to be able to take very soon, and we are holding our breath as we wait to see what happens. It's not over until they're out of Iranian air space as you said. Jason Rezaian, thank you so, so much for being with us.",

But the one where they most frequently said there were critical shortages are for chemotherapy drugs. 57 percent of the health pharmacists who responded in the survey said that chemotherapy drugs were at a critical level in terms of the shortage. Now that means they had to ration care or even delay care cancel or cancel treatment altogether with these medicines.We also saw them saying critical levels were seeing with other drugs like corticosteroids or oral liquids like of drugs like amoxicillin. Any parent of young children, of course, is very familiar for that one for things like ear infections -- it's bad not to be able to access that. And this really affects patient care. 85 percent of these respondents said they had to ration. 42 percent said delaying or canceling care -- Brianna.",
