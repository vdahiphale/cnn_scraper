Also tonight, new details on the \"death note\" left behind by the Walmart gunman, including his claim that people working at the store were mocking him. This, as police reveal the handgun was purchased the same day that he opened fire. And at the World Cup, the American underdogs played to a dramatic draw against England. Now Team USA is facing a must-win matchup. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Alex Marquardt. And you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to our top story, the growing hardship in Ukraine amid an onslaught of Russian attacks against the Ukrainian power grid. Authorities are racing to repair critical systems as winter quickly closes in. Our senior international correspondent, Sam Kiley, is on the ground in Zaporizhzhia.

In fact, the vast majority got shot down. But this, of course, is the seventh wave of these attacks. Every time they occur, they knock out a bit more of it and then it gets rebuilt. So by tomorrow, the government is saying that they expect to have the country back up and running, not by any means perfectly, but with scheduled blackouts rather than sudden Russian-induced blackouts. This is coming at a time when even cities like Kherson are expected to be connected to the national grid. That's a town that was cut off from the rest of the country deliberately by the Russians and had its own energy structures, destroyed as the Russians retreated. The problem for Ukraine is this is a steady process of degradation that the Russians are carrying out against the civilian infrastructure here as part of its ongoing campaign. What the NATO secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg called the weaponization of winter. Nothing new for the Russians to weaponize winter. They've been doing it every time they've been invaded. It's a natural part of the rhythm of war, if you like. But this is a direct attack on civilians and being treated by Russia's critics as something approaching a war crime. Because as the weather gets colder, as winter really deepens, and it's only just beginning to bite now, it's going to get an awful lot colder here. Things are going to get very, very difficult, indeed, for the Ukrainians if these attacks continue -- Alex?",

So that left a bit of a sour feeling. Nevertheless, for the Kremlin, an extremely important event. This has been played on Russian TV the entire evening. And there were some interesting other things that Vladimir Putin said as well, Alex, a view into the mind-set that he has right now. One of the main things he said was Russia used to live by others' rules but the events of today are a path to some internal purging and reinvention, as he put it. So he's essentially saying through this conflict Russia is reinventing itself. Obviously a very expansionist point of view. He also went on to say he believed the annexation of Donbass should have happened a long time ago.

Let's discuss this with CNN military analyst, \"Spider\" Marks, and the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor. Gentlemen, thank you for joining me this evening. General, I want to start with you. In most wars, it would be very normal for a commander-in-chief to speak with families who have lost loved ones on the battlefield. Putin doesn't call this a war, he calls it a Special Operation, now in its tenth month. Does this look like damage control to you? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, clearly, it does. And my assessment is that what Putin does as a matter of routine, as he speaks domestically, the international audience, the global international audience that looks at Putin, sees him for what he is, which is criminal behavior, international pariah. And frankly, on a personal level, I feel very sorry for these women that are essentially being played for suckers. This is an optic that he wants to have brought forward. Again, these are hand-picked ladies. I'm assuming they are legitimate mothers of soldiers. I don't know that this does anything other than bolster his internal -- his domestic support, which, frankly, I don't see that eroding, even though he's mobilized 300,000 and we've seen the departure of hundreds of thousands that have gone across the border. But that's the crust, it's the elitist crust of who we are seeing responding to Putin. I think he is going to continue to march and will continue to conduct this operation, irrespective of what this particular discussion played out for him.",

And social media has really been keeping this alive in terms of a hashtag and celebrities and activists, have all been pushing to get answers.We know the FBI is involved but Mexican authorities have issued that arrest warrant but we don't know which one of the friends or one of the people who was there they're looking for. There was six people who traveled to the Mexican destination. Apparently, they were all college friends. There's a video that has surfaced online that we have gotten confirmation from her father that it's her being hit over and over again. Now, we haven't been able to get that video cleared to be on air just yet. But it's a brutal video to watch. You understand why this family had so many questions. Mexican authorities are calling this a direct attack. And they believe that's why they're moving forward. But listen to her mother talk about the idea of what the friends initially called and told them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So now the conversation is about, was the murder scene looked at thoroughly, what investigators were doing, what's the next steps here. Obviously, with an extradition hearing that has to happen, will more friends have to face charges in this? Alex, because obviously, you have a family in Charlotte who has so many questions right now, not a lot of answers. Especially when you know the video is online and so many people want to know, how could friends go someplace and, on the first day, something like this happens.

China has been reporting record-high COVID case numbers, the highest since the start of the pandemic, reaching more than 30,000 cases a day.We're seeing the country resort to harsh lockdowns across the country. People are being sealed in for days, weeks, even months. But increasingly, it is the restrictions, not COVID itself, that's being blamed for heartbreaking deaths we're seeing that are fueling nationwide outrage. Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capitol of China's Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine injured in a fire at an apartment building. Most parts of Xinjiang had been in lockdown for more than 100 days. Widely circulating videos, which have now been censored in China -- we're showing some of them now -- show that COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. Video shows fire trucks unable to get close because the compound entrance is partially blocked with fences, tents, metal barriers that are frequently used as part of COVID measures. You can see in the video that smoke and flames are coming from a high floor of the building but the water actually failing to reach the fire. What adds to this tragedy is that, you think about those who died in the fire, they likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building, if not entirely. This situation has really struck a chord with the public because we've been seeing scenes of tragedy and suffering play out again and again during these three years of zero-COVID in China. Countless stories of people struggling to get enough food, essentials and emergency help in those lockdowns.",

I'm still allowed to walk out of my apartment right now, but there's really nowhere to go. If I do want to enter one of the few places that are still open, take a taxicab, I've got to line up for a COVID test because you've got to show a 48-hour COVID test to participate in any public activities. There's a lot of fear and anxiety because, if your building isn't already sealed off, it almost feels like it's only a matter of time. People are trying to stock up on goods. There has been some panic buying. And remember, in China, if you get COVID, it's not like in other parts of the world. You become a pariah because you get sent to a mass quarantine facility. All of your close contacts get sent to a mass quarantine facility. Sometimes that can mean an entire building. Then your whole community or neighborhood very likely goes into lockdown. So there's fear and anxiety about getting COVID, not so much for everybody about getting the virus itself, but the repercussions if you do.",

Don, this was a tie, but how do you think the U.S. fared against England? DON RIDDELL, CNN HOST, \"WORLD SPORT\": You know, I think it might be one of those drawn games that feels like a win, maybe even a moral victory, at the very least, for the United States. It was a really good performance by the Americans. The English team, one of the favorites to go away in this tournament. They put six goals past Iran in their opening game. So I think they acquitted themselves very well, the American side. They handled England very well. And they gave them a run for their money at times. We're going to show you some of the highlights from this game. The Americans had some really, really good chances in the first half. Western McKinney, a man who's known for his love of Harry Potter, he had a chance. Unfortunately, his finish wasn't as magical as it could've been. But arguably the state's most famous player, Pusilic, had a terrific shot there against the crossfire. He ended up with the Man of the Match Award at the end. England had their chances too, though. This is Mason Mount drawing a good save out of the American goalie. Matt Turner and England's captain, Harry Kane, had a chance right at the end. He hit it just wide from a free kick. So honors even in the end. I think it's a moral victory for the United States. They've now got two points from their first two games. In some ways, it didn't matter whether they won or whether they drew or lost this game. Because they still go to that final match on Tuesday against Iran, knowing that they have to win. But that's good. Destiny is in their own hands. The trouble is Iran looked quite good in their game against Wales today. So we'll see how it plays out for the Americans. But I think, going up against one of the tournaments favorites and doing so well today was a good performance by the states.",
