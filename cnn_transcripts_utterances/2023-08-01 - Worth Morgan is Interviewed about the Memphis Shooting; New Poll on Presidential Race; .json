When they stopped him, they say he got out with a gun in his hand. Authorities say an officer then shot the suspect, critically wounding him.

And Governor Bill Lee has called a special session of the Tennessee legislature in three weeks, August 21st, to discuss red flag laws, they're called in some states. What they're going to try to introduce here in Tennessee is extreme risk protection orders, which are very similar, which simply says that if an individual has demonstrated that they are a risk -- they're going to use a gun and that they are a risk to the community, that evidence needs to be presented in front of a judge. And then that judge can conditionally remove the gun from the individual until they get the help that they need.And the name of this - of the shooter, as you say, has not been released publicly, but it's known to those in the community. The picture has been. And I went on their social media last night and I can - you know, I can tell you that they were very open -- the gunman was, just in the last week, about their struggles with mental health. And that they were, you know, posting about their - their high school experience, that is easy for them to become triggered. And then even three days ago they were posting about a gun store nearby Memphis and their interaction with it. So, there were clearly signs. The friends and the family are on the front lines when dealing with people that are potentially violent with mental health. The government needs to come alongside the friends and family and give them a system to be able to, you know, step up, raise their hand and say, hey, this person may be a threat to themselves or others. We need to intervene and have the government intervene. And red flag laws or extreme risk protection orders allow for that system to be put in place for these people to get help and to protect the community.",

I think that is something that people would generally agree on. And more of the disagreement, what needs to be worked out in legislation is, how does the government intervene? What is that mechanism in order to remove the gun and what is the path that individual, if they get help, in order to receive their Second Amendment right back? That's the debate.
