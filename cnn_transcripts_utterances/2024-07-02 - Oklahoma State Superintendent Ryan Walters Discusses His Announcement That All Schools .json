You can't talk about our rights coming from God, as Thomas Jeffersonreferenced. You can't talk about Abraham Lincoln talking about being on Gods side and what he does and that inspires him. You can't talk about the civil rights movement. Martin Luther King Jr, who routinely referenced examples from the Bible, including from a letter from a Birmingham jail, to say the reason I'm doing the things I'm doing is because of the tenants taught to me by the Bible. So it's essential that our kids understand our history. And we're going to put it back in. And the left is going to continue to try to censor our history.

The Bible is a book that was referenced throughout American history.We have academic standards that tell are teachers that you are to talk about the Bible in reference to the Mayflower Compact. Let her do \"From a Birmingham Jail,\" the Declaration of Independence. So these are all very clear -- it's very clear from primary sources that these individuals are referencing history. In our history, they referenced the Bible. So look, when it's historically accurate, we're absolutely going to include that. I mean, think about how absurd it would be to teach about the Pilgrims if you don't mention their intention for moving to the New World. It's crucial. And we're not going to allow the radical left to continue to push a false history on our kids that said that faith played no role. Well, just read the history. It's clearly there.",

But I want to go back to this in terms of for the teachers here. Because in one case, you took a teaching certificate away from a teacher for what that teacher taught in class. You said it was pornographic material and it was unacceptable. In this case, you're telling teachers, hey, teach the Bible. How's a teacher to know what to teach, how to teach it? How will you monitor that? What if a teacher says, look, I'm a math teacher, I'm not a theologian. I'm a Muslim. Teaching this is against my most closely held beliefs.

So you continue to put the Bible on the same moral plain as gender, queer and flame or -- and pornography. It's not. It is the best-selling book in American history. There has been no more widespread book that's been read in American history more than the Bible. If you don't have that in a classroom, in a history course, in a literature course, you are not teaching the students the story of America. So it has to be included.

Supreme Court precedent actually is against what you're pushing for now.In fact, in 1980, there was a Supreme Court case saying that it's unconstitutional to, for example, put the Ten Commandments in the classroom. The First Amendment has the Establishment Clause saying Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free -- prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech. And it goes on, as you know. So what do you say to that? It's not that these are -- this is just the separation of church and state. It's not an atheist center. It's -- it's that. And that what you're doing, the critics have come out against you and said, look, you're trying to impose your conservative agenda on schools in Oklahoma.

This is not telling them that they have to be of a certain faith. Not at all. It is teaching our history in an inaccurate way. The Bible would'vebeen found in every schoolhouse until the 1960s because of the prominence of it in American culture and American history. We are going to bring the Bible back in every classroom here in the united -- here in Oklahoma, and every state should follow. But I'm also going to say this. President Trump has actually put Originalists on the Supreme Court. So now if this goes for it and we get sued on this and it goes the Supreme Court, President Trump has led the way for the Supreme Court to actually look back at what the Constitution says, not what a bunch of liberal judges have said that it says. And we feel very confident we'll win the day. Thanks to President Trump's appointees on the Supreme Court, we can absolutely put the Bible back in school.",

He had a hoarse voice. You all heard it. That's why you reached out. But I will say this, and the president said this over the past couple of days, certainly right after the debate, he knows how to do the job. And he knows how to do the job. Not because he says it. Because his record proofs it. Because for three-and-a-half years, almost four years, the record -- the president's record has been unprecedented, delivering for the American people. Another thing that he said that I would add is he -- (COMMERCIAL BREAK) JEAN-PIERRE: Speaker Pelosi, who's very close to the president, said it is not about performance in terms of a debate. It's about performance in a presidency. And this is a president, you've heard me say this. We've talked about this. He's been able to give us an economic recovery, the strongest economic recovery in modern history. Let's not forget, during the midterms of 2020, many people, many of you all, some of you in this room, said that it was going to be a red wave and that didn't happen. He defeated Big Pharma. We have seen a historic low in crime in more than -- down to a 50-year low. And then you had Representative Clyburn said the president has done a great job leading for the last three the half years. The best predictor of future behavior is past performance. This is from Clyburn. And when you look at the record of President Biden versus former President Trump, you see President Biden, who has delivered the strongest recovery in modern history, versus the previous administration whose plans hurts the middle class. And President Biden, who is committed to protecting our fundamental freedoms versus the former -- the former president, the previous administration, doing everything that they could, and they did, to overturn Roe v. Wade. And they are responding ansible for that. And those are -- that's coming from two people who are not just leaders in Congress, but also close to the president.",

So I guess I'm wondering if there's been any consideration given to like releasing a more robust set of medical records or something to show his mental acuity. JEAN-PIERRE: So I will say this. Look, and again, I get the question. It is a fair question to ask. We're not taking that away. And that's why the president certainly has spoken to this. As it relates to his medical records, we have been transparent. We have released thorough reports from his medical team every year since he's been in office. That is something that we have been pretty consistent about.

His team, who has said, the medical team said it is not warranted in this case. We have put forward a thorough, transparent annual report on his health. So they have said that is not warranted. It is not necessary. Again, we understand. We understand. We're not taking away from what you all saw and what the American people saw. We understand. It was a bad night.
