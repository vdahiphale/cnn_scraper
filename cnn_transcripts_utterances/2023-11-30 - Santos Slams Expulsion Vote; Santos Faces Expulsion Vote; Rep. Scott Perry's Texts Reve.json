The chair of the committee putting out a motion to expel, just introducing it and not calling its privilege, was designed to force me to resign. The reality of it is, it's all theater. It's theater for the cameras. It's theater for the microphones. It's theater for the American people, at the expense of the American people, because no real work's getting done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Santos is also facing 23 federal charges, including wire fraud, lying to the FEC and House of Representatives, identity theft, device fraud, money laundering and stealing public funds. If Santos is expelled tomorrow, he would be the first lawmaker to face that punishment in over two decades.CNN's Lauren Fox is joining us now from Capitol Hill.

He also made clear that this was not how he saw his year going. Here's how he started out his press conference.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY): This is not how at least I thought this year would go. I don't think this is how most people in the media would think this year would go. And it's just an unfortunate circumstance that I had to sit here and watch the American people waste -- Congress waste the American people's time over and over again on something that is the power of the people, not the power of Congress.

      "sentences": "Well, good morning to you, John.Yes, things could potentially move very quickly if Santos is expelled. By the House rules, the clerk of the House of Representatives would immediately notify the state and then it's really up to New York Governor Kathy Hochul. It's up to her to declare formally a special election. And per New York law, she has to do this within ten days of that seat becoming vacant. And she's already said earlier this month that she would be very happy to call for a special election here. Now, per New York law, that special election would then have to happen 70 to 80 days after she calls for it. So, we're looking here potentially at a special election, within just a few months of him potentially being expelled from Congress. And the New York county party leaders, they would put forth their nominees for each party, unlike a traditional primary election, and then that election would be held potentially in a few months. And certainly Democrats here are really eyeing this seat if he becomes expelled to flip that seat back to Democrats' hands. You know, as Congress moves past Santos, though, of course, his troubles are still there for him. He is, as Sara said in the introduction, facing a slew of charges, from conspiracy, wire fraud, false statements, falsification of records, aggravated ID theft, credit card fraud, among many. Trial going in September 2024. Of course, his legal troubles if he were to leave Congress only starting for him. John.",

Only five House members have been expelled and kicked out in more than two centuries. And three of those happened during the Civil War. John Clark, John Reid, and Henry Burnett were kicked out for siding against the union and fighting for the confederacy.Only two House members have been expelled since then in modern times. Both were convicted of crimes. Pennsylvania Democrat Michael Myers in 1980 after FBI agents caught him taking a $50,000 bribe, and Jim Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio who was expelled in 2002 after being convicted of ten felonies, including bribery, fraud and tax evasion. If Santos is expelled this week, he would be the first House member in modern times to be kicked out without being convicted of a crime. Something that he himself mentioned. Santos is facing, though, 23 federal charges, including fraud and identity theft. He has pleaded not guilty and is set to go to trial next year.",

      "sentences": "John, Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with a number of senior Israeli officials today, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We know from a State Department spokesperson that Netanyahu and Blinken discussed three big things. They talked about, of course the need to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, the need to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, and I think perhaps most delicately the need to try to limit civilian casualties once hostilities do resume in Gaza as they are expected to do.The Biden administration has really had to walk this very fine line in between validating Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas while simultaneously trying to limit the number of civilian casualties as divisions have emerged, even within Biden's own White House over the civilian death toll as the result -- that has come as a result of the punishing air campaign launched by Israel in the first phase of the war. Our colleagues and I were able to report last night that senior Biden administration officials up and down the line have been discussing with Israel how exactly to do that, how to try to do more to protect civilian life once fighting resumes in the south as it is expected do. Again, the south being where so many civilians fled from the northern part of the strip during the first phase of the war. I think there's a very keen understanding here that this truce that has taken place over the past six days, now been extended twice, is not likely to last forever. So, our colleagues and I have reported now at this point that administration officials have been - have been urging Israel to avoid a resumption of the kind of air campaign, the kind of intensive airstrike campaign that characterized the first phase of the war. Also discussing the need to have areas in the south that are very clearly understood to be safe places for civilians. And so I think that you can expect, John, that this kind of thing would have been a key part of the discussions that Blinken was having today in the region.",

Multiple sources tell CNN one option is moving citizens from the south back to the north, which is pretty much destroyed, once the military operations there end. But that problem with that, of course, is it's crumbled. There's up to 50 percent of all structures in northern Gaza have been damaged. You can see the pictures there. Not a place that you want to go back to.I'm joined now by CNN national security analyst and former deputy director of national intelligence, Beth Sanner. Thank you so much for joining us. So many things to get to here. First of all, we are hearing Netanyahu double down on the fact that he says we are going to continue to go after Hamas and try to eliminate Hamas. The U.S., obviously, pressing, saying, look, the civilian casualties are too high, we need you do not do what you did in northern Gaza. I mean is this even possible at this point with all of the people that have fled, a million people fleeing from one side to the other, in such a densely populated place?",

A poll that was just done in Israel last week said only 39 percent of Israelis think that Israel should be, you know, working with, negotiating with the United States in how this goes forward. So, a majority says not. And I think that the pressure that is going on inside Israel for the government to proceed with this is only ratcheting up because look at the attack in Jerusalem today that Hamas claimed that took three Israeli lives. And so that pressure is really on eliminating Hamas and going back at this, even though people want hostages to be released at the same time. And that is going to be much more important, as well as the right wing in the Netanyahu government that's threatening to withdraw if they don't resume and resume hard.",

Plus, Hamas that was very unpopular, by all accounts, before October 7th, has only actually increased in popularity, which is, you know, kind of mind-blowing, but that is how a lot of Palestinians are thinking about it, both in the Gaza Strip and also the West Bank. And so the idea of eliminating Hamas as an idea is very difficult.
