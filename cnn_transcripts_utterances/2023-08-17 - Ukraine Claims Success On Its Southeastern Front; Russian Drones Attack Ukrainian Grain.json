Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says this is the seventh Russian attack on a port since that Green Deal fell apart. U.S. condemned Moscow for striking at the world's food supply. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): This Russian strike is a blow to world food prices, a blow to social and political stability in Africa and in Asia. Basic things that provide a normal life to every society, it is food on the table in households. No other terrorist of the world apart from Russia has ever so openly and intentionally targeted the security of so many nations at once. VEDANT PATEL, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: It is unacceptable, Putin simply does not care about global food security. Such actions by the Kremlin negatively affect Ukrainian farmers and all those around the world who are most vulnerable to food insecurity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks so much for being here with us. So first, I mean, we heard from President Zelenskyy there concretely what effect will this have on food security and on Ukraine, economically, this attack on the on the granaries? MATTHEW SCHMIDT, ASSOC. PROFESSOR OF NATIONAL SECURITY, UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAVEN: Basically nothing at this scale right now. What we have to understand is that the market has already priced in the war. If you actually look at the spot price of wheat right now, it's lower than it was a few weeks ago, when Russia formally pulled out of the Green Deal. So the market is factoring this in. And the truth is, there's a lot of slack in the U.S. and in Canada, where there's wheat that they can put out on the market, it's going to take time to move it to change the supply rafts and these kinds of things. But it's there. That doesn't mean it's not a bad deal for Ukraine. Ukraine is hurting because of this. But the fact of the matter is, is those price effects are already in the system.",

Now we want to warn you some of the images you're about to see are graphic and the report includes distressing descriptions of conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIMA ELBAGIR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The streets of El Geneina in Sudan's Darfur region are eerily quiet, filmed at great risk by survivors. The video shows racist graffiti defacing walls and corpses littering the streets. Seen here in their own propaganda, Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, RSF, occupied Geneina in June after a heavy shelling campaign and fighting in their war for dominance over Sudan's army. A CNN investigation has now uncovered some of the cost of the RSF victory here in Geneina. Survivors, aid workers and body collectors described the CNN house together with their allies, the RSF gunned down hundreds of civilians in and around Geneina on June 15. In one of the most violent massacres to date in the recent history of this genocide scarred Sudanese region. Using satellite images, eyewitness testimony and geo locating what few videos have made it through the telecommunications blackout, cutting that four off from the world. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I lost eight members of my family that day during the escape from El Geneina to Chad. ELBAGIR: This man says he buried hundreds of victims in Darfur since April. But on that day, he couldn't even reach his slain relatives. The ISIS troops are drawn from Darfur Arab tribes and together with its leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo aka Hemedti are implicated in the years long genocide in the region against African tribal groupings. It's unsurprising then that the war between the RSF and Sudan's military for control of the country took an even more sinister turn here in Darfur mirroring the RSF's previous tactics, forcing civilians to flee many arriving in Geneina. That is until June 14 when the West Darfur Governor seen here at his arrest by the RSF was executed. The RSF blamed for the killing denies responsibility. As hundreds attempted to flee they were harassed and threatened. Even children joined in. A lucky few made it to Chad.

All injuries consistent with being shot from the back.Over 850 people flooded the hospitals in Adre between June 15 to 17, according to MSF, more than any other period since fighting began in April. Body collectors say according to their count, around 1,000 people were killed on the day of June 15, buried in dozens of mass graves. Survivors say the RSF is replicating these same tactics across the region. Even as they're supposed to celebrate in the aftermath of mass killings, and the sweep of escalating ethnically targeted attacks. ELBAGIR (on camera): A spokesperson for the rapid support forces told CNN that they categorically deny the assertions that we put forward in our reporting, without though denying any of the specifics that we shared with them. It's also important to note that the RSF had previously denied the findings of an investigation where we uncovered evidence that RSF troops had engaged in rapes before subsequently the leader of the RSF stating that those who had been implicated in violations were to be prosecuted.

CNN's Kylie Atwood has more about that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Paul Whelan spoke by phone today with the Secretary of State Antony Blinken from a Russian prison. And according to a source familiar with the call, the secretary's message to Paul Whelan was to keep the faith and that the U.S. government is doing everything in their power to try and bring Paul Whelan, who's been wrongfully detained in Russia for more than four years, home as quickly as possible. Now, we are told that this is the second time that they have had a conversation. The first time was late last year, but we don't know the logistics that went into setting up these call. You can imagine it would be quite complicated to get Paul Whelan on the phone with the secretary of state, even though he is able to make phone calls from the prison where he is. Getting him on the phone with America's top diplomat is hugely significant. Now David Whelan, who's Paul Whelan's brother, described the conversation to CNN as a long conversation, a frank conversation. He also said it sent a signal to Russia that the U.S. is still working, of course, to secure Paul Whelan's release. And we should note that the U.S. has put an offer on the table to secure Whelan's release. That offer to Russia was sent earlier this year more than eight months ago, according to a senior administration official. That is still a live offer, but the Russians have not substantively engaged.

[01:49:51] BRUNHUBER: Data from other countries also shows an increase of cancers among younger adults. Scientists attributed that to better screening and other factors they are yet to investigate. The study was published in the journal \"JAMA Network Open\". Two separate research teams are reporting new success in organ transplants using genetically-modified pig kidneys in human patients. In a report published Wednesday researchers at the University of Alabama say the transplanted pig organs are working as intended, providing the life-sustaining function of filtering waste. A team at New York University gave updates on their study of kidneys' longevity. After nearly two months their patients have showed no sign of rejection and the organ is functioning normally in clearing toxins. Both teams are using kidneys transplanted into recipients who are brain dead in pre-clinical human research.
