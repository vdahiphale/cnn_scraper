We'll hear from a survivor who describes the moment of impact. Also ahead, no boarding pass? Apparently no problem. For the second time in less than a month, a passenger stowed away on a Delta flight. Seriously, how does this keep happening? We'll discuss ahead. And later, over 50 years in the making, a birth mother and daughter spend the holidays together. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. The official reason is still unknown and an investigation is underway. But speculation is starting to emerge as to what may have caused the plane crash in Kazakhstan on Christmas Day that killed dozens of people. Azerbaijan Airlines says early findings indicate the disaster occurred after physical and technical external interference. Separately, a U.S. official told CNN the science point to Russian anti-aircraft defense is shooting down the plane, possibly in a case of mistaken identity. Authorities have recovered both flight recorders at the crash site. And survivors and coffins have begun arriving in Azerbaijan's capital, Baku. This new video shows passengers praying just moments before the crash. And here's how one survivor described the terrifying experience afterwards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUBHONKUL RAKHIMOV, PLANE CRASH SURVIVOR (through translator): I was conscious when I felt the impact. I was thrown up, hit down, thrown up again. I was strapped in. I was being thrown back and forth. It all lasted a few seconds. And then everything went quiet and silence. Everything was quiet, calm. And I realized that was it. We had landed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But there are questions as to what exactly led to that, whether or not perhaps there was a loss in system controls onboard the flight.

In terms of why the plane ultimately diverted to Kazakhstan, that does seem to remain a mystery.

However, it's being reported in the Azeri media, again, quoting Azerbaijani, the officials involved in the investigation, that the pilot was not given suitable alternate divert areas. Plus, there was still Russian air defense and drone activity potentially going on over the North Caucasus Federal District. So Russia may not have provided divert options that were suitable under the circumstances, which led the pilot to make a decision to divert to act out. So more information needs to come out from that. The flight data recorder and any of the communications from the pilot will be critical in establishing after the explosion outside of the aircraft that led to the damage, what steps did the pilot and air traffic controllers take to try to deal with the situation that it developed? It's difficult to say without actually having access to the cockpit voice data and the actual kinematics of the aircraft during its flight. Since the aircraft was experiencing GPS jamming, we don't have a lot of ADS-B data publicly available. That is -- that is very useful to analyze this. And since Russian authorities are very quick to lay blame on things other than a shoot-down at this point, i.e. weather, birds, or the pilot making a choice to divert to Aktau.

If this were birds or weather, why would -- why would Azeri Airlines be canceling flights across Russia? Why would EL AL Airlines be canceling flights to Moscow? Why would Kazakh Airways be canceling flights to Yekaterinburg? The questions that need to be answered by the authorities are unlikely to be done in a timely fashion.

But in order for the formal impeachment process to conclude, a constitutional court ruling upholding that impeachment vote is necessary. But critically, and here's the problem right now.

      "sentences": "Yes. I think we all know, or many of us know, the traditional Hanukkah story, which is -- which is an accurate one, which is basicallythere was a cruel king, a Greek-Syrian king, who oppressed the Jewish people and outlawed Judaism. Basically, pain of death. You could not celebrate Sabbath. You could not read Torah, any of the practices, under a tremendous penalty. And there was a group of intrepid Jews, actually one family, the Maccabees, who defied that edict. And despite their small numbers, they fought that army and they won very -- and very unlikely triumph. And that is a story of resilience of deciding that we are going to hold to our differences. And we are not going to be snuffed out. But there's another piece of that story, which is that the Maccabees were essentially, in some sense, you would say zealots of their day. They insisted on a certain very strict brand of orthodoxy, of Judaism. And they did not allow any Jews who did not go along with that to basically to live their own brand of Judaism, which was essentially they considered watered down. So there was a basically sort of essentially a civil war, Jew against Jew at that time. And I think what it gives us is a sense that we have often disagreed on things. And the larger point of that story and the one that the rabbis wanted to highlight is not to deny that there was that infighting, that internecine battle, but really the bigger and more important story was the miracle of the light. The fact that when they rededicated the temple that had been desecrated by the enemy, they basically, they had one cruise of oil and they managed to last in a miracle for eight. And that is the story that the rabbis upheld because it's the one that we should not just aspire to but decide that that's who we're going to be. And our op-ed was saying, it's not a fabrication to say we choose our narratives and they define us. It's the same in America. I think we know there was a civil war, and we teach it, and we don't ignore it. But it isn't the definition of who we are as Americans. It's not what we hold up as our identity.",

But basically, it was his idea that we take the Five Books of Moses, which some people think they've gotten pieces of, but they've never read in its entirety, and that we talk about it. Because as you know, in the -- in the Jewish tradition, that is our -- that is actually what we're supposed to do, is have a conversation out loud about the -- about these stories. And what we did was we did it in a very kind of accessible way where each chapter is just five or six pages and we go from the beginning of creation in Genesis until the end, Moses' death in Deuteronomy. And this is a foundational document for all of us. And these conversations were challenging because Dov and I are very different Jews. We observe differently, we pray differently. It's amazing how many -- how much difference there can be in such a tiny people. But where we met is around a document of scripture, stories that have united our people for millennia, for 3,000 years. And when you actually kind of kick the tires on the -- on these stories, on these ethics, and you say, why do they apply to my life today, it's extraordinary. You see Torah everywhere. And I think that that's what's powerful again is that this document can withstand a modern lens and it actually can deepen our lives when we -- when we talk about it out loud, even with someone who's very different from us.",
