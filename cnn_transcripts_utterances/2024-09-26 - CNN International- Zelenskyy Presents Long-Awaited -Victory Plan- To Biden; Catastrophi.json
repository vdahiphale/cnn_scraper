But we want to begin and Washington, that's where Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has just presented his victory plan to President Joe Biden. While Zelenskyy is working to get permission to use U.S.-made weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, Ukrainian president is also pushing for long-term security guarantees that could withstand changes in American leadership. Biden announced a new $2.4 billion security package and also ordered the Pentagon to allocate all remaining Ukraine funding approved by Congress before he leaves office. Earlier today, Zelenskyy met with members of Congress and will meet with Vice President Harris this hour. We will bring that to you once it happens. But for now, let's get to our team of reporters. We have seen in senior international correspondent, Fred Pleitgen, who is live for us in Kyiv, as well as senior White House U.S. correspondent Kayla Tausche. She is at the White House. Kayla, let's start with you. Is there any indication that Biden might lift these weapons restrictions that the Ukrainians have been asking for, for quite some time now?",

To be flexible on this policy, saying just a couple of weeks ago when asked about it, we're working on it, even though at the time, a senior U.S. official said that there was no official change in policy.There have been a lot of discussions behind the scenes and we expect that President Zelenskyy today is going to be making the case for why he needs to use those weapons to bring about a quicker end to the war, to essentially get Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, the broad contours of this so-called victory plan include a surge in assistance to get more weapons into Ukraine, to expedite their ability to hit certain Russian targets and weapons depots, to essentially convince Putin that there is no path to victory for him and to bring about some sort of negotiated peace solution. Now, this comes after President Zelenskyy was at the United Nations this week, warning world leaders of a very dire outcome if Russia is allowed to prosecute a third winter at war, Zelenskyy suggested that Putin would hit no fewer than three nuclear plants inside his country, warning the world that the fallout from that could be toxic and could permeate borders. So, certainly Zelenskyy upping the ante to bring about a quicker end to this war. And that's exactly what he's going to be discussing with both President Biden and Vice President Harris as he tries to figure out what, if any, continuity there could be for his country after November, Rahel.",

General, good to have you today. I want to pick up where Fred left off there, just this -- this agenda item for Zelenskyy to get the U.S. to lift restrictions on its weapons to be used to strike targets deeper inside Russia. One, do you think that its a matter of at this point when not if and as Fred was saying, there Ukrainians believed that this could be a game changer on the battlefield. Do you see it that way as well? BRIG. GENERAL STEVE ANDERSON (RET.), U.S. ARMY: I do believe that it would help to provide put some pressure on Vladimir Putin. I mean, we have to remember that Vladimir Putin is the center of gravity, okay? He is the reason that this war happened in the first place. That he is the reason why it continues to this very day and will continue until he changes his mind about it, either he gets forced out of office or he decides that this war is no longer worth it. I mean, he's now had an incursion inside Russia for over seven weeks in the Kursk region. He's lost perhaps a million casualties during this war. It's had a tremendous strain on his economy. There's a lot of internal pressure within him. And so -- within Russia. And so, I think that anything that we can do to support the Ukrainians that help apply pressure to the center gravity is a good thing. And if that means more ATACMS, as Fred mentioned, more long-range artillery, more HIMARS, and some as Fred mentioned, also the air defense artillery systems such as Patriot, whatnot. I think that's all a good thing, and we should be providing it to Ukraine as soon as we possibly can.",

I understand that.And the one thing that we don't want to go to, of course, is a nuclear action, but he's been threatening this for quite some time. I think that if we prioritize the air defense artillery assets and then help with a little bit of long-range artillery, I think that that would be sufficient provide the kind of pressure that the Ukrainians need to need to put on Vladimir Putin internally to, number one, continued to hold the Kursk region, the incursion that occurred seven weeks ago. And number two, continued to attack Moscow, to take the hurt to the people because this has been going on for two-and-a-half years. And again, the center of gravity is Vladimir Putin.

They are not going to bow into Putin. They're going to continue to resist and I'm very, very confident that they are that we need to continue to support them.I want to remind all the viewers that, you know, we've given them now about $52 billion that seems like a lot, but it's really a drop in the bucket. We were spending $300 million a day, Rahel, 15 years ago in Iraq and Afghanistan, that's 300 million a day. Thus far, our support to the Ukrainians has been equivalent to about six months the war in Iraq, Afghanistan and this is a far more important, this is an existential -- existential threat to the United States. And the Ukrainians are essentially, they're fighting for all of us. They're fighting for NATO. They're fighting -- fighting for world peace and order. They're fighting for all of us.

You know, don't support Ukraine, don't provide certain weapons systems, don't get involved in this war because he knows that if the United States and NATO continue to support Ukraine, that he can't win. But every time we have stepped up to the plate to support Ukraine and do what's in our interests, U.S. national security interests in Americans interest, and that is support Ukraine to make sure whatever Putin cannot win this war, he backs off and takes a different tact.

Individual leadership failure, cultural issues, and overstretched Secret Service, the Secret Service that has agents working 80, 90 hours a week.

There's quite a bit of confusion here because just last night, we heard from the White House saying that they had put together this 21-day ceasefire, which is really a pause, it's a temporary pause in the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel to get the two sides back to the table, to figure out a more permanent solution for tens of thousands of residents, both in northern Israel and in southern Lebanon, to really go back to their homes.And we know that the U.S. and French and other officials who are engaged in these talks had been speaking with both sides. It's not like this was a plan that was just presented to them last night for the first time. So it did appear that there were some optimism, at least some hope that this might get implemented quite quickly. And we know from a source who spoke to CNN yesterday that Prime Minister Netanyahu had given the green light for his government to engage in these talks. And yet today, there seems to be kind of reversal of course. As soon as Netanyahu landed in New York, he said that the policy is clear. We continue to hit Hezbollah with all of our might. And so, it does appear that the Israeli military campaign is going to continue. The U.S. and Israel are on the same page in terms of one thing, that it's going to take diplomatic, political negotiations to get to a quiet place in Lebanon. But the difference is Israel clearly feels that it is military pressure, continued bombardment of Lebanese position, of Hezbollah positions that's going to get there faster while the U.S., France and the other allies signed onto this statement, would like this to end right now. So these discussions are continuing. Certainly, the ceasefire did not start as imminently as the White House would have liked. We've often heard, you and I, Rahel, have spoken about us hopes for ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon quite a bit over the past few months. And so, this has not yet come to fruition, obviously remains to be seen, whether it will. We know that there were more diplomatic conversations taking place today here in New York. Everyone's here for the U.N. General Assembly, a top Netanyahu aide was due to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. So, we will see where this goes, but I can certainly --- wouldn't -- should expect tomorrow morning, New York time when Netanyahu goes up to that podium at the U.N. to talk about why Israel feels the need to continue bombing those positions in order to get those Israeli citizens home. But it is, it is certainly a very dangerous time, a real period of escalation and the U.S. fear of the European fear people around the world frankly, worrying that that, that is going to spill over into a much broader regional conflict, Rahel.",

But unfortunately, it seems that, you know, everyone is intent on finding a diplomatic solution to this conflict, except one party that wants to continue with its indiscriminate attack on civilians.",

I want to especially thank you for your participation in the Peace Summit -- and really it was very important and we remember it. The format was successful. We are preparing the second one now. We have to end this war, we need a just peace. We must protect our people -- Ukrainian families, Ukrainian children and everyone -- from Putin's evil. And we are grateful to America for supporting Ukraine all along. We'll have an important meeting today -- right after I talked to President Biden about the plan of Victory. I will share the details of the plan with Vice President Harris. It is crucial for us to be fully understandable and to work in full coordination with the United States. This morning, I talked to the congressmen -- both chambers, both parties. And I'm thankful for the bipartisan support. We believe this war can be won and just peace can be closer only with the United States. Madam Vice President, this is our, you said, seventh meeting.",

But it was Harris who really leaned into this stagecraft of this moment, flanked by both the Ukrainian and the American flags in her ceremonial office with leader of Ukraine to essentially lay out what the official position of the United States and her official position going forward would be. She's really leaning into the imagery and the optics of that moment as she did when prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu visited her in that same office just a few weeks ago. And so, she has really positioning herself at the forefront of foreign policy and trying to help voters imagine her in that role going forward, Rahel.",
