      "sentences": "COP stands for Conference of the Parties. The gatherings are intense technical negotiations brokered by the U.N.Countries are meant to work together to coordinate a global effort to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, but progress at success of COP summits has been limited. The first climate COP summit took place in Berlin in 1995 and representatives from more than 170 states or territories attended. Two years later at COP3 in Japan countries agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in which 37 industrialized states or territories were legally bound to start reducing their emissions. But the biggest polluter at the time, the United States refused to ratify the agreement because it didn`t oblige developing nations like China to cut emissions. And without the United States and China on board, the Kyoto Protocol began to crumble. Then at COP21 in Paris, there was a breakthrough. The Paris Agreement was adopted by more than 190 parties, including the U.S. and China its ambition was to limit global warming to well below two, but preferably 1.5-degree Celsius above pre industrialized levels. Since then progress has been slow and pledges by governments across the world haven`t gone far enough, even as deadly extreme weather has gotten more intense and cost of in action has skyrocketed. At COP26 in Glasgow country signed an agreement that for the first time acknowledged the role of fossil fuels in the climate crisis. But the conference also had its shortcomings. India successfully demanded that the final agreement would commit countries to phase down rather than phase out planet heating coal. COP27 in Egypt saw countries agreeing to set up a loss and damage fund to help vulnerable nations hit by climate disasters. But while the intent to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius was reaffirmed progress so far has fallen far short, where scientists save needs to be. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Now at this year`s summit already global delegates have agreed to establish a damage fund for those nations hit hardest by the climatecrisis. The United Arab Emirates and Germany already pledged 100 million to this fund. The U.K. promised 60 million pounds. The U.S. committed 17.5 million and Japan contributed 10 million. Since last year summit in Egypt, more than 80 countries have voiced support for language around phasing out fossil fuels. However, many wish to continue using fossil fuels as long as the climate pollution is captured before it enters the atmosphere. Moving on now to news back in the United States, the environmental protection agency proposed to remove lead pipes from the us water system. Why? Lead is an extremely toxic heavy metal and studies have linked exposure to it to significant health and developmental problems, especially for kids.  New lead pipes have been banned in the U.S. since the 1980s, but there are still about 9 million lead service lines in the country according to the EPA. And Illinois and Rhode Island are the states with the highest proportions of service lines due for replacement. The EPA proposal says lead service lines must be replaced within 10 years. The project will require billions of dollars, but the agency analysis suggests that the benefits would be 4 to 10 times greater. Ten second trivia. What sport helped ease mounting tensions between China and the U.S. during the height of the cold war? Ping Pong, Pickle ball, Tennis, or Badminton? Chinese leader Mao Zedong invited the U.S. table tennis team to China in 1971. Those matches helped break the ice ahead of the Secretary of State Henry Kissinger`s groundbreaking secret trip to China months later. One of the most influential and controversial foreign policy figures in American history, Henry Kissinger has died. The former U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Advisor was 100 years old. CNN`s Richard Roth has a look back at the defining moments of Kissinger`s career. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
