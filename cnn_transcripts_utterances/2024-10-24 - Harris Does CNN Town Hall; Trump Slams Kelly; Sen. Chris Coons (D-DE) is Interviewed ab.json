She's closing this campaign, you know, really drawing this contrast. But this is her message. The campaign about Donald Trump has become really the anthem of her candidacy. She's trying to rally, you know, some of the Democrats, of course, who may still be on the fence, or not voting at all, to focus on this race and see this distinction here. But she also has been trying for weeks to really explain how she would be the candidate of change. That's one of the central issues here, which candidate is viewed as a candidate of change? So, she's been trying to put some distance between herself, how she would govern, and how President Biden did.

And she did not. But she did say that she agrees with Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, who told \"The New York Times\" that Donald Trump fits the definition of a fascist. Trump also is continuing to attack the retired general, John Kelly, calling General Kelly a total degenerate.As for where he heads today, Trump is going to Arizona and Nevada. Let's talk - let's bring in CNN's Alayna Treene, who's tracking his campaign for us. And before that, he was at a rally in Georgia last night. You were there. What did he say? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: I was. It was in Duluth, Georgia. A suburb of Atlanta. Look, it was a wide-ranging rally. We really heard Donald Trump hit all of the key things we've heard him say repeatedly on the campaign trail, which is to talk about the economy, to try and trash Harris' handling of the border. But one thing that was new and a little bit different, Kate, was, he said that he - and this is when he was calling RFK Jr. up to the stage, he said that he wanted to spend more money on health care, or health is how he put it, than any other country. And, of course, this comes as he has pledged that he would have RFK Jr. serve in any future administration if he were to win in a role that would oversee health care. Take a listen to how he put it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are also going to make America healthy again. Your Kamala health care plan will make our kids sicker and their diets more toxic. Under the Trump administration, we will get the toxic chemicals out of our food supply and we will make our children healthy again. We will spend more money on health care than any other nation.

      "sentences": "Now, Kate, this is obviously something that Donald Trump has just started to say in recent weeks. But I'll tell you where it's coming from. It is coming from RFK Jr. This was a key platform that he had run on before dropping out and endorsing Donald Trump. And part of the reason Trump keeps talking about this and mentioning RFK on the trail, I'm told, is because they think he helps Donald Trump when it comes to women. They believe that women, obviously, a key demographic that they are targeting right now, are being swayed by this message, particularly on health care, about certain processed foods and whatnot.And you heard RFK Jr. speak on stage, or I heard him last night when I was there in the arena, really focusing this - on this as well. But one other thing that happened last night, because I just - it was so odd, I feel like I have to bring it up to you. This was a massive rally and a massive arena. There was a lot of high-profile Republicans who spoke. People, like I said, RFK Jr., but also Tulsi Gabbard, Dr. Ben Carson, Marjorie Taylor Greene. But also Tucker Carlson. And at one moment prior to Donald Trump taking the stage, Carlson actually told this story. He said that if Donald Trump were going to win, again, it would be like dad is coming home. And he said, like a father, Donald Trump loves all his children. He was referring to Democrats and the media. But said that he would be, quote, \"pissed\" at them and then said that he would need to give them a vigorous spanking. Very odd language, but the reason I'm bringing this up is because it seemed to stick with the crowd in the room. When Donald Trump came on stage, the crowd started screaming, \"daddy's home.\" Something I have not heard on the trail so far. And I just felt, you know, it was a bit odd, so I wanted to share that with you this morning.",

So even though we had a great convention, there was a debate between Trump and Harris, now weeks ago.There are folks who need to hear one more time. Here's their economic ideas, Donald Trump has a terrible idea to impose a 20% nationwide sales tax that he calls a tariff on all imported goods. That means your groceries, your clothes, your furniture, your cars, everything that comes into this country from anywhere, he wants to increase their costs. Kamala Harris has ideas for how to address housing, health care, pharmaceuticals, child care, and make taxes fairer. You look at those two ideas and independent reviewers like, for example, Goldman Sachs, say if Trump gets to enact his ideas, inflation will go up, growth will go down. Kamala Harris, inflation goes down, growth goes up. I do think we need to keep making the case and I'm looking forward to Vice President Harris' closing argument this coming week.",

I have a hard time believing that the average American will look at that contrast and choose Donald Trump if they believe what Republican after Republican has now come out and said publicly.Look, conservative congressman, former Congressman Fred Upton just said yesterday that he voted for Kamala Harris. He's joining a long list, like my friend Jeff Flake, former conservative Republican from Arizona. Liz Cheney was just here in Pennsylvania a few days ago campaigning with Vice President Harris. You don't see the same thing happening with Democrats who are endorsing Donald Trump.

Why does this matter? Well, because he keeps saying, look, it was at its lowest level the day I left office, then it started increasing.
