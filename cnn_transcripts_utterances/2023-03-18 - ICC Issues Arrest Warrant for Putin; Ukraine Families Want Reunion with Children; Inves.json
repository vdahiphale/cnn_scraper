The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for him and the Kremlin so- called children's rights commissioner, alleging they're responsible for the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.The international court was created to prosecute individuals accused of such actions. Right now, 123 countries recognize its jurisdiction. And if Putin travels to any one of them, he could be potentially arrested there. Russia, however, is dismissing the warrant since it's not an ICC member state; neither is the U.S. On Friday, President Biden voiced support for court's decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Well, I think it's justified. But the question is it's not recognized internationally by us, either. But I think it makes a very strong point. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're not going to immediately see an end to violence but the hope from the ICC and the belief is that this could act as a deterrent in the future. There's still teams on ground investigating each and every day the Russian aggression taking place in Ukraine. Those allegations of war crimes and that evidence will prove crucial in the coming years when it comes to seeking legal accountability for Russia's war crimes in Ukraine. And that was certainly the direction from the European Union. We heard yesterday from the E.U.'s foreign policy, Josep Borrell, who said this was an important historical step but also noted this was only the beginning, an important first step, in his words, to what will be a continued focus on seeking accountability by independent international bodies like the ICC for accountability when it comes to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. So this is a significant step forward, it's somewhat unprecedented and rare to see a sitting head of state facing this kind of warrant by the ICC. But of course, with Russia not a party to the treaty, as neither is the United States, there's some debate whether or not this will have impact whatsoever from President Putin's direction.

That was pretty obvious to the public from almost the beginning of the war, that this was a criminal war led by a man who therefore must himself be criminal. But it's a great step to have taken -- maybe a bit later than we would have liked to have him labeled in this way. He won't be able to travel freely in many places. And his being labeled in this way is extremely important for the alliance of countries, including, of course or led by the United States of America, supporting Ukraine. Any of those countries that now want to separate out, maybe because they would rather have cheap gas and oil because they've just tired of supporting Ukraine, will find it much more difficult when the man leading the war against whom they have so far been giving support is identified in this way, as a man who needs to be tried.
