The boy's father, Colin Gray, faced the same judge moments later. He's charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter for providing the gun that his son allegedly used in the rampage. This is just the second case in U.S. history where prosecutors will try to hold a parent partly responsible for a mass shooting that was committed by their child. CNN's Rafael Romo is live northeast of Atlanta in Winder, Georgia. And, Rafael, we're also hearing more from some of the family members of the victims. What can you tell us about that?",

Brianna, specifically from the mother of Christian Angulo, one of the two fellow students that were shot by the teenage suspect.And it is just very difficult to hear what she had to say, the manner in which her son was killed. But let me tell you first that the first appearance for both father and son has come and gone. And now it will likely be three months before we see them both again in court. Fourteen-year-old Colt Gray and his 54-year-old father, Colin Gray, are scheduled to have their preliminary hearing here at the Barrow County courthouse on December 4th, at the same time as today's hearing, 8:30 in the morning. Colt Gray was arraigned on four counts of felony murder and is expected to be tried as an adult following the Wednesday shooting that left four people dead here in Winder, Georgia. After the hearing, Barrow County District Attorney Brad Smith said Gray will face additional charges. His father, Colin Gray was arraigned on four counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of second-degree murder, and eight counts of cruelty to children. His arrest warrant, obtained by CNN, alleges the following, and here I quote, Brianna. \"Colin Gray did cause the death of\" -- a redacted name -- \"a child under the age of 18 years, irrespective of malice, by providing a firearm to Colt Gray with knowledge that he was a threat.\" And here's the key, Brianna, \"to himself and others.\" Meanwhile, we're now hearing from the mother of Christian Angulo, one of the two students killed Wednesday. As you can imagine, Emma Angulo is trying to understand the violent and unexpected way in which her 14-year-old son died. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EMMA ANGULO, MOTHER OF SHOOTING VICTIM CHRISTIAN ANGULO (through translation): I'm in mourning. He didn't deserve to die like this. I miss him. For me, this is like I wish it was a dream. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Remember, when the program began, the Chinese government was dealing with an overpopulation problem. And the officials there very much enforcing its draconian one-child policy that basically limited most couples in cities to only one child, forcing many families to abandon children, especially girls and disabled kids. But right now, the authorities are dealing with the opposite problem, a shrinking labor force and a rapidly aging society. That's why, within the last decade, they have twice relaxed its once very strict family planning policy, allowing couples now to have up to three children. But none of that seemed to have worked against this backdrop of a slowing economy and young people's changing attitudes towards marriage and parenthood. Now, Chinese reactions to this policy change seem to be mixed on social media. But those who applauded this decision -- decision seemed to be expressing a lot of nationalistic sentiment, saying China's now rich and powerful enough to take care of its own abandoned children. And often also mentioning rising tensions between China and the U.S. But none of this economic, social and political realities, of course, offered a much real comfort to the hundreds of international families in the middle of adopting children from China. Because the government here seems have indicated this ban goes into effect immediately, with very limited exceptions, leaving hundreds of American in limbo and potentially heartbroken -- Brianna?
