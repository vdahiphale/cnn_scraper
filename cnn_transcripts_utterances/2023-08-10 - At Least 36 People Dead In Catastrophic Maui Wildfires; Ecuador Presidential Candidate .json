It's the big part of Maui and the head of the turtle is where Lahaina is.And there were multiple areas of fires. Then Lahaina also had a fire. So if you can imagine just how the resources had to be spread out. And 100 firefighters were on duty for 24 hours. And that was calling all hands on deck. At the time, it seemed -- it was overwhelming. It seemed like we really didn't have the help that we needed. Now fast forward to yesterday. We started to get help from the national government, the federal government, and I think that has really helped. The winds have come down a little bit, so that also helped with the fire-fighting effort. What I'm hearing from people -- and if you can imagine, in Lahaina, 29 power poles went down. So the winds blew the power poles down, the power poles -- this is my personal opinion because, obviously, there have not been investigations done yet on the cause of the fire. But when a power pole comes down, it sparks, and we've heard this from witnesses, as well. And with winds gusting into 80-mile-per-hour or more, that is how the fires spread very, very quickly. The power lines are down, so that means also no power. And fiber optics have been impacted in Lahaina. So in Lahaina, it was just the perfect storm of all of the wrong ingredients to create this situation. And on top of that, no one -- people could not get in touch with others. People are missing. And we still don't have communications. Right now, we've had buses taking the people from the shelter in Lahaina to an area where now they're finally getting cell reception. We're just starting to have names trickle in of survivors.",

I'll take you through a few of the pieces of new information that we just learned.We now know that there were six men arrested in a series of overnight raids around the capital city of Quito. That's according to the interior minister of Ecuador who said the men are all believed to be foreign nationals. The interior minister also said they're believed to be connected to organized criminal groups operating in the country. Although, he didn't say or specify which gangs they're believed to be involved in. Those raids turning up a real cache of weapons. Among them a machine gun, three hand grenades. Now those capping what was an explosive evening in Ecuador just 10 days ahead of the presidential elections. To reset, it was around 6:15 p.m. when Villavicencio left the campaign rally to go to a school in the capital city of Quito. He was walking to a car, as you see on that video, when we hear the sound. About 12 gunshots rang out. We're now learning more about his security detail that evening. According to the interior minister, he had three levels of protection within his details. Among them, several police officers and two patrol cars at the site of the rally that evening. Now apparently, his campaign also had an armored vehicle in their possession, but it was in a different city in Ecuador that night, so it was not with him at the campaign rally. Alex, this is obviously a very important time for Ecuador. They are going forward about their elections in 10 days' time. Some candidates have suspended their campaigns. But it's going to move forward. This obviously a very important topic of discussion.",

That includes Eddie Peterson, who served as a military lawyer at Lejeune back in eight 70s. Later went on to be an assistant D.A. in Tennessee and was forced to give up his successful law career as Parkinson's disease took over his body. A new study, by the way, shows poisoned Lejeune veterans are 70 percent more likely to have Parkinson's. Eddie and as many as a million other young Marines, civilian staff and their family members, who served and lived on base from the 1950s to the 1980s, had no idea they were bathing their children in, washing clothes in, and drinking water so contaminated that it would later be linked to 15 categories of cancers and other conditions. Eddie's speech is now severely affected by his advanced Parkinson's so we have subtitled him so that you can understand him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Then in early May, Shelby Jean Hunter, a former civilian employee at Lejeune who served as the base housing clerk and librarian, died of breast cancer. A day later, Corporal Alfred Eugene Benson passed away from bladder cancer and kidney failure. In his obituary, his family highlights his two tours in Vietnam and later his government work providing top-secret communications for government officials, including then-Secretary of State Henry Kissinger during peace talks in the Middle East during the '70s. In early June, Private First-Class Danny Lee Williams died from bladder cancer. Later that month, James Arthur Thomson, from Medford, Oregon, passed away from kidney cancer at just 63 years old.
