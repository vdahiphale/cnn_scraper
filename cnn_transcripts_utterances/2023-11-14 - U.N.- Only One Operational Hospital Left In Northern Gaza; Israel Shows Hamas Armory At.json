Earlier, I managed to speak to one of the surgeons inside that hospital, we'll bring you that in just a moment. Then thousands take to the streets of Washington D.C. in a mighty show of solidarity, as you can see there, for Israel. We'll be live from the march for you. Plus, Germany says the EU likely won't reach ammunition targets for Ukraine. I'll speak to Norway's foreign minister as western leaders grapple, of course, with two major international conflicts. But first tonight, major tension is now focused on militarily -- military action around hospitals in Gaza, with one medical director describing conditions there as catastrophic. Fire fights and bombings have centered around medical facilities, and with the lack of crucial supplies, the U.N. now says one out of roughly 30 hospitals is functioning -- is not functioning in northern Gaza. The World Health Organization warned the situation amounts to what it calls a death sentence for the injured. You're looking at really on your screen there all the hospitals there in the -- in northern Gaza, but only one is operational at the moment, and that's the one, that Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. Now, Israel has accused Hamas of embedding itself in civilian structures, including hospitals. CNN cannot verify these claims. And Hamas has repeatedly denied that its fighters hide under hospitals as have health officials in Gaza. Joining us now from Jerusalem with the very latest is CNN's Nada Bashir. And Nada, only one hospital operational when what is already a catastrophic and desperate situation for patients. We'll be hearing from doctor -- a doctor inside Al-Ahli Hospital in just a second. And I'll be showing viewers that. But first, just give us a sense what you are hearing from your contacts in northern Gaza, and particular Al-Shifa Hospital as well as beyond.",

But it's important to remember that for many civilians in northern Gaza, they simply cannot evacuate. There are hundreds of patients who are reliant on urgent care, who aren't able to walk the long and dangerous distance it takes to get to southern Gaza, because they require specialist medical evacuations, not least those premature babies that we've seen in that footage who require transportation via incubators. And of course, there are many elderly and disabled. It is difficult to get across by car. Many are walking. We've seen those videos of hundreds walking in droves for hours to get to southern Gaza, in the hope of finding safety.
