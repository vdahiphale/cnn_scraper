Kennedy Jr. is currently addressing supporters amid questions about his campaign's future. He is expected to withdraw from the race after removing himself from the ballot in Pennsylvania and Arizona, two key swing states, of course, while a recent poll from CBS had RFK Jr. polling at just 2 percent, his presence on the ballot in key swing states could have been the difference in a race decided by just a few thousand votes. Any moment, Donald Trump will take the stage at this own rally in Las Vegas before traveling to Arizona, where Kennedy is currently speaking, teasing, Trump says, a special guest. I'm joined now by former GOP Congressman Charlie Dent, as well as CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer. Charlie, first to you, you know Republican politics. Well, Kennedy stayed in this race as long as he could. A lot of speculation now as to what his departure will mean for the general election and where his supporters are most likely to go. What's your read?",

The reason I say that is there were traditional Democrats and maybe pro- choice Democrats as well who are supporting RFK Jr. And I was -- as a Pennsylvania and I was receiving mail regularly saying RFK Jr. pro- choice, pro-choice basically trying to split the pro-choice vote between Harris and RFK Jr.Now that he's out, some of those voters may go to go back to Harris, but Trump will probably pick up those RFK voters who would be labeled anti-vax or conspiracy theory oriented. And that's a significant number of RFK support, too. So on balance, I don't think it's going to make a big difference. But on the margins, Trump probably has a slight edge out of that. But again RFK's campaign had imploded. I mean, he was dead, moving a dead bear cub in the Central Park and brain worms all campaign was becoming rather off the rails.",

So in that sense, perhaps some progress in the eyes of negotiating just like that has been seen as at least at some level acceptable to present to Hamas officials, but it remains to be seen whether or not those Hamas officials are actually accept this proposal, whether they do you see this as acceptable as you mentioned, Hamas has long stood by their rejection of any sorts of presence, any suggestion of Israeli troops on the ground within the Gaza strip, any sorts of post-school a structure that has been a longstanding sticking point. However, their decision on whether or not they can see this as acceptable will be crucial over the weekend and that's those negotiations continue, crucial to discussions as to whether or not Hamas will send representatives to these talks, as we know, Hamas has not been directly involved in the negotiations. But rather has been communicating via Qatari and Egyptian mediators. And, of course, while this has been one of the main sticking points, there are other disagreements, other issues still on the table, there are still significant gaps between Israel and Hamas, including on the release of Palestinian prisoners that Israel has been pushing for veto power over which panel? CNN prisoners are released. That's something that Hamas has rejected so far. There's also disagreement on proposals around the movement of free movement of Palestinians within the Gaza Strip from southern Gaza to the north. And crucially, what we've been hearing repeatedly now from Hamas officials is that in their view, the current proposal on the table that's not include firm guarantees for a permanent ceasefire. And we've heard from Israeli officials in the past saying that while they might welcome a pause in fighting, we know that that first phase of the ceasefire stipulates a six-week pause, the hope from mediators is that could then translate and transition to a permanent ceasefire. Have Israeli official denied or rejected this? They've said they will a continuation of the war in order to achieve their goals of eradicating Hamas's military capabilities. Hamas wants to see that permanent cease-fire guaranteed. They said they want see a deal delta, which reflects the proposal put forward by President Biden in late May, which they say they accepted in early July. But at this stage, there are still significant gaps. Negotiators we worked on hammering out this final details over the weekend.

It is destroying Hamas and is doing everything physically possible while Hamas is doing everything that they can to get civilians killed, Israel is doing everything to prevent it. And I disagree strongly and that's why I wrote the article that Israel has not been successful while you want to use the numbers of at what cost. And this is where it really comes into. It is the war just and is it being executed justly? And I don't think your sources are experts or data says differently.",
