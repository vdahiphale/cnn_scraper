Major events are often used as decoys. Crowds can wait for hours, enduring long security lines, only to find the leader`s seat empty. Even Kim`s own bodyguards can serve as decoys, best known for donning dark suits, running alongside the leader`s limo during the Trump-Kim summits, projecting power and security, riding an armor-reinforced rail card to Russia, to meet with President Vladimir Putin, a fellow strongman seen by some as a global pariah. Putin and Kim come with plenty of baggage, both saddled with heavy sanctions, for Kim`s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, for Putin`s brutal, unprovoked war on Ukraine, and suspiciously timed plane crash taking out his one-time critic. Kim may not have a reason to fear Putin, but he still does not take any chances when he travels outside North Korea. As Moscow looks to buy artillery and other wartime supplies from its impoverished authoritarian neighbor. CNN contacted the Russian embassy in Washington for comment. North Korea denied previously supplying Russia with rockets and missiles to use in Ukraine. In July, Putin`s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was in Pyongyang as Kim showed off his latest weapons, long-range missiles and military drones. Shoigu said Russia may even be staging joint military drills with the North. The North Korean leader has a lot to gain.",

The train is a symbol of three generations of the Kim family dynasty and a nation stuck in the past. Kim has taken his chugging locomotive to Vladivostok before, meeting with Putin there in 2019. This time, Kim may hope Russia will help him with oil supplies or even technology to use in its own ambitious ballistic missile program. Goal is perhaps worthy of a rare venture beyond his nation`s hermetically sealed borders. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Pop quiz hot shot. The atmosphere of Mars is made primarily of what chemical compound?Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Methane or Argon? If you said CO2, you are winning. The Mar`s atmosphere is over 95% carbon dioxide. Mars has been the focus for several space agencies and companies with ambitions of taking humans to infinity and beyond, but humans aren`t naturally made to be multi-planetary movers. The conditions on the red planet Mars, for example, would be pretty harsh for us earthlings. But many ideas, some very wild, are being discussed as solutions to making Mars livable. One idea sprung from NASA, landing on Mars in 2021 with the Perseverance rover. It`s called MOXIE, short for Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment. Yeah, I don`t see how that makes sense either. Anyways, MOXIE`s goal was to make oxygen right there on Mars by converting the abundance of carbon dioxide into precious oxygen. And the results of the experiment are in. The device, no bigger than a microwave, generated 122 grams of oxygen. How much is that? About what your average small dog would breathe in 10 hours or so. So not too shaggy. Questions remain though, will future tests confirm these results, could the technology be scaled to provide astronauts with breathable air? And how much would this cost, and is it even worth it? Some question whether humanity should be focusing and spending on these types of efforts when we could be focusing on making our planet better instead. For the technology itself though, this is seen by NASA as a successful experiment far exceeding their expectations. At its peak, MOXIE produced 12 grams of 98% pure oxygen per hour, twice as much as NASA hoped for. So this might mean that we are one step closer to some people someday becoming Mar`s. Next up, the U.S. has around 150,000 U.S. auto workers in the United Auto Workers Union, and they could be gearing up for a strike this week. Why? If the big three automakers, General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis can`t meet their demands, which include pay raises and better benefits. Last week, both sides started tossing around their ideas, and while they made a little progress, it might not be enough to prevent union workers in various states from hitting the picket lines if their demands aren`t met before their contract expires. If they strike it could throw a major wrench in car production here in the United States. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
