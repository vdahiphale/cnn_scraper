Just heard from Brianna Keilar who's in Washington. Just moments from now Hope Hicks, Trump's 2016 campaign press secretary will return to the stand. Now so far Hicks has described how deeply worried Trump's campaign was around the time of the access Hollywood tape and when it was released. Now how the campaign went into damage control has been a central point up to this point. Much more to come right Brianna.",

      "sentences": "Yeah Brianna, we had quite a morning in court. When court resumes in about 15 minutes or so, Hope Hicks will be on the stand continuing her direct examination. Hope Hicks, of course, was one of the first people to work on Donald Trump's campaign. She was his communications director and for a time, a very close confidant of Donald Trump's. Now, the key moment in time that Hope Hicks is testifying about is in the final month before the 2016 election. The Access Hollywood tape comes out. People, I'm sure, remember this is when Donald Trump was caught on a hot mic talking about grab him by the blank and all that. We remember this. And Hope Hicks told you what was happening inside the campaign. Now, the prosecution in opening said that Trump's campaign went into, quote, damage control mode. And I think Hope Hicks has really borne that out. She said, I was concerned, very concerned.Ends up being an understatement of sorts. She said at first, Donald Trump's reaction was deny, deny, deny. Now, he denies some of the affairs here, but he didn't end up denying this tape. And finally, again, in a little moment, perhaps of understatement, Hope Hicks said, quote, this was a crisis. Indeed, this was a crisis. Another important thing that Hope Hicks has not yet been asked much about, but I think we can look for this after the lunch break. She was part of a very important August 2015 meeting at Trump Tower attended by Donald Trump, Michael Cohen. David Pecker testified about this meeting earlier. Michael Cohen will, too. He said, this is where we got together and said, we're going to use the inquirer, national inquirer, to try to control Donald Trump's PR. Hope Hicks was in and out of that meeting. So I expect her to be asked about that meeting when her testimony resumes after lunch.",

But this paralegal at the DA's office, Georgia Longstreet, took the stand purely as a vehicle to get in certain of Donald Trump's social media posts. All she said was, yes, this was in fact something Donald Trump posted. One example that the prosecutor showed the jury, Trump posted in August of 2023, if you go after me, I'm coming after you. Prosecutors argue this was an attempt by Donald Trump to intimidate witnesses on this case. And they'll argue that it goes to his state of mind.",

Their direct could even extend into Monday. But I would be shocked if they let defense attorneys begin their cross. But we still have a lot of space to cover. I mean, we're right now in the questioning. They were in early November 2016. The election hasn't even happened yet. And what's really unique about Hope Hicks as a witness, is that she can testify not only about what happened in the election, the transition but then she went to the White House. So even if there's no indication at this point that she was privy to Trump signing checks or any effort to reimburse Cohen, she can talk about any mention of Stormy Daniels or Karen McDougal at the White House.We know another witness testified that she was speaking with David Pecker about possibly extending Karen McDougal's hush money payment or her catch and kill deal. So we know that she has a lot to potentially talk about. She was in the room where everything was happening. She was often with Trump. So she can really be the first witness to meaningfully take us into 2017, which is when Trump was reimbursing Michael Cohen throughout like the first six or seven months of that year. And that's going to be the first time we will have heard really anything about that critical time period.",

You take a light touch and you just ask, you know, were you ever in a conversation where this hush money payment was arranged? Was my client, do you have any evidence of that? Do you have anything to say? Do you have any evidence that my client was somehow involved in falsifying business records or in a cover-up? I mean, she has really not much direct information, really almost no direct evidence to provide prosecutors to support the charges that have been levied at their client. So I think for them, this could be pretty quick and dirty.

I don't think there's a purpose for calling other Trump insiders.I don't think it brings anything more to the case, most likely, given what we've heard from Hope Hicks. They're trying to establish, through her testimony, that this was something the campaign cared about. And, you know, in the wake of the Billy Bush tape, in the wake of then the other things that followed up with Stormy Daniels, I think those, they're trying to establish that these were campaigning crises and that they were responding to a campaign issue.

They were running around, frightening, friends of the campaign were texting, we're f'd, he's f'd. And so, that's been established, and also that Donald Trump was involved.

Here we're getting the actual mechanics of it. But the idea that a news breaks and it's about you and he'd be like, what's happening, is like not how it works for him.
