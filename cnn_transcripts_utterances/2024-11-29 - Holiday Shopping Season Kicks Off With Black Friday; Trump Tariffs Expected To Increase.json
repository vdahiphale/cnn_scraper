So if you're shopping right now, you're listening and you have credit card debt that you're revolving every month, you ought to take your behind home and eat your leftover Thanksgiving meal and think about how you're going to get out of this debt to secure yourself for the coming year.

You can see the lake-effect snow bands just pumping off of all of the Great Lakes. We're especially worried about Lakes Erie and Ontario because that will just continue as we go into the weekend.So if you're doing some traveling, Grand Rapids, Interstate I-196, some problems there. These lake-effect snow bands can be very heavy, very localized, windy as well, so they drop visibility. I-90, a mess, from Cleveland up through Erie over towards Buffalo. This will have some huge visibility problems with these bands as we go through the day today. These are all the winter storm alerts. Again, each to the Great Lakes and you've got those lake-effect snow warnings east of Cleveland including Buffalo and then off of Lake Ontario as well. The problem is, is our lake temperatures are incredibly warm, record warm in fact. We have these lakes in the lower 50s and you might say that's not that warm. Well, compared to the air that's coming over it is much warmer than that very cold air. So what that does is that very cold air will pick up the moisture from the warm water and then it rises as it hits the terrain and that's what pumps the lake-effect snow. So there's nothing really to turn this off until the wind stops, which is why it will continue as we go through the weekend. So we could be looking at snowfall totals in feet off of Lakes Erie and Ontario. That's the paralyzing part, because it won't stop and it piles up feet on end. And it's coming because we have again that very cold air. We're looking at 70 percent of the lower 48 with temperatures at or below freezing as we go through the rest of the holiday weekend. And I'm talking even as far south as Atlanta. You're looking at your overnight lows below freezing as we go through Sunday and Monday, 29 for a low in D.C. How about teens in Chicago waking up to 15 degrees on Sunday 18 degrees on Monday?

The attacks leaving more than a million people without power as temperatures begin dropping ahead of winter. Ukraine says Russia fired more than 130 drones into the country, injuring at least 8 people. Russia's defense ministry says it shot down dozens of Ukrainian drones as well as the two sides trade blows.For more, let's bring in retired U.S. Army Major, Mike Lyons. Sir, thank you so much for being with us on this holiday weekend. I do want to ask about the fact that this is Russia's 11th large-scale attack on the country's energy supply. That is according to Kyiv. Obviously the energy supply is a frequent target of the Kremlin just before winter sets in. But I do wonder how much of this renewed aggressiveness from the Kremlin is tied, in your mind, to the result of the U.S. presidential election? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, Boris, I think all of it is. I think Russia is racing to get to this point where they can claim some kind of strategic advantage over Ukraine, given these kinds of strikes, knowing full well that attack missiles now have been released on the Ukraine side as they continue to strike deep inside of Russian targets there as well with drones as well as that weapon system. But I think it's 100 percent, knowing full well that the Trump administration wants to get to some kind of ceasefire. They want to end this conflict in some manner. The current administration doesn't seem interested in trying to even start to do that right now. So I think the clock is running for Russia to do as much damage as it can and get as much land as it can right now before the Trump administration takes hold and starts this process in earnest.",

They don't have really the best systems that the United States could actually provide them. So they have to pick and choose what gets shot down. It's a very tough task. They're probably hanging on very much as each one of those rounds are fired on their land. So it's not a great situation for Ukraine as they continue to try to defend their land as best they can.",

We've got to consider that if we want the firing to stop. I think that the Trump administration will likely go into this negotiation telling Ukraine that we're going to - you're going to have to give up something or else we won't provide the military support, but they sell the same thing to Russia that says if they're not willing to give up something, that we'll pour weapons and military supplies into Ukraine. Instead of giving them 50 battle tanks, we'll give them 300, 400 tanks. So I think that's the leverage they'll try to use.But I do think that it's not in our best interest, the United States' best interest, to have Ukraine anywhere near a planning process to get into NATO anytime soon, just based on where they are, how the Russians feel about it. I was never actually for some of those other countries getting in as well. We need military allies that are going to fight alongside us, not military dependents, which some of these countries have become, even some of the larger NATO countries, frankly. They've not paid enough of their GDP towards their own self-defense. What Ukraine wants is the nuclear umbrella of NATO, and maybe we can come up with some bilateral security agreement to make sure that they have assurances from the United States. But they want that nuclear umbrella that, frankly, some of these NATO countries now live under that they haven't, frankly, met their obligations towards.",

It also bans surgery, although that's not very common for minors. In the lowest court, the trial court level blocked the law. They said that it was unreasonable. They said that it violated the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. And then it went up on appeal. The Sixth Circuit reversed.So now we have it up at the Supreme Court and it's not just Tennessee where this matters. About half of states now in the last four years have passed laws that discriminate against transgender people by saying that they cannot get their gender-affirming care, they cannot play on sports teams and all sorts of stuff. So this really is one of the hottest issues in the culture wars right now.",
