UBS will pay nearly three and a quarter billion dollars for the 167-year-old Credit Suisse. That's about 60 percent less than what Credit Suisse was valued at when markets closed on Friday. And UBS will now assume up to $5.4 billion in losses, in a deal backed by a massive Swiss guarantee. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year and is being welcomed by many in the finance world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARIN KELLER-SUTTER, SWISS FINANCE MINISTER: The bankruptcy of a global, systematically-important bank would have cost irreparable economic turmoil in Switzerland and throughout the world. For this reason, Switzerland had to take the responsibilities beyond its own borders. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Slightly up on the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P.Now, to help avert a financial crises and keep credit available to households and businesses. The U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks of the U.K., the E.U. and several other major economies have announced a joint effort to keep U.S. dollars flowing easily through the global banking system. All right, Ryan Patel, senior fellow at Claremont graduate university's Drucker School of Management joins me now from Los Angeles. Always good to see, Ryan. The question is, will this calm things down? RYAN PATEL, SENIOR FELLOW, CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY'S DRUCKER SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT: Well, calming today, Michael. What about the rest of the week? We just got started. I mean, truthfully, yes, I think it was good news by all to be able to have -- you know, for UBS, it's a great deal. It's almost pennies on the dollar when you think about combining the invested assets. It's almost five trillion, you know, dollars, per se. So I think one of the things that helps the global interconnection piece and even the Silicon Valley Bank piece. It kind of calms the nerves. But you know, Michael, this is just the start of -- you know, of other questions on the banking system in general. And, yes this would have been a really bad sign if they couldn't come to an agreement or to be able to kind of have that much stability.

And now we're looking at it a lot more closely than before, which like we saw what happened with Silicon Valley Bank, the Credit Suisse CEO. And I believe their leadership came out. That system, even though it's not that connected, kind of made their weakness even further and brought the weaknesses to the forefront. And Michael, this is what's going to happen to other banks that were teetering just like what Credit Suisse was. It's going to put this, you know, escalation a little bit further back on that conversation.

He does want to make sure that the United States is tied down, and that the Russians are busy innovating a good deal of what it is that they're doing.

And the risk is especially high among girls and members of the LGBTQ+ community.The CDC's report found nearly three in five teenage girls felt persistently sad or hopeless in 2021. Thirty percent of high-school- aged girls had seriously considered suicide. And almost 20 percent had experienced sexual violence in the previous year. Similarly, more than half of LGBTQ+ teens reported poor mental health, with more than 20 percent attempting suicide in the previous year. Dr. Jill Harkavy-Friedman is the senior vice president of research and leads the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention's Research program. She joins me now. Doctor, thanks for doing so. So how concerning are the results of this CDC survey when it comes to overall teen mental health, particularly having suicidal thoughts and so on? And why are more girls apparently affected than boys? DR. JILL HARKAVY-FRIEDMAN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH, AMERICAN FOUNDATION FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION RESEARCH PROGRAM: So first, I just want to say thank you so much for having me and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Because as you know, our mission is to save lives and bring hope to those affected by suicide. So we find these data concerning, this is a different time. So we know that there's a lot of distress. We also know that girls often, over the years, have higher rates of suicidal ideation than boys. The difference is not as surprising. What's of concern, and yet of hope, is that the girls are responding and expressing it more.",

It has to do with the rejection they experience, the lack of acceptance, the discrimination, the lack of gender-affirming care, and again, the discrimination that they face.",

In the U.S. now, many Republican states are legislating on gender issues, LGBTQ rights, and so on. And not in a positive way. Many of those bills coming after this survey that we're discussing.Are you worried LGBTQ suicides, transgender for that matter, attempts are just going to get worse? HARKAVY-FRIEDMAN: We know that it's very stressful, and again, I want to say that suicide is complex. It's not just being LGBTQIA, for instance. There are many factors that go into suicide risk. And many people at risk will never actually engage in suicidal behavior. But if you are at risk, and you have this kind of intense pressure and stress, you might be a greater risk to think about it. You might be a greater risk to actually make attempts. And again, we don't know about deaths.",

I guess although some of these trends were evident before the pandemic, what -- what role do you think the pandemic -- lockdowns, et cetera -- might have played in the findings?HARKAVY-FRIEDMAN: Well, fortunately, we're out of the  lockdown now, but you know, many people may have been in homes or situations where they were being rejected and not accepted every day, you know. We know from research that when people are accepted, that they fare well. But when there is rejection and discrimination, it's toxic. And like anybody else who's experienced that kind of thing, when you're at risk for thinking about it, or making an attempt, it just exacerbates that problem.",
