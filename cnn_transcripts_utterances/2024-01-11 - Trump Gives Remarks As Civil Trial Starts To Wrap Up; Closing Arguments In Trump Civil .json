This is the Trump building where the former president is expected to be speaking any moment following closing arguments in the civil fraud trial that is wrapping up there in Manhattan.He did unexpectedly. And here he is about to approach and make some comments. We will be fact checking this after he speaks. He said a number of things in his five minutes in court today that were untrue. The judge actually cutting him off. So we'll be watching very carefully, listening very carefully. This is his attorney, of course, who is speaking there ahead of the president. Let's listen in.",

Every single, just about, case that I'm involved in, is set up by Biden. They're doing it for election interference. And in a way, I guess you'd consider it part of the campaign because if you really look at it, they are doing this. It's never been done like this in this country. It's like we're a third-world country, a banana republic. But every one of the things that you write about are Biden indictments. And I don't know, you know, I just got a poll. We just had a poll. It just came out. And we're leading massively in Iowa. We're leading very big in New Hampshire. We're leading because the people understand this stuff. These are all set up.

That's actually a misrepresentation of what took place. The Court of Appeals scaled back the initial case that was made by Letitia James. For example, determining that the statute of limitations had run out on certain charges, removing his daughter Ivanka Trump from the case itself, very far from saying that the appeals court sided with him. In fact, the appeals court would have shut the case down according to legal experts if they had felt that there wasn't a case there. Further, the president made the case that there was only one witness against him and that was his former fixer Michael Cohen, someone who he said was a convicted fellow and convicted of lying. Michael Cohen was convicted in part for lying on behalf of former President Trump, so make of that what you will. He also made claims about Burisma and Joe Biden, things that were largely false.

OK, as you said, the court had ruled that claims that originated before 2014 could not be brought into this trial.Now, even -- even for conduct that took place before 2014 but continued into the future could be brought into this trial and as you said Ivanka Trump that was the decision that said that her conduct that touched her was kept out. There was one sentence in there that was accurate which is that the court ruled in our favor but everything else he said was wrong and twisted the facts of the case. It's absolutely a legitimate lawsuit. You don't have to agree with it.

Case is going back to Richard Nixon in the 1970s about the president's actions are immune from lawsuit or prosecution if they are their official duties. But the drone strike example was a perfect, logical legal example where you would have a president using the official tools of the presidency to commit a crime.He can't do that. The Constitution does not allow that. Nothing, no law written in the United States allows that. And this is exactly the shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue argument that the president himself ran for office on, which is that, well, you know, I could just walk down the street and kill somebody and get away with it. He's making that point here.
