I want to get right to our breaking news this hour. We are expecting a major announcement any moment now from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A source tells CNN, Mr. Trudeau will resign as the leader of the ruling Liberal Party. He is expected to remain Prime Minister until a new leader is chosen. But, you can see there, we are waiting the Prime Minister to step up to that microphone and announce a resignation. He is facing a series of crises ahead of a general election later this year that he is expected to lose, including threats by Donald Trump to slap tariffs on Canadian goods, and a steep slump in his poll ratings. I want to bring in Paula Newton for more. She is live in Ottawa for us. So, Paula, I think just, can you explain to our viewers -- I mean, how did we get to this point?",

That is why, since 2015, I have fought for this country, for you, to strengthen and grow the middle class, why we rallied to support each other through the pandemic, to advance reconciliation, to defend free trade on this continent, to stand strong with Ukraine and our democracy, and to fight climate change and get our economy ready for the future. We are at a critical moment in the world.TRUDEAU (Interpreted): Every morning I woke up as Prime Minister, I was struck by your generosity as Canadians. Every day I was aware of the privilege I had of serving you, and I have fought for this country to reinforce the frontiers, and particularly through the pandemic, to defend free trade and the unswerving support of Canada for Ukraine, as well as the fight against climate change.

We made sure the economy was focused on working for everyone, and not just a few, and that has changed -- that has dropped poverty rates in Canada. That has brought more people into the workforce. That has moved us forward on reconciliation in a way that has deeply improved the opportunities and success of Canadians despite the incredibly difficult times the world is going through right now. There is lots more work to be done, and I know that this party in this country and Canadians will keep doing it.If I have one regret, particularly as we approach this election, well, there are probably many regrets that I will think of, but I do wish that we'd been able to change the way we elect our governments in this country, so that people could simply choose a second choice or a third choice on the same ballot, so that parties would spend more time trying to be people's second or third choices, and people would have been looking for things they have in common, instead of trying to polarize and divide Canadians against each other. I think in this time, figuring out how to pull together and find common ground remains something that is really important for democracies, but I could not change unilaterally without support of other parties our electoral system that wouldn't have been responsible.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. A couple of things, Omar, but first and foremost, the somber tone. Listen, I've been covering him since he has come into office here, and I have rarely seen him that downbeat. I think it gives us some insight into the fact that he really did not want to resign, that he really believes that he is the best person to lead Canada, and more than that, that he believes he could have taken on this conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, even though he is ahead by 20 percentage points in the polls. But, he made it clear, Omar, right, those around him were not convinced that he could do it. And again, it does have some similarities with what happened with President Biden. Those similarities really stick out to me at this point in time, especially because it leaves the Liberal Party kind of hobbled in terms of a succession plan.I say as well, though, when we think about this in terms of Donald Trump's first term, right, Justin Trudeau was pretty much seen as the polar opposite. He had progressive values, and he put them on display, Omar, loud and proud on social media, on a global stage, to anyone who would listen. The pendulum, as you know all too well, Omar, has completely swung. His challenger, Pierre Poilievre, for so many years now, from the Conservative Party, has found some currency in the MAGA base. They do retweet what he has been saying about Trudeau and about policy efforts. We had Elon Musk call Trudeau on a social post, I guess, an insufferable tool, and saying that he wouldn't be in power long. Elon Musk does not wield power in any kind of government sense. But, if you're looking to see the strain of where some of that angst, some of that anger with inflation, legal immigration, where it is now putting some of its sentiment it's putting it into, I would call, a center right, if not a completely right posture even here in Canada, many Canadians fed up with the economy. And again, mirroring the United States, it is not so much the social agenda that they had trouble with, but certainly any kind of virtue signaling was looked down upon, Omar, but again, the economy, the fact that Justin Trudeau just wasn't getting them in terms of inflation and other hardships they had with things like housing.",

But also, I mean, in a way that I think many Canadians viewed as disrespectful, called Justin Trudeau, the governor of the 51st State of the United States. So, clearly that relationship was always going to be one that would be seen as a conflict, or at the very least, a hurdle to overcome for whether it was him or the next person in office. I wonder how you see Pierre Poilievre, who I think is expected to sort of step into the Prime Minister's mantle, or at least a frontrunner. How you see that relationship potentially changing, or if it stays a significant hurdle?",

It's a very small country sitting economy wise, sitting atop a very large and powerful country, and that's always going to be difficult. And I think Pierre Poilievre at least has his finger on the pulse of what's ailing Canadians, a bit more than Justin Trudeau did.But, make no mistake, dealing with Donald Trump is not a rational proposition. I think he is a man who respects strength and respects someone telling it like it is. And I think Justin Trudeau spent his -- Trump's first term in office preaching a different story and really looking down his nose at the President what he represented, instead of dealing with the world as it is, and you have to deal with who you have. And the Prime Minister, Trudeau, did a good job renegotiating the free trade agreement in North America, but I think he had no currency left in his own account, either with Canadians or with the incoming President, who saw a weak target, and we know this President sees weakness and preys on it, and that's what Justin Trudeau is, and that's where he has left Canada, unfortunately, in a weakened state, in front of a very aggressive President.",

I mean, looking at an analysis by the Financial Times, for example, every governing party facing election in a developed country this year lost vote share.

That said, I don't think Justin Trudeau did himself any favors in coming into that and basically spending the government out of money and not doing anything to address people's pocketbook concerns, and that's ultimately what's really angered Canadians, is their lives has gotten materially worse, and per the Prime Minister's words, or paced his words at his press conference, people are feeling pain, and he didn't do enough to alleviate it.And if you don't have a good record, in the face of that very stiff headwind, electorally, it was always going to end in tears. It will end in tears for the Liberal Party, no matter who is selected as the leader. Pierre Poilievre will be the next Prime Minister of Canada, and with a massive mandate.",

But, of course, what we saw four years ago was anything but a nonviolent routine action by the United States Congress, and today, we expect there to essentially be done, probably within one hour's timeframe.Now, the Congress did in the aftermath of January 6, 2021, make some -- take some steps to make it harder to do what Donald Trump wanted his Republican allies to do at a time, which is to overturn the election results. Back then, though, under the law back then, it allowed for one Republican member -- any one House member, Democrat or Republican, or any one Senate member, Democrat or Republican, could object, if one in each chamber objected, that would force a vote in both chambers to throw out a state-certified electoral result. But, in the aftermath of 2021, Congress stepped in and made that threshold much higher. Now it requires one fifth of the members in the House and the Senate. Remember, there are 535 members in both bodies. Then you have one fifth in each body to force a vote in the House and Senate. That is a very high threshold that is unlikely to be met anytime soon. Also, it would -- it ensures that law that was passed in 2022, it ensures that the Vice President, this time, Kamala Harris, is overseeing her own defeat, that she -- her role is ceremonial, which is much different than how Donald Trump thought Mike Pence's roll back in 2021, when he said, reject the state election results, send it back to the states. Mike Pence, of course, resisted that. That forced Congress to act. So, what we're expected to see today, Omar, is a pretty routine event, which is a way it has been for so many years, and then Donald Trump will be sworn in on January 20th.",

Justin Trudeau just announced that he will step down as leader of the ruling Liberal Party, but will stay on as Prime Minister for now until the party chooses his replacement. Now, Mr. Trudeau was making way for new leadership amid a series of political crises. He has been under pressure to quit as his popularity sinks and as polls show the Liberal Party could get trounced in the next general election. Mr. Trudeau says he cannot be the best choice for that election if he is having to fight internal party battles. Paula Newton is joining us again from Ottawa with more. So, Paula, we were just talking to you a few minutes ago. You're giving us some perspective on how we got here. I guess now the question is, where do we go from here?

He has also repeatedly called Prime Minister Trudeau, the governor of the state of Canada as well.

But, Omar, as you've already witnessed yourself, it's quite capricious those kinds of relationships, and Elon Musk so far has not been elected to anything.When it comes to Donald Trump, Canadians certainly prefer a relationship that's close, but not too close, on many of the social issues, and on many issues in general, they do not agree with Donald Trump. At the same time, they certainly realize, many Canadians that they cannot afford to antagonize a Trump administration. It is the Trudeau government that has a good track record there, meaning standing up for some Canadian principles, but negotiating a good trade deal with the United States during its first term. I think once those tweets came out, pardon me, those social posts, not tweets, and dating myself here, that Donald Trump calling the governor and calling Trudeau a governor, saying it was the 51st state, it did two things. One is it certainly stiffened the spine of many Canadians, understanding what they were up against here in terms of trying to get another good deal from an American administration. But, more than that, it also made them think, look, if we have this leader already dismissing Justin Trudeau out of the gate, perhaps we do need someone who has a fresh relationship. I will add, Omar, that Donald J. Trump posted some comments that were not too favorable of Chrystia Freeland, the deputy -- the former Deputy Prime Minister as well. I'm sure the President-elect is watching all of this closely, and his administration will parse, in the coming weeks, exactly how to handle this in the next few months. I will add, though, Omar, Justin Trudeau will be Prime Minister for at least the next few months, it looks like, at least until the end of March, and Canada now has the presidency of the G7. They're supposed to hold their G7 meeting in Alberta, Canada, in June. There will be a lot of facetime still between Donald J. Trump and Justin Trudeau.",

      "sentences": "So, investigators here in Seoul did two major things today, and let's spend some time talking about the first thing. Corruption investigators asked South Korea's police force to take over, to carry out the arrest warrant against South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol. He is suspended because lawmakers voted last month to impeach him after he declared martial law on December 3rd, into the early morning hours of December 4th. He has not been removed from office. That decision is up to a court, and that decision could be made within the next six months.So, why would corruption investigators here ask the police force to carry out this warrant? It is because, on Friday, these corruption investigators tried and failed to arrest suspended President Yoon. They went to his home, but Yoon's presidential security service and members of the military formed a human shield protecting Yoon from arrest. Now, Yoon's lawyers say the warrant was illegal and invalid. So, again, why move this into the hands of South Korean police rather than keep this with those same corruption investigators? Well, the police have a larger force, more people and more resources to carry out an arrest. But, it is still anybody's guess if this will be successful, because Yoon has told his supporters he does not intend to turn himself in. Investigators are also working against the clock here. That is the second major thing that they did today. They have requested an extension of their arrest warrant because they were facing a midnight local time deadline. Now, even though suspended President Yoon has managed to escape arrest, at least up until this point, there is still the first trial session for his impeachment process that has been set for next week, and again, that process is what could remove him from office.
