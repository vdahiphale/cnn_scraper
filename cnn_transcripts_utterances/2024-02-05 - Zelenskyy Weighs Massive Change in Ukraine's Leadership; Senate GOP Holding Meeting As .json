OUTFRONT tonight, Zelensky's major move. It could be more than the military commander in chief who loses his job in a massive shakeup in Kyiv and it could happen at any moment. President Zelenskyy telling Italian broadcaster RAI, quote, a reset is necessary. I mean a replacement of a series of state leaders, not just in a single sector, like the military. The word reset, a massive shakeup in Kyiv coming as Putin is trying to court the MAGA GOP in the United States. In fact, one of the leaders of the MAGA GOP is in Moscow tonight. It's the man you see here with the MAGA leader Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, possibly there in Moscow to interview Putin, definitely there as a Putin-supporting celebrity. Just listen to how Russian state media is breathlessly celebrating his visit. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Independent journalist Tucker Carlson who has flown to Russia from the U.S., via Turkey, to Vnukovo Airport. He saw Spartacus ballet at the Bolshoi Theater, had lunch at a nice restaurant, went for a ride around town, road the subway. He charged his smartphone via a USB port and connect to do a fast and free Wi-Fi Internet. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Despite the giant word children written on the roof, more than 200,000 Ukrainian soldiers killed or injured.

(END VIDEOTAPE) FOSTER (on camera):  There has been a long running custom for royals not to reveal their private medical details and the palace protects that fiercely. But King Charles does seem to be taking a slightly different approach. She's worked with cancer charities for many years. He wants to raise awareness around what cancer sufferers go through. I have had an indication tonight that Charles may at some point choose to reveal exactly the cancer that he does have. Right now isn't the moment.",

And Trisha Goddard, British journalist and talk show host, who has covered the royal family extensively. Good to be with both of you. Dr. Eastham, let me start with you. January 26 was when King Charles first went to the hospital about ten days ago when he was very open. It was going to be treated for an enlarged prostate. They had anticipated that would be no issues with that. Indeed, it doesn't appear that there were. He says it's not prostate cancer. Three nights at a London Clinic, now, we are told he has cancer. What does it tell you that the cancer was detected during a procedure like this? I mean, the procedure was a large prostate, but it's not prostate cancer. DR. JAMES EASTHAM, UROLOGY CHIEF, MEMORIAL SLOAN KETTERING CANCER CENTER:  So it tells you that sometime during his evaluation, whether it was prior to his surgery with imaging or during the procedure when he was undergoing evaluation, primarily looking at the prostate and the bladder area, that something was identified. It seems to have been a surprise, meaning not something expected and then it's now being dealt with.",

That says something to most people.TRISHA GODDARD, BRITISH TALK SHOW HOST &amp; JOURNALIST:  Well, I think any parent getting cancer, your children want to be there and remember, it's -- it's kind of like the last straw that broke the camel's back. Lets look at what the royal family has been going through recently. The duchess of York, first of all, had breast cancer and then discovered she had melanoma but then there was a Princess Catherine being in hospital, having an operation. And now his father, it's kind of now it's time to come home. And I think that's natural whatever the prognosis. If you hear the words cancer, you want to be by your family member's side.",

But these words are being mocked by some Chinese people there, tens of thousands flocking to the U.S. social media account in Beijing, calling out the Chinese government.

I've been unemployed for so long, and I have debts. Or another one that said, this message was directed to the U.S. government, Erin, saying, please help us run our stock market. I want to go to the U.S. We know that Chinas in the midst of a real estate downturn, Erin, high youth unemployment, record high youth unemployment, massive deflation happening right now.
