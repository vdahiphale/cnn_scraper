I discuss with DemocraticCongressman Brendan Boyle and former Republican Representative Charlie Dent. Then, from bad to somehow even worse. The life of Afghan women is dealt another blow by a new Taliban edict. What this means for them, with Afghan women's rights activist Mitra Mehran. Also ahead, as Jurassic Park gets another reboot, and Jeff Goldblum takes on the role of Zeus, we look back to Christiane's conversation with the actor, where he's playing a very different part, jazz musician. And welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Paula Newton in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. It's been well more than a month since Joe Biden stepped down and one week on since that jubilant Democratic National Convention. Presidential nominee Kamala Harris finally sat down for her first interview in a CNN exclusive on Thursday evening. Now, so far, reaction to the interview has been a little subdued. Few are saying she set the world alight, but many believe she did, in fact, rise to the occasion enough as not to damage her hard won momentum, which was seen -- which has seen the Democrats chances of retaking the White House absolutely surge. There are 67, just 67 days until the election and only weeks until early voting begins in key swing states like Pennsylvania, which just so happens to be where Former President Trump is campaigning at this hour. We want to dig a little deeper here and dig into the state of Pennsylvania. Joining me now to discuss the state of the race in general and the impact of that interview, Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and former Republican Congressman Charlie Dent comes to us from Avalon, New Jersey. Charlie, your state will forgive you for being on the Jersey Shore, but we do want to have a look at the -- CHARLIE DENT, FORMER U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN:  They're all here.",

Of course, you're going to have the analysts that claim it went very well, but others noted it was a bit underwhelming, and specifically on policy.

I thought she effectively batted down the ethnic smear question, you know, when Trump was, you know, questioning her race, you know, black or Indian, and she just said, you know, next question. Good answer. I thought she missed an opportunity on fracking. You know, she said she's now against the ban, but I thought she could have really done a better job on that question if she just simply said that we need, you know, reliable American natural gas to you -- you know to make this green energy transition, and that's why I am where I am and it's not because of Vladimir Putin's, you know, blackmail tactics. She could have done better on that one. That sounded a little bit like political opportunism. She just changed because of the election. But overall, I thought she came across well. She handled the border question well, too. All she had to do is say that she supported the border deal that Trump torpedoed.

You know, I'm getting whiplash from all Donald Trump's positions on abortion right now. But I thought that overall, the border question was -- that was a good response. She also went into the fact that she supported the bipartisan border deal that was actually negotiated by James Lankford, a very conservative Republican with Democrats, and had a lot of good provisions in there on asylum and adding border patrol agents and so forth.

If I were in Western Pennsylvania and I'll say Northeastern Pennsylvania, areas where they're more traditionally Republican, I would probably be focusing quite a bit more on the economy, jobs, and take the fracking question on a little bit better than she did yesterday and talk about why it's important for America, and I think that would help her. So, she needs to speak to industrial and agricultural Pennsylvania a bit better. She was smart along with Tim Walz to go to Beaver County just to show up there. They're going to lose that county, but they're showing that, you know, we're going to try to cut the margins down and that we're interested. So, I would do that. Trump on the other hand, he's going to pound away on inflation, the economy, and the border. That's what he's going to do. And that would probably be an effective message for him. We know, we don't know how voters are going to react, you know, which set of issues matter the most, but right now, it's pretty tight.

And I think that there's a reason why, literally, every single poll that has asked the favorable unfavorable rating on both VP nominees has shown Tim Walz with a significantly higher favorability rating rather than unfavorability. Meanwhile, every single poll has shown the exact opposite for J. D. Vance. The reason why is because the American people get that Tim Walz is the real deal.

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, it is the end of a week marked by massive Russian aerial attacks. Local authorities report seven people killed and dozens more injured in strikes around Sumy and in Kharkiv. That's after Russia's air assault on Monday targeted energy infrastructure and caused power outages in several cities. Ukraine says one of its top pilots was killed while repelling that attack. That was when a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet crashed. An investigation is now underway, but as Fred Pleitgen reports, the loss of that particular pilot is a major blow for the entire country. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Ukraine called it the largest Russian aerial barrage to date. Moscow's troops launching hundreds of drones and missiles on Monday. Ukraine using U.S.-made F-16 jets to help repel the attack. Now, Kyiv acknowledging one of the F-16s crashed, killing one of Ukraine's top fighter aces. Oleksiy Mes, known by his call sign Moonfish. Ukraine's general command, saying, quote, during the approach to the next target, communication with one of the aircraft was lost. As it turned out later, the plane crashed, the pilot died. Few Ukrainian fighter pilots were more instrumental in lobbying partners to give Ukraine the F-16s than Moonfish. OLEKSIY MES \"MOONFISH,\" UKRAINIAN AIR FORCE PILOT:  This war does not appear to end soon, if west will provide us with some additional jets with some additional Sam's (ph) and we're really looking forward to it. We -- I think we will be able to control our sky for a while. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Moonfish was one of the first Ukrainian pilots instructed on the F-16 around six months of training that normally take years.",

The moment you think of something, it turns. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been asking western allies for the F-16 since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, warning that Ukraine's air force was becoming more and more depleted, and that its old Soviet era planes couldn't match up against Russia's newer aircraft. Finally, last year, several European countries agreed to donate the jets, with the green light from the U.S. as the manufacturing country. Moonfish and another pilot known by the call sign Juice became the faces of the campaign to get the F-16s to Ukraine's skies. Juice was killed in a plane crash just over a year ago before ever flying the jets. On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian Air Force used the F-16 to destroy missiles and drones launched by Russia on Monday, the first time any Ukrainian official confirmed the jets were being used in combat.",

And then it sort of developed into this obsession by the time this shower business started around 9th, 10th grade. I went to Carnegie Mellon University. And around that time I was -- I really was, I must be an actor. And every morning, I would take a shower and the door would steam up and I'd say, please, God, let me be an actor.
