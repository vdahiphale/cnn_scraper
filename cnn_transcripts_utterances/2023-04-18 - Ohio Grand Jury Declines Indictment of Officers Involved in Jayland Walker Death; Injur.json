We move on now with our news. And Akron, Ohio, is bracing for more protests today after a grand jury declined to indict any of the officers who fatally shot 25 year old Jayland Walker last June. All public schools are closed, and the city has set up 24-hour demonstration zones outside city hall and in front of the police department. The mayor, police chief and Walker's family are calling for protesters to remain peaceful. Ohio's Attorney General says the grand jury concluded the officers were legally justified in their use of force as Walker fired on them first from his car, then turned toward the officers when he fled on foot as if he was about to fire again.

He shot through a glass door when he saw this young black teenager on his front porch.
