Violent clashes ongoing at UCLA between pro- Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters. This after school officials declared the protest encampment there illegal and has increased security on campus. Video from the scene. You can see protesters throwing a wooden pallet, fireworks parking cones, even a scooter. These clashes have been ongoing for hours with minimal police intervention, but the chancellor of UCLA has now asked for the LAPD's assistance. A spokesman for the L.A. mayor tweeting a short time ago, quote, LAPD is responding immediately to Chancellor Block's request for support on campus. Joining me now to discuss, CNN senior national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. Juliette, good morning. From what we can tell from the pictures coming out of UCLA, we don't know that police are involved in the clashes there at this point, but we do have a tweet, just a few moments ago from the LAPD HQ that says that the request of UCLA, due to multiple acts of violence within the large encampment on their campus, the LAPD is responding to assist UCLA PD and other law enforcement agencies to restore order and maintain public safety. So, of course, we are seeing it seems a clear risk fonts here, but this has taken some time.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And it shouldn't. I have been arguing the last couple of weeks. Look, whatever our politics are, these universities and colleges have a responsibility to protect all students, including those who are protesting so long as the post-it protest is lawful, which we've had in this case at UCLA.UCLA was sort of ratcheting up its potential actions against the protesters in anticipation of a graduation, I think they wanted to clear it out. But they weren't there yet. So in the meanwhile, it appears just based on what were seeing so far, it's still early that the protesters, the Palestinian protesters or protesters for the Palestinian cause were left relatively vulnerable for others to come in and attack them. It's that kind of vulnerability that law enforcement and colleges and universities have to get serious about now as well as these temperatures are increasing between the two sides. And I can't honestly -- I can't believe how exposed they appear just from the pictures and then its taken this long to get the LAPD in or to get a request in. This is -- this is -- this was avoidable. Had there been just a security perimeter around these protesters?",

      "sentences": "Exactly. So, there have been some disputes about that that representation. We know that the student reporters at Columbia sort of pushing back on that narrative that is being disclosed by Columbia University. Regardless, the arrest will tell us who in fact was in the building. This will be true at UCLA.So, once again, these are if you can just take the emotions out of this, as we should, these are simply security vulnerabilities that colleges and universities and local police have every capacity to be able to secure beforehand. So that that gets to something called access control. UCLA used to live right next door to UCLA. It is -- it would be hard to do access control in all areas of UCLA, but you can certainly do it in areas where there are in encampments or protesters. And these outsiders who may, depending on their number, who come in, are obvious the motivated not simply by their desire to make an issue, but to use the college or university as a focal point for their own activism, that the college or university owes them those outsiders, nothing. But - there's always a but, we delude ourselves. Or we shouldn't think that its only the outsiders. These are for the most part because I've been working on this issue throughout the country now in terms of college universities for the most, these are student-led movements. They represent something that students feel very passionately about. It represents divisions within the United States population at large and colleges have to really think about the kind of outdoor one allowed their students in terms of protests while protecting them both from outsiders, but also now counter protestors that were seeing at UCLA. We've been my personal feeling is we've been a little bit too shy, colleges and universities about using law enforcement appropriately, not to condemn the protests but to protect First Amendment speech and students who might feel vulnerable because of these protests.",

We want to continue to make those distinctions between students who were peacefully protesting, something that they believe strongly in people who are engaged in harassment violence, vandalism, et cetera.Juliet Kayyem -- Juliette, thank you very much. Alright. Coming up here, we're going to have more on New York City police clearing Columbia's campus and removing protesters from Hamilton Hall. And we're going to live on the ground there.

They talked about pepper spray being coming from encampment towards the counter-protesters who were trying to pull those barriers down.A lot of concern, a lot of tension, not a concern that it could blow up into something at any moment. We also spoke to a report on the ground. He said he was surprised no one had been injured or killed up until this point, which does raise the question, why aren't the police there? So, Dylan Winward described how the universe as California has its own police force if they want to bring in the LAPD, they need to invite them in. They had done that hours before but the LAPD, hadn't arrived eventually, of course, they did arrive. So that's a very good sign, but who's in this counter group? We have seen those pro-Israeli flags, but I asked Dylan about exactly who he thought made up the entirety of that group. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But we also know that they were at various points chanting \"USA\" this evening as well. So we just don't know who they are. That the university earlier today, threatened to arrest any outsideactors who came to campus. We believe that many of the counter protesters who were on campus now and who are throwing those fireworks aren't members of the university community as well.
