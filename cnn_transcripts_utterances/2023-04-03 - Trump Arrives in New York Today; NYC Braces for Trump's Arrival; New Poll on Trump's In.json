You can see pictures of his plane on the tarmac at the Palm Beach Airport. That plane, of course, made famous from the 2016 presidential campaign. He is coming here to New York and will likely spend the night in Trump Tower. Tomorrow, Trump will head to the Manhattan courthouse where he is expected to surrender. He will be booked. He will be fingerprinted. After the arraignment, Trump says he will go back to Florida and deliver a speech from Mar-a-Lago tomorrow night.

All right, this just in to CNN, a source says the suspected Chinese spy balloon the U.S. shot down in February was able to capture images and collect some data from U.S. military sites. CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand joins us now from the Pentagon. Natasha, what are you learning? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: Yes, John, so what we're learning is that this Chinese by balloon that hovered over sensitive U.S. military sites back in February before being shot down by the U.S. military, it was able to capture some images and collect some signals intelligence from sensitive U.S. military sites in the United States. Now, importantly, it is not clear to the U.S. government at this point whether the Chinese government was able to remotely wipe the data on that balloon before the U.S. government was able to fully analyze it because, of course, the FBI has been looking at this balloon for the last several months, trying to figure out the extent of what it was able to collect. And we are told that the balloon was able to transmit these images and these signals back to China in real time. So, the U.S. has some idea here of what the Chinese were able to gather about these sensitive military installations, but it is still unclear at this point whether there is information that the Chinese collected that the U.S. does not know about because of that possibility still looming out there that the Chinese government was able to essentially remotely erase the data on the balloon before the U.S. could access it, John.",

But ultimately the U.S. is going to be looking for more information about the origins of this balloon. For example, who was able to navigate it and control it because the U.S. has said that they want to hold someone accountable for this. They do believe that there were elements of the Chinese military that were responsible for making it hover over these sensitive U.S. military sites, but still they are trying to gather more information here about who they can actually pinpoint so that they can not only learn more about China's surveillance program, but also potentially file criminal charges against whoever was responsible for this, John.",
