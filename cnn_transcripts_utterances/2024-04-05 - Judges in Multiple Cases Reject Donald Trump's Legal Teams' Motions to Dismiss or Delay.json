Judge Aileen Cannon dismissing Trump's theory that he had the authority to take classified documents when he left the White House. And in the Georgia election interference case, the judge rejected Trump's argument that the First Amendment protected his efforts to overturn the election.This all comes after earlier this week the judge overseeing Trump's hush money case in New York also denied his attempt at delaying the start of the trial set to begin just 10 days from now on April 15. And adding to Trump's legal woes, the New York attorney general is now questioning whether the $175 million bond he posted in his civil fraud case is financially sound. Joining us now, senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, it appears these cases have to go forward now, correct?",

Donald Trump's team has made a lot of arguments to dismiss or deny these criminal cases against him, have them dismissed or delayed, excuse me. And in the three rulings that we've gotten this week, the judges have said, no, no, no to the Trump arguments.In the Mar-a-Lago case, Judge Cannon refused to dismiss it on the grounds that Trump had argued he had the ability under the Presidential Records Act to claim documents as his own, take them out of the White House. She said that's not a reason for me to get rid of this entire indictment against you. In the Georgia case related to the 2020 election, Judge McAfee said he wasn't going to dismiss it on First Amendment grounds. He said that the defense just hasn't presented any authority that allows Donald Trump to have the speech and conduct that he has and say it was protected political speech. That was what the judge's words were there. And then in the hush money trial still set to go forward in 10 days, Judge Merchan refused to delay it on the grounds of presidential immunity. But as Trump is making all these arguments, as the judges are denying those arguments, his team is carving out little silver linings for him to have when the trials take place. In the Mar-a-Lago documents case and the hush money case, both of those the judges have said maybe these issues could come back later and we could talk about them at a later date. Judge Cannon specifically saying this could be something that could come up again, this Presidential Records Act issue and Donald Trump's claims about personal records.",

Should we go forward and ask this judge for a gag order against Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, and part of their concern is that Willis is continuing to speak publicly about the case. She's running for reelection at the same time she's presiding over the prosecution of this case. And in a number of instances, she has made some race-related remarks, including remarks that drew this rebuke from the judge.

One of those details is that they thought they saw some things slung over the shoulder of one of the people inside one of those SUVs. Now, the IDF is also saying that because it was nighttime, this is outside of the report, because it was nighttime, they couldn't identify these vehicles as World Central Kitchen vehicles, even though World Central Kitchen says that they were coordinating with the IDF. So yes, there are separate details that are now trickling out that if you will, sort of not muddy the water, but add a level of, okay, here are some reasons why this happened, and the IDF are very clear, this was a grave mistake. It did happen, they say, outside the protocols of the IDF chain of command. They have disciplined people.

I am not saying he is going to pivot his philosophy, but theirapproach and where they go after it, I absolutely believe that because it is the smart thing to do and he does want to win. But also understand, a lot of this campaign is going to happen in the courtroom, right? Every time he is in a courtroom now, he is -- he kind of plays himself as the victim. His poll numbers go up. There are so many other factors that are kind of going to come in here, but believes me, most Republicans that vote in the Republican primary are going to end up voting for Donald Trump because it is not about Trump, it is about a Republican administration, it is about a GOP administration. It is about changing the political culture in Washington, and it is about the fact that Biden, while a lot of folks might have voted for him as this moderate is clearly no moderate. He is clearly being controlled by these extremists, and that is driving a political culture that nobody wants to see in America. So that's where Biden is really blowing it. It isn't we are all for Trump. It is, we want a political change and voting for him and that type of administration puts more opportunity in the seats of individuals, or states, or communities as opposed to this, one size fits all we are going to tell you how you should live your life mentality that the Democrats have been giving us.",

The next Republican governor I want to take my seat or to win congressional seats or to win mayoral seats or even school board seats. But what he says at the top of the ticket really kind of defines us and not always for the best, as a lot of us have learned. So I am a little concerned about where he is going to go with that.
