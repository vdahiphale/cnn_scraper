KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  You have members in your conference that won't let you vote for appropriation bills, doesn't want an omnibus and won't vote for a stopgap measure.

But I want to be very clear, this was not me, in any way, trying to delay any vote. So, that's the latest from Bowman explaining what happened.

Let me read you the statement from the president released yesterday evening. He said, \"Tonight, bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate voted to keep the government open, preventing an unnecessary crisis that would have inflicted needless pain on millions of hardworking Americans.\" He went to say though that we should have never been in this position in the first place.Now, over the course of the day, White House officials had been in touch with lawmakers as all of these fast-moving developments were unfolding, including in direct conversations with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Now, as you noted earlier, there are disaster relief funds included in this bill. That's important because those are funds that the White House has been talking about for some time. They had been running almost close to empty, which meant that they had to delay recovery projects that really only focus on life-saving issues and support. And so, now, they will have those funds, which is some relief for this White House and this administration. But what it doesn't include is Ukraine funding, something that the president has talked about at length. And we've learned that officials were disappointed by that and they had reached out to lawmakers about making sure that that was included, including a top Pentagon official. But in the end, that was just not part of what was included this this bill, although a White House official tells me that they fully anticipate that the house speaker will eventually introduce a stand-alone bill to provide Ukraine that funding. But the bottom line here is that this caps a dizzying week where millions of federal workers thought they wouldn't be going into work tomorrow.",

I've dealt with coming in weeks on end where before we even start the day, we are already short staffed, we're already working in the hole. And that has progressed constantly. It's escalating.

He also canceled business certificates for several Trump entities. James is still seeking to hold the Trumps individually accountable and prove they conspired, falsified business records, issued false financial statements and engaged in insurance fraud. The state said it plans to call 28 witnesses, including the former president, his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and Ivanka Trump, as well as Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, whose testimony on Capitol Hill sparked the investigation. Trump has called the investigation politically motivated and has denied any wrongdoing.

And of course, this is exactly what Putin has been waiting for. He's been waiting for the West to be divided, the West to be wavering. And when that becomes a reality, Putin will think that he has scored a victory and that he can then prosecute the war to a much greater extent than he's been able to do that so far.And if that becomes a reality, then the situation on the battlefield is going to be much, much worse than it has been up to this point. WALKER: Yes, I mean, let's talk about the situation on the battlefield. What is the latest? I mean, we're hearing a lot about Russia bombarding Ukrainian cities and some of the heaviest fighting has been happening in Zaporizhzhia and the Donetsk regions in recent weeks. What's the status?",

So, the problem that we run into is that we've waited too long to provide the weapons and the ammunition that has been provided to the Ukrainians in order to prosecute this counteroffensive.But without this, the lines would have collapsed. They would have gotten much, much more encircled around Kyiv and other major cities in Ukraine. And it would have been a real problem for the Ukrainians to maintain the viability of their fighting forces. At this particular point, in essence, yes, it looks like a stalemate, but the very fact that Ukraine has been able to protect its sovereignty for a large portion of its country, that of course is a major achievement for them, particularly when we remember what things were like at the beginning of this invasion back in February of 2022 when it looked like the Russians were going to take Kyiv in a few days.",
