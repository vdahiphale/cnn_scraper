The numbers that you're talking all reducing our deficit. But, really, so there's two ways of looking at a tariff. You can do it as a moneymaking instrument, or you can do it as something to get the companies. Now if you want the companies to come in, the tariff has to be a lot higher than 10 percent, because 10 percent is not enough. They're not going to do it for 10. But you make a 50 percent tariff, they're going to come in. Let me tell you the other thing about tariffs that's great. Our steel companies, as you know, three, four years ago, they're all -- when I was in office, I saw a man from a big steel company and he was devastated. I knew him for a long time and it's been a tough business. It was a great business many years ago. And I would not let U.S. Steel be sold to Japanese, by the way.

We were going to lose all our steel companies, because China, as you remember, was dumping steel at levels that nobody's ever seen before. And I put a 50 percent tax on that and a tariff on that, all dumped steel. And it was also bad steel, what they call dirty steel. It wasn't good steel, which is a bad thing for structural components of buildings and planes and things like that. They were dumping crap into our country. And I put a 50 percent tariff. I started at 25. I raised it to 50, because the 25 didn't quite do it. I raised it to 50 and that did it. They stopped dumping steel. And I saved our steel mills by having that. We saved it. We saved our steel. Now, what was left, because we have lost so much. But there are certain companies you have to have. There are certain things you have to have. Steel, you have to have. If you go to war -- there's a possibility you go to war. I kept us out of war. I was the only president in 82 years that kept you out of a war, except I defeated ISIS, but I inherited that one.

You're paying -- Germany's paying billions of dollars a month. And we're supposed to protect you against a guy that you're paying all this money to. So is there something wrong with my thinking? So he's building a pipeline to Germany, and we're spending -- and, by the way, until I got there, we were spending almost 100 percent for NATO, because we had all these delinquent countries. They weren't paying. When I got there, I said, you know what? And, by the way, my biggest fan is Stoltenberg, just leaving, secretary-general of NATO.

And the former President Trump, we know, loves tariffs, and he went all in today talking about how great tariffs are. He called tariffs the most beautiful word in the dictionary. He said tariffs need a public relations firm to help it. And he said that tariffs are going to be a way to bring companies back to our country. At one point, he even recalled a recent conversation he said he had with an auto manufacturing company and he said that he threatened massive tariffs on imported cars, cars that were made in Mexico. He said 100, 200, 2000 percent, the highest tariffs in history. Now, in the past, Trump's campaign has said he's being hyperbolic when he uses numbers that high, of course, but still this just shows how much he loves tariffs. At one point, the Bloomberg editor in chief warned that he could be pushing the United States into the biggest trade war since Smoot-Hawley, right before the Great Depression, made the Great Depression worse, actually. And Trump again defended his tariff policy. He also was asked a lot of questions about how expensive his economic agenda is, right, because there's estimates out there that his plan could cost something like $7.5 trillion. But he pushed back on that and he dismissed the idea that \"The Wall Street Journal\" and others have raised questions about how much debt would be added. He said, what does \"The Wall Street Journal\" know? They have been wrong about everything. And then he attacked the moderator and said the moderator has been wrong about everything. One last interesting point was, towards the end, he was asked a lot about the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell.",

He was speaking to the issues.I thought the moderator was doing a good job in terms of pressing him on the specific questions he was asking and then trying to argue the counterpoint, particularly when it came to tariffs and the inflationary effects and other impacts it would have, so a good discussion. I know you brought up, Boris, the question about whether Trump has been talking with Putin. Look, I think in general, world leaders talk to one another once they leave office. Friendships develop. What's unusual in this case would be that Trump is talking to Vladimir Putin, who is arguably our adversary. I mean, what he's doing around the world in terms of his horrific onslaught against Ukraine now for over 2.5 years, the cyber operations he's conducting against the United States and our allies, he's an adversary. So that raises major questions, which Bob Woodward apparently in his latest book said that Putin and Trump continue a dialogue. And so it'd be very interesting to know, what are they really talking about? So that kind of piqued my curiosity, of course.",
