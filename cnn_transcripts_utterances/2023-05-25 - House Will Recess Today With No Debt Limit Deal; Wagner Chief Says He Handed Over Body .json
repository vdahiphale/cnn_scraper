If we could -- if we could freeze spending levels to 2022, like the original proposal, then that's something I believe the vast majority of Americans can get on board with. But at some point, we have to say do we want to run off the edge of this cliff at 80 miles per hour or 75 miles per hour?We have to have responsible measures in place that hold both sides accountable when they spend too much. This is one way to do that -- to rein in out-of-control spending that was started by Democrats and Republicans alike pointing fingers across the aisle today, like Hakeem Jeffries just did, doesn't win anything for the American people. We ought to be talking. Everybody on both sides should be sitting down. I have full faith, and Kevin McCarthy is our leader to negotiate a deal with the president. And I feel positive about what he's doing right now and have full faith in his ability to negotiate.",

I'm curious, are you concerned at all that if this happens, if the -- if we run past the extent, if Fitch would downgrade the U.S. credit rating, that Republicans will face blame or backlash? And I'm not saying only Republicans, but that Republicans will face backlash since it is true that Republicans have supported clean debt ceiling increases in the very recent past.",

You know, Republicans have added a lot of money to that $32 trillion of debt, so they're not innocent in this thing. But at some point, we have to say, we have to -- we have to hit pause.And there's no reason to default. There's no reason to lose our credit rating. If the date comes and goes off June first, what that means is we need to prioritize our spending. And guess what, in terms of tax revenues, we get 11 times the amount needed to pay the interest on the debt. So we'd pay that first and then pay other bills second, third, and fourth, and on down the line. It just means we reprioritize how we pay America's bills until we negotiate a deal.

The governor of your state just signed just moments ago today into law a six-week abortion ban. I think we're showing folks live some pictures of that signing that happened with the governor there.This has been a long fight in the state legislature we've covered closely. A bipartisan group of women senators even standing up to fight against the six-week ban, but the governor is signing it. As a Republican yourself who has stood up against the restrictions that we're seeing like this, what is your reaction? What should people think about your state today?",

You know, Bannon here you know, is on trial for charges relating to this border wall fundraising scheme. They had -- he and his co-conspirators allegedly had gotten donors to donate to this campaign called We Build the Wall. The idea was to direct the money to construct a wall along the southern U.S. border. But prosecutors allege that Bannon and others diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars of those millions of dollars that they raised and line their own pockets with that money. Now, Bannon has pleaded not guilty to the six counts he's been charged with. Those include money laundering, a scheme to the fraud, and conspiracy. You know, he will only come back in court back in early May where the judge will have a motions hearing ahead of the trial that started. Of course, you know, Trump and Bannon's relationship has been close when Bannon was first charged on the federal charges in this case. In Trump's last days in office, he pardoned Bannon. And when Bannon was leaving the courthouse today, he was asked who he would endorse in this coming presidential election. And he said I've already endorsed President Trump, Rahel.",
