All of us across the United States, either at normal or above normal, especially across the South, as you just saw. Dallas, 103; Atlanta, 95 today. Same for you in D.C.

So, the overnight lows that are going to be in like the 80s or 90s. So, we don't get that cooling during the overnight hours. So, then we get even hotter through the afternoon. With that being said, excessive heat alerts are in effect. Excessive heat warnings for Phoenix, back across the central plains, places like St. Louis, D.C. also included. There's some relief for D.C. Our temperatures are dropping just slightly below normal as we come into Monday, and Tuesday, and Wednesday. With a few clouds, we'll get some shade too.

It was 49 hours to be exact of how long she was missing. She was on the side of the road when she called 9-1-1 and said that she saw a toddler on the side of the road.When police arrived, they found Carlee Russell's car, but they didn't see a sign of her or that toddler. 49 hours later, when she showed up to her parents' home, she had a story about a man with orange hair who had kidnapped her along with a woman who she said she'd never seen before. At some point, she was able to break away from this story that she was telling police, and they were able to discover that what she was saying was a hoax. Police also went through her social media, and they were able to figure out, also through her phone and her searches, that she had looked up a one-way bus ticket and travel outside the city and the movie, \"Taken.\" Listen to the police chief talking about the charges he decided to place against Carlee Russell.

It comes after years of lobbying from lawmakers and victims' advocates, who have long argued that these cases were not taken seriously, or that the victims were subject to retaliation within their chain of command. For that reason, in mid-2021, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced that the Pentagon would support a move of these prosecutions outside the chain of command. He presented a set of options to President Biden to do just that. And lawmakers and later defense spending bills, set those changes in motions with a deadline of this December to do so. John Kirby, who is the spokesman for the National Security Council tell CNN that what happened in those two years was a lot that it took time to establish a brand-new military justice system to create these offices, to hire for these offices and to secure funding for them, and said that the president is five months ahead of deadline. The White House expects this new military trial council to be up and running by December. Victor and Amara?",

We don't want to lose those here in Florida. So, from a protection point of view, the reefs are extremely important.
