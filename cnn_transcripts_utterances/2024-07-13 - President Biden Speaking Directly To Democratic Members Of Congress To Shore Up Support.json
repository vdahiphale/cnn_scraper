      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, we begin this hour with President Biden's latest push to save his reelection bid. Today, he's taking a short break from the campaign trail as he scrambles behind the scenes to shore up support from members of his own party who are unsure if the race should continue for him. Over the next few hours, Biden expects to hold calls with groups of moderate and progressive members of Congress in an effort to convince them he can win in November. So far 20 Democratic lawmakers have called for Biden to step aside, but at a rally in Michigan last night, Biden was defiant, vowing to stay in the race. On Monday, he returns to the campaign trail and well sit down for another high-stakes television news interview. For more on this, let's bring in Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, walk us through the president's strategy to convince his fellow Democrats that he should stay in the race.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a strategy that breaks down in two ways. One, privately, it's the president working the phones to get the Democratic Party in line and behind him going into November. The second part of that, though, is publicly making sure that the focus is on his Republican rival, Donald Trump, and the difference between his red record and that of, again, his Republican rival.Now, the way this looks behind the scenes is, again, the president reaching out to key groups of lawmakers. This is part of an outreach campaign that has been the case over the course of the week. The president is speaking to multiple allies to try to reassure them and calm their nerves about his candidacy, and that includes two more calls today. Now, again, to sort of look back at the week briefly, all of these concerns culminated in a meeting between President Biden and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies on Thursday. That was an opportunity for the House minority leader to convey the concerns of his caucus, do so bluntly. But according to sources, he did not provide his endorsement of the president. Now, that just goes to show how much more work needs to be done by the president to try to listen to the concerns of the caucus while also reassure them. And the solo news conference he did on Thursday was part of that in showing that he still had the vigor to take on about 19 questions. It was a press conference that lasted just under an hour, and by most accounts, much stronger than his debate performance. But even the next day, so yesterday, the president spoke with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and in that call, Representative Mike Levin directly asked the president to step aside. So again, just another example of what is playing out here even as the campaign tries to reassure it's allies. The president, of course, hitting the campaign trail next week to Texas and Nevada to make sure he can shore up voters and supporters along the way.",

It comes just ahead of the Republican National Convention that kicks off Monday in Milwaukee. All eyes are on Trump as we await his pick for vice president. The most likely candidates right now, Senators Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum.

Everything he was saying about going with his instinct, going with his gut, the fact that he is still mulling this decision over, that is everything that has closest advisers have been telling me for the past several days, that really his decision and his thinking on who he wants to choose could change day by day depending on whom he sees out their that's defending him on television as well as who was in his ear lobbying different candidates.Now, I do want to just give you some insight into how the convention lineup is giving us a little bit of a moment to read some of the tea leaves on who he may be leaning toward. We know that Donald Trump Junior and Tucker Carlson are both slated to speak at the convention, and both of those men had been pushing for J.D. Vance. Now, I can also tell you we've seen Donald Trump kind of tease that out. A lot of people were wondering if he would select Marco Rubio on Tuesday when he was in Miami. All to say that Donald Trump and his team consistently say it's still unclear. All of these men are in the running. And so we're waiting now to see when this announcement will be and exactly who he's going to choose. Fred?",

He's drawing a stark contrast between himself and a future Trump administration. That's what everybody wants to see, from regular voters to senators and congresspeople on the Hill. Ultimately, that's the concern. Does the president have the stamina to be able to do this between now and November? And the more he's out there doing it, as opposed to showing it, telling it, right. This is, we have to do it. You have to just go out there and do it.So these calls that he's making, if that's what he has to do for his politics, that's fine. But I think the more effective thing would just be to continue taking the fight directly to Donald Trump as he did yesterday in Michigan.",

They want this to be about policy. What happens after November, not necessarily performance on the debate stage? How are they going to try and redirect now against the arguments that have been made and kind of solidified about age? How do they now redirect the arguments on policy? What would come next?",

They're not with a national ban on abortion. They're not on the eradication of democracy. They're not on pulling our troops out of NATO. They're not on giving Ukraine away to the Russians or giving Taiwan away to the Chinese in exchange for more patents for Ivanka Trump. God knows, everything that that Trump stands is not what the majority of the American people stand for. But you need somebody out there to be able to do that.Look, I'm sitting here actually in Charlie Dent's former Congressional district, which Congressman, you know full well is the swingiest. I'm in North Hampton, Pennsylvania, the swingiest county, the swingiest state in the nation. And it's places like this that are going to make the difference between a win or a loss for Donald Trump or for Joe Biden. And so I would strongly recommend that the president come to Pennsylvania, come to Michigan, come to Georgia and take it straight and directly to the American people. Enough with trying to get Congresspeople on the phone to calm down. Nobody is going to calm down because Congressman Dent is absolutely right. These people are worried. Susan Wild, the congresswoman from the district that I'm here right now is in a tough race. She always is. she's clearly worried about making sure that Donald Trump does not do so well in Pennsylvania that it swamps people like her, or the Senator Pat Toomey, or the senator who is running for reelection here in Pennsylvania. So what you need ultimately is to make sure that Donald Trump is not able to make the case for Joe Biden, which is what's been happening right now while the president has been behind closed doors at the White House. The president needs to take the fight directly to the American people. Good start yesterday, cannot stop, not for one day. He needs to continue doing this over and over and over again.",

I think he'd rather let Joe Biden stew a little bit further in his own muck, because obviously the Democrats are in disarray, and why change the subject? So I think Trump will wait as long as he can. Frankly, I suspect Republicans wish their convention were not this week so Democrats could still fight publicly about their nominee.But if anything is going to happen this week in Milwaukee, I suspect they're going to try to present, if it's possible, a softer side to Donald Trump and maybe have a little bit less of the showman the noise it's maker, the angry guy, just because of the Democrat dysfunction right now. And I think most of the public right now sees both of these candidates, one is too old, and one is too dangerous. That was the case before the debate. That case has been simply validated and amplified since the debate. So Trump right now in Milwaukee, I think they're going to keep this thing as low key as possible. They'll make that announcement of the vice president whenever they're going to make it. But I think later is probably smarter.",

This is typically used with bombs over 500 pounds. It is also used for those 2,000-pound bombs that we know the United States has supplied to Israel in the past and which creates very, very large craters. And indeed in this instance, we can see that the crater at the scene, the plume of smoke is indicative of a munition, a very heavy munition that was indeed used in this strike. Not the first time, of course, that Israel has used us provided munitions, and also not the first time, we should note, that Israel has tried to carry out a targeted strike to kill Mohammed Deif. He escaped assassination attempts in the past, in 2002, as well as in 2014. And as of now, it is not clear whether or not he has survived this latest one. Fred?",

So Lucy, you first. How miserable is it for people there in south Texas? LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is hot, it is muggy, and there is mounting frustration both at CenterPoint, the utility responsible for restoring the power, as well as government leaders as Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, describes itself as the energy capital of the world, it continues to be crippled by these blackouts. Now progress is being made. CenterPoint is promising that about 85 percent of their customers should get power back by the end of the day tomorrow, but that still leaves hundreds of thousands to make do while they wait for that help to calm. And that means, of course, no A.C., no refrigeration, no way to power medical devices. We already saw one woman lost her life when her oxygen machine ran out of battery. We know that emergency rooms and the city are overwhelmed. In some places there are cots lining the hallways. It's a very dire situation. Then, of course, as often happens with natural disasters, it is those who are already living paycheck to paycheck, those who are already struggling who are the most impacted. Now we've seen a lot of volunteer efforts to get food and water to people. There's been pop-up relief centers and drives set up all across the city both today and yesterday.
