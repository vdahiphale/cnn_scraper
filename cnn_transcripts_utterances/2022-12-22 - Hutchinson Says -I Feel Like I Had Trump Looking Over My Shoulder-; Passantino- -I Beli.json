New transcripts provide intriguing insight into the January 6 investigation and that includes testimony from star witness, Cassidy Hutchinson. And there's more to come as we wait for the committee's unexpectedly delayed final report.Our historic visit and impassioned plea to Congress and the American people. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy vows to never surrender, but says his country needs more help to defeat the Russians. And a step forward on Capitol Hill, Senators now in the process of holding votes as lawmakers are raised to pass a massive $1.7 trillion spending bill ahead of tomorrow's deadline to prevent a partial government shutdown. Up first, the lengths the Trump world went to, to try to influence the January 6 committee's star witness, this is according to the witness herself. The panel has just put out transcripts of former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony. This as we're expecting the committee to release a full report of its findings today. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now. What can you tell us?",

Joining me now to discuss CNN's Lauren Fox, POLITICO's Alex Burns, Francesca Chambers of USA Today, and CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams.Wow, remarkable. This is under oath from the committee's star witness, Cassidy Hutchinson. It's her fifth interview with the committee. And she really lays out this picture, Alex, of a pressure campaign coming out of all ends of the Trump world that she felt indebted to them and was repeatedly told to be loyal that there could be jobs for her. And then of course, we know she left and switch lawyers. What stands out to you?",

      "sentences": "Look, I think that what stands out to me. First of all, we had heard some of these elements from the committee and a pretty vague fashion right, that witnesses felt intimidated or deterred from speaking in one way or another. What really sort of pops out to me just as a political reporter is that we've known for the longest time that this is how Trump's world operates, not necessarily with witnesses who are testifying under oath, but just pretty comprehensively.If you're a Republican candidate running somewhere in the country, and you want his support, you need to bend the knee in some way. If you're a governor who's looking for a ventilators for your state, or disaster aid of some kind, you need to make a show of loyalty. So, I think there's something that's not terribly shocking that this is how lawyers close to Donald Trump would be interacting with just people generally. But obviously, the risks and consequences of behaving like this are totally different right now. And I think you do get coming out of this committee, a picture of former President Trump and the people around him as not necessarily having adapted to a world where there are suddenly real consequences for their actions, where they don't control the Justice Department or the mechanics of congressional investigation.",

And we should note again, this is Cassidy Hutchinson, speaking under oath to the committee. Stefan Passantino has released a statement, he says, I believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.So clearly, he has another side to this, but in the transcript, Elliot, it says, everything's going to be OK. We're taking care of you. This is what Hutchinson described. Passantino was saying, quote, just downplay your position. It's not fair that Mark Meadows, a former boss, the chief of staff to Trump, put you in this position. We just want to focus on protecting the president. We all know you're loyal. Let's just get you in and out. And this day will be easy, I promise.",

      "sentences": "Oh, Lord, where to begin. This is like first year of law school, criminal law class playing out because of all the sorts of issues this raises. Number one, what you have is knowledge on the part of the former president that he lost the election. That is relevant to an obstruction charge. It's relevant to a conspiracy to defraud the United States charge.And it's relevant to this false statement charge that they're talking about former president that he knew he lost, right? And what you're going to see from the committee, I think, is rolling out all these statements where people brought to the former president, the knowledge that he lost, right? Two, obstruction of justice. Any of these people who are directing a witness to say something or not say something on the stand in the event that it frustrates. Or what the goal of frustrating the investigation is itself an act of obstruction of justice. So, it's not just the former president here, it's Passantino and others around him who might have been trying to influence your testimony. So, it this is quite serious. And because a lot of these statements are what you'd call hearsay, it's one person saying, what another person says. They're piling them up because you need to be able to get just one of them. Yes, you got to corroborate, which you can't get them by themselves.",

And again, a lot of this is going to play out politically, play out on the presidential campaign trail.When you go back to the testimony, though, I want to talk about Hope Hicks for a moment. She was someone who was so close to the president. The president saw her as like a daughter. And she was also on the record saying that she told people that he had essentially laws that tried to get him to speak out on January 6, and that is so critical. She is someone who when she left the first time, I mean, he did a whole colonnade, walk with her, which is something that's usually reserved for foreign leaders, for instance.

If you pick this fight with the Biden administration and you're not really, really prepared to go round after round on why it's not responsible to send more money. You know, one thing that we have actually not seen this president do a whole lot of so far is these grand White House photo - that to showcase the power of the presidency, power the American military, it's the kind of thing. I think, sort of folks our age, remember very well from the Bush years and the early Obama years of what it means to have a president who's seen as a strong commander in chief.
