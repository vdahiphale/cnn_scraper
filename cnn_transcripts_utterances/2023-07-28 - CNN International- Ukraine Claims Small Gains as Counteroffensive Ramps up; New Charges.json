We're talking about settlements, we're talking about the consolidation of gains which is essentially means that Ukrainian forces take territory and then they have to actually solidify that they control that territory.Why is it so slow? Why is it taking so long? Well, just as Ukraine has been preparing for months, so has Russia I've video to show you of one of the areas. This is a Dragon's Teeth defensive line that's been built by the Russians. If you look at that video, what you are looking at right there is concrete and rebar pyramid that are three rows deep. These types of defensive lines stretch hundreds of miles. And of course, they make it impossible for tanks to go through. This is just one kind of defensive method that's been put up by Russians. You also have mines that have been laid into place you have Russian forces that have been mobilizing themselves shelling Ukrainian position. They're also backed by air support. Remember, Ukrainian forces are reporting in some places along the battlefield that it's like a hellscape. First, they're shelled by Russian forces then they're struck by Russian helicopters with bombs. It keeps Ukrainian forces so far out in many places that they're beyond the range of even shelling Russian positions. So this is a huge logistical challenge. I mean, you also have to remember you have hundreds of miles of frontlines that we're talking about the length of Ukraine, and what Ukraine is trying to do right now is, of course, no sudden moves. It has limited resources. It has a limited number of troops. It has a limited arsenal. It needs to focus that on softening Russian targets. And that's exactly what's happening in the south in a place like -- , where Ukrainian forces have been very focused on hitting Russian artillery positions, Russian weapons depots, and you're going to continue to see that strategy. Nothing can happen overnight here it requires Ukraine finding vulnerabilities capitalizing on those vulnerabilities and slowly but surely working its way into trying to cut some of those defensive positions. I just showed you.",

They shouted -- down with France. And these are pro military protesters. They support this military takeover because some of them feel that President Mohamed Bazoum was a puppet of the West. In the last few hours also, we've seen a state television a general claiming to be the leader of a Transitional Council that is the Brigadier General, Abdourahamane Tchiani. He has shown up on state television there claiming to be the leader of that we're still working to confirm exactly who is in charge of. We know that the military, the Army Command did support the military man that took over the country. So there's a lot to sift through here.

And it's not clear if this was a presentation that was given to this leadership group in a written form or for something from Putin on videotape.But he did acknowledge North Korea support of Russia during the Ukraine war. In fact, if we look at some of the reporting from state media, it goes on to say that Russia feels Putin feels that this support emboldened the two nation's determination to cope with Western nations it gives them some empowerment. So this comes at a time as North Korea presents a very bold military parade. It comes at a time when we have seen delegates in North Korea from both Russia and from China. And this is also a moment in time where for the next few months or last few weeks, we have seen increased tension in this region. It was on July 12, that we saw North Korea launch an intercontinental ballistic missile it was in the air for 74 minutes. It is seen as significant a type of missile that some analysts feel could reach the United States. In addition, in recent days, we have seen an American submarine in the waters of Korea, South Korea, and a submarine that has nuclear capabilities. That mere presence, Max, has also drawn approval or disapproval I should say disapproval kind of nation from North Korea.",

They can nullify, and appointments like the Supreme Court would be able to nullify an appointment by President Biden, not by saying that there's a conflict of interest that exists today in Israel. That it's undo process that exists today in Israel, that it's not proportional that exists in Israel. But just by saying, we don't think this appointment is reasonable. That doesn't exist in America.
