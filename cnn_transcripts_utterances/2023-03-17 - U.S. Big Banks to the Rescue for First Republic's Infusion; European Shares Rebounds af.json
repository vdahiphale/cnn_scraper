Banks were all holding long-dated securities, treasury securities, government-backed agency mortgage securities. And we all know that when interesting rates are on the rise, the value of those securities declines. So this is something that the fed really should have been on top of, going back a year.

Officials tell CNN Russia has recovered some small debris from the drone, which crashed the waters south of Ukraine. U.S. has also released a video that it that says shows the Russians are lying about forcing down the aircraft.We have more now from CNN's Natasha Bertrand. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER (voice-over): This is the moment just before a Russian fighter jet collided with a U.S. drone over the Black Sea. The thick plumes of smoke, jet fuel being vented by Russian SU-27 as it passes. We don't see the moment of impact, but here's the propeller of the MQ-9 Reaper drone undamaged and here it is later, clearly damaged. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It had to have been some kind of an impact. And I don't think, you know, while the fuel spill on top of the aircraft, on top of the MQ-9 would have been significant, I don't think it would have caused that damage. BERTRAND (voice-over): The newly-declassified footage appears to directly contradict Russia's claim that the aircraft did not make physical contact. ANATOLY ANTONOV, RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: There was no collision, you see that, and the problem is that we did not contact to this drone. JOHN KIRBY, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL STRATEGIC COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS (voice-over):  The Russians have been just flat out lying. Flat out lied about their accounts. BERTRAND (voice-over): The U.S. has not yet determined whether the pilots intended to directly hit the drone, forcing the U.S. military to crash the drone into the black sea some 80 nautical miles from land. GEN. MARK MILEY, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN: We know the intercept was intentional. We know that the aggressive behavior was intentional, we also know very unprofessional and very unsafe. The actual contact of the fixed wing Russian fighter with our UAV, the physical contact of those two, not sure yet. BERTRAND (voice-over): But CNN is learning that the Russian pilots did not go rogue. U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence say the pilots were ordered to harass the drone by senior officials and Russia's defense ministry. For now, the drone's wreckage fate is unclear. The U.S. has no naval assets in the Black Sea that can readily retrieve it and the Russians have already reached the crash site and recovered some small pieces of debris. But the U.S. took steps to wipe the drone software, officials tell CNN, making it highly unlikely that Moscow will glean anything valuable from its remnants.",

These are Soviet air jets that were about 30 years old. So, they were near the end of their life span, if you will.Now, Poland saying they're sprucing them up. They're going to send them, of course, to Ukraine as quickly as possible. You can't really emphasize just how much Poland has been impacted by this war. Russian missiles have landed right up near that border. It was Poland that had to receive millions of refugees, millions of people displaced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. So it seems quite logical to see that Poland is making this precedent setting, this precedent a meeting this long standing Ukrainian request for fighter jets for aircrafts for planes to support its military's fight. But the question is, does this put more pressure on other allies, on other NATO members, and particularly the United States? You'll remember, it was just a few weeks ago that President Biden had to respond directly and publicly to President Zelenskyy's repeated pleas for F-16 fighter jets from the United States. President Biden saying, at the time, that the U.S. military had assessed it was not necessary that the fighter jets were not needed by Kyiv's army at the time. And now, top U.S. officials emphasizing, that is still the case, despite Poland's move. I want to read you something that John Kirby, a top U.S.  official, said in response to this announcement from Poland. \"It doesn't change our calculus with respect to F-16s. These are sovereign decisions for any country and we respect those sovereign decisions.\" What's important to note here in the bigger context, Kim, is just how extraordinary this is. At the beginning of the conflict, a decision to provide fighter jets would be seen as escalatory, would be concerning to NATO and other allies because, it would be viewed, that may be potentially Moscow would see that as direct participation in the conflict, and that would further provoke the war. But what's -- what we're learning as we go through this conflict, is what was seen as escalatory and dangerous at the beginning is now necessary and required on the front lines. You're seeing allies really becoming more and more flexible as they meet the demands on those battlefields.",

Thursday, the French parliament was meant to vote on the new law, which had already been passed by the French senate.But before the vote in the lower house, Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said the government had counted votes and realize that it would lose. The prime minister went before the national assembly and announced that there would be no vote. That the law would be enacted by decree. Something allowed by the French constitution, but something that further enraged the opposition. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BORNE (through translation):  We cannot bet on the future of our pensions. This reform is necessary. It's also because I am attached to our social model, and because I believe in parliamentary democracy. It is your reform on parliament text for you to compromise between the two assemblies that I am ready to engage my responsibility. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that was certainly the sense we got yesterday from the Finnish president who was visiting the province of Kahramanmaras, one of the hardest hits in the epicenter of last month's earthquake.He said, according to Turkish state media, told reporters that he believes President Erdogan has important messages to convey in today's meeting. And today is going to be a long day for both leaders. They are set to meet to discuss bilateral relations. And there is expected to be a joint press conference later this afternoon around 9:45 am eastern time. And chief of course among the priorities to be discussed is expected to be Finland's bid to join NATO. And over the last few months we have seen Turkey expressing its reservations around Finland's accession to the alliance. And in particular, Sweden's accession to the alliance. Both nations of course expressing their intentions early on last year to join the alliance together. Now, Turkish president has accused Sweden in particular of harboring and being too lax when it comes to groups Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization namely Kurdish organizations in the country. But we have seen over the last few months, intense negotiations. That was acknowledged by the Finnish president yesterday, telling reporters during his visit to Kahramanmaras, that Finland has done everything that is expected when it comes to making that bid to join the NATO alliance, including taking part in negotiations with Turkey. And of course, we have also seen some policy changes in both Helsinki and in Stockholm. So, this will certainly be a key focus of the talks today. And as you said there, we have heard some hints from President Erdogan as well as the Finnish president just on Wednesday. President Erdogan told reporters that Turkey will fulfill its promise and do as its needed. And so, some suggestions there that perhaps. And of course, we also heard from the Finnish president, according to his office, telling reporters that it was understood that in the instance that Turkey should agree to ratify Finland's succession to NATO, the Turkish president would request a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders. And that Finland had in turn accepted that invitation. So, this is certainly expected to be a focus of today's talks. We will wait for the press conference later this afternoon, a joint press conference between the two leaders. And of course, there are still many questions around whether or not this might lead to Turkey softening its position on Sweden too.",
