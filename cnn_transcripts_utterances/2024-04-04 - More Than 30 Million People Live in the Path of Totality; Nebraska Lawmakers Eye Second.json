And people are so excited about this. So talk a little bit more about the psychological benefit of that collective experience. What does that do to people?",

First of all, when the light changes and the temperature drops, what we see is that fight or flight phenomenon that happens, right? Where it releases a epinephrine, we feel excitement, but a little bit of fear because we don't quite know what's going on. But once it actually does happen, and then we're in that darkness, and we know that we're safe with everyone else around us, then that fear turns into a euphoria.And it really does help us connect with other people. We're there to share this and protect one another. The other thing that we tend to see, Brianna, is that people with depression live in the past, right? For the most part, they can't get over some of the past. People who have anxiety, like I do, they're always thinking about the future. But something like this total eclipse, it keeps you right here in reality, in the here and now. It snaps us back into the present, as some psychologists will tell you. So we're much less anxious and worried and depressed during that time. And I would venture to say, we just need more total eclipses, psychologically, if nothing else, to keep us centered, to keep us in the here and now, so that we can be better off emotionally.",

If you're a presidential candidate, you only have to win certain parts of the state, certain congressional districts, to get one delegate in particular.Now, what's important here is that if this were a situation where there was an electoral tie across the country, that one electoral vote could tip the election. And that is really the incentive right now for advocates of changing this. And those advocates are being encouraged by Donald Trump. And the argument here is essentially it's going to be a close election, and in that scenario, this one vote could decide the election. KEILAR: Yes, because there is a scenario where if Nebraska moves to winner-take-all, there's a 269-269 tie. And it's not too outlandish. You could see how that could kind of work out there. But you mentioned it's one of two states. And the other one is Maine. And there are some sort of machinations in Maine as well. But do you see that working?",

The judge there rejecting a Trump attempt to get the charges dismissed regarding his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, saying Trump's lawyers that his efforts were protected by the First Amendment. Judge Scott McAfee saying no.New York Attorney General Letitia James, meantime, is now asking Trump's out-of-state underwriter for his $175 million bond to show that they're financially capable of supporting the president's, former president's, bond requirements. A lot to get through. Fortunately, we have former U.S. attorney Harry Litman with us. Harry, your reaction to Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling in the classified documents case? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: So my best guess, Boris, is this, is Jack Smith is saying two cheers for Judge Cannon today. On the one hand, she rules, and that's what she wasn't doing. And obviously, she took to heart or was chastened by his very strong filing Monday night that said, get off the dime and rule already, please. On the other, what she said was very sort of basic. She just said, look, the indictment itself charges the Espionage Act, doesn't mention the Presidential Records Act. The indictment is sufficient to give information. So I'm denying Trump's motion to dismiss based on the Presidential Records Act. But she then drops a paragraph that will give a little heartburn that says, of course, I could still, at trial, change my mind or basically give the jury instructions based on the bogus Presidential Records Act. And so that risk that really prompted Smith to act and do a forceful filing is not completely eliminated. But she replied, she issued an order, and she denied Trump's motion.",

And Scott McAfee, who's a thoughtful and, you know, I think pretty responsible judge, it doesn't surprise me at all that he would adopt what is by now the party line. Look, I'm sorry, President Trump, or I'm not sorry. I'm telling you, President Trump, this is not protected core political speech. On the contrary, when you incite people or you conspire or you enter into a RICO, you can use words, but it doesn't make it protected speech, denied. And that, I think, was to be fully expected.",

But she asked for more.And I think the judge will at least let that effort be given if it's if it's a sort of sham. And there isn't really the money to cover it, then there'd be a problem.

So those are the two factors over time as we see more people, especially more people in older age, we can expect to see more cancer.And this report does highlight that lung cancer has caused the most cancer deaths and disease in recent years. But when you look at data on other cancer types, there's some interesting trends. When you look at cancer incidents among men, specifically across different countries, we know that prostate cancer you see there in green is very, very prominent, but also lung cancer is very prominent in Asian countries. And then when you look at cancer incidents among women around the world, breast cancer is the most dominant. You see there the prevalence in pink. But cervical cancer shown in orange is prevalent in parts of Africa and lung cancer in blue is prevalent in parts of Asia. So these are numbers and trends to definitely follow as we think about the future. But also, Boris, there are things we can each do to reduce our cancer risk, like maintaining a healthy diet and a healthy weight, reducing how much alcohol we drink. Definitely not smoke. Smoking is a big risk factor. Getting regular exercise. So these are ways we can reduce our risk, Boris.",
