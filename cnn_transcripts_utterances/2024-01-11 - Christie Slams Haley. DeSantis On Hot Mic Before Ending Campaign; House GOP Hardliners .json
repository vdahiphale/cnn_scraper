Stood there behind Trump after endorsing, him looking sheepish and looking awkward in 2016, he led Trump's transition team. His -- his thing about oh, I'm not going to endorse Nikki because she refuses to say she's not going to be his VP. That's because he's jealous about that he didn't get picked to be Trump's VP in 2016. I mean, it's -- it's really sad.",

The steps out front where any moment Donald Trump is expected to arrive to attend closing arguments in his civil fraud trial. We're keeping a very close eye as you can see on all of this. Cameras everywhere we can have them and where it is allowed.Well, in Washington today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to make some moves take a first step on a bipartisan Stopgap Spending Bill. The goal here is what amounts to a bandaid to avert a partial government shutdown that set to be triggered next week on January 19th. With the chance of a full shutdown, two weeks later. Here's the deal. This doesn't mean it's a final deal yet even if they would pass this short-term deal. But even this short-term holdover move is becoming a hard sell, in the House for Speaker Mike Johnson. Hardline Republicans are bulking one Republican Warren Davidson of Ohio, calling it a surrender, even questioning why Johnson was even got the job as speaker if he goes along with this. CNN's Lauren Fox is on Capitol Hill. Lauren, you've got a ton of great reporting on where things stand, what the temperature is, what the heck is going on. Can Johnson find a way forward as the right flank is rebelling once again?",

And despite the fact that they are in the second session of this Congress, there is a sense that it looks a lot like the first year of Republicans being in control of this body.Meanwhile, they do have this spending deadline coming up on January 19th. And Mike Johnson, he's already cut a deal on the top line funding numbers with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. He announced that deal over the weekend. His argument to his conference behind closed doors and publicly is that this was the best deal he could get under the circumstances. And yet he is still facing this extreme pushback from his right flank who held the floor of the House of Representatives hostage yesterday, when they voted down yet another procedural step. This is a tactic that they have used in the past. It was a bill that is unrelated to the funding fight, but it is a way for them to register their displeasure with the Speaker. Meanwhile, Johnson defending himself to our colleague, Manu Raju yesterday. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MANU RAJU, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on-camera): Are you worried that one of these guys is going to make a move on you? REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: No, I'm not worried about that at all. I just met with all those guys. Their close friends of mine. And we agree on the principles. Look, I am a lifelong hardcore conservative. I want to get as many policy wins as we can, I want advance the ball as far as we can. But the reality is we have a small majority. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's really walking a tightrope right now between what is practically possible given the fact that this deadline is coming up, given the reality that many of these members who are frustrated with the deal that he caught, are members who don't vote for spending deals, really no matter what is inside of them. That is the challenge for Johnson. Not to mention the fact that anything that House passes has to get through a Democratic controlled Senate, has to get signed by President Joe Biden, yet another Democrat. That is why Johnson feels like he has very little room to maneuver right now. And it's why he is in the position that he's in.Kate.",

This is the first time we're going to hear from Hunter Biden, we expect that he and his lawyers are going to enter a not guilty plea to those -- to those nine counts, three of which are felonies. But remember, you know, just six months ago, Hunter Biden was just minutes, minutes away from sealing a plea agreement with the federal government. Prosecutors agreed to reduce everything to a couple of misdemeanors, and another deal covering his purchase of a firearm at a time that he was prohibited from owning firearms.So now, we have Hunter Biden facing two federal cases. Now he's being prosecuted in in Wilmington, Delaware for that gun charge. And now he is going to be facing these nine counts here in Los Angeles. As you pointed out, from the start the show that we had yesterday in Congress, that this is the legal part of this, but Hunter Biden of course, is also a big figure in the political story as Republicans try to use some of the facts that you hear, you see in these cases right here against the against Hunter Biden and against that, of course, his father, the President of United States.

Now the judge has already found them liable for fraud. So right now, they're focused on penalties, which could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars and also some other charges.Now today's specifically is for closing arguments. This is the end of the case where both sides present their theory of the case to a judge. Again, this is not a jury trial. This is going before a single judge. But there was talk of Trump potentially doing some of the closing arguments. The judge wanted some restrictions based on Trump's prior conduct here at court, attacking the judge, attacking the district attorney, attacking staff members here at the court. They would not agree to those terms. So, this point, Trump is not expected to participate in today's closing arguments. But anything can happen here, John.",

Let's keep an eye on that camera in the New York court house, because Donald Trump will be entering that courtroom very soon. I'm going to just keep an eye on this because there is quite a bit of activity. He's -- he's arrived at the New York court for the closing arguments in the civil fraud trial.Now the judge in that case has already found that Donald Trump is liable for committing persistent. Here is. Let's listen. DONALD TRUMP (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you very much. As you know, we consider this unconstitutional, which it's election interference at the highest level, it's a disgrace. And it's in coordination with the White House and Joe Biden, because he can't win a campaign fairly. And we're going through it, but it is indeed a terrible witch hunt. We're going to have a news conference a little bit later on. As you know, I want to speak, I want to make this summation. At this moment, the judge is not letting me make this summation because I'll bring up things that he doesn't want to hear. And it's a very unfair trial, nobody's seen anything like this. I don't think they've ever seen anything like this. We have a situation where a statute was used that doesn't give me a jury. So, I have no jury, I really have no rights, and it's sad. And nobody, nobody thinks it's constitutional people. Legal scholars are writing about it like it's something they've never seen before. So, it's interference, its political interference, and it's something that shouldn't be allowed. So, I am hoping to speak and to help my lawyers reveal all of the defects of this case. It should have never been brought. Very, very strong financial statements, they thought it was the opposite. They had no idea (INAUDIBLE). Then they saw them, knocked their socks off. You couldn't believe it. But great financial statements, everything is good. So, we have -- we have a level of detail in our defense that nobody's ever had. This is a case that should have never been brought, and it was brought, and it's very unfair and it's very bad for New York State. Companies are fleeing, people are fleeing, the streets are crime- ridden. And Letitia James, that's all she thinks about is \"Get Trump.\" She's been dreaming about it for years. And it's, you know, it's not the way the state should be run, because it's a state that's been in big trouble. We have all the businesses fleeing, and you have the people fleeing, the people that pay taxes. The people that don't pay taxes are coming in. So that's not what you want. So, I want to thank you. We're going to have a news conference today, we don't know the time, we'll notify you, but sometime in the early afternoon at 40 Wall Street. So, we'll give a news conference where we can actually speak and have a microphone here, because even that they don't want us to have and they really don't want us to speak too much. So, we'll see whether or not the judge allows me to speak. Perhaps he won't, but I certainly would like to. Thank you very much.",
