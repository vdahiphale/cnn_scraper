The way the marketsare looking, we are down 60-odd points for the Dow Jones, holding over 36,000 comfortably. But you can see, it's been down for the entire session. There's 1,001 reasons why we will deal with many of them in tonight's program, the markets and the main events. Israel's defense forces says its objectives in northern Gaza are nearly complete, and the shift focuses now to the south of Gaza. The president of COP 28 is defending his comment to science -- his commitment to science after a barrage of criticism of comments on fossil fuels. The six weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump holds a commanding lead in the race to be the Republican nominee. Tonight, I'm in Dubai, in the UAE. We're live in Dubai on Monday, December the 4th. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening, tonight, Israeli forces have expanded their ground operations into southern Gaza. They're calling for people in large areas inside Gaza to evacuate immediately. There have been strikes today on Khan Younis, the main city in the south. Gunfire can be heard in a video geolocated by CNN as south of Wadi Gaza. The IDF is describing the main route near Khan Younis as a battlefield and said people cannot flee the city to the north or to the east. Southern Gaza is already filled with people displaced by the fighting. In October, Israel told people to leave the north and head to the south. So take a look at the map from last week that shows the damage across the strip based on satellite data. Now, you can see the north, where they all move south, where there's been massive bombing shelling, and where the tanks are. If the IDF is telling people to head even further south into smaller areas of safety, well, it begs the question where they are supposed to go. Israel dropped leaflets last week with a QR Code that links to this map, dividing the strip into hundreds of numbered evacuation zones. There's a major problem. Without electricity or Internet, you have to ask how many people can actually access the information or use the QR Codes, bearing in mind all that has to be done in the moment in the (inaudible) [00:03:21] the heat of war with bombs and bullets. The head of the -- of UNRWA says the number of civilians killed is rapidly increasing. Ben Wedeman is in Jerusalem. Ben, the first thing I thought this morning when I heard this idea that Israel was asking people to evacuate from the south as they move forward, the first thing I thought, you know, where the hell are they supposed to evacuate to?",

The commander was in charge of Hamas forces in the Shati area, was responsible for raids in Israel on October the 7th. General Wesley Clark is with me, our military analyst, former NATO supreme allied commander. General Clark, before we get to the nitty-gritty, in a way, of how the battle is progressing, this idea that you can tell a million (inaudible) [00:02:20] people to move further south or to move to a safe area, when you are decreasing that area day-by-day, you're literally pushing them into a smaller and smaller cone. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, it's a real problem. It's a real problem for the Israelis. It's a real problem for the civilians in Gaza. It's a real problem for the United States, but there doesn't seem to be an answer. The original idea, I think, Richard, would have been that Israel or Egypt would have set up some kind of ancillary camp so people could evacuate Gaza while they finish the fight against Hamas. Israel was concerned about this because they didn't want the terrorists to slip through what the civilian population. It could've been prevented if they had had the right support from the United Nations and others. But as things evolve, it just -- they had to get on with the military mission and now they're in it.

And this is more destructive, maybe more protective to reduce Israeli casualties, but it's certainly causing a lot of civilian casualties. But there's only so much you could do in battle to avoid these civilian casualties. You really have to look at Hamas. It's what you said earlier, Richard. Hamas should surrender. If they're really concerned about the welfare of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza, surrender. Just stop. Just come out of the tunnels, put your hands up, call on the world to show mercy to you.

This is an entirely different circumstance. Now, for Israel, Israel has to worry about Hamas. It's branded Hamas as an existential threat. This is the first time really, since 1973, that Israel has faced an existential threat. This is a problem. And Israel recognizes that if Hamas gets away with this, the next threat will come from Hezbollah in the north. And there's fighting already in the west bank.

All of this comes as the role of fossil fuels in this climate transition is being reevaluated. They make up 80% of energy now. And frankly, being honest, they're not going away completely or much anytime soon. The IEA says they expect fossil fuels to be more than half of the energy mix 20 years from now when there's COP discussions focused on finance. The UAE, which is hosting the conference, made a splash, pledging $270 billion in green financing by the end of the decade. And that's only a fraction of what's needed.

And in that sense, COP28 comes at a critical moment. We need to continue to make progress. Spain is very strongly committed. We also have put our money where our mouth is. We have launched massive investments, which are also proving to be the right way forward because Spanish companies are becoming more competitive with low energy prices and cleaner energy.
