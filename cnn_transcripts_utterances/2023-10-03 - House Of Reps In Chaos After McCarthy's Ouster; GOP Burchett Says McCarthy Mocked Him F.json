The jockey, for the position, though is already underway, tonight. And CNN's Melanie Zanona is covering it all here, at the Capitol.

And that includes Steve Scalise. He is the number two Republican, the House Majority Leader. He is seen as the likely next in line, the heir-apparent. And I am told that he has been calling members, tonight. His team has also been calling members. And that he is already lining up supporters. One of those members who heard from him tonight said he's getting a good amount of support, already, so, just to give you a sense of how quickly things are moving here.But I'll tell you, there are some other names, in the mix as well. I'm told that there are some members, who have been encouraging Jim Jordan, to run. He is a conservative. He was a Co-founder of the Freedom Caucus. But he's also become a Kevin McCarthy ally. He is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And he is someone, who is also seen as a potential contender here. Now, it's unclear if he would run. He was asked by our Manu Raju, earlier, whether he would be open to doing so. And he said it is up to the Conference, so clearly, leaving it open, though it's unclear whether he would mount a challenge to Steve Scalise. Now, we're hearing some other names as well. Kevin Hern. He's the head of the Republican Study Committee, which is the largest Conservative Caucus in the House. But, at this point, Kaitlan, it looks like Steve Scalise is making moves, to become the next Speaker. They have until next week. There's going to be a candidate forum, on Tuesday, for any Speaker candidates, to try to make their pitch. And then, they will move to try to elect a Speaker, on Wednesday. So again, things moving quickly. But, as of right now, the House is paralyzed. And they cannot conduct any other business, until they elect a new Speaker.",

They wanted to give some time.Especially now that Kevin McCarthy has stepped aside, it is really a whole new ballgame, unlike in January, where he was in the race, for round after round. No one else was willing to step up to the plate. But someone, like Steve Scalise, for example, has long been waiting, in the wings. He never wanted to challenge Kevin McCarthy, outright. But now that he is out of the picture, he's clearly making his moves. But I'll tell you, back to your earlier point, about government funding. That was a concern, raised by a lot of Republican members, today, about if they were to go forward, with the motion to vacate, and potentially oust Kevin McCarthy, as Speaker, which they did, that it was going to delay their appropriations process. The same appropriations process, we should point out, that Matt Gaetz had been fighting for. So now, all of that is delayed. They were supposed to be marking up bills, this week and next week, trying to move towards that November 17th deadline. That's going to be a lot harder. And I can tell you, whoever is going to be the next Speaker is immediately going to have to deal with that next challenge. And the question becomes what do they do away? Do they have to pass a short- term stopgap bill, to keep the government open, and avoid a shutdown, the very thing that Kevin McCarthy was punished for?

But aides tell me that President Biden is going to aim, to strike a tone of business as usual, throughout the rest of the week. Tomorrow, he has a policy-focused speech, on student loans. And today, in messaging blasts that the White House, has put out for many weeks, in today's, they announced a split-screen, of President Biden touting his negotiations, for lower drug prices, contrasted with Republicans, trying to repeal the legislation, that authorizes the President, to do that, not highlighting the motion to vacate, or any of the drama that was happening, on Capitol Hill. But that's the White House trying to stay above the fray, Jake.

But Jake, when you look at their voting records, which is one of the things that the White House points to often, you sort of have a spectrum of support, and a pretty wide range, if that, among the names that have been floated so far. Tom Emmer, based on his voting record, and his public statements so far, would be seen as the staunchest supporter, for Ukraine aid. And you have Steve Scalise, the number two Republican, who would be somewhat in the middle. He's made some neutral statements, recently. And it's unclear whether when John Kirby, the NSC spokesman, was saying that there was support, among House leadership, whether he was referencing Steve Scalise, as part of that bucket. And then, of course, there's hardliners like Kevin Hern, and Jim Jordan, who would be seen as anti-Ukraine, based on their voting records.

I mean, this was, what he does is.And what we are told is that there's a multitude of reasons. One is that, one ally told us that he can't always stick his neck out, for McCarthy, whenever there's a problem, on the Hill, particularly given that he has allies on both sides of this issue. He is very close with Matt Gaetz. And we know he spoke with Matt Gaetz, before he even brought this motion, Gaetz, over McCarthy. So, there is a lot going on there. Now, the other thing, we are told, is that he hasn't even really been paying attention. He is fixated on his trial. We know he's going to come for two days. Now, he's again going back to trial, tomorrow. He is enjoying the media coverage. He is blasting out tweets. Just a few seconds ago, he posted, on Truth Social. I was looking to see if it had anything to do with Kevin McCarthy. And instead, it just said, \"Change the border,\" or \"Fix the border.\" So clearly, he is not weighing in.

He thought that Donald Trump was strong. But he didn't know he was the best candidate in 2024. That was something that Trump and his team took a huge amount of issue at. Now, we are also told that Kevin McCarthy has given a list of excuses to several of Trump's allies, as to why he hasn't endorsed Trump in 2024. Some of it is about fundraising, or about the fact that he didn't want to impact certain sections, of Republican voters, on the Hill. But that has still irked people close to Trump. I'm even told at some points that people have said, told Trump, that they don't like Kevin McCarthy. But yet Trump stood by his side, again, in the Speaker's race. So, I do believe there is somewhat of the loyalty being a two-way street. I think that Trump did give him some loyalty, back in January. And then, he is very quick and very fickle, as we know.

And it gave cover to other people to join Matt Gaetz, in this push against McCarthy. And so, that is how we ended up here. Donald Trump will always leave as many options open as possible, so he never has to foreclose anything, and then he can end up on the side of where something is going. That is often how he decides what he's doing. I think he waited to see where McCarthy was. He didn't especially feel like waiting in, for all of the reasons we just heard. And another one, which is that McCarthy? And this, Trump did raise a lot. And frankly, this came up more than the endorsement issue. Trump wanted his impeachments expunged, from the record. He wanted McCarthy to introduce this, and push this. McCarthy did not do that. Impeachment of Biden was less of an issue for Trump than his own record. And so, you put all of this together. And I think it is true that Trump had not been especially focused on this, in the reason -- the days leading up to this. I think he's pretty focused on it right now. Because, I think that he sees this as some kind of an activity that he can be talked about in, witness people are talking about him, running for Speaker, which, Donald Trump has a long history of people, running non-organic drafts, for him. This has the same feel. But it's not surprising to me, because I think that he's -- somebody said to me, close to Trump, last week, he doesn't think Kevin needs rescuing, now. And I messaged that person today, and said, do you still -- does he still think Kevin doesn't need rescuing? And I didn't hear back. But he decided he was not going to invest capital in this.

And that's going to come with concessions. That's a really good point, because we forget about this. The impeachment inquiry into Biden, that was, sort of an organic House thing that members truly wanted to do. But the former President has wanted his own impeachment expunged, and no one is going to move forward with that, I would suspect, of the candidates who are putting their names for it.

Now, the judge said that that was an untrue post, and Trump did not post any evidence to this. But he said it was unacceptable, saying, \"Personal attacks of any member of my court staff are unacceptable, inappropriate and I will not tolerate them. Consider this statement an order forbidding all parties from posting, emailing or speaking publicly about any members of my staff. Failure to abide by this will result in serious sanctions.\" And the judge said that he had warned the counsels, for the defendants, yesterday, about this, because Trump had spoken in the hallway, about this clerk. And this clerk is the judge's right-hand person. She sits often next to him, just to his side, on the bench. So, someone that he works very closely with. So, after that testimony continued, it was Trump's former longtime accountant, on the stand. His defense lawyers got a chance to begin their cross-examination of him.

They are asking the judge to prohibit Donald Trump, from making disparaging or inflammatory comments, about anyone involved in the case. Look, I was a prosecutor. You're allowed to make a disparaging comment, if you're a defendant, about a prosecutor. You can say, \"These prosecutors don't know what they're doing. This case against me is worthless.\" That's OK. So, I do think Judge Chutkan is going to issue a gag order. But if I was in her shoes, I would say, \"You cannot make statements that could intimidate or threaten or pose a danger to a witness, or to a juror, or to a staffer.\" I think it needs to be narrower than what DOJ is asking for",
