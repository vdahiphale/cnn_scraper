State media there say the North will expel the army private, but it hasn't said when that might happen. You'll recall, King bolted across the border into North Korea during a tour of the demilitarized zone back in July. North Korea says the investigation into the incident is over. According to Pyongyang, Travis King told them he was disillusioned with inequality in U.S. society and racial discrimination in the army. Let's get the very latest from Paula Hancocks, who's in Seoul. What did you make of the statement from the North and what's right and what might be wrong?",

We haven't seen him at all. No photographic evidence even from the North Koreans.They admitted just in August, so a month after he had run across the military demarcation line from South Korea into North Korea in the DMZ, and they had finally admitted that they had him, that he had, in their words, illegally intruded into North Korea. Now, back then, they also said that he had said he had done so because of racial discrimination in the United States, and he was wanting to either stay in North Korea or go to a third country. So now today, this evening, we have heard from North Korea again quoting Travis King, saying that he has said it is an unequal U.S. society that forced him to do what he did and that was his reasoning into running across the border during that civilian tour of the DMZ. Now, they say that he will be expelled. We don't know when, we don't know where, and those really are some key questions as to when we might see him and where we might see him. Max?",

That's why you hear from the health ministry that many of those who died, died due to suffocation. Unable to breathe. Unable to get out. I mean, absolutely horrifying. Again, this huge wedding in this Christian community, this was a Christian wedding in this predominantly Christian community, Qaraqosh in Northern Iraq, gathered more than 1,000 people, 1,300 according to some officials. And in an instant, it turned into a nightmare. We know now that 100 people are dead. 150 are injured, but take those as preliminary numbers. Those could easily go up and expect, of course, that an investigation is going to look into why was that illegal building material used? Did corruption lead to death in this case?",

And in recent years, there's been efforts to bring people home, bring people back. Actually, the Pope visited in 2021, a way to celebrate, if you will, that revival of that community.

The judge finding that he engaged in fraud for a decade by inflating the value of some of his marquee properties on financial statements that were provided in a number of business transactions.The judge saying that the -- Donald Trump's explanation for how he came up with the values for some of his assets, they -- he called it a fantasy world, not the real world. Specifically, he singled out Trump's triplex apartment at Trump Tower here in Manhattan. Trump had inflated the value of that property, including just the mere square footage by three times, meaning that he did acknowledge and the judge saying that that massive discrepancy could only mean fraud. Now, he also said that he was ordering that certificates of business to operate in New York State be canceled and that he would put in place a receiver to dissolve the business. Exactly what that will look like. Remains unclear at this point. There's a lot of confusion, even among the parties, about how that will play out. But it could significantly reshape what the Trump Organization looks like and whether it has a footprint in New York City. His son, Eric Trump, who essentially leads the company on a day to day basis, said that both the judge and the attorney general are trying to destroy their company. Now, Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, who's representing him in this action said, \"Today's outrageous decision is completely disconnected from the facts and governing law. While the full impact of the decision remains unclear, what is clear is that President Trump and his family will seek all available appellate remedies to rectify this miscarriage of justice\". They are already appealing before the appeals court, the start of this trial because they think the judge has not implemented correctly what claims would actually be covered by this. So they are hoping that the appellate court will narrow even the scope of what the judge overseeing this case could look at, saying that certain claims fell outside of the statute of limitations. We're expecting the appellate court to rule this week on that. But as of now, this trial is still in limbo, but is currently scheduled to start on Monday.",

But as the Kremlin tries to get its arms around Wagner's sprawling commercial network on the continent, still unclear who is heading the operations there.CNN's Clarissa Ward reports on the man who may be the new Wagner leader in the Central African Republic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLARISSA WARD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Behind this door, we are expecting to find Dmitry Syty, one of Wagner's bosses in the Central African Republic. Access strictly forbidden to all people who don't work here, a sign warns. Our knock goes unanswered. And shortly after we are told to leave the building. We came back to the heart of Yevgeny Prigozhin's empire in Africa to see how his death had changed things, and found two of his lieutenants still running the show. Vitali Perfilev is in charge of the security piece, while Syty runs the commercial side. Syty likes to keep a low profile these days, which is not surprising given that he's survived a mail bomb attack here in December 2022. After the attack, locals began to wear t-shirts in support of him, a sign of Wagner's entrenched popularity here. We first met Syty back in 2019. Officially, he was acting as a translator. But documents showed he was the head of a now defunct Wagner-owned company called Lobaye Invest, and that he had started working with Prigozhin to influence U.S. elections in the so-called troll factory back in 2016. Educated in Paris and fluent in French, English, and Spanish, Syty later created the Russian Cultural Center in Bangui, which investigative group the century says Wagner uses as a front to sell its gold and diamonds to VIPs and manage its timber and alcohol operations. The center is one of the last places Prigozhin was photographed alive, seen here with Syty standing by him. We filmed covertly at the cultural center where a woman who called herself Nafisa Kiryanova told us that Prigozhin's death has not changed the status quo.",

Police escorted his hearse to the cemetery, and prevented media and onlookers from watching the funeral. Messina Denaro died on Monday after a battle with cancer.

And the fact that he was allowed this funeral, that -- family chapel alongside his father who was also a convicted mobster is really -- you know, causes a lot of pain to the families of the victims. And, you know, it's quite distressing to just, sort of, watch it because whoever the next boss of bosses will be, he's probably already in hiding, he's probably already killed countless people. And, you know, it's not -- you know, it's not an episode of \"The Sopranos\" or \"The Godfather\" movie. This is real life here, you know.

And streaming residuals was a big deal as well. As well as the size of writers' rooms.Let's walk through a few of the things that they got in this deal. Starting with pay increases of five percent immediately followed by four percent the year after that, three and a half percent the year following. Slight increase in health fund contributions. As far as the limitations on artificial intelligence goes, the company must disclose to a writer whether they're handing the writer anything that's been used or generated by A.I. The writer can use A.I. if they so choose, but they don't have to. They're not forced to use that. You see that there are success-based streaming residuals listed there, that is a big deal because this requires companies, studios to be a little more transparent to the guild about the viewership on streaming platforms. And writers can take home a bigger bonus depending on how popular that content is. The minimum writers' room staffing means that people can be guaranteed work on a show for a bit longer duration as well. Here's one person we talked to on the picket line yesterday, very excited about the streaming residual part of this deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
