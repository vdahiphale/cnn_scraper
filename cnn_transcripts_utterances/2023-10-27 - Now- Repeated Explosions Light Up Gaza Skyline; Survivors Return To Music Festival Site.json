But not to any increased paste from what we've seen in recent days, and that's despite a very high level of alert among the IDF forces here that we've encountered.

The Hamas leader said, for instance, regarding Hezbollah, he said Hezbollah now is working against the occupation. But he added, we appreciate this, but we need more in order to stop the aggression in Gaza, we expect more. It appears that Hamas expects more retaliation as it were from Hezbollah in the north and from other Iranian proxies in the region. They haven't seen it yet.That doesn't mean that as we see this increased in Israeli activity in Gaza tonight the last several hours that that doesn't spark something. But it's notable that it has not yet and that Hamas officials have notice that and are, in effect, complaining publicly that they don't have the support they expect. Now, I don't want to minimize what we have seen because, you know, those Hezbollah threats, those strikes so far have basically emptied the northern part of Israel towns up here, many of them that we visited under mandatory evacuation, many 10s of 1000s of Israelis fleeing south. And I should note, as we discussed earlier, Jake, U.S. forces in the region are also under threat. Iranian proxies firing on them in Iraq and Syria. So, that doesn't mean they are not firing back, but from Hamas' perspective, not to the degree that they'd hoped for.",

I think we have to be careful to jump to any conclusions here because this is going to be a well-planned operation. This is not going to be just something that they pull out of their hat. And for that reason, I think we have to be a little bit careful about assuming what exactly is going to happen. I'm not so sure it's going to be a full blown military invasion, it could very well be setting up a buffer zone and conducting targeted attacks into Gaza.

You could be a detective, the chief bail out of the station, you could be whoever, everybody goes. So, being Lewiston officers they go, that's we know what that is, everybody gets in the car and they immediately go to spare time to help in any way they can not knowing that, in fact, they're going to be the closest there and the first out.So that cuts almost two and a half minutes off the original or the initial uniformed police officers response. And that's not uncommon from a police standpoint. Sometimes you got months where you're thinking, well, I'm right around the corner, all this stuff happens. And sometimes there's, I'm on the other side of the city when other stuff happens. We're very, very lucky that the officers were that close, because I think you save lives with time responses.

The next night at a YouTube concert, Bano told the audience to quote, sing for our brothers and sisters who themselves were singing at the Supernova Sukkot Festival in Israel. We sing for our kind of people, music people, playful, experimental people. And then Bano change the words to the 1984 song pride in the name of love, quote, early morning, October 7th, as the sun is rising in the desert sky, stars of David, they took your life, but they could not take your pride, unquote.While I was sharing that piece, we heard continuous explosions over Gaza as the IDF is expanding its ground operations against Hamas, the people who perpetrated the horror. We just told you about some of the most frequent explosions we've heard since the show started, an hour and 40 minutes ago. I'm joined now by Michael Oren, the former Israeli ambassador to the United States. Ambassador, do you believe this expanding ground operation in Gaza is the beginning of the full invasion that we've been hearing about? What exactly does expanding ground operations mean? MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Well, good to be with you, Jake. And that seeing that last segment about revisiting the place of the Nova massacre, it's very moving. I get very much choked up about it. And we recall why all of this is happening. I'm talking about 1,400 Israelis, including 260 young people at this festival, massacred in cold blood, tortured, mutilated, beheaded, burnt at the equivalent of suddenly 52,000 Americans if you do it like proportionally, so get a sense of why this is happening. Logistically, tactically, this has to happen eventually. Again, I think we've talked about this earlier. We have 360,000 reservists called up. That is an immense amount of people. There are people in their 20s, their 30s young men and women, they have left their families, they have left their jobs, now going into the third week, that's not sustainable. There is the clock going of international opinion and international pressure for a ceasefire and understand the ceasefire, you know, sounds really good at ceasefire, you know, let's not shoot at one another. But for Israel, that means something close to death. It means that these people can never go back to their homes in the South that Hamas wins gets literally away with murder, but mass murder, we can't restore our deterrence power. So the message is going to go out to our enemies, whether Hezbollah and the North, Iran to the east that we are, you know, we're fair game, we're not going to defend ourselves, the international community is going to prevent us from defending ourselves. So there's that clock spinning as well.",

And so it could be establishing a bridgehead like a beachhead from which other operations can then expand into the Gaza Strip. They've created a cordon, the area -- the Israeli Air Force has been bombing, very intensive, certain area to clear out that area, so that our forces can advance.We understand here, everybody in the city understand this, better understand that this operation is going to cost us, that soldiers are not going to go to battle and they're not going to come home. So the Israeli army has to do two things. It has to, you know, defeat Hamas and get the hostages released. But it also has to preserve as much as possible our soldiers life. We're not going to spend them.",

And so like almost on every single demand, it's almost impossible for Israel. And I think that our decision makers concluded that Hamas was just playing for time, and they were going to keep on releasing terrorists, you know, hostages one at a time getting a very high profile, sort of coverage for and more and more pressure for that ceasefire.Keep in mind, it's not impossible that in Israeli ground incursion will actually increase the pressure on Hamas. Think about -- to release the hostages. So it's not, you know, it's not so black and white that if we stay out, we have a better chance of releasing them. It could be by going in we'll have a better chance of releasing them.",

Every day is that worry. So and most of my worries comes from the treatment of Hamas and my disrespect or I don't know which stronger word to use, to what I think the Hamas might be using.So I have more, let's say, respect to what our military is doing. And I hope that they're very calculative in their actions. Of course, it also worries me that I have much more trust in them in what they're doing and how they are trying to operate than whatever happens inside of Gaza.",

And they managed to arrive and we didn't know where she is.So for almost a whole week, I was there every day trying to go out with them to find her. And when we finally concluded that she's not there, and she'd be -- she -- they took her again inside Gaza. So we stopped. I don't think that we have more information than that. It's very sad to say but this is the most that we can have right now. The rest is in the hands of the brutal people inside of Hamas that are holding her and only them can provide us proof of life. So understand the situation that we are in who holds the information and the thing that we are holding most dear. It's in their hands. So I don't think that ideas will help at this point.",
