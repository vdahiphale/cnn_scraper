An American man is believed to be in North Korean custody. A U.S. official confirms that he is an American soldier, and a Pentagon official says that he was at the time facing disciplinary action. We don't have specifics in terms of what exactly that means, but a U.N. agency says that he was detained after he crossed the military demarcation line during an orientation tour to the joint security area. The development comes during a highly sensitive time with Pyongyang ramping up ballistic missile tests in a U.S. nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarine arriving in South Korea for a rare visit. CNN's Marc Stewart is monitoring the story. He joins us live now from Tokyo. So, what more do we know about this American soldier? How exactly he got into North Korea? And more importantly, Marc, why?",

From what weunderstand is that soldier who was facing disciplinary actions was likely going to be returned to the United States. How that plays in this bigger narrative still unclear. We certainly don't want to speculate. It is very curious, though, exactly where and how this soldier crossed over, because it may be surprising for some people to learn you can actually go on a public tour of the demilitarized zone and of this joint security area. It is very well marked, it is very well delineated, there are no questions where the borders are. There certainly is a compound that we are familiar with, with different buildings where we've seen North Korean soldiers looking directly at United Nations forces, which are often American soldiers. But there's also an area surrounding it which is a bit wooded, an open field, almost a scenic outlook where you can look directly into North Korea from the south. So, it's not clear exactly where that person entered and what their exact reason was -- what that soldier's reason was. We know that talks are underway right now. As part of this whole joint security area, there's actually a phone line that has been established between the United Nations and the North Korean government to be used perhaps in a situation like this. We do not know if that has been activated and if that is the diplomatic channel that is taking place. We are expecting some briefings though in the hours ahead from Washington, hopefully, some of those gaps, some of those very valid and worthy questions will get a little bit more clarity in the hours ahead, Zain.",

There was a kind of an industrial park area. I traveled by bus. I had to leave U.S. or any kind of newspapers from the West behind. I mean, it's a very, very insular insular country.

So, that is the line of demarcation between the North and South that President Trump crossed. I can walk across in here because it's international agreement. But if I was outside, that would not be allowed. There is just an absolute feeling of what if? What if I suddenly made a run for it? Would they stop me? Or what if they came out and what if? JOHN PAUL MULLIGAN, LIEUTENANT, U.S. NAVY: If you're running across, that'd be an incident for sure. So, they are well trained to stop that. And most of the soldiers that are stationed up here are black belts in one or multiple martial arts because you can't be armed in the JSA, but you know, hands only. So, I personally wouldn't risk it.

Obviously, there's still so much we don't know at this point. We understand that he may have indeed been facing disciplinary action. We don't have details on that.

So, since the Korean War, since the armistice in 1953, seventy years ago, there have been a total of six defectors that have left the United States military and gone over to North Korea. So, if this is a case like that, of course, we don't know yet, but there's certainly a possibility that may be the case. So, what would happen in a situation like this? Marc mentioned the hotline that is established between United Nations Command and Panmunjom, which is that peace village that Richard Quest was at, and the North Korean command that is basically the U.N. counterpart over there. And so, they would be discussing potentially whether or not to bring that soldier back to U.S. and U.N. control or, you know, perhaps handle some other aspect of the negotiations. This could potentially be a pretty long drawn-out process. And it's, I think, an open question as to whether or not the soldier would actually be coming back to U.S. control. He may, you know, be in a bona fide defector, in which case the North Korean may very well keep him. So, it could be a drawn-out process and it's not quite clear to me at least what the resolution will be.",

Trump sayshe's gotten a target letter from the special counsel, Jack Smith, investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In recent weeks, many of Trump's top aides and advisors have been called to testify before a Washington, D.C. grand jury looking into the post-election chaos. The letter is seen as a strong sign that Trump could be indicted by the same prosecutor who's already indicted him for his mishandling of classified documents. And now, for us to break all of this down, let's bring in CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter, Katelyn Polantz. Katelyn, thank you so much for being with us.

But this is the surest sign that we have had and that we would ever have in an investigation that an indictment is coming and that Donald Trump may be charged with federal crimes related to what happened after -- excuse me -- the 2020 election and leading up to and on January 6th, when that riot at the Capitol among his supporters took place and he did not call them off and have them keep the peace until much, much later in the evening. So, Zain, this is one of those situations where it is a formality often by the Justice Department to determine to send a letter like this to someone that they have been investigating. In this case, they are notifying Donald Trump as of this Sunday that he is the target of the January 6th grand jury investigation. So, that's a criminal probe led by federal prosecutors that were specially appointed to look into this working out of Washington D.C. and they have told Donald Trump he has four days to report to the grand jury or rather that's his wording of it is very likely he is given an opportunity and he can decline to testify on his own defense if he wanted to, but that is where the investigation stands. And really, we have for some time, Zain, been aware that this investigation seemed to be nearing its end. There had been significant witnesses coming in and speaking about not just what they witnessed generally after the 2020 election, but what they witnessed with Trump himself. Vice President Mike Pence testified to the grand jury. Trump's Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, testified to the grand jury and many, many others from the White House. There have been multiple legs of this investigation. And so, now, it appears it is all coming together. The Justice Department and the grand jurors themselves would be nearing the momentum -- the momentous moment in this investigation where they would decide whether or not to charge the former President of the United States with a crime. And at this point in time, it looks very likely that that may happen. Zain?",

And I think the takeaway here is because we normally will set records in the summer, we seehot temperatures, but the longevity of this heat wave, especially in the U.S. and other places around the world, is what has been very alarming. We have been on these very long streaks of very hot temperatures, record temperatures, and we're not seeing any end in sight, really. We have these areas of high pressure that's creating these heat domes and you can see them basically all across the world. And so, that's what's creating the very warm temperatures. You know, we've had globally, the hottest temperature on record back July 3rd. Well, every day since then we have surpassed the old record and so we are continuing into uncharted territory here. Look at these temperatures in the upper forties and fifties by Friday. Death Valley should hit 51 degrees. Palm Springs in the upper forties, Las Vegas in the mid-forties and we're not going to see a cool down anytime soon. Those temperatures are going to remain hot throughout the weekend in the beginning part of next week. In Phoenix, we have had 18 consecutive days with high temperatures at 43 or higher. We're going to break the record of most consecutive days at that temperature or higher today. So, that record will go down, as well, and we're going to continue with this streak with temperatures in the upper 40s to mid-40s all the way through the weekend. Here are the heat alerts for the U. S. You can see across Texas. Southwest U. S., we have had 38 consecutive days with heat index exceeding 38 degrees. This is for Miami. You can see June into July, and then across Europe. Temperatures are very hot, as well. Madrid, 40 degrees. We're seeing temperatures even in the 50s across the Middle East. Rome has had temperatures well above normal 38 degrees for today and not cooling off much. Athens hitting the low 40s, as well. Look at these forecast, high temperatures, but then when you factor in the heat index, Dubai 51 degrees. We have a little bit more moisture because it sits closer to the water versus other places like Baghdad in a very dry climate where the heat index is not going to be much different than the actual temperature. But Zain, these are alarming numbers when you look at how hot not only the U.S. has been but the entire world setting record after record. We have set high temperature records across China as well, setting a record for an all-time high temperature across China. So, it's not just the U.S., Zain, this is a global problem and as you -- we've talked about before, we've also been talking about the sea service temperatures and unchartered territory, as well, and that's only making the air above it hotter as well.",

But in a rare diplomatic breakthrough last July, a wartime deal brokered by Turkey and the U.N. allowed for the safe passage of ships in the Northwestern Black Sea. Much of that exported Ukrainian grain was sent to Africa and the Middle East, offering a lifeline to some of the world's poorest countries. Many of them already on the precipice of famine, struggling with climate change, conflict and economic insecurity. Those nations have landed in Russia's crosshairs. Once again, Western countries are accusing Moscow of weaponizing hunger, following the Kremlin's announcement on Monday to suspend the grain agreement.

It's a lot of Russian allies in Africa that are gonna be affected by this.

There are about 15 countries with food inflation over 50 percent, and there are about four to five countries where food inflation is over 100 percent. So, in these types of circumstances, if for any reason, you know, international prices go up, that means food becomes even more expensive for people who are barely making ends meet as we speak. Last year, World Food Program, we assisted 160 million people, which is a record. This year we are meant to do 170 million people, but we have funding shortfalls, significant funding shortfalls.

You find that the same life of a girl that is being impacted, you know, by this war is the same girl who is not able to finish school or have access to food. So, it's really important that the international community raises awareness about the impacts and you know, how the rights of girls and young women are in a crisis, especially with a war like this.",

On behalf of UNICEF, I mean, I've always thought Rwanda is quite an interesting case because you have, you know, Rwanda hasone of the highest numbers of women in political positions as a direct proportion of the population. So, that's certainly quite impressive. You've also got Rwanda making a lot of strides in terms of reducing gender inequality, in terms of a decline in maternal mortality, as well. So, there are good things happening on the ground in Rwanda. However, that does not mean that the work is over. There's still so much work to be done in terms of gender parity in that particular country. Just walk us through what you've been doing in Kigali and what you're seeing on the ground there.",

I appreciate the realities of the frontlines, the mines, and the situation there, but has the counteroffensive stalled, and how is this not a failure so far? And Secretary Austin, you talked about the alliance and the contact group being together, but publicly there seems to be a bit of fraying. Defense Minister Wallace, last week, said that he had told his Ukrainian counterparts that, quote, unquote, we are not Amazon, and that they should show us some appreciation. Do you agree with the sentiments that Secretary Wallace expressed?

The U.S. government is in the process of alerting and notifying and engaging next of kin. He said he's most concerned about the welfare of his troops, but that hopefully in the coming days and weeks they will have more information to be able to share with all of us.

And it's also timed to coincide with the 75th anniversary of Israel's founding. But it really does underscore these tensions between President Biden and the man who he hasn't invited to the White House, which is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That relationship has been under strain for several months, in part because of those judicial overhaul rules, but also due to settlements in the West Bank. So, President Biden did speak to Netanyahu yesterday. There is some sign of warning -- of warming rather, but I think it will only underscore that those tensions still do exist, Zain.",
