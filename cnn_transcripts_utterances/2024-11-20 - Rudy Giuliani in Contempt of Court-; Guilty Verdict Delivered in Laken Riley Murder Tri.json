      "sentences": "Yes, so what happens, Pamela, is that prosecutors generally prove or they attempt to charge you with and do follow up and charge you with everything that they believe your conduct really describes in terms of what you did.And so when you look at malice murder, malice murder is exactly that. Premeditated murder, murder committed with a pretty bad heart. And then you look at the felony murder, and the felony murder is any murder that's done in commission of a separate felony. So, for example, if you're committing a felony such as kidnapping and it results in murder, that's felony murder. If you're engaged in aggravated battery, where you're bashing someone with rocks or something else, that is felony murder. Anything done in commission of a felony that ultimately relates to or results in murder, right, someone dying, then that's what the felony murder stems from. And, of course, the other charge is the kidnapping, is incident to what was alleged to have happened here. And now it's no longer alleged. It's what has been discovered to have happened. And so the judge looking at all of that and rendering a conclusion consistent with the technological evidence, with the DNA evidence and with the circumstantial evidence. One last point, and that's this. There has been the indication from the defense all along that this was a circumstantial case. What does that mean? It means nothing direct, but circumstances, right? According to the defense, it's only circumstantial. Circumstantial evidence is powerful evidence. Very rarely would you have a situation where you have someone there who sees everything, knows everything. People who commit crimes generally don't do them in the light of day. And so you need to piece together the circumstances. And I think, when you piece that together with DNA, with cell phone evidence, with smartphone evidence and with other things, as they did here, that is, the prosecution, that's what results. And that is a conviction of all counts, all 10 counts.",

The judge in the Laken Riley case just came out with his verdict, saying Jose Ibarra is guilty of all 10 counts, including four counts of murder.We are now awaiting the sentencing, which should happen around 12:30. Right now, they're taking a break before we learn the sentencing. The prosecution is asking for Ibarra to face a maximum of life in prison without parole. I'm going to bring in Joey Jackson, our legal analyst, and Rafael Romo, who was actually inside that courtroom, to continue that discussion. Joey Jackson, to you. I also want to note that -- another layer to this and another reason why this became such a flash point in the election was because he is an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela. And it has raised all kinds of questions about crime and immigration. And that's been a big part of the discussion in the political sphere. But in this sphere, when you look at the legal sphere, he is facing a maximum of life in prison without parole. And he is an undocumented immigrant. How does that play into this?",

      "sentences": "Yes, so Pamela, what would occur, of course, is that it could play a number of ways. The first, of course, is that we have, that is, the United States, jurisdiction over him. And you have to answer, based on that jurisdiction, to your crime.In this country, of course, we have trials. You're allowed to have due process. That is noticing an opportunity to be heard. He was heard. He's guilty. He had his option, of course, to go in front of a jury of his peers. He opted to have a judge instead, presumably for that emotional issue, to eliminate it. But emotion or not, he now is guilty. The United States can take the position and Georgia can take the position that he's with us. He will remain with us until that sentence is imposed and concluded. And so, in doing so, he would be in the jurisdiction of Georgia and their prison system until his death, right? The other issue would be whether or not there's discussions to deport him and send him back to his country, in the event that that would occur, a negotiation in terms of how that would look like. Would he be imprisoned there? I doubt it. I think that the United States may want to keep him here, for fear that if he goes and is deported to his country, potentially, there's a risk of him coming back. And so U.S. has jurisdiction, Georgia has jurisdiction, the court system has jurisdiction, the state has jurisdiction. I think they want to keep him incarcerated in that system for the duration, but we will see what intermediaries get involved and what the politics of this looks like. But, clearly, today, Laken Riley's family certainly got some measure of justice with respect to who killed their daughter.",

You were there with all the emotion.You had just said before the break, it was the most emotional verdict reading you had ever been a part of as a reporter. Tell us more about that and what more we learned about Jose Ibarra and how he was able to pull this off.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam, so, number one, the death of a loved one is difficult, this hard -- it's unimaginable to begin with.But when you think about what this family has gone through, meaning that they had to relive the whole episode, because part of the evidence was situating Laken Riley the day of the murder, what time she left the house, who did she call, where was her cell phone, all the digital evidence. And things that we learned during the trial was that her last text message was to her mother, telling her, I'm about to go for a run. Please let me know if you can talk to me. And then she called her. And the phone call went through to voice-mail. And her mother calls her back at 9:24. And the prosecution said that it was at 9:28, that very same morning on February 22, that her heart stopped beating. So imagine being the mother of that young woman and listening to all of that, in addition to the trauma that you are already went through after losing your own daughter. So that's one thing. The other thing that caught my attention, Pam, is that the judge, before issuing a verdict,he said that he filled up two legal pads of notes during the entire trial, two legal pads. And then he said, during closing arguments, I only wrote down two observations. Number one, he said, the statement by Sheila Ross, the special prosecutor, was very powerful. That was number one. [11:45:16] Number two, Beck, the defense attorney, required the court to set aside my emotions, he said, the judge. And so he made that clarification before saying that Jose Ibarra was guilty in all 10 counts. So it was really interesting to see the judge say that, because, normally, we only hear from jurors. It is, in a trial by jury, the jurors who decide whether a defendant is guilty or not. This time, that was the task of a judge. And he didn't take it lightly. He worked very hard at it, listening to the evidence and really paying attention to everything that was being said in court, Pam.",

But, look, the prosecution has not given the reason as to why they did not do so, but I think this certainly was a case that could have been in contention for them pursuing the death penalty and potentially getting the death penalty.",

      "timeStamp": "11:40:32",
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "Yes, I think a couple of things.I think the one thing that is, of course, concerning to everyone, no more concerning than to her family, of course, was the fact that he was permitted even to have this opportunity, based upon being arrested previously both in New York, both in Georgia, whether or not that could have prevented him being in -- whether ICE officials could have gotten involved. Apparently, they tried to, but he was released before that time. And so it speaks to how the system certainly needs to be tightened up. The second thing is, in terms of actually event itself, could there have been more security in that particular area? People have the right to run wherever they want. There's a specific trail here. Could that -- security measures have been more heightened? That being said, the fact that he engaged in this activity just, I mean, unimaginable, the fact that he had this opportunity to confront her, the fact that he also was, let's remember, accused and convicted of this Peeping Tom -- he apparently was peeping in on someone else's apartment looking to and having bad intentions. And so the crimes are going to be committed, whether you're undocumented or whether you're citizens, et cetera. I think the fact is, is that, when there are those crimes, they need to be held accountable. There was accountability today. But my big takeaway is the issue of prevention and how potentially this is a lesson moving forward about how prevention can occur, so that we're not at this place.",

What's happening here is new problems for Rudy Giuliani. He's had a lot of them in court, but this is following a settlement that he agreed to about six months ago, where he said he would no longer defame Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, these two Georgia election workers. He would stop insinuating that there was fraud in the 2020 election, that they would have participated in those false statements. But then their lawyers found that, on November 12 and 14, on a broadcast he does nightly, Giuliani re-upped these things. He claimed that there was fixing of machines in the 2020 vote, that these women were quadruple-counting ballots, also false, again. And so on this broadcast, he says he was framed, that he wants to be able to show courts tapes of these women counting votes. All of that, he had already agreed to that he wouldn't say, and so they're going to court and asking the judge to hold him in contempt. Here's his lawyer responding to that accusation. This is a new lawyer that just agreed to start helping Giuliani just a few days ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
