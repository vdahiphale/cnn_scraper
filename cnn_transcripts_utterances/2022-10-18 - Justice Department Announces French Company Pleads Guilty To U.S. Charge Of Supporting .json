So, let's remember the time that this is happening, ISIS is essentially taking over large swaths of Syria in an effort to establish what they refer to as the caliphate. It essentially was an Islamic government in Syria that had taken over the country from the Syrian Government. The allegation and in fact, what LCS has pled to here, amounts to not just complying with or protecting their employees from the draconian circumstances levied upon the people there by ISIS, but actually assisting the terrorist organization in establishing their government in paying taxes, in revenue sharing, and conducting operations.These are all things that run directly counter to U.S. foreign policy interests, U.S. national security, and in fact, enabled ISIS to continue targeting Americans and brutalizing Americans in Syria in the way they did. So, it's very serious conduct. And I think it sends a message to all companies who find themselves operating in conflict zones, that if you -- if you pay to play with the devil, there could be some serious consequences down the road from the United States.",

Let me read a little bit that we -- that we found here. It says the gains to all participants in the conspiracy, including Lafarge, their Syrian subsidiary and the intermediaries, and the terrorist groups totaled approximately $80.5 million. In our scratch math, it looks like it's about -- it's about 9 million went directly to ISIS and that -- and to another terror group. I mean, what does that kind of money mean for groups like ISIS, like what they were enabling?",

And ultimately, if you're as strong as ISIS was in Syria, at that time, you levy taxes, essentially, extortion upon the people and the entities, the corporations that are within your area of control.And that's exactly what they did here. So by playing into that LCS enabled ISIS to continue their waging their terrorist tactics across Syria, and also directing terrorist attacks around the globe, here in the United States, in places like France and the UK, and other places where their supporters and adherence engaged in terrorist activity. And let's not forget, profit was the motive here. LCS was looking to be in a position in operation when whatever happened with this conflict was finished, so they can have the inside track on rebuilding Syria, which had become completely destroyed throughout the course of the Civil War so really craven profit motivations that funded this terrorist activity.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, we are seeing a tug-of-war between the White House and OPEC. OPEC, taking supply off the market, that drive prices up, the Biden administration responding by adding supply in hopes of lowering prices. Now, two sources familiar with the matter telling our colleague, Phil Mattingly, that in the coming days, the Biden administration is planning to announce the additional sale of roughly 14 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserves.Now, importantly, we should note that this is part of that 180- million-barrel emergency relief announced back in March. As you can see, the strategic petroleum reserve has gone down sharply over the past year. The U.S. was on track to undershoot that 180-million-barrel figure. Now it looks like they're going to go ahead and do what they plan to do all along. It's just going to take a bit longer. Now nonetheless, this is already impacting prices. U.S. oil prices down almost 4 percent as we speak, back to, basically levels before OPEC announced their production cut. This should help at the gas pump. A gallon of regular gas is now selling for $3.87 nationally. That is not cheap, but it is of course down from that record high ended June of $5. And we could see gas prices tick a little bit lower. Also on the energy front, new images show the devastating damage done to Nord Stream. That is the natural gas pipeline linking Russia and Europe. Danish police say that preliminary investigations show the damage was caused by powerful explosions. Kate, this is just another reminder of the threats to the supply of energy as this war in Ukraine rages.",

He's being cross-examined right now in the sexual misconduct civil trial against him. Spacey was emotional as he denied allegations yesterday that he sexually assaulted actor Anthony Rapp when he was 14 years old. CNN's Jean Casarez has been following the testimony.

      "sentences": "Well, this just happened and it is important. Outside of the presence of the jury, the attorneys for Anthony Rapp argued with the judge that they want to question Kevin Spacey about a book his brother wrote that said in the book that as a child that Kevin Spacey was sexually abused by their father. The judge denied it. He is not allowing it. The attorneys for Kevin Spacey argued the only reason they want this is to try to show that it was done to him and he does it to others.So, the cross-examination is proceeding right now bringing out his memory and things like that. But very important to this case is that two of the three charges have now been dismissed, assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress with the three original charges. Months ago, the assault was thrown out because the statute of limitations had run. Yesterday, the attorneys for Kevin Spacey argued very strongly to the judge to dismiss the other two. The judge said I can't do that, but what I can do is I see a duplication of the elements of battery and intentional infliction of both -- emotional distress. Both show serious emotional distress, anger, resentment, emotional issues, it's not fair to have them both. So, he dismissed the intentional infliction of emotional distress. And, Kate, now, only battery will be going to the civil jury. Why is that important? The plaintiff is asking for $40 million in damages. And with only one charge left, that drastically reduces what he would be able to get if, in fact, the jury would find Spacey liable.",

CNN's medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula joins me now with more on this. What do you see in this study, Dr. Narula?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I mean, this isn't really a great picture that's being painted. This was researchers that looked at 982 diabetics used insulin. They surveyed them. And from that, they estimated that 1.3 million Americans, or 16.5 percent of those who are diabetic and used insulin ration their insulin use last year. This was most commonly seen in Type 1 diabetics and those who are under 65, those were middle income and African Americans, more common in the uninsured population, but also seen in those with private insurance. We know that insulin prices have really soared over the last 10 -- 15 years and many people have to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars every month.",
