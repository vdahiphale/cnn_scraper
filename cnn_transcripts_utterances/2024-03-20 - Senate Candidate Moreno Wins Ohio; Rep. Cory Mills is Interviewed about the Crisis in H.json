We can talk big picture too in terms of some warning signs for Trump kind of underneath these numbers. But what do you make of Moreno winning here and how he stacks up against Sherrod Brown. CHALIAN: I mean he didn't just win, right? I mean he won with an 18 percentage point margin over Matt Dolan, the more establishment backed, DeWine, Portman backed candidate here. So, a huge, significant victory, obviously, for Moreno, for Trump, who went in last weekend. There's no doubt about that. And continuing to put the stamp on the fact that that old establishment Republican Party is no more as the dominant force inside the Republican Party. We know that it's Donald Trump's party. But to your point, Kasie, what is consequential here is the matchup for November because this is a race that could end up determining control of the United States Senate. And Sherrod Brown has a major uphill climb in now what was formerly a battleground state, but is now very red state of Ohio. And he's running in a cycle unlike his previous three races as the state has gotten further away from Democrats. So, I know Democrats got the candidate that they preferred, and -",

Nearly 1,000 Americans in Haiti have filled out a crisis intake form to try to evacuate. Joining me now is Republican Congressman Cory Mills of Florida. He has personally, with the help of a strong team, rescued 23 Americans from Haiti since the country was overtaken by gang violence. Congressman, thank you very much for being here.
