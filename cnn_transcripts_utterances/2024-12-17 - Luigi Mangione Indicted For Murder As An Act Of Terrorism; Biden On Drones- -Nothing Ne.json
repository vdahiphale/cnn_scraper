But there are questions, tonight, about how prosecutors will prove that Mangione intended to terrorize a civilian population. In the week since Brian Thompson's killing, we have seen dark praise for the murder on social media and elsewhere, with some even celebrating it while expressing their anger at America's Health Insurance industry. We're even just learning tonight about the support that Mangione is getting while he's behind bars. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections tells CNN that Mangione has gotten 157 deposits into his prison commissary account, along with letters and dozens of emails. The 26-year-old is set to appear in a Pennsylvania courtroom, for an extradition hearing, this Thursday. His new attorney, which you learned about here, first on THE SOURCE, on Friday night, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, says that her client is no longer going to fight extradition to New York. There's also been another notable revelation about what Mangione's mom told police, before he was arrested. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, in terms of jury nullification, I'll tell you this. I've presided over a lot of felony jury trials, in both New York County and Kings County, and I spoke to every single juror after those convictions or acquittals. And jury nullification is something we all talk about, as lawyers. But it's rare. Jurors, in my view, and the ones I've spoken to, do the right thing. They follow the law.

Musk and SpaceX are to report itineraries and meeting notes during their foreign travel. Instead, The Times reports tonight that Musk and SpaceX have repeatedly left out details, or even the mere existence of meetings that he has had abroad. Musk is also required to report the use of even prescription drugs. And the government bans the use of federally-prohibited ones, like marijuana, which is why you cannot smoke if you have a security clearance.

This new report raises questions and some concerns about Musk's interactions with world leaders, at a time where he has very deep influence in the President-elect's inner circle.He responded to The Times piece, writing, quote, \"Deep state traitors are coming after me, using their paid shills in legacy media. I prefer not to start fights, but I do end them.\" My source tonight was Trump's longest-serving National Security Advisor, during his first term. Ambassador John Bolton is here. And Ambassador, it's great to have you. Because when you look at these reviews and what is alleged, a failure to disclose these details, how serious is that? JOHN BOLTON, FORMER TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.: Well, first, let's start with a proposition. This is a news story, and it's not a Holy Writ. So, further evidence may be forthcoming. But Musk's response to it, I think, is really irresponsible. The defense contractors take this continuous vetting process very seriously. Their contracts can depend on it. And given the amount of contracts that Musk has with the federal government, it's very important that he and his company comply with these obligations, just like everybody else. This may sound very intrusive. But when you contract with the federal government, especially the Defense Department, they have what they call an Open Kimono policy, which is they know everything about you. If you don't want to contract with the government, don't contract with the government. But that's what they worry about, so that critical national security information doesn't get to our adversaries. And I think the real concern here is China, and some of the things that Musk has said about China, his quite large investment in Tesla in China. And I think that's probably what's at the bottom of many of these Defense Department concerns.",

I mean, if you go back to Loral Space Communications, for example, which made satellites, at the end of the 1990s, the end of the Clinton administration, was accused of helping the Chinese launch their missiles more effectively, so they didn't blow up and destroy their satellites. And they ended up paying a $20 million fine, I think it was, to the Defense Department. That was 25 years ago, almost. And China has considerable leverage over Musk, given the Tesla -- level of Tesla investment in China. And he's said some pretty strange things. At least a lot of people would consider them strange. Musk said that Taiwan should be a special administrative region of China. Not very popular on Taiwan. Not American policy either. So look, he has to comply with these regulations. They are burdensome. There's no doubt about it. His company has to comply. Other defense contractors comply. As I say, if you think they're too burdensome, don't contract with the federal government. But if you do, do what everybody else does, and follow the regulations.",

I talk to people, who say, they are always together. He's always around at Mar-a-Lago. He sits in on job interviews. He's got -- he's got a heavy influence on Trump, at the moment. BOLTON: Yes, well, he has a propensity to post on X, the way Trump posts on -- used to post on Twitter, including sensitive information. I remember one tweet that Trump put out was a picture of a Iranian ballistic missile that had blown up on the launchpad, that was given to him just a few hours before he posted it, and he was told specifically not to do it. So being careless with national security information is a problem Trump has, as we know from the famous Mar-a- Lago documents case. So, I think it will be a legitimate question, for all the people who require Senate confirmation, how much do they care about security precautions in the federal government? And a lot will change after noon on the 20th of January. Right now, Trump is still a private citizen. But after he becomes president, talking to people like Musk, the whole DOGE operation, could well become, probably will become, subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, not the most famous statute in the world, that could have a big impact on its activities. So, I think this is a legitimate subject of concern. And as I say, this is a news article. And even in The New York Times, it's not always a 100 percent correct.

SARAH MATTHEWS, FORMER DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY FOR PRES. TRUMP: It does seem like the punishment is kind of the purpose here. It looks like they want to punish her for putting out this unfavorable poll to him. When in actuality, this did more harm to her reputation than anything. She would not have risked her reputation and her record to put forth this poll, if she didn't believe that it were to be true. But obviously, she stood by her outdated methodology. We know that she kind of stood by it, because she said Iowa's population, it was in line with the methodology that she used, an older, predominantly white population. Obviously, those methods caught up to her in 2024. And she put out this poll. It ended up being terribly wrong, and she's the one who has to deal with that. And so, it does seem really petty then, for Trump to have to go after her, and try to inflict more pain, put salt in the wound here. Because she was right at the end of her career, kind of noted as this renowned pollster. And then they are pursuing this lawsuit for what? The guy won the popular vote. He won the election. It just seems silly for him to go after her. But it just kind of proves, in my view, that he's like the smallest man who ever lived.",
