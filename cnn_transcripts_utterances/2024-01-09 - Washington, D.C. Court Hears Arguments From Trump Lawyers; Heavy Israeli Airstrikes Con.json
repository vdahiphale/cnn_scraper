Now, if Trump's arguments are ultimately ruled successful, it could instantly end the election interference case against him. Here's just a little bit of what each side had to say before the judges. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) D. JOHN SAUER, ATTORNEY FOR FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If a President has to look over his shoulder or her shoulder every time he hears she has to make a controversial decision where after I leave office, am I going to jail for this? My political opponents take power that inevitably dampens the ability of the President. JAMES PEARCE, ASSISTANT SPECIAL COUNSEL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: Never in our nation's history until this case has the President claimed that immunity and criminal prosecution extends beyond his time of office. The President has a unique constitutional role but he is not above the law. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

Remember that six days togo ago until Iowa -- he took time off from the campaign trail in order to attend the hearing in person. Note that he was not required to be there. He chose to be. Obviously, this is a political moment for him, as well. And just moments ago, he spoke to the media saying that he did absolutely nothing wrong. And if his side loses, it will open up all future presidents up to prosecution by their rival, something that his lawyers were arguing, as well. It is unknown how quickly the Appeals Court might rule in this case, but whatever they find, I think we can all agree that this issue is likely to appeal again, be appealed again rather to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

There are so many different arguments here and so many issues to be addressing in this court. So, the way I sat inside and was able to watch a closed circuit video feed of the courtroom, as well as listen to the arguments. And there essentially were three things that the judges really were trying to put a point on. The first is can they do this now? Is this even a case that should be before them right now? Before Trump goes to trial, very few things can actually be addressed by an Appeals Court before a trial takes place and a criminal defendant faces a jury. So, that was one of the questions. That's what they started with. They wanted the lawyers on both sides to tell them why they should have this case now. The second thing is, where's the line around the presidency? That is the big question here. Is there some sort of protection around the presidency? Where do you draw that line? Where is it in the Constitution? Where is it in the duties of the president versus the duties of somebody who's running for president, somebody who's campaigning, and what sort of standards should this court adopt for that? On top of that, the third thing that they were doing is they were trying to figure out what to do, how to do it. And one of the questions from Judge Karen Henderson was about how do we write an opinion here that doesn't open the floodgates to political prosecution, that thing that John Sauer, Trump's attorney, James Pearce, other attorney in court, we're just going after one after another. Here is what James Pearce -- I'm sorry, he's with the Justice Department, what James Pearce had to say about it's not going to open the floodgates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, it has been raised by the defense to say that in addition to this immunity argument, that it's improper for Donald Trump to face any criminal charges because the impeachment was ultimately unsuccessful. He was not convicted. But what I find interesting about that argument is that it ended up being at odds with this idea of absolute immunity, which is the other argument raised by Donald Trump's defense. So much so that in the course of answering questions from the justices, it was ultimately conceded by Trump's team that had Donald Trump been impeached successfully at the time, then it would be proper to face prosecution. So, that really is at odds with the idea of absolute immunity, which was raised as an argument that he cannot be charged in any criminal capacity while for anything that happened during the time that he was the President because that would qualify as an official act. So, it's a very complicated legal structure. But I found that concession by Trump's team to be interesting. And it was a lot of what the justices were getting at, proposing hypothetical scenarios. And, ultimately, his team did concede on that point.",

And onereason I say that is because of Richard Nixon. This is something that was also brought up during the course of the arguments it was raised in the papers that Nixon, obviously he left office, he resigned. After he resigned, he was pardoned. Right. So presumably, had he gone through the impeachment process, that would have been successful. But since he left office on his own accord, he was pardoned, which would imply that there was the possibility of criminal charges. So, I do think the argument was likely to come up, and I'm sure Trump's team knew that. It just was addressed so blatantly and so on point by the justices that I do think from the perspective of watching these arguments unfold, I foresee that the judges are really, really paying attention to that aspect when ultimately making their decision on this case.",

As many of the judges pointed out today, that's absurd. It's absurd because trying to overturn an election is not consistent with defending our constitution. It's utterly inconsistent with anything resembling faithfully executing the office of President, given that we've got a tradition of peaceful transfer of power that continued from George Washington until January 6, 2021. I'm glad you also played the clip of the judge pushing back on Trump's counsel in the hearing today, saying that Trump's lawyers argued in the first impeachment that a President could be prosecuted, that there was limited immunity while someone's President. That's what Republican Senators argued during his second impeachment. They're, oh, we don't need to impeach him. This can be handled through the courts. This is simply an attempt to wriggle out of accountability. It's logically inconsistent. But Trump is sticking to his guns and his lawyers are doing their bidding for their audience of one.",

That's BS, but that's the argument he'll make. He'll also fundraise off it effectively. And I think this is where we need to sort of keep these things in mind. This is, to me, less about the politics and more about remembering that we're watching history in the present tense. This is about precedent. You know, to hear Donald Trump, Richard Nixon's discredited line that if a president does it it's not illegal, that that's sacrosanct. That's a very dangerous precedent. I heard another extraordinary argument from his lawyers today in the press conference after the hearing in which his lawyer John Lauro basically argued that if this were to go forward, if he were not granted immunity. Then that would be incredibly dangerous for President Biden when President Trump should become President again, basically threatening the current President and saying that's the Pandora's box, that if you hold Trump accountable, that that's, that'll be really standing in the way of our healing and reconciliation as a nation.

So, he can basically be on ice according to the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel opinion that a sitting President can't be prosecuted criminally. And that's the larger backdrop here. These are all desperate attempts to wriggle out of accountability. And that's why I do find it, as someone who cares deeply about finding ways to reunite the nation, thinking about how we apply history to the present tense. The argument -- they're holding Trump accountable for an unprecedented action, trying to overturn an election on the basis of a lie that led to an attack on the Capitol, that any accountability for that action, which is utterly outside anything resembling a presidential responsibility, would itself be divisive and perpetuate rancor. Now it's accountability, but that's what Trump is desperately trying to get out of any way he can, and delay through the courts is one of his best gambits to do it.",

At the Vatican on Monday, the pontiffdescribed surrogate motherhood as a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and the child. He said that a child is always a gift and never the basis of a commercial contract. The Catholic Church has long opposed surrogacy. It is illegal in Italy and in several other countries, as well. And it's also restricted in many countries, too. CNN Vatican Correspondent Christopher Lamb is just live now from London. The fact that the Pope here referred to surrogacy as the commercialization of pregnancy, that an unborn child must not be turned into an object of trafficking. I mean, there are a lot of countries where surrogacy is, of course, legal. For example, where I am here in the U.S., it's legal in several states. What's been the reaction? What is the potential fallout of those comments from the Pope?",

However, I think this is consistent with what the Pope has said in the past about surrogacy. And as you mentioned, one of the main concerns that he has is that it puts childbirth, as his words, subject to commercial contracts. Now, it may be that he has in mind, places like Ukraine where there are women who feel they need to go down this route for financial reasons. And in the past, Pope Francis has said that he believes that women who are vulnerable or the poorer women are often the ones exploited in these arrangements. So I mean, it's an interesting intervention because it comes after the Pope had authorized blessings for same-sex couples and after the Vatican had said that the children of same-sex couples can receive baptism and be part of the Church. So, I think it shows how the Pope is both trying to be open and inclusive and pastoral, but at the same time, he upholds traditional Catholic teaching when it comes to these matters.",
