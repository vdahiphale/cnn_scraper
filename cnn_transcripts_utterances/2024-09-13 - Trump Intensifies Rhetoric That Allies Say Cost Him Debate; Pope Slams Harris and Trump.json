Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera):  Good evening, happy Friday. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about, pet peeves and politics. Donald Trump tripling down on the rants, the tangents, and the conspiracies that his allies have told him cost him the debate, rhetoric that Kamala Harris tonight says that Americans are exhausted by. He's set to speak in Las Vegas any moment now, but I'll start in Ohio. Schools in Springfield have been forced to evacuate for the second day in a row now over threats after Trump amplified baseless conspiracies about migrants eating pets in that community. Now, it's clear he doesn't care about any of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: No, no. The real threat is what's happening at our border. We will do large deportations from Springfield, Ohio, large deportations. We're going to get these people out. It's like an invasion from within. We're going to have the largest deportation in the history of our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And if he's right, it'll be because of this. Nativism is one of the most powerful forces in not just American politics, but world politics, and it is rooted in human nature. And you look at history, this is 100 percent true.

And given that that is part of our human animal nature, to use rhetoric, it is true that people are suffering and people have anxieties, but to then fan those flames. We've seen this in the Jewish community before when Trump supported people who said Jews will not replace us, and then not long after that there was the Tree of Life shooter who was spouting the Great Replacement Theory.So, I agree that there's an aspect to human nature that we favor our group, but what wise leaders do is work with that skillfully, not fan the flames of sort of the most violent aspects of who we are.",

Both of these candidates are promoting policies that run contrary to that dogma, right?But I think what he's sort of tacitly saying is, it's not one or the other that abortion is a veto because there are many conservative Catholics who see this as a one issue election, not immigration, by the way, but abortion. And I think what the pope is trying to say is, well, there's teachings on all sides of this, right? So, Donald Trump is violating Catholic teachings, this is the pope, not me, on migration.

What's new here is that I don't think the Catholic Church has ever put those two issues on a par, which is to say, abortion has been a much more important issue in Catholicism than immigration.
