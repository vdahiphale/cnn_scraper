But now, they look at the numbers.They're going to reach a four percent shortfall. That doesn't seem like much, but that's about five million acre-feet of water over the next century. The new laws are, if you're going to build a new development, put a thousand homes out in the middle of the virgin desert, you got to have the water to supply those homes for the next century or so. And once they did that math, they realized now the time -- now is the time to stop short and put a halt on this. Here's Governor Katie Hobbs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATIE HOBBS (D-AZ): That's why as required by law, we will pause approvals of new assured water supply determinations that rely on pumping groundwater. Ensuring that we don't add to any future deficit. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's just the new ones you have to think about.And also, most of the Colorado River water, almost 70 percent goes to agriculture. A lot of that is for growing feed for cattle. Right now, federal money is paying alfalfa farmers in Arizona not to plant in order to conserve water. So that can't go on for very long. All of this is sort of a sign that there's a new attitude when it comes to water and the age of megadrought and then intense weather whiplash, these flash floods, until the infrastructure is there to capture that abnormally high rainfall and hold it for those long stretches of drought.

So, the question was, would it also work for patients in early stages? Because thankfully, breast cancer often is caught early.And so what they found it -- they did a very large clinical trial, they found that when they gave the drug to folks, and they looked at three-year survival, were people still alive three years later? If they took the drug, that rate was about 90 percent. If they didn't take the drug, that rate was about 87 percent. Now, you might say that's not such a huge difference. But you know, breast cancer is so common. When you talk about the huge number of people in the United States who get breast cancer, that is really quite a big difference. And we're talking about survival here, you know. The difference between making it to three years and not making it to three years.
