Ukrainian troops were forced to withdraw last week, something President Biden has blamed directly on Congress's inability to pass more aid for Ukraine.Now, as the war enters its third year, the president is running out of ways to help the nation fight off Russia's invasion. On Friday, the White House will announce a new round of significant as they have called it sanctions against Russia. But that's about all that the president can do unless the House finally agrees to take up the funding bill. Joining us now is Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh. Thank you so much for coming on this morning. I do want to ask you about this. Our Christiane Amanpour is in Ukraine right now. And she just spoke with Ukraine's Foreign Minister. And he was very clear why Ukraine could not stop Russia from taking another city. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's as simple as that.What happened in Avdiivka is the exact result of congressional inaction. We've been raising the sound bells on this. They've been ringing the alarm since October to pass our urgent supplemental request to allow us to continue to flow aid to Ukraine. Unfortunately, Ukraine has not seen an aid package from the United States since December 27. And they're in the fight of their lives. They're still pushing in the East and the South, but they had to make a strategic withdrawal from Avdiivka in order to preserve their resources, to conserve their ammunition and artillery. So, we are going to continue to urge Congress to act -- to pass this supplemental that the Senate took up just last week and passed with bipartisan support. But we really need the House to act in order for us to continue to flow these presidential drawdown packages to Ukraine in their -- in their fight against Russia.",

It sends a detrimental message. And so, we here at the Pentagon, the secretary is continuing to urge Congress to pass this critical aid. And also, we're urging Congress to pass our budget request. We are still operating under a short-term C.R. As you are well- tracking, I know, the House comes back into session on February 28. And three days later, the government could shut down.

CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich is here with the details. What can you tell us? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So, you have the two largest brewers in North America right now. You either have workers on strike or threatening to go on strike. So, at Molson Coors, that one brewery in Fort Worth, Texas, you have about 400 people that are on the picket lines right now. They say that the offer that they got from the company was about a dollar-an-hour increase in wages. They call that deal insulting. And they said it was in part because we know that in 2023, the company reported $1.5 billion in earnings pre-tax, but that was a 39 percent increase from 2022.",

And this is also over wages and benefits. They've seen in the third quarter of last year a five percent increase in profits. And the Union also calling the offer that was put on the table insulting the Teamsters going back to Anheuser-Busch and saying we need your best and final. According to the two companies, they clearly want to work this out. But they are putting contingency plans in place to make sure that there is supply, to make sure that there are people working. As we know we're heading into March Madness, this is a huge time for sports, a huge time for beer drinking. And the last thing these two companies want is a strike at any of these locations or expanded strikes. Anheuser-Busch is feeling a little more confident that they can come to a deal by a week from Friday. But this is really a continuation of what we saw last year, right?",
