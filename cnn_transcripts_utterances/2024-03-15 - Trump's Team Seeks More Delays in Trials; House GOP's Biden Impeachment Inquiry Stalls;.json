At least two people have been killed in this region after the twisters hit. Our meteorologist, Derek van Dam, tracking the damage and storms still out there right now. He will be with us later on in the hour. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to be with you on this Friday morning. Happy Friday. It is decision day for the Fulton County D.A. Just hours from now, Georgia Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee will announce whether Fani Willis can resume her prosecution of Donald Trump. She is facing disqualification for having a romantic relationship with her lead prosecutor. If Willis is removed, it is highly unlikely that the case would be tried before the November election. And there's questions about whether it will be tried at all. There is also a delay in the New York hush-money case. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, agreeing to delay that trial for up to 30 days, pushing the start date into late April. In another case, Trump was in a Florida courtroom yesterday, trying to convince the judge that he appointed to throw out the classified documents case against him. Judge Aileen Cannon shot down Trump's chief argument. We're going to see whether the former president still feels this way about her.

If it meant spending money to silence people, if it meant inciting a riot on the Capitol. Right? You've got to start to give people a little more of a narrative around why does it matter?

When Republicans took the majority and got their committees in January 2023, investigating the president and his family was a top priority for them.But 15 months or so in, they've received over 100,000 documents. They've interviewed over 40 people, including Hunter and the president's brother, their business associates, Department of Justice officials, IRS whistleblowers, and they don't have evidence of wrongdoing. And so the question is, how do you land this plane when the expectation was you were going to be able to deliver some -- some evidence of wrongdoing and then impeachment articles against the president? And so one conversation is about criminal referrals. House Oversight Chair James Comer, who's co-leading this investigation, very much wants that. He's on television talking about it. I've talked to him about it many times. But the two other stakeholders in this decision-making process -- the speaker, Mike Johnson, and Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan -- are less committal when it comes to criminal referrals. And they said there's still more conversations need to be had. Beyond that, Comer says he wants to do legislative reforms to address so-called influence peddling.

We just put this graphic together. See that first line of storms that move through? Right there, near the border of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, right along the Ohio Reiver, a tornado spawned. This is not associated with the late evening dusk tornadoes that you saw the footage just a moment ago from Winchester, Indiana. But here it is, Carrollton, Kentucky. Daylight footage confirms tornado on the ground. And some of the resulting damage is just horrific: homes completely wiped off of their foundations, roofs taken off of buildings. I mean, scary stuff. All in all, we've had eight confirmed tornado reports, and the National Weather Service is talking about that tornado near the Ohio River that spawned low-end EF-2 wind damage. So that's roughly 111 miles per hour to upwards of 135 miles per hour. That current band of thunderstorms that produced the tornadoes, moving South. It is moving into a more stable environment.
