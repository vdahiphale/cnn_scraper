      "sentences": "Republican governor of Florida making news today.Ron DeSantis' administration is blocking a new Advanced Placement or AP course, on African American studies, in high schools. Official with the State Department of Education wrote in a letter, to the College Board, which administers AP exams, quote, \"The content of this course is inexplicably contrary to Florida law and significantly lacks educational value.\" No mention in the letter of what law would be violated by the course, or what in the curriculum was objectionable. But a DeSantis spokesman tells CNN, the course, quote - excuse me - \"Leaves large, ambiguous gaps that can be filled with additional ideological material, which we will not allow.\" Joining me, now, two CNN Political Commentators, Bakari Sellers, former State Representative of South Carolina, Host of \"The Bakari Sellers Podcast\"; also, former Trump Campaign Adviser, and now a supporter of Ron DeSantis, David Urban. Bakari, what does it say to you that the Administration is specifically - excuse me, I'm coughing - doesn't identify what part of the course they object to. We're talking about an AP African American studies course. BAKARI SELLERS, (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA HOUSE MEMBER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, HOST, \"THE BAKARI SELLERS PODCAST\": Well, Anderson, I actually think they said all they needed to say. And they said this African American studies course doesn't have any value. I've been speaking to my friends, about this, via text, et cetera. And one of them, just recently texted me, that, they're trying to erase our history. And that's exactly what they're trying to do. I mean, this is anti-intellectualism. This is anti-Black racism. This is systemic - when we talk about systemic racism, this is exactly what we're talking about. It's the way by which we go about ensuring that people cannot learn about the plight and burdens that African Americans, in this country, went through, and go through, today. I don't know what voids, Ron DeSantis is talking about. I haven't seen the curriculum. But I'm actually an African American Studies Major. I am actually the son of someone, who was a Director, of an African American Studies program, at the University of South Carolina, who oh by the way, was a member of SNCC, and happened to be shot in the Civil Rights movement. And so, I just think it's a damn shame, what Ron DeSantis is doing. But nobody is going to stop him, because they're afraid of what maybe next, from Mr. DeSantis.",

In the future, if the College Board liked to work with us, on something that would meet our criteria, we'd be happy to consider it again.\" And from what I was told, Anderson, and Bakari, this was declined, because it sought to teach progressive doctrines, such as intersectionality, and critical race theory, which are violative of April 2022 law that Governor DeSantis sent, this Anti-WOKE Act. I'm not, you know, I'm simply telling you that what - I've not delved in and read every chapter of the syllabus. But I glanced through it. It's pretty - it's pretty dense.

But they don't even know who he was, because we don't teach the history correctly. People whitewash his legacy. They don't talk about the fact that he was a rabid revolutionary. They don't talk about the fact that he was talking about wages, and proving the plight of Black Folk day in and day out. And I think that the fact that we refuse to teach the accurate history of this country? We refuse to talk about April 4th, 1968, where Dr. King was assassinated? February 8th, 1968, the Orangeburg Massacre? We refuse to talk about June of that year, where RFK was shot? Or the fact that you have all of these Black soldiers coming home from a war in Vietnam, being treated like second-class citizens? That's not something that is a fairy tale. That is a history of who we are. And Ron DeSantis, and this administration, in Florida, are completely ignorant to that fact.

That's what's at stake here. We've never defaulted on our debt. And we have heard from several leaders, including Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, today that that will not happen. But here's the state of play, as it is, right now. House Republicans have been adamant, led by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that they are not going to sign off, on what's known as just a \"Clean\" debt ceiling bill that would just be clearing the debt ceiling. They want to attach to that spending cuts, and a fiscal agreement, before they do any of that. They want to negotiate before they sign off on raising the debt limit. The White House has been equally adamant that they don't want to negotiate at all. And so, that's really where we are at this point. Mitch McConnell, also saying today that he believes negotiations will take place. Senate Majority Leader, Chuck Schumer, really, pinning this, on what he calls MAGA Republicans, and saying nothing about negotiations. And of course, the House and Senate come back next week. And this is what they are going to be squarely focused on. We do know that some bipartisan talks, on the House, have begun to percolate. But those are in very, very early stages.

At this point, they've got to focus on how they're going to do this. Will there be negotiations? What are Democrats, if anything, willing to concede? Again, the White House continuing to maintain that they're giving up nothing, and Republicans saying that they're just simply not going to sign off on this without any negotiation.
