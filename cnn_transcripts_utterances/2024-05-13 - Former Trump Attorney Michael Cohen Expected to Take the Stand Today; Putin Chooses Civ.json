Ahead, how Michael Cohen could make or break the former president's hush money case.A shakeup at the highest levels of Russia's military. Vladimir Putin choosing a civilian as his new defense minister. And both Republicans and Democrats in Congress pushing back on President Biden for threatening to withhold some weapons shipments to Israel. All right, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, a live look at Capitol Hill on this Monday morning. Good morning, everyone, hope you had a wonderful Mother's Day weekend, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. In just a few hours, the star witness in Donald Trump's hush money trial will take the stand. Former Trump attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen. You may recall, Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump. Now, prosecutors are hoping his testimony will close the circle for the jury by directly connecting Trump to $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, how Trump reimbursed Cohen for that payment at the heart of the trial. Joining me now, \"The Hill\" reporter, Julia Manchester. Julia, good morning to you --",

And then, we've had this, you know, really high-profile role changed. So, we're trying to read into what we can about Putin's future strategy. But he's putting an economist in there. Which does suggest that, you know, bedding in almost into this process of conflict, which probably make clear, there's a chief of the defense staff who is the opera -- you know, the top soldier if you like, in the Russian military, reports directly to Putin already. So, he's across the operational side.

A tense moment in Australia as a small plane approaches the runway without its landing gear. The pilot pulls off a textbook belly landing, the craft circled the airport for hours to burn fuel before attempting to landing. And all three people aboard walked away without injuries. That's great. All right, severe storms and flood threats continue from Texas to the Gulf Coast with residents bracing for the next round as they dig out after three tornadoes in the Tallahassee area. Our weatherman, Derek Van Dam tracking all of it for us. Derek, good morning, what are you seeing?   DEREK VAN DAM, METEOROLOGIST:  Yes, this is the last thing that they need this morning across the Florida Panhandle. But this is what we're seeing. Current radar, very busy and I'm concerned about this line of storms right now, moving through southeastern sections of Mississippi. See how it's starting to kind of make a bow-like structure, we're going to watch for that to kind of continue to bow out. So, we call this a potential Derecho, which is a straight-line wind event, hasn't quite efficiently reached that status just yet. But one thing is for sure, it's creating severe thunderstorms, and as it propagates eastward, could impact places like southern Alabama and into the Florida Panhandle. So, this is the area that was struck by two or three tornadoes across other greater Tallahassee region on Friday,  you could see the storm prediction center has enhanced the risk -- increased the risk to enhance, I should say, from the Florida Panhandle right through Louisiana and the central sections of Texas. In fact, we have a 5 percent risk of tornadoes today, New Orleans, Lake Charles, Mobile and Tallahassee. Greatest risks though for hail really extends across southeastern sections of Texas, San Antonio to Houston, where you see that hatched shading. And this isn't the only round of severe storms, we'll get another round tomorrow and into the day on Wednesday. So, with this multiple round of wet weather, unsettled conditions, we have flood watches in effect for this particular location, 3 to 6 inches of rain, not good news. This is already very saturated areas, so localized flooding possible, we're going to look out for that potential at least across the Gulf Coast states. Weather prediction center has what it's called a moderate risk of excessive rainfall that could lead to flash flooding. So, we're going to keep an eye into the sky and an eye on the roads for this potential of flooding and severe weather once again today and this week, Kasie?",
