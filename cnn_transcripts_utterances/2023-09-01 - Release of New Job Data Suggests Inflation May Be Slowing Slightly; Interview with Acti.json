It is no longer that break-neck speed that we saw at the beginning of the recovery, but this is what the president has been talking about when you are reaching a point where you got slow, steady growth. We continue to have an unemployment rate that is less than four percent for the longest stretch since the 1960s. And as you mentioned, more people are coming into the labor market. This is a good jobs report.",

People who have felt maybe left out from opportunity in the past.And so, we're really focused on making sure that all communities, when the president says, we have to build an economy from the middle-out, the bottom-up, and leave no one behind, that's the kind of thing that we're trying to do in every community across America so that families feel like when talk about a good economy, we mean them, too.",

The National Restaurant Association put it this way, adding this kind of cost to already high -- the already high price of food and years of increasing years of labor costs will leave many of these operators in the untenable position of raising prices, cutting costs, or closing their doors.

And there are only four times in 23 years that Hong Kong's authorities have declared a T-10 super typhoon, this is one of them. And they have been taking it very seriously.They shut down the schools today, the stock exchange, hundreds of flights canceled. And that goes for Southern China, Mainland China neighboring us, the City of Shenzhen with more than 13 million people, they closed their airport midway through the day. Today, closed schools as well. The city has been almost deserted the streets on a Friday night with the exception of emergency workers, police, and fire trucks moving around right now.

We have now learned just this morning that President Biden is asking Congress for more help on this very thing. Requesting an additional $4 billion to replenish the FEMA disaster fund, that's on top of the $12 billion that the Biden administration asked for last week.

Even though resources and equipment and staff were available to launch, he says, the conditions were so difficult that it may not have helped too much.In fact, he said, by the time there was situational awareness, it was unfortunately too late, because this fire was moving a mile a minute. And speaking of those fatalities, as you mention, the death toll is at 115 at the moment. You mentioned that missing or unaccounted list, that will be updated today. Last week it stood at 388, and they have been able to bring the number down by quickly determining some people on the list who are incarcerated or incorrectly reported. The actual number of missing person reports filed with the police department was also cut in half, the governor said yesterday, because they immediately found some of them unfortunately had died or were in a hospital.
