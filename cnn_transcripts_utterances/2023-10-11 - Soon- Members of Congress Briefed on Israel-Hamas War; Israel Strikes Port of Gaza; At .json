Right now, we don't know the fate of all the hostages who were kidnapped from Israel and taken to Gaza. President Biden has confirmed Americans are among the captives and at least 20 U.S. citizens are currently unaccounted for. The death toll in Israel from Hamas's surprise assault over the weekend continues to rise. At least 1,200 people are now confirmed dead as the scale and savagery of Hamas's massacre of civilians comes to light more and more each day. Fourteen Americans are confirmed dead, and the State Department tells us that number is expected to rise today.Let's begin with Erin Burnett in Ashkelon. Erin, what are you seeing right now? We have been following you throughout the morning. What are you seeing at the moment? ERIN BURNETT, CNN ANCHOR:  All right. So, Phil, we are actually moving here to a stairwell just because we are hearing again incoming. So our security team is having us move to the stairwell. So as you can see, we are just taking shelter here in the north side of a building because, obviously, the rocket fire from Gaza is coming from the south. Obviously, you saw what happened earlier when we were -- where the Israeli military is amassing very close to where we are now in Ashkelon. We understand from that earlier barrage, remember, we were talking, they said -- we were saying dozens and dozens of rockets were fired. We now know about 60 were fired and about six of them broke through the dome or were partially interpreted, only partially intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome. So there were remnants here in Ashkelon, in the actual city center where those rockets were targeting. We understand about 12 people were injured. And we're going to be heading over there in just a few moment. But we are here now in Ashkelon, and, as you can see, obviously, there are other people here. This is a city, a city of more than 100,000 people. The roads are very empty, but not completely empty. And there are cars still going by even as we could hear the thudding that just caused our security to ask us to move here back into this stairwell, as I said, Phil and Poppy, on the northern side of this building in Ashkelon.",

And as I said, on one side of the road you're within the line of where the actual sirens are going off. On the other side of the road we found a grocery store. We went inside. The store was not completely empty. I mean, there was actually someone with a full grocery cart. I would say it was quite empty. The shelves were full. But there is also this semblance of life continuing to go on as normal, which, of course is how things are here when people are so used to the general situation, although, of course, not the unprecedented specifics of the situation that we are in right now.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we spent most of our time in Sderot, which is very, very close to Gaza. It's perhaps two miles away. And it gives you that slightly different perspective because what you are witnessing, what we're witnessing here in Ashkelon is that sort of little uptick, slight uptick compared to a few days ago in people trying to go about their daily business, going shopping, a few more cars on the road.In Sderot it really is still not entirely deserted, but really most people have left. The stores are all closed. There is nowhere to go to buy anything. And on the streets there, really serious and significant foot patrols of military doing their patrols through the town there because there is still this concern about Hamas infiltration, although there is nothing for sure. They are taking a lot of precautions. So what we're witnessing close to Gaza is this continued heavy artillery barrages, this heavy artillery that was firing into Gaza last night. We could see the flash from where we were, and about four seconds later the boom was so loud, the doors and the windows of the building we were in were rattling. The roof was shaking. Then there will be the airstrikes as well on Gaza. But you really understand, as we've been traveling around this morning, coming from Sderot to where we are here in Ashkelon at the moment, just that increase in military presence. We have been talking about it the past few days, but the convoys get bigger. Not only do you see the convoys, but you're beginning to see the troops deployed on the ground with their backpacks, they're carrying stretchers, they're carrying radios, they're carrying bedrolls. These are soldiers who are not going back to a barracks anywhere tonight. They are out in the field. They are deployed. And close to the border with that fence to Gaza last night we could hear a lot of heavy equipment on the move. It sounded like possibly tanks, heavy mechanical diggers, all the sorts of things we have seen in the past that have been brought in by the military in advance of an incursion. Although there is no order for an incursion, I think for all the troops that are arriving here, they know that that is such a real possibility. And I think, it's giving a sense of security again to the population here that they are coming out. But the closer you get to Gaza, it's much more of a military zone, not a civilian zone. BURNETT:  Yes, I know, Nic. Watching some of those convoys go by, and one thing that really struck me is you would have someone on the top with the machine gun, fully ready to go, not sitting and waiting, fully ready to go. One thing I know you also had a chance to experience, Nic, is sort of why we are here to begin with, right, is we are getting more and more understanding of the horrific atrocities that happened in people's homes when these militants went door-to-door slaughtering people. And you were able to go to a kibbutz where that had happened. Can you tell us what you actually saw?",

I think it's happening to you repeatedly, and I think it shows humanity and the personal side of this as well. Erin Burnett, thank you so much.I want to get back now to CNN military analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel, Erin's reporting that six rockets had broken through the Iron Dome. We talk about what an incredible system it is when it's in action. But it's not infallible. Talk through that. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  So basically, Phil, what you see is every system is vulnerable, and I can't emphasize that enough. So when you see the Iron Dome in full impact and full effect here, you are able to see it take out some of the incoming rockets. The problem that you have is they can handle about 80 rockets per battery. Once you get beyond that, once the system is saturated, then you have a whole different situation here. And so you can tell when the rocket strikes occur, when Hamas is doing -- conducting these rocket strikes, they can go all over Israel and do this. Most of the time these rocket strikes are intercepted. However, every time that they saturate the system and the system isn't ready to take care of the trajectory as it comes to assess where it's going or any other type of anomaly, then you get an impact. And you get the kinds of things that you see in Ashkelon and in several other cities right around here. And the reason for that is the system is really dependent on accurate radar pictures, in some cases, accurate intelligence and the ability of the operators of the system to actually figure out what's going to happen with the incoming rockets. And that really becomes the key thing.",

Any human being, forget your race, religion, your politics. This is horrifying and more than a congressman, I'm a human being. And these images and the depravity of Hamas have got to be addressed.

That's why I've traveled to Riyadh recently, to Jerusalem, to inspire what we hope and still expect will be peace between Saudi Arabia and Israel.We believe in that because we think that may be the beginning of the very peace that we've been seeking for a half-century between Israel and Palestinians. But I want to remind people, that Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction. Hamas is sworn to annihilate the Jewish people. Until they change that disposition, there is going to be more death, there's going to be more destruction. And I ask, I plead, I invite Palestinians to recognize that principled leadership in this time has never been more important. And if and when they achieve that, there might be a chance, because then the rest of the world can push both sides together and ensure that we never see the images that we've been seeing this week. It's going to be difficult, but we must redouble our efforts right now because the Iranians, their proxies Hamas, and Hezbollah, they did this to disrupt that peace process because it frightens them.

I just ask people to be objective and empathize with both people right now. But there is wrong and right as it exists at this very moment.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  So, Phil, this is one of those times when you have to kind of step back a bit and see what the possible goals are. And I think what's happening here now that I've seen this video is that notice this break wall right here? This is an effort to basically keep all of these little boats inside. And remember that one of the attack mechanisms that Hamas was using against Israel was to use some boats that came along the Israeli coastline. So, with that said, I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to box these guys in. There is a fishing fleet there, too, so it'll probably impact them as well. But the basic idea that I think the Israelis have, is that they fear that they're going to be using small boats to go attack vessels in the Mediterranean, potentially, or even the Israeli coast. There's also some smoke over here in this building. I suspect that might very well be a target related to Hamas. Not 100% sure about that, but that is certainly something that looks like a very clear precision strike right there.
