I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour in East Palestine, Ohio where backlash over that toxic train derailment is growing and pressure is mounting on government officials to do more. The EPA now temporarily stopping the transfer of millions of gallons of contaminated waste to Michigan and Texas as the agency reviews disposal plans. Federal teams are now on the ground in East Palestine checking in on residents door-to-door passing out flyers with information on getting health assessments and clean water. But for many in that town, that simply is not good enough. Residents are worried about their health and their homes. Many are questioning how this even happened after an initial NTSB report said the derailment was 100 percent preventable. CNN's Jasmine Wright is in Wilmington, Delaware this morning where the President is spending the weekend. So Jasmine, you know, what more is the administration planning to do for the people of East Palestine?",

Well, that door- to-door effort you just spoke of was federal teams under the direction of President Biden is key because it is the federal government trying to show local residents that they are there for them as the Biden administration tries to really contain the fallout. That is, of course, in the face of this heavy criticism and also potentially House Oversight Committee probe that is being threatened.Now, we heard from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg over the weekend, who really slammed what he called misinformation surrounding the community in East Palestine, as well as saying that the administration's response has been very well coordinated. Now James Comer of House Oversight has really zero in on Pete Buttigieg really asking for him to turn over a tranche of documents related to his correspondence on this issue. While we also heard on Friday from President Biden himself, he weighed in and he said that the -- that this was a top of mind for him. He said that, you know, the EPA and other federal agents were on the ground just two hours after the train derailment happened. And Pete Buttigieg briefed President Biden on Friday after he returned from East Palestine himself. And take a listen to his response on how President Biden is thinking about this issue on MSNBC.

So, you know, there have been growing concerns, right, about China. Now, even according to the CIA Director, who feels almost certain China has a plan to supply Russia with more arsenal. This is what the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier today on CNN. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: And, you know, Beijing will have to make its own decisions about how it proceeds, whether it provides military assistance. But if it goes down that road, it will come at real cost to China. And I think China's leaders are weighing that as they make their decisions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The -- I think the biggest thing that we have to look at is the very fact that China and Russia are bringing themselves closer together. There has been a relationship between the two of them, especially with Putin in power in Russia, and Xi in China, that really shows this greater alliance. The -- they have an intelligence working relationship between their intelligence agencies, they have done military exercises together, showcasing a relationship between the two militaries. And this is, in essence, a natural outgrowth of those relationships that they've forged over the past few years. So my main concern when it comes to the situation in Ukraine, is that the Chinese will, in fact, actually be supplying weapons to the Russians so that they can prosecute the war even further in Ukraine. That means more suffering for the Ukrainian people. The form that this will take, you know, it depends on a variety of factors. But most likely drones, it will be part of this equation, munitions, artillery pieces, perhaps, even possibly spare parts for aviation assets, because the Russians and the Chinese share some aircraft types of between them. So this is something that is -- we definitely need to watch this. And it's highly likely, in my view, that the Chinese are going to support the Russians in this way, because they find it more important to have an alliance with each other, because they both believe that they need to, in essence, keep the United States at bay. And this is one way that they do that.",

Officials say heavy rain caused it to crumble. And about 50 miles south along the coast, the storm brought large waves and hail to Redondo Beach. This severe weather forcing all L.A. County beaches to close yesterday. And to the north, heavy snow forced officials to close parts of Interstate 5 leaving some drivers stranded on the road. And that same system is now marching east.

So we do have that video to show you guys. But first, a warning. That video is very disturbing. This happened on Tuesday in Flagler County, just south of St. Augustine, North of Daytona Beach. Here's a video. Matanzas High School, 17-year- old just really wailing on his teacher's aide right there, a paraprofessional knocks her to the ground and just punches and kicks her repeatedly. She appears to be motionless there. And we can see in the video quite a few employees and even students whose faces are blurred here, trying to keep him away from her. And he keeps repeatedly just punching and kicking at her. Eventually, they do manage to keep him down on the ground. And that employee, that school employee is taken away to the hospital. We do have a statement from Sheriff Rick Staly of Flagler County who says the actions of this student are absolutely horrendous and completely uncalled for. We hope the victim will be able to recover both mentally and physically from this incident. Thankfully, students and staff members came to the victim's aid before the school resource deputies could arrive. Our school should be a safe place for both employees and for students. So the sheriff's office did end up arresting that 17-year-old, charging him with felony, aggravated battery with bodily harm. And the arrest report also shows that he was getting violent even with the school resource deputy, to the point where they had to handcuff him, as we can see there, and take him away to a different location.

I said, wait a minute, you can't possibly love me. You just met me and, you know, you don't know anything about me. And it proceeded to tell me that I wasn't actually in love with my wife, that I should leave my wife and be with Sydney. And it persisted on this topic even after I tried to change the subject many, many times. So this is proof to me that Microsoft did not do the kind of quality control that it needed to do before it released this into the world.",

So you can now only have a conversation, I think with a maximum of six or ten chats inside a conversation before it will sort of shut down and ask you to start over again.So they're really trying to prevent this kind of long, meandering conversation. But this technology is still very much going to be deployed. It's going to be out in the world. If not from Microsoft, than from other companies.
