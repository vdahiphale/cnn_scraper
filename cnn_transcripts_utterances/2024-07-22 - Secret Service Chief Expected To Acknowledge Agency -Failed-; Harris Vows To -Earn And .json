The director of the Secret Service, Kimberly Cheatle, is preparing to testify before a House committee and is expected to tell lawmakers, \"we failed.\"This is her first testimony since a would-be assassin fired multiple shots at Donald Trump at his Pennsylvania rally on July 13, killing one man. CNN's Evan Perez is tracking all of this for us. He's joining us now. Evan, what more are you learning about what Kimberly Cheatle is expected to say?",

And this is the first time she's appearing before Congress. And meaningfully, I think for everyone who has been following the failures on the July 13, she is going to acknowledge for the first time that the Secret Service failed that day.I'll read you just a part of here prepared remarks, which we obtained ahead of time. \"The Secret Service's solemn mission is to protect our nation's leaders. On July 13th, we failed.\" She says, \"As the director of the United States Secret Service, I take full responsibility for any security lapse.\" And look, just in the past week, we've learned so, so much about what happened that day. We know that the gunman -- it looks like -- you know, according to the investigation, had been preparing for this event for about a week. We also know that there were failures in sort of anticipating -- sort of imagining the vulnerabilities at the -- of the former president at that outdoor rally. They failed to secure a rooftop of a building that is just outside the security perimeter, so she's going to be facing questions about that. About the number of assets. About where they posted people, including local law enforcement. We also know that the Trump team was not informed ahead of time that they were searching for someone who local police had spotted -- someone with a range finder. And they were looking for him for about 19 minutes. And the former president was still allowed to get on that stage while law enforcement was scrambling to try to find who -- what this -- what became -- obviously, the would-be assassin -- the attempted assassin. So those are the questions you expect that the Secret Service is going to be facing for the next four -- sorry, six hours or so --",

To unify as a party. To go into the Democratic Convention unified.There are some voices who have yet to come out supporting Kamala Harris -- name among them, obviously, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate. But as our colleague Dana Bash was reporting yesterday, part of that is because they want to give their membership and voters time to understand and to coalesce around Harris on their own. They don't want to be seen as forcing her as the heir apparent -- instead, arguing that she should be earning it, in part, because they want voters to feel very good about it going into November, and they want their members to feel really good about it.

That's not me. But this is Democratic strategist -- and there's Natasha. And here's Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky. We're getting it straight. It's been an exciting morning, a chaotic morning -- all the things. You know, John just alluded to this. For a few weeks now, Democrats have been wah-wah. And suddenly, you're seeing -- there was consternation, but excitement around all of this. You can feel it. So I do want to get to the issue of delegates and how this works. I will talk to you first, Julie. How the heck do the delegates work when it comes to this? Because it's not guaranteed, right, that they are going to fall in line and stand behind Harris. JULIE ROGINSKY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, CO-FOUNDER, LIFT OUR VOICES: No, they're pledged to Joe Biden. But now that he's not in the race they could do whatever they want. But look, the reality is these are not just random people who just showed up to become delegates. They're typically party insiders. They're typically people who are connected to either their governor or their congressperson or their senator, or people who are just very actively involved in their state politics and their federal politics. And so, these are people who are going to -- they're not going to fall in line, but they understand the mission. They understand the assignment. They know what's at stake. And what's at stake right now is a unified party that has to be laser-focused -- and I mean laser- focused in this very short time -- in defeating Donald Trump.
