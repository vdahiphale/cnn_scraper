And also, Wolf, if you listen to that announcement, you heard Attorney General Garland, which it was notable in and of itself that he was announcing this, but you also heard him use the word obstruction twice. That is something that stood out to me. I know that is also something that stood to those around the former president as well as they were listening to that. And so when it comes to the other aspect of this, which is what Manu was just talking about there, with the Republicans and their calls for similar investigations into Hunter Biden and the Biden family, this also comes in a week where you saw a lot of Republicans break with Trump. Not all of them, of course. Certainly, some of them endorsed him after he ran or announced his candidacy on Tuesday night.

Now, this is going to a special counsel. Now, a lot of those same Republicans have distanced themselves from Donald Trump, as Kaitlan was saying. So what do they do?Well, here's what they do. They call for a special counsel for Hunter Biden. That's easy to do. You already have Republicans yesterday in the House saying we're going to investigate Hunter Biden, we want to bring him up here before the committee. So, they have to walk this kind of fine line, and they have to pick who they want to pick on. And so that's going to be Hunter Biden, they'll distance themselves from Donald Trump a little bit.

Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, former President Trump is already blasting this decision by the attorney general. Will the appointment, do you believe, of a special counsel do anything to bolster the integrity of these investigations and all the political attacks? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, first, let me just say this is not really a January 6th committee topic. We really don't have anything to do with it. But on the Judiciary Committee, and, you know, I think the attorney general made it clear that he did this appointment to remove any appearance of political involvement since the former president has now announced that he's running for president again. Now, this has been spun as a politicized action when, in fact, it's the exact opposite. I think what's troubling the ex-president is that it's now become clear -- I think it was clear before -- that he is very much the subject of inquiry when it comes to the Mar-a-Lago documents. But even more telling, obviously, you know, the subject of inquiry about January 6th. And we didn't know that for sure before the naming of this special counsel.

Kim Jong-un unveiling for the first to the world his daughter, holding his hand as they walked around a giant new missile that North Korea claims is capable of hitting pretty much anywhere in the world with the exception of some portions of South America, that certainly would include anywhere on the mainland U.S. and most U.S. territories.It is an extraordinary thing to see the scale of this thing. They are dwarfed by the transporter erector launcher that then fired up this missile. It traveled more than 3,700 miles up into space on what's known as a lofted trajectory, that means it goes that high but doesn't travel that long of a distance. But it's basically demonstrating that it can travel to almost any continent in the entire world. This is a major threat potentially. Of course, this is all theoretical because we don't know North Korea's ability to deliver a nuclear warhead with a missile like this. And that is raising speculation of what tests can be coming up next. They've had 34 missile events this year. They've launched more than 50 ballistic missiles so far this year, all of that in violation of U.N. Security Council resolution. Many believe that a seventh underground nuclear test could be coming at any moment. Vice President Kamala Harris is here in Bangkok for the APEC summit. She and the leaders of Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, and South Korea all issued a statement strongly condemning this launch. But silent on the issue, Wolf, Russia and China. U.N. security council permanent members with veto power that have prevented the council from giving Kim Jong-un any severe consequences for this unprecedented barrage of missile testing blitz this year that is likely to continue unabated because he has no desire at this stage to talk to the United States, Wolf.",
