The Pentagon has decided against that for now. Plus, an Arctic blast is moving into the northeast in the U.S. over the next 24 hours and will be the coldest in years to some locations. It's being called a generational event. We'll have more on these stories in the hours ahead for you. Prosecutors say that up to 20 more hours of video related to the police beating of Tyre Nichols is yet to be released. Nichols tied last month after being brutally beaten by five officers in Memphis, Tennessee. The confrontation was caught on footage that has already been released. Prosecutors also say that more charges are possible because the officers may have filed a false report about what happened during the incident. Some of the released video was captured on the so-called SkyCop cameras which are part of the city's crime surveillance network. Ryan Young explains how they work. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
