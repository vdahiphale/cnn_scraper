They have not been able to agree on immigration policy in decades. How could they get an agreement on that, get Ukraine aid, and then Israel aid at this critical time? SOTOMAYOR: Exactly. I mean, when Senate Republicans are starting to talk about border security, everyone took that as, OK, well, the Ukraine funding may never happen, because they've never been able to agree bipartisan on any kind of border security reforms. And listen, if Johnson's able to get this through the House and the Senate accepts it, that is a win. Sure. The Freedom Caucus is kind of looking at this as a first strike possibly for Johnson. But he is going to face the same questions, the same fundamental decision. And at the end of the day, whether it's on Israel, whether it's on possibly Ukraine funding, on these future government funding deadlines, how to do all of that, not to mention funding the government next year, for a full year. He has to decide. It will always come down to him, do I irritate my Republican Conference, or do I do the right thing, do the bipartisan thing that still costs McCarthy his job?",

And listen, when you talk to the White House, when you talk to the Biden campaign, they say, there's a lot of focus right now on Biden because he is president. And we do see that.The moment that Trump and we start to talk about him a little bit more, that's at least what they're saying. People will start to make that difference. And also, back to the 2020 campaign, obviously it was very different. Biden did not have a record as president. But he did have legitimate Democratic candidates that he was running against. And it very similar to what you're hearing now. They were saying at the time, I love Elizabeth Warren. I love Pete Buttigieg. But who can beat Trump? And there's still this feeling among Democratic voters that don't love Biden. We have questions about his age, but we still think that he can beat Trump.",
