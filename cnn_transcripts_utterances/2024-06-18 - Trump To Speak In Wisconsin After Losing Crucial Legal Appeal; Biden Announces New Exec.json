Witnesses and the jury that convicted him in his criminal hush money trial or the daughter of the judge who works for Democrats because today, New York's highest court in the land has -- or the highest court in the Empire State rather, has declined to hear his appeal on the gag order Judge Merchan imposed on him in that in case. Trump's legal team is today vowing to fight the gag order, saying it's unconstitutional because it violates Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights of free speech. Trump's appearance today just South of Milwaukee comes a few days after he reportedly behind closed doors, called that city horrible because of its crime.

Interestingly enough, though, when -- before he speak, they keep showing a video on the boards behind me of Trump addressing the issue of voting. And he has said things like he will institute paper ballots when he is elected, that he wants to same day voting, that he will force voter ID, but until then he said, quote, Republicans must win and we must use every appropriate tool available. There have been Republicans who have been concerned about the fact that Donald Trump has been railing against early voting, voting by mail. Those are two popular methods of voting here in Wisconsin. It's something that deals to state the higher senior population. Many of those people take advantage of early voting and voting by mail. You have people like Ron Johnson, senator here, has been telling people to bank their voting, contrasting that against Donald Trump who continues to spread lies about the 2020 election and rally against voting early and voting by mail, a different message today from Donald Trump showing just how important this date is going to be in the upcoming election. This is the second time in two months that he is in this part of the state. President Biden had two appearances this year as well.

As we speak, Jake, right here, I'm on Capitol Hill, there are 1,800 well-paid lobbyists right now running all over Washington to make sure that we do not lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country. Many of these -- many of these drug companies give their CEOs tens of millions of dollars a year in compensation. They do stock buybacks, et cetera. They're enormously profitable. So the question that you're asking is how do we develop a system which allows us, allows the system to fund the important research and development that we need. So that we come up with groundbreaking drugs to deal with important diseases that are out there. This system that we have right now, which is ripping off the American people, just is not working. And a simple question that the pharmaceutical industry has got to ask ourselves, they make money selling Ozempic in Germany for 59 bucks. How much money are they making in here in the United States telling us that product for almost $1,000? That's the question that has to be answered.",

Sanjay, you were on our show around these daily COVID briefings every day, and so many the viral moments were on camera.
