I'm Manu Raju.President Joe Biden and his team spent the weekend in a full blown effort to contain the damage to his candidacy from Thursday's CNN debate, a performance many in his own party called disastrous as they fear it could lead to a Donald Trump victory in November. But despite the growing calls for the 81-year-old incumbent to drop out of the race, to give the party some time to find a new candidate ahead of the Democratic convention in august, Biden and his team signaled he was not going anywhere, as they aggressively tried to tamp down the push for a replacement. This morning, the president is with his family at Camp David, and yesterday, he told big donors in New Jersey, quote: It wasn't my best debate. I understand the concern. I get it, but I'm going to be fighting harder. And in the Hamptons, he also said at a fundraiser, quote: Voters had a different reaction to the debate and, quote, I didn't have a great debate, great night. But neither did Trump. Now, Democrats are assessing the fallout, even as the drumbeat for Biden to drop out is getting louder, including from editorial boards of \"The New York Times\", \"The Atlanta Journal Constitution\", \"Chicago Tribune\", and big name commentators like Maureen Dowd, Tom Friedman and David Remnick. But so far, publicly elected Democrats are still standing by him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAJU:  He's the best candidate for you guys? REP. ANDRE CARSON (D-IN):  I think so, I think so.",

This is an email that went out to supporters last night. Rob Flaherty, the Biden deputy campaign manager, said: Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee, period. End of story.

I mean, I think if, if, if he were to voluntarily step aside, my guess is that he would say Vice President Harris should be the nominee, then the question is, do others go after that? Do others try to take her down? They're right in the in the sense that this would be a very messy situation. And I think that the other reality is that all of the people who we've talked about as potentials, and mostly it's some prominent governors, Governor Newsom or Governor Whitmer or Governor Pritzker or Shapiro, these are not people who are well known nationally. They've not been vetted nationally. They're not prepared to suddenly run a big presidential campaign. So there would be enormous risks beyond the whole obstacles of the process. There would be enormous risks of swapping him out.

They shared some Democratic polling data showing that people, even the vice president of the United States, they contend, would not do better than Joe Biden. Is that a -- is that the reality of the situation? MICHEL MARTIN, NPR \"MORNING EDITION\" HOST:  You know, one of the things that's really struck me about this campaign all along is how there are really two campaigns, or there should be. I mean, there's the campaign of people who pay attention and there's the campaign of directed at the people who don't, you know, we're all aware of the people who pay close attention. I mean, we know that the polling shows there is an enthusiasm gap that Trump supporters are really behind him. And Biden supporters are sort of behind him. But what's really shocking to me, when you sort of go out on the trail and you talk to people, is how many people don't really see a difference. They really don't. They say things like, well, I mean, I'm talking to say, a Muslim person who I know very well who said, oh, it's a difference between a person who wants to kill us and a person who will let us die -- and speaking about Gaza. With African Americans, they're like, what's the difference? He didn't really fight for us on certain key issues.

But behind closed doors, there was an interesting tweet from, one, a former Trump aide, Anthony Scaramucci, who was talking to who was at this long island fundraiser. He said, President Biden needs to appear unscripted settings and handle fair but tough questioning. Further demonstrations of his ability to read from a teleprompter will not assuage my concerns. Now, Scaramucci supports Biden now. He was at that fundraiser. He heard Biden. Biden is trying to show that, you know, he this is a problem in the debate. I get it, but I can do this. I can handle it. But what Scaramucci is saying here is that you got to do it in an unscripted setting, and we have not seen that from the president yet.",

He gave a long speech, then some back and forth.It was not unscripted. I mean, it was scripted, but he's had a few scripted moments. But the reality is, the Biden we saw Thursday night is largely closer to the Biden we see every day at the White House. So that is the challenge that they have. And something else, and this is, again, all this criticism is coming from people who generally like President Biden from the inside. But someone told me when they made the decision to run in November 2022, in Nantucket that weekend, the Bidens got together. After the midterm, he's diminished considerably since then, or he's aged since then and perhaps even since the State of the Union. So that is the big unknown here. And the risk, I mean, they're --",

Like it was sort of a Biden argument. I'm who you need to beat the Republican. Didn't win. An African- American woman won. Now she's 11 points up over the Republican, who was a very popular Republican governor, very independent Larry Hogan. He's a person who even Donald Trump endorsed him. He said, I don't want it.
