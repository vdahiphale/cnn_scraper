Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES RUBIN, SPECIAL ENVOY &amp; COORDINATOR, GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER: This is the dark side of globalization. If we don't change course, steady, often imperceptible changes will occur that poison the information space that is crucial for our societies to function.

It then relays that information wirelessly to another implant in the body, so bypassing the damaged spine. AI, in that implant, triggers the right muscles to actually make those movements. They call this thought-driven movement. Dr. Jocelyne Bloch performed the surgery. DR. JOCELYNE BLOCH, NEUROSURGEON, LAUSANNE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL: We removed a little bit of bone.
