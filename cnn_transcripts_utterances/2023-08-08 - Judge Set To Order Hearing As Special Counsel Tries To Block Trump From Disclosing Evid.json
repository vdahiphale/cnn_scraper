That indictment, of course, covered the investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election.It's the first time that this panel has met since last week when the former president was officially charged with allegedly plotting to undermine the election. Well, now there's a legal dispute on that case over evidence sharing. The two sides have about 40 minutes left to let Judge Tanya Chutkan know when they can present their sides to her. Special Counsel Jack Smith is trying to block Trump from disclosing evidence publicly before trial. He's accusing Trump and his team of wanting to try the case in the media instead of the courtroom. But Trump's lawyers say Smith is trying to restrict his free speech. Let's turn now to CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid. Paula, first, what do you know about the grand jury meeting today? Their work continues.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEOFF DUNCAN, (R), FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I'm going to certainly keep the details to myself just to protect the integrity of the investigation. But there is a very clear subpoena that was delivered to us late last week and we will certainly answer the questions that they've got before us and answer their call to show up for the grand jury.

Amending Ohio's constitution is. And today's measure would change the simple majority that Ohio requires to change its constitution to a higher threshold. If issue one passes today, a 60 percent super majority would be necessary. That's where abortion rights in Ohio come in. Because a measure to protect abortion rights is on the ballot there in November. A 60 percent super majority requirement would make it more difficult to pass that measure protecting abortion rights. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Columbus. So tell us about this race here. The effort to raise the threshold to 60 percent is by folks who don't want a measure passed to protect abortion rights.",

And this was an effort put forward by Republican legislative leaders to schedule a special election today, August 8th.Really effectively at the end of summer as families are on vacation, getting ready to go back to school, which critics say they were trying to slip through, trying to have a low turnout election. But so far, at least for a special election, even going into Election Day today before the polls opened, nearly 700,000 people across the state voted. And there has been a steady stream of voting here at this polling place in Columbus, but as well as at other polling places we're told across the state. So we will see what the exact turnout is. But what today is about is writing the rules essentially for that November question. Ohio becomes the latest state to put abortion rights on the ballot and deciding whether to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution. Right now, the state has an abortion ban after six weeks.",

And I think it's too great of a risk until we have better monitoring, better understanding of the water table to even put that at jeopardy. So, I understand people's desire for uranium there. But until we have better knowledge, which we don't, and scientists have been working on this, hydrologists would be working on this a long time. And we've ignored the native voice that's not only been crying out for the protection of fresh water but also there are a lot of sacred sites included in this monument, up to 3,000.
