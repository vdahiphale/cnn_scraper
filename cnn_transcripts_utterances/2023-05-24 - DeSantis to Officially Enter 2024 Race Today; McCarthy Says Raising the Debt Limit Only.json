We're told he'll make it official tonight during this live discussion with Elon Musk on Twitter. The governor's wife teased the announcement with a video of him getting ready to go out on the stage. For a while now, DeSantis has been widely seen as Donald Trump's most formidable challenger, but his standing has been slipping in the polls and among some concerned donor. Trump, meantime, has been rallying his base against DeSantis and outright mocking him on social media.

And you know, most candidates often announce their presidential ambitions in their hometown or some other place of political significance. But Twitter under Elon Musk's stewardship has become this dividingline between liberals and conservatives. And DeSantis, if anything, loves to seize on these cultural clashes and make them his own. So that is certainly part of the motivation here. As you mentioned, it's also a place that once launched Trump's political aspirations. But he notably is no longer on the website. And DeSantis has taken to sort of trolling the former president of late. But it's also a move that is not typical of candidates. And that is something DeSantis' people tell me he is very interested in doing over and over again in this political race. He doesn't want to run a conventional campaign. He intends to operate in these sort of moments that can generate a buzz like that is right now, get a stir. And get people talking about him in ways that they don't necessarily always talk about political campaigns. He has an uphill climb against -- against Donald Trump.

And it really speaks to the frustration that we've seen bubbling up over the course of the past few days, starting with President Biden's comments while he was in Japan on Sunday, when he said that, in order to -- for there to be bipartisan compromise, there needs to be movement from Republicans, as well. One thing that Democrats have been expressing some frustration with is that they feel they have presented some options, one those being freezing spending at current year's levels, as a means of compromise with Republicans. But comments like that from McCarthy, saying that the only concession they're making is raising the debt limit, is something that has rankled some at the White House. Now this is all coming, as we say, each morning, the clock continues to tick down to that potential June 1 deadline when the U.S. could face economic catastrophe.

It's like getting hit with a tornado for several hours at a time, as this hurricane eye wall scrapes the Northern portions of Guam, not making a direct landfall but certainly close. But of course, this is a game of miles, because that makes all the world of difference in terms of how much storm surge impacts the island. A hundred and forty miles per hour, so no longer a super typhoon. Equivalent, though, to a strong Atlantic hurricane here. You can see the current wind gusts. That's 105 miles per hour near where that video was shot. The threats here, of course, the flash flooding. We're going to experience 15 inches of rain over the next 24 hours or so. And now that the storm is moving just North of the island, we're starting to get battered with the storm surge on the Western kind of vulnerable facing coastline area. So that is where some of the largest population density of this U.S. territory is located. There is the forecast accumulation.
