Thanks for joining us on this Christmas Eve.A winter wallop leaving millions of Americans out in the cold this holiday weekend, some enduring their coldest Christmas in decades. Right now more than 100 million people are under windchill alerts. The arctic blast is extending from Montana all the way down to Florida. Some areas in the Midwest are dipping into the negative 30s. Yes -- I said negative 30s. New York state police are warning people to stay off the roads amid white out conditions. They say search and rescue is moving extremely slowly due to the blizzard. The bitter cold proving really dangerous. At least 15 people have lost their lives across the country so far. In Ohio, icy roads are being blamed for a 50-car pileup. You are looking at it there -- devastating. In North Carolina and Tennessee, places that aren't used to this kind of cold, power companies are running short, rolling blackouts to keep up with unusually high energy demand. More than 1.6 million customers are now without power nationwide due to this weather. And the icy cold is adding to the frustrations for travelers, as you might imagine. This is a busy holiday weekend. More than 1,800 flights have already been canceled and that's just today alone. That's more -- that's on top of the more than 5,900 canceled just yesterday. CNN's Polo Sandoval is out there again, struggling and suffering through this absolutely insanely cold weather in Buffalo, New York where things still look pretty darn bad, Polo.",

But for now, the key is for people to shelter in place. And we need to be clear with our viewers. That's exactly what we aredoing as a team. We are actually sheltering in our hotel. We'll pop out every hour to be able to show you the conditions that authorities are hoping people avoid. And that's the only reason why I am able to stand on the street here in downtown Buffalo is because we have not seen much traffic on this particular street. However, we heard from county officials earlier this morning clearly frustrated saying that it seems that people are still violating the driving and the travel ban that's in place here in the Buffalo area, throughout Erie County, basically prohibiting any kind of nonessential, non-emergency travel. The reason being is that about two-thirds, as of last check, of emergency vehicles here in Erie County are still stuck. They're still stuck in the snow and because of that there are little to no emergency services in cities like Buffalo and surrounding townships as well because they cannot promise that if somebody suffers a medical condition in their home that they will be able to get to them. And so what they are in the process of doing right now is taking advantage of the fact that a snow band seems to have shifted slightly north. So this is actually a slight improvement. They are able to clear out some of the streets and highways. But that one lane they want to dedicate that to emergency vehicles, not to people who want to make it out to their grandmother's house for Christmas, Sara.",

There was one flight out to California that was also canceled. The numbers across the country, they are not a whole lot better. We are nearing the 2,000 mark when it comes to the number of flights across the U.S. Canceled. Well over 2,000 flights have been delayed.

They just aren't able to maintain body temperatures the way other people can. Also cold weather puts stress on the heart, so people with heart disease are also vulnerable right now. Also cold weather aggravates asthma and other lung diseases. So even if you have asthma and you have it under control, remember the cold can make it worse. Make sure your medication is close at hand. So here are a couple of tips on what you can do. First of all, dress infants warmly, dress them more warmly, for example, than you would dress yourself. Check in on the elderly. If you know an elderly couple, check in on them. Make sure their heat is working. Make sure they are doing ok. Also, I know this is disappointing, but avoid alcohol and caffeine. Alcohol and caffeine, those drinks might be nice and warm and toasty, but they can also inhibit your body's ability to deal with the cold. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And in fact, as that cold air retreats, not only do temperatures warm- up, they actually get above average for so many people by the time we get to Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. However, they are not there yet in some spots, which means any of the snow that fell is likely going to stick around for a white Christmas for many folks.

But all of them telling me that it's been difficult, that they are praying and that they really see themselves staying here. That's really their hope and their dream and that's what they are hoping will happen over the next couple of days. They're hoping to go find either family members or somewhere they can stay.

Under Title 42, they can still be immediately expelled on the grounds of COVID prevention. Lucy and Yulexi determined to enter legally. She wants to do it the right way, she tells me, and knows exactly where she wants to go. Far from their Big Apple dreams, unable to return home, stuck in international purgatory. \"I am here with my partner,\" she says, discriminated against, they say, because they're migrants, they're women and they are a couple. To be safe, they avoid public displays of affection and travel in groups. Another reason they want to get to the other side, when we're there, we're going to help all of our families, she says. The very mention of family triggers emotions Lucy has carried since leaving Venezuela. Lucy, missing her mom and siblings; Yulexi, her ten-year-old daughter. We hurry across traffic about a half mile from where we first met the couple and arrived at this local shelter. With nowhere else to go, families line up, hoping to escape the freezing cold. Lucy and Yulexi among the fortunate. This is home, at least for now. We meet some of their new friends, fellow migrants from all backgrounds. And how many people altogether are usually in here at night? ELIAS RODRIGUEZ, DIRECTOR, HOPE CENTER SHELDTER: Altogether, 135 has been our greatest number. . We don't have the capacity for the demand.",

And much like border cities in the U.S., Ciudad Juarez is feeling the strain from this migration surge.\"The city has always been very generous to migrants, but in this case, with so many people, it's difficult. The city is not prepared for this influx,\" he says. Back in the shelter, Yulexi struggles with having left her daughter behind, telling me, \"I don't know when I can give her my love again because right now, I'm just trying to provide for her.\" Lucy saying the hardest part in this moment right now is being so close and not being able to cross. But echoing from their phone, a familiar song that chronicles a migrant's journey brings back smiles and hope. \"We're going to make it, we're going to make it,\" she says. And it's precisely because of Title 42 that Yulexi and Lucy want to avoid doing what the migrants you see behind me are doing. Thousands of them, turning themselves in to U.S. Customs Border Patrol, so as to seek asylum, officially. But the problem that they would face under Title 42 is that as soon as they enter, they risk being deported to places much farther, and much more dangerous.

Thank you so much for joining me at a time when I am sure it was a bit difficult to get to work because of the cold. DR. SAJU MATHEW: It's cold here in Atlanta, 9 degrees, sara.

The problem is we are seeing a rise in these infections. Now Group A strep is an infection that causes strep throat. I don't about you Sara, but I have had strep throat a couple of times. It's very painful. But the good news is you have antibiotics that can actually treat that infection. However, if you get a respiratory infection like the flu or skin infection, the same bacteria can seep into your bloodstream. It can even cause a really bad infection called necrotizing fasciitis, which is a skin infection. It is very rare though. I don't want to alarm parents but we are seeing a rise in these infections.",

We realized we would have to live with COVID being around similar to living with any other disease or the flu. But it has such a different effect on so many different people's bodies.I do want to talk to you about something that you alluded to -- and that's a shortage of medications. There are common medications for children and adults that treat things like the flu and RSV. What is happening out there with the availability of the medicines that we all need regularly? DR. MATHEW: Exactly. I think what happens is people panic. You know, we are seeing a rise in the flu cases and RSV four to six weeks earlier because of the reasons that I mentioned before. So what people are doing is they're stockpiling. It's not necessarily that the manufactures aren't making enough. The problem is people are also hoarding these medicines. So I tell parents when I see kids, don't stockpile Tylenol and Motrin. Just make sure that you get enough for what you need. And not every fever needs to be treated. Generally speaking, unless the fever is 102, you don't really have to treat a child every single time for a low-grade fever. And remember, fever is our natural body's response to fighting an infection.",

MATHEW: Well, the problem is you know, even suppositories or the chewable forms, Sara, even those are becoming scarce. You know, you can't really get them on the shelves or order them online. But this is what you can do. I mean there are so many other ways to control a fever. It's to make sure that the child is kept in a cooler space, maybe like an ice towel around the baby's body or throat. So there are other ways. And again, like I said, if your child is active, feeding ok, you don't necessarily have to treat every infection. But if you have any questions, if you are worried about this infection, always make sure you seek care. Urgent cares are also open during the holiday weekend.",

MATHEW: You know, I wouldn't pay too much attention to when cases plateau for the reasons that mentioned. Once a lot of people get together, it's usually the aftermath, that's when we actually see a surge in cases. I mean where I live right here in Atlanta, flu cases are still going up in certain counties. I think ultimately, Sara, the bottom line is layering. I am not trying to convince everyone out there to get vaccinated, but remember we have layers this year that we didn't have last year. Vaccines, wearing a mask and I am also telling people traveling on planes, the most dangerous times is when you are boarding and right before you get off the aircraft. That's when the HEPA air filtration systems are not working as well.
