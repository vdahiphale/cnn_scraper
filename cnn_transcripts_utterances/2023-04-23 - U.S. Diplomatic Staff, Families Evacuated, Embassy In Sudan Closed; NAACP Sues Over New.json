They have been not quite necessarily allies but certainly rivaled colleagues in knocking over the dictatorship of Omar al-Bashir a few years ago, and then again of a civilian administration, and had been in negotiations with one another for the different roles that the two military forces would have in an amalgamated Sudanese armed forces in the future. And they appear to have fallen out over the roles, particularly for officers within the Rapid Support Forces and who would ultimately would lead to Sudan's entire national forces following this amalgamation.

That includes all U.S. government personnel on the ground -- the diplomats, their family members and some diplomats from other countries as well. And this was a clean and fast operation, that's according to a senior Department of Defense official.You had about 100 Special Forces that flew into Sudan. They were on the ground for less than an hour to load all of these U.S. government personnel onto aircraft and get them out of the country, with the secretary of state saying that the conditions on the ground simply pose an unacceptable risk to those U.S. government personnel. Of course, as we have seen this ongoing heavy fighting, which made it hard for them to do anything in the country -- of course, the streets wrecked with violence, and it also made it hard to get any resources into the country that that embassy needed. Now, as you guys were discussing, the embassy is now closed down. According to the secretary of state, it is temporarily suspended. Of course, they hope to reopen that embassy when this fighting stops. We really don't know when that will be and there locally employed staff, Sudanese folks who work with us government officials at that embassy and they are essentially watching over it and caretaker status for now. So we'll continue to watch where that space goes. But when it comes to the U.S. embassy, it's no longer actually operating in all those diplomats now out of the country.",

I mean, look, it's it was a success, right? Because U.S. officials say special operation forces, they spent less than an hour on the ground to execute this evacuation of about 100 people, U.S. personnel and their families. Can you talk to us about what goes into executing such an operation and perhaps how difficult it was to pull it off? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Amara. Yeah. What this really tells you is the State Department and the Department of Defense are talking with each other. So, it starts with good news, right? It wouldn't have been as quick as it took about an hour for the actual evacuation on the ground, but the preparation in advance of that is quite considerable, which means the state department is getting all -- is getting all the resources that they can together. They're getting the personnel. They're marshaling those folks at a very specific location, maybe a couple of locations, and then DOD is aware of all of that, and then they execute from Djibouti. And with the as Sam Kiley described -- as he understood the operation -- there clearly based on the kit that they used, helicopters as well as probably some C130s, there probably was some refueling that needed to take place based on the legs, the distance from Djibouti to Khartoum. But this was incredibly well-planned, a priority. That's what happens with every embassy. There are these noncombatant evacuation operations. In this particular case, I suggest this was permissive, which means the government at least stood aside. The Khartoum government as disruptive as it was so the U.S. could get in and get out very quickly.",

We were able to get in and make sure and it ended up being permissive, which is great, but you're looking at a lot of nations that don't enjoy that level of competency, and so there will be great competition for runway access and capabilities.

Supporters of these new laws, including the Republican governor, Tate Reeves, they point to the crime rate in Jackson were in the past decade, the homicides per year have doubled, peaking in 2021, the homicide rate per year in Jackson is 12 times the national average, making Jackson one of the deadliest cities in the U.S.Now these pairs of new laws are creating a divide. Some hope that it will save the capital city after that spike in crime. Others though, are seeing echoes of a racist past. Let me break down these laws for you. It will allow the state of Mississippi to expand reach of state controlled law enforcement to the entire city of Jackson. Now, this is a force that has primarily protected capital, the capital and surrounding area that has not been engaged in city law enforcement. This force answers not to local officials, but to state appointed leadership. There's also major changes coming to the judicial system. It will establish a new court within the boundaries of a new capital complex improvement district. So, this is going to be a judge appointed by the Republican state chief justice. Prosecuting attorneys will be appointed by the Republican state attorney general. A focal point of this debate as you guys mentioned their husband representation, the legislators who introduces these bills, they represent districts outside of Jackson. The state legislature is majority Republican majority white, but the city of Jackson is majority Democratic and over 80 percent Black. Here is a statement from the NAACP, which is suing the city of the state of Mississippi. Here's what they said: If elected officials in Mississippi want to help address the results of their negligence and improve the lives of Jackson residents, they should start with completing improvements to Jackson's water system, not undermining the constitutional rights of their citizens. Governor Tate Reeves spoke at a press conference Wednesday before signing these bills into law. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TATE REEVES (R), MISSISSIPPI: Jackson has so much potential. I've lived in Jackson for almost a third of my life. And I want what's best for Jackson. But for us to continue to see young kids getting killed in the streets, for us to continue to see property crimes that are happening here that are causing businesses to leave, we've got to make sure that we have law and order.

Disney attempted to undermine the takeover of a special district that allows it to self govern its Orlando theme parks. DeSantis allies on a new state board set up to oversee Disney's properties are now looking for payback, threatening to hike taxes, raise utility rates even develop land around the parks.But the governor's renewed fight against Disney is drawing some criticism from fellow Republicans. Some say he's gone too far. Others say he's been outsmarted. Let's discuss now with former Republican state representative Juan- Carlos Planas of Florida. He is also an adjunct professor of law at St. Thomas University. Good to see you again. Let's start here with some of the suggestions that the governor kind of mulled over publicly on what to do with the land around Disney. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): People have said, you know, maybe have another -- maybe create a state park. Maybe try to do more amusement parks. Someone even said, like, maybe you need another state prison. Who knows? I mean, I just think that the possibilities are endless. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think DeSantis is making a fool of himself, and he just keeps digging himself deeper the whole week.

Does this matter? You think. PLANAS: Absolutely I think it shows that a lot of Republicans don't -- I mean Ron DeSantis is known for not having any friendships. But his campaign keeps taking missteps, even those that are outside his campaign. He had a super PAC that is doing things for him now and promoting him, and they released an ad. And the title of the ad is \"steel is not forged overnight\". Well for anyone who's ever looked at the steelmaking process, and you can Google this steel is forged in a couple of hours.

Is it -- is it focused on only the primary element or how this might look in in a general? What do you think? PLANAS: It's not. It's basically trying to do everything possible to win a primary by ignoring what it takes to win the general election. I think Republicans have actually given up at this point trying to win the popular vote. They're trying to do electoral college math to see what they can do in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and try to get that way. But I think the six week abortion ban is even going to bite them in Florida. If I'm one of these legislators that voted for the six week abortion ban, I'm nervous about my reelection because this is something that once the public looks at what the total ramifications are, they're not going to like it. A lot of folks -- a lot of women don't know they are pregnant at the six week mark. A lot of doctors do not feel comfortable with this. In fact, we're seeing states with abortion ban now have less applicants for licensing to be OBGYNs in their state.
