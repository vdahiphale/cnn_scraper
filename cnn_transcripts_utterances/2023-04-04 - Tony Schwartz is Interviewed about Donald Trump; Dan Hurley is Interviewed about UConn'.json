And I asked (INAUDIBLE), you know, has Tacopina been sidelined? He said - he said, Joe's a great lawyer. He's got a trial coming up in two weeks, and he needs to focus on that.And he is representing former President Trump in this battery and defamation trial brought by the former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll. That has been winding through the courts for years. And it's now actually coming to a head. That will be a civil trial just down the street in about two weeks' time. So, he says that that is really the focus of Tacopina. He was brought in to represent Trump in that case just in the past several months. So, that is now also coming to a head.

There is what is good for Trump from a legal perspective, and then there's what's good for Trump from a political perspective. I think that the attorneys are trying to control what they can control inside of the courtroom.What happens outside of the courtroom is less under their purview, and that's going to be how this is going to play out. You're going to have attorneys saying on the one hand that they - that they have confidence in the legal process. They have confidence in the judge. And then Trump, going on his social media platform, and attacking that very same judge, that dichotomy is going to play out. The question is, will what Trump does outside of the courtroom start to affect what happens inside? And I do think that there is a concern here that the judge might be deliberating on, which is, is Trump going to try to taint his own case, and that's when I think you'll see the judge potentially stepping in here.",

People are -- there is no one on this planet unfamiliar with Donald Trump. It's going to be really challenging to find an impartial jury in this jurisdiction. But that's going to be the task here. And they're going to have to find a way to prevent the defendant in this case from making that job even more difficult.You know, talking to lawyers over the weekend, they were talking about whether there would be a gag in this case. I think that's definitely something that could very well be on the table.",

The spectacle with the airplane and what have you. The attention. This president loves the attention. And as you have been reporting, now he wants to speak in the hallway before and after.So, we're going to see what kind of spectacle it will be. I know all eyes will be on it and you guys will be down there covering it -- or you will be down there covering it.",

We had actually planned to go in just to be able to at least watch him going into the room. I will be in there.But also what's important to note is that new attorney that they just added yesterday to the defense team, Todd Blanche, is also going to be appearing in the courtroom today. That's notable because the other thing that Kara Scannell learned earlier from Chris Kise is that they do expect Joe Tacopina to instead start shifting his focus to another case. He had initially believed he was going to be the lead defense attorney in that room today. It doesn't appear that is going to be the case. We'll see how it plays out, though, Don and Poppy.",
