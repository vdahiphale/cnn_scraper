U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is warning Congress the U.S. could reach its debt limit as soon as June 1. [04Yellen's letter warned that if Congress doesn't act, it could harm American families and the global economy. And more than 11,000 Hollywood writers are going on strike for the first time since 2007. The strike was announced after the Writers Guild and studios failed to reach an agreement hours before a midnight deadline. Now there is a looming crisis at America's southern border where thousands of migrants are gathering across at least four northern cities in Mexico. Officials and advocates say more than 36,000 migrants are now sleeping in shelters and on the streets. They are waiting for May 11 when the pandemic era restrictions known as Title 42 expire in the U.S. and even more migrants are expected to make their way to border cities. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following the developments from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, in just over a week, Title 42 that pandemic era border restriction that allowed U.S. border officials to rapidly expel migrants crossing into the United States, it's set to expire. And U.S. officials as well as local officials along the U.S./Mexico border, they are already bracing for what is expected to be a surge in migrants following the expiration of that authority.And already you are seeing some cities along that U.S./Mexico border beginning to prepare for that surge. The city of El Paso, Texas as well as the city of Brownsville, Texas both of them issuing states of emergency. In El Paso, that will allow them to set up temporary shelters to deal with the expected influx of migrants. And that's because we know that there are already thousands of migrants in northern Mexico that are waiting for Title 42 to expire in order to cross into or attempt to cross into the United States. 9,000 believed to be in Tijuana, 10,000 to 12,000 in the city of Juarez, Reynosa 16,000 and 1,500 in Matamoros. A DHS official told CNN that several border detention facilities along the US-Mexico border are already overcapacity. And in recent weeks we have seen 7,000 daily encounters of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. And again, all of that with the expectation that those numbers are going to go up once Title 42 expires. Now, U.S. officials here in Washington, they have been preparing for months for the expiration of that pandemic era policy. They are preparing a new asylum rule that they are expected to roll out in the coming week or so that would bar migrants who travel through other countries from applying for asylum in the United States. They are also looking at expediting the asylum screening program and adding resources to the border. But those additional resources including some that the Department of Homeland Security reprogrammed for other programs to dedicate it to the border. The Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas says even that won't be enough. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: While the department is frugally utilizing the limited funding Congress has provided to prepare for the post Title 42 environment, this notification of repurposing existing funds is only a fraction of what we will ultimately need. But we can't do everything that we need to do until Congress provides the needed resources and reforms. We call on Congress to provide the resources we need to continue our work.",

A decades old system that officials say makes the problems at the border that much worse.But what you're also hearing is an acknowledgment that those first few weeks following the expiration of Title 42 could potentially seriously strain the U.S. immigration system.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Max. Well, that's going to be the big question here. And it's actually the German foreign minister who's speaking right now. You can see behind me -- I'm going to get out of your way for just a second here. That Annalena Baerbock is currently giving her speech. And we were actually able to speak to the German foreign minister a little bit before she went on stage here as she is speaking right now.And she did say that the Germans do have a pretty ambitious agenda. Because obviously, say that essentially the Petersburg climate dialogue is what is going to set the stage for the main COP 28 meeting, which of course is going to happen later this year in the United Arab Emirates. And she said that there's really several things that are on the agenda. On the one hand, it's for the rich nations of the world to put up a lot of money for the poor nations of the world to be able to deal with climate change and be able to finance dealing with climate change. Then of course also, investing in renewable energy for poorer countries as well. One of the interesting things that Annalena Baerbock said before she went on stage here, and before she went inside the venue, she said she believes that one of the things that need to happen at the main COP 28 meeting later this year, is for there to be a real target for the amount of renewable energy that the world wants to produce. She says that something that she believes is key to just combating and to stop climate change. Of course, the big target that the nations have, that many nations around the world, is to limit the amount of global warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade. She says right now she believes most countries are failing. In fact, most people would say that most countries are feeling to cut carbon emissions and to also try and not have the climate change happen that quickly. So, clearly a very ambitious agenda that's on the agenda here. And certainly, you see that the Germans are trying to push this forward as fast as possible -- Max.",

We don't know how reliable it might be. But still, it is a massive number considering since the start of the year. The U.S. says that killed or wounded on the Russian side is more than 100,000, 20,000 killed in the line of fire on the front lines. And the U.S. also says that nearly half of those were Wagner fighters whom we know have been doing a good chunk of the fighting in Bakhmut. That important town, symbolically important town that the Russians have put so much effort in trying to take, so far with no success -- or with limited success I should say.It is also interesting to note the huge gap -- it's almost comical the gap between this U.S. estimate and the number of casualties that the head of Wagner says that they have lost which is just 94. Something that John Kirby the national security official calls ludicrous. He also said that he won't be releasing any Ukrainian estimated casualties because the U.S. doesn't want to do anything, in his words, to make it harder for them.",

The governor there says that this was an IED placed on, what he says, was a civilian cargo train carrying building supplies, carrying oil products, things like that. But what's interesting is the location here. Bryansk region borders Belarus, it borders the northern part of Ukraine.And even just today the governor said that overnight there was Ukrainian shelling on the border. Over the weekend there was shelling, he says, that killed four civilians there. The Ukrainians also say that drone strikes on Kyiv have originated in Bryansk and the Ukrainians have also launched their own drone strikes into that region. Something that is extremely rare for them to admit. And of course, we've seen throughout the course of the war that there have been plenty of mysterious explosions on Russian soil. But in cases like this, I mean, the Ukrainians haven't said anything about it and it seems like both sides have their own reasons for downplaying it. The Ukrainians don't really want to provoke any kind of response. And of course, the Russians really don't want to acknowledge that there is war taking place on their own soil right now.",
