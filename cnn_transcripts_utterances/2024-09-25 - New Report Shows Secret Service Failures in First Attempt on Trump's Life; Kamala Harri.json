There was a discussion of putting up farm equipment or other barriers. Sometimes, you know, Trump is not a fan of things that look ugly on television, but there could have been something put there, and essentially nobody made a decision on what to do. There was no plan to really secure that building, the roof, where the shooter actually posted up.There were resources that were denied on that day, and you know again, part of this discussion that should have been made, given the threats. One of those threats, of course, was the threat by Iran to try to assassinate the former president. It turns out even some of the people who were key to defending the former president there that day, to protecting him that day, did not know the details of that, and so a lot of decisions that could have been made just were not.",

It's a high-intensity, high-stress workplace and a very serious threat environment. And just talking to our sources, we are talking to current and former agents.We are getting a picture of an agency really racked with low morale, high burnout, staffing and retention issues, poor management. Just to take you through some of those, on staffing, the agency, its former director said they need 9,500 employees. Right now they have about 8,100. And they are having a really hard time keeping the agents they do have. Really retention remains a really big problem. There's a lot of travel, long hours, little balance, and a lot of frustration with management. Another issue that consistently came up in my conversation was pay caps. There is a cap on overtime, and if you go over that cap, you are not getting paid. You are working without pay. And because of all of those issues together, and these staffing shortfalls, it's a high-stress environment. Agents are required to stay in these high-stress positions for longer. These roles -- and if you just think about what being on high alert like that does to your body, the physical stress of that, it is really contributing to a lot of burnout.",

Now, the question is, you know, there's a lot of details that we don't know about this, but they've taken the proactive step here. The Office of Professional Responsibility is investigating this, and you know, until that is cleared, the person who is responsible or is being investigated will be sort of on administrative leave.We got a statement from the spokesperson for the Vice President's office, and they say that there's a zero tolerance on sexual misconduct, and they take this obviously very, very seriously. But really, it adds to some of the picture that we've been seeing, a lot of hits coming to an agency that's beleaguered at this point, and, you know, you want to see it, see things turn around.

Inflation has dropped faster here than the rest of the developed world. Unemployment is near record low levels.

And part of being pragmatic means taking good ideas from wherever they come. Listen, you all know my career, Andrea shared it with you. I am a devout public servant.

And we must work with them to grow our economy. I believe an active partnership between government and the private sector is one of the most effective to fully unlock economic opportunity. (APPLAUSE) And that is what I will do when I am President. I will target the major barriers to opportunity and remove them. We will identify common sense solutions to help Americans buy a home, start a business, and build wealth. And we will adopt them. So let's start then with the first pillar of an opportunity economy, which is lowering costs. So I made that our top priority for obvious reasons, because if we want the middle class to be the growth engine of our economy, we need to restore basic economic security for middle-class families. To that end, the most practical thing we can do right now is to cut taxes for middle-class families and individuals. (APPLAUSE)",
