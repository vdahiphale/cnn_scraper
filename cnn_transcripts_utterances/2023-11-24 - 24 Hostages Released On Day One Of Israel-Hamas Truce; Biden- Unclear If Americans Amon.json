But the majority of those, who were taken, on October 7th, are not. They are still in Gaza, tonight. And that includes Americans that we do believe are among those hostages. President Biden spoke today, after the successful release, of this first group of hostages, and said he's hopeful that at least some U.S. citizens will be included, in the next group that's going to be released, which could be as soon as tomorrow. CNN's Alex Marquardt is tracking all of this, from Washington. Alex, we heard from President Biden.

And we understand that has happened, again tonight. So, the question, right now, and this is one that we've been putting to the White House, is whether they know, if any Americans are going to be released, in this second wave, tomorrow. Now, we have not gotten a response back, from the National Security Council, or from the White House. What we have heard from President Biden, earlier today, was that he is hoping, and he is expecting that the three Americans, who fall within this category of women and children, the two women, and young Abigail Edan, will come out, in the next three days. Of course, this is a planned four-day pause, if everything goes according to plan. The administration is encouraged by what they have seen today. It's a good first step that President Biden said earlier that it has gone well so far. But, of course, they are waiting, with bated breath, to see these three Americans get released by Hamas.

And that's the way that it was designed.I mean, the Biden administration officials have said, there are incentives that are built into this deal. And essentially, the more hostages that Hamas releases, the longer the pause there is, the easier it will be, for aid to get into Gaza, the more Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli prisons. Obviously, those are, that's a real priority for Hamas. It's, the onus really now is on Hamas, Kaitlan, to come up with more hostages. They were clear that they were able to identify these 50, in this initial group. And they're going to be using these days of pauses, to go out and try to identify more, find others, who may be spread around elsewhere, in the Gaza Strip, who may be with other groups, other factions, may be with gangs, so that they can release them. There really is an incentive, for Hamas, to release more of these hostages. I thought that question about whether he trusts Hamas was really interesting, because he said, \"Of course, I don't trust Hamas.\" He said Hamas doesn't give a damn about the Palestinian people. And he said the only thing that Hamas responds to his pressure, which is interesting, because that has been the Israeli argument. Israel was pressured, in the beginning of this war, to delay their effort, to delay their ground incursion, to give more time. But they thought that military pressure would get more hostages out. And so, here he is, making the Israeli argument, when in actual fact the deal that the U.S. actually helped in a major way, to broker, is really built on incentives, and getting incentives to Hamas, so that they will release these more than 200 hostages.

Typically, the last time I was here, you could hear the activity that was happening, in the south, in Gaza.It's not a stretch that international pressure is going to intensify on Israel, and also by extension, the U.S., to potentially keep this pause going, for longer than just the 96 hours.

      "sentences": "This is a -- it's a great question. It's one I've been wrestling with, since October 7th, because the Israelis say that. They say we have twin goals, which is eradicate Hamas, and get the hostages back.And sometimes, some members of the War Cabinet, actually say the primary goal is getting the hostages back. Gadi Eizenkot, who's a former IDF Chief of Staff, who's a member of the War Council, has said, apparently in private meetings, the goal is to get the hostages back, as though that the war-fighting, the eradication of Hamas is subordinated. But by and large, the attitude is, both goals. Now, what I've been wrestling with is do those two goals conflict with one another or reinforce one another? I have believed that they conflict with one another. That if your sole goal is to eradicate Hamas, you have to do that differently, when you know that hostages hang in the balance. It's just the nature of the war-fighting. The operational decisions you make are different, when you know there are hostages in those tunnels, that you are trying to get home, or there's a possibility for negotiating to get them home. I think one bright spot, of the last couple weeks, from Israel's perspective, is there may be a case to be made that the two goals reinforce one another. That is to say that that Sinwar and Deif, the two leaders of Hamas, in Gaza, would never have accepted this deal, in the early days of the war-fighting. And it's purely of a function -- it's a purely a result of how successful the IDF has been, at least in north Gaza, that the leadership of Hamas, in Gaza, feels under so much pressure, that they were willing to start negotiating this aggressively. So, there is a case to be made. I've been skeptical of this case. But I must say the last few days have demonstrated perhaps that there's a case to be made, that the success of the Israeli war-fighting, and the pursuit of Hamas, has actually delivered results, on the hostage front that they otherwise may not have.",

I'm joined now by retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton. So, give us some perspective on this, if you would, Colonel. Hezbollah launched nine other attacks, on Israeli military posts, yesterday. How does the truce, between Israel and Hamas, fit into the broader regional picture here? CEDRIC LEIGHTON, U.S. AIR FORCE COLONEL (RET.): Yes, Pam, that's a very good question. Because Hezbollah is not a party, as you mentioned, to this truce, between Hamas and Israel. So, Hezbollah is kind of watching what's going on here. They're looking at this, from the standpoint of \"Do I enter Israel at this point? Do I attack Israel? Or do I put the kettle on a low boil, just to keep the Israelis occupied?\" And that seems to be what they're doing. They're trying to in essence, foment a degree of tension in the north, so that Israel is at least paying attention to them, and to some extent, even a little bit distracted, from a military standpoint. We, in the press, are covering it, covering the hostage situation. We're covering the south quite well. But in the north, the forces from Hezbollah are kind of poised to go in, and perhaps do a little bit of damage, in the north, while we're focused on other things.",

Plus, they work with Syria. And there is a big relationship, with some of the paramilitary forces, in Iraq. So, Iran has a lot of tentacles, out, in the rest of the Middle East. And they are in essence, looking to foment just enough conflict, in these areas, so that they keep Israel occupied, because they -- their stated goal is to eliminate the Jewish state. Plus, they also want to keep America occupied. They want to make sure that when we are engaged, that it's dangerous for us, that we put our forces at risk. And that's why you're seeing a lot of attacks, on American bases, in both Iraq and in Syria. And that's the kind of thing that the Iranians, really like to do, because they want to keep us somewhat engaged. But they don't want us to get so engaged that there's actually a broad shooting, where at least at the moment, that's the way they're looking at it, right now.",
