Republican Kevin McCarthy is holding last-ditch talks tonight fighting to win tomorrow's cliffhanger vote for the speaker's job. We're going to tell you who's been spotting heading into his office as he tries to win over opponents within his own party.Also this hour, the suspect in the brutal stabbing deaths of four college students is expected in court tomorrow, authorities seeking his return to Idaho to face first-degree murder charges, even as they remain silent about a possible motive. And a deadly new year of war in Ukraine, as Russia suffers today what may be the biggest loss of life since the start of the invasion. Ukraine claiming a major strike against Russian forces as Moscow unleashed a fresh barrage of missiles and drones, including in Kyiv. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with a very big cloud of uncertainty right now, hanging over Republican Kevin McCarthy's bid to be the next speaker. Lawmakers will vote tomorrow on whether McCarthy should hold one of the most powerful positions here in Washington that would puts him actually second in line to the presidency. CNN's Melanie Zanona is following all the new developments up on Capitol Hill. Melanie, what can you tell us right now about McCarthy's 11th hour appeals to his opponents within his own party?",

If he gets the job, at any point, some of these what I call obstructionists, I'd like to call themselves conservatives, I call them obstructionists, could demand that he be removed from the chair. Wolf, there's one other scenario that would be very interesting, and that is for Republicans, the bulk of the Republicans to join with Democrats to pick a speaker in a sort of a coalition government in the House of Representatives. Is that likely to happen? No. But in the best of times it could happen. It would moderate what would happen in the House of Representatives the same way that Joe Biden is going to have to moderate his agenda because Republicans are in the majority. But at this point, if it's McCarthy or somebody else and they pass a rules package, it really empowers obstructionist to just remove people willy-nilly because he didn't meet their purposes. That's not a kind of a leader that has any strength. And if there's anything we need today, it's leaders that have some strength and some vision. BLITZER:  Yes. You speak with some authority when it comes to the House of Representatives. You used to serve in the House before you became governor. That's where I first met you. Melanie, let's get back to what is happening right now. McCarthy wouldn't say whether he will actually make more concessions.

One thing that conservatives are still pushing for is to lower the threshold to trigger a vote on ousting the sitting speaker. McCarthy has agreed to allow five people to trigger that vote. They want it to be one member. That's what it used to be before Speaker Nancy Pelosi change the rules.And so it's very possible he might have to come down on that. I asked a number of lawmakers leaving his office just moments ago whether there's still discussions about rule changes, and they said you know, nothing is final until they pass the rules package, which indicates to me that, yes, there's a chance that we could see changes between now and tomorrow morning. But there're a number of other things besides the rules that McCarthy has in his back pocket. He can make promises about committee assignments. He could create a leadership, a seat at the leadership table and appoint one of these members there. There are number of things, he can twist arms, he can dangle carrots. But it's going to be a big question of whether he can still get there despite all of these concessions that he's made.",

They are very keenly aware that whoever wins the speakership vote is going to be a critical piece of government moving forward.And while they are fully expecting partisan warfare from the new House Republican majority, they know, there are issues where it's government funding or raising the debt ceiling, where the person in the speaker's office is going to play a critical role in trying to find some kind of outcome or resolution. However, those same officials have made clear they have no insight that is any different than we've got. In fact, some have pointed out that Mel's reporting, our colleague, Manu Raju, is reporting, that has been as much as they've gotten in terms of inside into what's actually happening right now. But there's one thing to note going forward. There are procedural reasons why they need answer at this point in time about who's going to lead House Republicans, when the actual state of the Union address is going to be. That will come from the speaker of the House. The committees that are likely to investigate the Biden administration, those won't really launch until there's a speaker of the House. But there's also the reality of the optics of what's happening right now on Capitol Hill. President Biden on Wednesday, Wolf, is going to be traveling to Kentucky to appear at an event, to celebrate his bipartisan infrastructure law with none other than Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. That is a split screen White House officials are very happy to take if tomorrow devolves into a circus, that I think a lot of people are expecting at this point in time. That ability to kind of frame things, President Biden talking about bipartisanship, meeting with Republicans in the Senate, who he thinks he can work with, as House Republicans, can't figure out how to even formulate themselves for the Congress ahead, that is absolutely something White House officials will take given where things stand right now.",

I mean, he would obviously have to move out if he doesn't get the speakership. This is standard protocol to move into the office. But it just really speaks to the uncertainty gripping the House Republican conference right now. And what a remarkable moment we're in. Kevin McCarthy did not think he would be in this position.

We want to know your encounters with him, what he said, what he might have revealed and so on. So, the tell there is that they may well be searching for a motive.So, it boils down to a couple of really important questions, which is, one, what was his relationship to that house? Had he been there before? Had he been inside? Was he familiar with it? Was he familiar with it because he knew someone in the house, someone who lived there? Was there an issue between him and that person or an obsession or something that we could understand as a motive? When you talk to FBI former profilers, like Mary Ellen O'Toole, they'll say, for someone to do a home invasion murder of four people at a house where they've never been is extraordinarily high risk for a criminal who doesn't know what he's walking into who is going to be there, whether they're going to be male or female. So, I think we're going to learn from the affidavit whether they know whether there was a relationship with that house. We know his DNA was found there as an unknown contributor, according to sources familiar with the case.

In spite of seemingly endless Russian strikes, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy still upbeat in his New Year's speech, underlying the sense of unity among Ukrainians and asking them to recharge and warning Russia that Moscow is fighting a losing battle. They're afraid. You can feel it. And they're right to be afraid because they're losing, he says. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin ended 2022 by visiting a military base in Southern Russia. He toasted with his forces, awarded the country's highest military honor to its general overseeing Moscow's war in Ukraine. And in his New Year's address he said, in 2022, Russia laid foundations for its true independence. It was a year of difficult, necessary decisions, he says, most important steps towards gaining the full sovereignty of Russia. Last year was brutal for both sides. This year, there is still no end in sight. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's a big blow to the military and that's got to be a big blow to Putin and his folks are watching the decisions that he's making, and they're losing confidence in those decisions.

They're incompetent. They don't know how to do that. So, I'll just put that aside. Zelenskyy clearly understands that this is a battle of wills. Russia has the law of large numbers going for it.

That includes a text exchange between Julie Radford, the chief of staff to Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, the longtime adviser to Donald Trump, an ally of him for much of the presidency.And Hicks was writing how frustrated they both felt over Trump's actions during the Capitol riots. She wrote, in one day, he ended every opportunity that doesn't include speaking engagements at the local Proud Boys chapter and all of us that didn't have jobs lined up will be perpetually unemployed. I'm so mad and upset. We all look like domestic terrorists now. So, that's Hope Hicks on January 6th in text messages. And it's a good thing that they have documentation like this from what people were saying because there are many witnesses that didn't answer questions, didn't remember, took the Fifth, didn't show up for testimony. And there are missing records too, six or seven hours of records on January 6th of the White House call logs that don't exist. However, the committee has made public as of today, call logs from the White House, from the presidency from January 2nd, January 3rd, January 5th, those days leading up, days where Donald Trump was calling the Georgia secretary of state in that infamous phone call, putting pressure there, also when he was speaking with Justice Department officials about reorganizing the top of leadership for the Justice Department to help him. And also, these logs, especially on January 5th, it look likes he was calling quite a few members of Congress and wanting to speak to them as well about what appeared to be his plan of the next day.",
