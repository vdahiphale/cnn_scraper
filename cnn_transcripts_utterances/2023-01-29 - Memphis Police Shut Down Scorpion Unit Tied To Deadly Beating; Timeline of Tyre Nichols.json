I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Today the attorney for the family of Tyre Nichols is calling the video of the 29-year-old being beaten by officers a watershed moment, one that the attorney hopes will lead to federal police legislation reform. Late yesterday, we learned that the Memphis Police Department had shut down the controversial Scorpion Unit that the officers charged in this killing belonged to. That news coming less than 24 hours after the graphic video of Tyre Nichols being beaten and tased by officers was released to the public. And again, I want to warn our viewers, what you're about to watch is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Video so brutal that it's time and time again been compared to the 1992 beating of Rodney King.So what has happened here in Memphis is that the police chief, Cerelyn C.J. Davis, she met with members of this Scorpion Unit, members who've not been involved in this beating of Tyre Nichols, and they determined that it was in the best interest of the community to disband. This goes directly to the wishes of Tyre Nichols' mother and father, to the family attorneys, and to activists who said that this was the only step forward, to permanently deactivate that unit. So here's what we know about that Scorpion Unit. It is a specialized unit that is relatively new, Jim. It was created by the chief back in 2021, November 2021, to really crack down on a surge of crime and to target violent areas in Memphis with a focus on things like homicides, robberies, assaults, and other felonies. Now Nichols' attorneys, the family's attorney, say that they would go around in unmarked cars and were sometimes unnecessarily aggressive, especially to people of color. We did hear from Attorney Benjamin Crump this morning. He spoke with CNN and he did, however, tout the quick firing and charging of these involved police officers, saying that this is really a blueprint going forward, not just here in Memphis but beyond, that reform needs to happen on a national scale. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN CRUMP, TYRE NICHOLS' FAMILY ATTORNEY: This video illustrates that it's this culture that says, it doesn't matter the police officers are black, Hispanic, or white that it is somehow allowed for you to trample on the constitutional rights of certain citizens from certain ethnicities and certain communities. And we have to have a larger conversation about this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What ends up happening is the kinds of officers that are attracted to these units are officers who want less supervision, less oversight, who want that kind of freer reign, and a, you know, really broad mandate. And so we've seen it, you know, over and over and over again. It started in the '70s with the stress units in Detroit. We saw it with the NYPD with the street crimes unit that's been off and on over the years. We saw it in Los Angeles and in Chicago, Philly. It's a very kind of tired and frankly sort of lazy reaction to increases in crime. This idea that we should just, you know, give cops more reign to do that. And so part of that is they're allowed to make these pre-textural stops, if they think that it will help them, you know, sort of investigate a major crime or a violent crime or help them find stolen weapons or drugs.",

But again, this is a repeating story. About 10 years ago, there's one of these units in Chicago, one of these allegedly sort of elite police units, and it was revealed after a number of scandals, including, you know, brutality, drug dealing, burglaries, robberies, that four of the officers on that unit had more than 50 citizen complaints against them, which were among the most in the 10,000-member department.So again I think we need to take -- you know, these units sort of select for the wrong type of police officer, and then you take these officers and you give them less discretion, less oversight, and tell them that, you know, they're allowed to sort of skirt the rules or they're allowed to, you know, go beyond what normal police officers do when it comes to suppressing crime, I think this is a, you know, a result that's pretty inevitable.

Bystanders might get hit, other people -- other cars might get hit and so on.And there was talk of reform. There were reforms made in some of those cities to stop doing that sort of thing. Do we need to see the same kind of conversation happen with these types of traffic stops? Because why in the world should a traffic stop end like this?

I think from the perspective of somebody like Tyre Nichols, you know, if you're black or a member of another minority or marginalized community in this country, you're going to be nervous and scared when you're pulled over by the police because of these videos and stories.And on the other hand, police, from the time they're in the police academy have it drummed into them that every traffic stop they make could be their last. That they should always be sort of on guard and be ready for, you know, the worst possible, you know, offender, that they should be ready to be ambushed. And that creates, you know, a really perilous situation when police pulled -- and I think this is a little different. I mean, this unit clearly just, you know, had it out for this guy from the start. But yes, I think you're right. There's no reason why police should be in the business of traffic enforcement. It can be done, you know, it can all be automated. If somebody is truly driving recklessly and presents an immediate threat to the public, then yes, you can have officers pull them over. But for, you know, things like broken taillights, you know, minor speeding, not using a turn signal, I mean, those things can all be handled, you know, through automated devices.",

But again, you know, I think when you're a police chief and you're in a city that's, you know, facing a soaring crime rate, you know, as we've seen in a lot of cities over the last couple of years, there's a lot of public pressure to do something, to do anything.And I think we need to kind of hammer home the idea that more force, more confrontation, more aggression isn't the answer. I mean, there's no evidence that these tactics makes cities safer. And in fact, you know, one of the most important things to keeping cities safe is trust between communities and the police that they serve -- excuse me, or the police that serve them. You want communities to be able to reach out to police to feel comfortable talking to them, to cooperate with investigations. And when you have units like this that are, you know, seemingly randomly harassing people just because they happen to live in a high- crime area, that -- you know, that's pretty much the opposite of building trust.",

I mean, between the deadliest day for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank last Thursday, then you had the shooting just outside of a synagogue on Friday night and that other shooting Saturday morning just outside of Jerusalem's Old City walls, it's been quite a few days of bloodshed here.And as you noted, the atmosphere is just incredibly, incredibly tense. So this visit, obviously, the timing is very useful, it's very important. He will first meet with Israeli officials before going to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian officials. And likely top of mind will be first of all trying to cool the temperature down a little bit. Trying to bring things back a little bit. Next up, will, I think, be trying to restore the security coordination between the Palestinian Authority and the Israelis. The Palestinian Authority on Thursday severing that security coordination. This covers things such as intelligence sharing to ostensibly help fight terrorism and militants. But the Palestinian authority cut that off on Thursday in response to a deadly military raid that the Israeli military says was targeting Islamic jihad militants. And that's being seen by many as very vital to help calm the situation. But there will be a real question about whether Secretary Blinken can actually get that done because really the atmosphere here has been building for some time. And former officials that I've been speaking to really aren't necessarily optimistic that what Secretary Blinken can do can really change the course of what's happening here. We think it might calm things down briefly. At best, they might be able to restore the security coordination between the Palestinian Authority and the Israelis. But really I mean, things have been building here for months. Last year was the deadliest year for both Israelis and Palestinians, especially in the occupied West Bank, in some instances in decades. [16:30:00] And so, there really is a question of, what, if anything, can stop what's really seeming to be a crisis moment for both Israelis and Palestinians here? And we're already getting reports of other instances of violence between both sides over the last 24 hours. And so, it's just, everyone is looking towards Secretary Blinken and to see what he might be able to do to help really calm the situation as much as possible -- Jim.",

Federal prosecutors even discussed potentially charging the then-president once he was out of office.The revelations coming from the new book, \"Untouchable: How Powerful People Get Away With It,\" which looks at how Trump and other powerful people have managed to evade the legal consequences of their actions. It was written by our very own CNN Legal Analyst, and former federal prosecutor, Ellie Honig who joins us now. Ellie, setting aside the question, how in the world can you write a book being as busy as you are? I won't put you on the spot and ask you that question. You do have some very good brand-new reporting in this book, taking us inside the Department of Justice, including the real story of how Donald Trump became individual one. Tell us more. ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST (via Webex): Yes, Jim, I got the behind the scene story here and I found it fascinating how Donald Trump ended up as individual one. So, if we go back to 2018, the Southern District of New York, my former office, is getting ready to indict Michael Cohen on those hush money payments. Now, because Donald Trump was the sitting president at time, they knew that they could not indict him. However, the Southern District of New York prepared an indictment of Michael Cohen that laid out chapter and verse on Donald Trump's involvement in that hush money scheme. That went into great detail. How Donald Trump was the driver of it, the beneficiary of it, and really made clear that, in their view, Donald Trump was criminally liable. However, the bosses down at DOJ in Washington, D.C., what we used to call main justice, found out about this and they stepped on it. They said, absolutely not. We're not putting all that detail in Michael Cohen's indictment about Donald Trump. And then, there was the question of, well, what do we call Trump then? Now, originally, the SDNY considered calling him co-conspirator one, which would have been the first time, since Richard Nixon, that label was applied to a president. That was shot down. Then, the Southern District said, well, how about candidate one? That was even shot down as being too much. And then, they settled on the completely innocuous individual one. And, Jim, as a result, we got this sanitized indictment of Michael Cohen that barely mentioned individual one. And the end result, there was only Michael Cohen was ever prosecuted for that.",

Do we indict him then?I will tell you the end result, we all know. No, he was not prosecuted. But the reasoning that went into the Southern District's decision I found really interesting. And people, I guess, can decide for themselves if they agree or disagree. But among the reasons was, first of all, they believed it would be politically fraught to charge a controversial former president. And, strangely enough, the fact that Trump had had all of these other scandals and potential crimes between those two things. The Mueller investigation. The Ukraine impeachment. January Sixth had happened. The Southern District felt like, at that point, the hush money payments were sort of too old or even too low on the list of his infractions. And so, they sort of left it to others to do it. And, as a result, only Michael Cohen was ever charged for this whole scheme which is really hard to defend, I think.",

The Justice Department has told lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, it is working to satisfy their demands for information about classified documents found at the properties of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, without harming ongoing special counsel investigations into both matters.

Figure out whether there's a national security risk.But what DOJ cannot do, and Merrick Garland -- as critical as I am of him at times in the book, Merrick Garland has done a very good job of saying, what we will not do is crack open the records on our pending ongoing investigations, whether it's of Donald Trump or Joe Biden or anyone else. Because if DOJ were to do that, they would expose those investigations. They would jeopardize the case. They would even jeopardize, really, the reputations of people who are under investigation.
