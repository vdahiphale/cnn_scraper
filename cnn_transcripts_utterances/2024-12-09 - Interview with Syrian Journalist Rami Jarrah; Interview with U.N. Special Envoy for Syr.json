Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. There is a new reality in Syria, and the road ahead is still unclear after rebels swept into the capital Damascus with lightning speed and ended half a century of oppressive rule by the Assad family. The Kremlin says Vladimir Putin has personally granted Bashar Assad safe haven in Russia. In Damascus, these were the scenes inside Assad's official residence over the weekend, which rebels and civilians were seen ransacking, while crowds gathered to celebrate in the capital's main square. Now, back in 2005, shortly after America deposed President Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq, I went to Damascus to speak to Assad about clouds gathering over his own head even then.

But once this offensive started and given that, youknow, the links that, in general that, someone has with those involved, it became very clear to me and I think many people that are able to reach out and get information that this this effort had been prepared for quite a while. I think anyone claiming at this stage that the goal was to take all of Syria and bring down the Assad regime is just taking advantage of being able to say that in hindsight. I think the reality is that the ambition was to take back some territory, the name of the offensive indicates that. It was to basically repel an offensive by the government. That's the name of the movement. So, I don't think anyone actually expected that this was going to happen. And I definitely speak for myself in saying that I never dreamed that this would happen. But what has been -- I mean, if I could just give a quick backstory. Jolani was obviously -- had his links to the Islamic State and obviously with Al Qaeda, but he has very pragmatically, over the years, created these links and then defected from them. When he pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda, it was basically to protect himself from the Islamic State because he had basically crossed Baghdadi, after Baghdadi had sent him to Aleppo. And then -- sorry to Northern Syria to establish the Islamic State there. And then, he broke ties with Al Qaeda. And first it was just done publicly, and then it became an official break of ties. And what happened after that was that, mainly in these past four or five years, Jolani has actually worked with civil society to build an administration of 11 ministries and work with civil society. And what I'm saying now might like sound like I'm actually defending him, I'm not. I actually am very skeptical. I don't trust Jolani. I think that what he's doing right now is very promising. We just heard out of Damascus today, I think Damascus, Tartus, and Latakia, that a number of laws and guidelines have been set for the fighters, that they're not allowed to interfere in civilian life. They're not allowed to tell women what they're allowed to wear or not wear. These things are all very promising. Jolani pledging that he's even considering of dissolving HTS is a very promising thing to say. But I think what we need moving forward is action. And I don't think that I don't think it's up to me to decide or suggest that Jolani should be forgiven for what he's done in the past, but I think the first step that he can take in actually proving that he -- proving the things that he said, that he does -- he respects the aspirations of Syrians who want to see a future democratic state that represents the rights of all Syrians, regardless of sect or ethnicity, I think the first step in doing that is handing over power to a transitional government and stepping aside.",

And I think Assad's refusal to do that or -- you know, there were disputes on some of the demands that Turkey was making such as, you know, how bit -- how deep the buffer zone that Turkey wanted into Syria. Turkey wanted, I think, 30 kilometers, whereas Assad was demanding six and then went up to nine. But I think Assad was actually trying to avoid this altogether because he didn't have -- his state didn't have the capacity to actually govern Syria or take back all of these refugees, especially the vast majority of them would be people that oppose his government. So, I think Turkey was basically trying to -- was on a path that was unrealistic. It had nothing to do with the aspirations of the Syrian people. And right now, it sounds strange to say, but I think that Jolani actually has -- HTS has the opportunity and these rebel groups, seeming that they no longer depend solely on Turkey as being the border that they share with another state, the fact that they have control over most of Syria right now is a sign that they can be independent and they don't have to depend on Turkey or give into Turkey's conditions. One point -- one really important thing to point out is the divisions between Arabs and Kurds in Syria, and what countries actually play a major role in that. Turkey is the main instigator of these disputes. And this is a reason that, I mean, even now, OK, we've managed, to some extent, disconnect the influence of Russia and Iran over Syria.

And I think all understood the seriousness of the situation, and this is important, the possibilities that this could be a new opening for the Syrian people, turning the page and a new opening to a new Syria that could be inclusive of all. But for that to happen, you know, that there needed to be immediate de- escalation, that we should not see a fight between the different armed groups that have now entered into Damascus, and also taking into account that, of course, there are parts of the country that are not under the control of these armed groups. We have the coast, where we have mostly Alawites, but also others who are living with Russian bases. And then, of course, we have the Northeast with the Kurdish and the so-called SDF bid on the American protection. So, there are many, many issues that are not sorted out. But to get -- and -- but to get this off to a good start, it's important that these groups know how to cooperate, but also that they send the message that they will establish a transitional body that is inclusive of all communities in Syria, that no one will be excluded. And so, far, we are lucky enough, we have been able to see that the messaging coming out, by and large, have been positive from the armed groups. But what is extremely important now is that we actually see that this is implemented on the ground. And if that is happening, then I'm hopeful that this could really be a page that is turned.
