He is a 52-year-old father of 11 who is takenhostage by Hamas on October 7th while he was working as a security guard at a factory in Kibbutz Magen just along the border with Gaza. He was rescued, according to the Israeli military, in a special operation carried out by Shay at 13. That's the Israeli equivalent of the Navy SEALs, alongside other Israeli forces, as well as forces from the Israeli Shin Bet the domestic intelligence service. They call this a complex operation that took place in Southern Gaza. They say that Qaid Farhan Alkadi is in, quote, stable medical condition, and that he's being transferred for medical checks at a hospital. His family has been informed that he was rescued in this operation, and obviously this is welcome news for him. He is a Bedouin man with Israeli citizenship who was taken on October 7th, and of course, over the last ten and a half months, he has endured captivity in Gaza. His family has endured the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not he was alive or dead, whether he would come back alive, and indeed, today, he has in what is a relatively rare occurrence of an Israeli military operation that actually retrieves a hostage alive. I believe he's the eighth hostage to actually be rescued in an Israeli military operation and brought back to Israel alive. Obviously very welcome news for his family, and very happy news in this country, although we should note that there are still over hundred Israeli hostages still being held captive in the Gaza Strip. At least thirty of those are believed to be dead. The fate of the others still uncertain Becky.",

And what I see is, first of all, they're stating that it was in the southern portion of the Gaza Strip that essentially means the Rafah area that you have had large scale troops active in for the last few months. In addition, what you can see, at least, what I read in between the lines, Jeremy mentioned some of the troops that have been mentioned. So, they said that it was special forces, as said. I mean, it's the Navy SEALs, but this is -- I don't think this is something that happened from the sea, but it could be. But it's more that in there, I saw engineering capabilities. As soon as I see the engineering core that's there, to me, it connects to either booby traps or the underground arena. So, I'm going to guess that he was somewhere underground, and that wherever it was, it was booby trapped. But Becky, that's what we know about all of the different area under underground. Its booby trapped. It is very difficult to be inside, so you need a combination of stealth to get to these different places, and then you need to be able to get in and take apart the booby traps.

You can spread them out into a lot of different areas, both in the Rafah area, but also in other areas, as we know, in the exchanges, some were held up north, some in the center, some from -- including some of those that the IDF did a different operation from the sea where they rescued several people. So, when we're talking about that, that's going to be part of the challenge wherever you go. When you asked about what capabilities are left to the Hamas terror fighters, both in the Rafah area and in the other ones, the command and control is destroyed. But that's the thing, is that it's a terror army when you destroy command and control in regular standing armies, usually that means that the unit kind of dissipates. In a terror army every single one of them comes up from a shaft, fires the RPG, continues to do a local capability, like firing a rocket at Israel the day before yesterday. So, I'm sure that they have capabilities, but they don't have the context to be able to execute a full-scale attack, certainly not an October 7th attack, but even something organized in the area of Rafah. I'll just add that Becky, the big problem with the Rafah area is that you have the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, and that's been an enormous point of contention. Because at the end of the day, it's hard for me as an Israeli to ignore that in the 17 years that Israel left the Gaza Strip, because we left it in 2005 that border became the main smuggling route into the Gaza Strip. And so those tunnels and that underground subterranean arena also connects of the possibility to leave the Gaza Strip into Egypt. It's not going into anywhere you're going into Egypt, but it does open additional possibilities also to smuggle out hostages.",

JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: I think the latest details, the most significant ones hearing from the IDF spokesman just a short time ago is that he was rescued from a tunnel based the IDF says on an exact piece of intelligence, we know that among the special forces units involved in this rescue operation were an elite combat engineering unit that is tasked with handling the tunnels in Gaza.

He joins me now from Bahrain, important developments today, the rescue of a hostage held by Hamas in Southern Gaza deep in tunnels there, described as a complex operation by the IDF and the ISA who were involved. This will, as many analysts want to point out, at this point. Put the squeeze on Yahya Sinwar and Hamas, at a time when there is enormous pressure on both Hamas and Israel to come to a deal on a ceasefire and the release of those hostages, of course, goes alongside a release of Palestinian prisons at the same time. Your thoughts on what we are seeing as we consider this breaking news this hour?",

Let's not forget that Benjamin Netanyahu's government took out Hamas' lead negotiatorIsmail Haniyeh a few weeks ago in -- by assassinating him in Tehran. That's not usually a good indicator of a desire, a genuine desire, to reach a ceasefire agreement with the party one is negotiating with. And we've seen, I think, a recurrent pattern of escalation in Israeli military activities, but also -- not only in Gaza, but also broadly in the region. I think one of the sticking points at the moment in the current negotiations is that Israel seems to have imposed, or seems to have been negotiating on new conditions, including a semi-permanent, or permanent stationing of Israeli forces along Gaza's border with Egypt and the Philadelphia corridor. Apparently wants to maintain an enduring presence in Rafah crossing. This is obviously objectionable to Egypt, which wants Israel to abide by their long-standing agreement on demilitarizing these areas. But it's also obviously unacceptable to Hamas, which insists on a permanent ceasefire and a total withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip. Let's remember as an addendum that there are thousands of Palestinians currently being held in detention in Israeli prison facilities. Most of whom are held without charge or without trial, and many of whom are being held under absolutely appalling conditions, including physical and psychological torture.",

You played thosedramatic images of rescue workers in the middle of the night in Central Ukraine, in Kryvyi Rih, trying to dig through the rubble of this hotel, trying to find survivors. Scenes like that, of course, playing out all across Ukraine. President Zelenskyy, speaking just a short time ago, vowed revenge, but he says, in order to carry out retaliation, he needs two things from his partners. He wants the green light, first of all, to use those long-range missiles that have been given to him by NATO to strike at targets inside Russia. Secondly, he is asking to use those air defense capabilities right up next to Russian airspace. Now, of course, these requests would make any western leader cringe, Becky, begins to beg the question, could this possibly aggravate Putin further? Could this escalate the war? But President Zelenskyy says there's simply no option. This is the only way for him to respond, and he's preparing for a meeting with President Biden, potentially around the U.N. next month to ask for just that.",
