What Rudy Giuliani and others whom Bernie Kerik was working with after the 2020 election to try and find evidence of fraud, which they couldn't find, what they were doing between election day in 2020 to January 6th. So the reason this matters -- we've heard about all kinds of witnesses -- is twofold. One, this is the first time we've seen investigative activity, really, after that indictment of Donald Trump last week. And on top of that, we're seeing investigative activity on a particular lane, about Rudy Giuliani and what Rudy Giuliani was doing.

And we'll let you, DOJ, decide in the first instance what's sensitive and what's not. And DOJ then came back and said the purpose of discovery is not to enable your P.R. efforts. It's to inform you and let you prepare for trial. So all of those are good points. And Judge Chutkan is going to have to sort through them. Look, I suspect she's going to try to find some middle ground here, because while there have to be some limits on what you can say publicly -- you can't cross the line into jury tampering or witness tampering or intimidation-- you do have as a defendant, the right; you can criticize your judge.

Jim, I was reading through your reporting this morning, and it's pretty startling and concerning. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR/CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is. And it's a marked change from the optimism at the start at this counteroffensive some weeks ago, but weeks in, Ukrainian forces encountering real difficulty. Russian forces have built and put up a -- really, a devastating defense there, so that as they look at the status of this war but also the chances for significant progress, Western officials receiving increasingly sobering assessments. As one senior Western diplomat told me, \"They're still going to see for the next couple weeks\" -- this is describing the Ukrainian forces -- \"if there is a chance of making some progress, but for them to really make progress that would change the balance of this conflict, I think it's extremely, highly unlikely.\" And I was speaking to multiple officials briefed on the latest intelligence who were seeing the same picture here. A number of things: Russian defensive lines, three layers, tens of thousands of mines. As they've been assaulting those lines, Ukrainian forces are incurring staggering, just staggering losses. And in response to that, they have often pulled back some of their forces, becoming casualty-averse, understandably. And that has then limited their chances for making further progress going forward. But there's also a bigger picture issue here: realizing that just a few weeks of training, eight weeks of training, in some cases, on some of these new weapons systems -- Western-supplied tanks, for instance -- is not enough to instantly create new, highly-capable mechanized units to successfully assault those Russian defensive lines. Now, they still maintain hope that this could change, but it is a marked change, Poppy and Victor, from what I was hearing just a few weeks ago at the start of this counteroffensive.",

For instance, the U.S. just approving sending Abrams tanks there now. But they're not going to get there until the fall. And they're still training up Ukrainian forces on those tanks. So, the view is there's not one system that they could send tomorrow and fundamentally change the nature of this battle here. That this is shaping up to be a long, difficult slog, with heavy losses on both sides. And time pressure, as well. Because as you get into the fall, the weather changes. Makes it more difficult to push forward. So, they're feeling time pressure to -- to make some ground, right, before then. But I wouldn't say pessimistic is the view, but I would certainly say a sobering view of their chances.",
