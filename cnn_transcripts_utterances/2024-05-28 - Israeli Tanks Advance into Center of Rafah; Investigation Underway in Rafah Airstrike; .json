This is the first time we arereceiving reports of this and the escalation comes despite international warnings around the operation and the global outcry over the strike on the displacement camp that killed at least 45 people in Rafah. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the strike on the camp a tragic error. And just within the past few minutes, Israeli Defense Forces gave updates are on these strikes. Spokesman Daniel Hagari claimed, their munition alone could not have caused such a large fire on its own. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem for us and we also have Oren Liebermann  standing by at the Pentagon. Jeremy, I want to start off with you. We just heard from IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari who says the investigation is still underway, basically saying that and showing a map actually that where they struck versus where the safe zone was. There was quite a distance but the images just show the harrowing impact of the strike, even though the IDF says this is still, it's too premature to tell what caused the fire.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right.What is most interesting and what we heard from Admiral Hagari, the Israeli military's top spokesman, are two things. First of all, he talks about the types of munitions that were used. He says that these are the smallest munitions that can be fitted onto Israeli jets, 17 kilo, which is about 37 pound munitions; two of those used to take out these two senior Hamas militants. And the second crucial point that Hagari makes here is that he is arguing that those munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of the size that we saw in those camps where displaced Palestinians were living. Effectively suggesting that the overwhelming majority of the casualties, if not all of the casualties, were caused by this fire or some kind of a secondary explosion. I did ask a question in that briefing that I submitted, which was whether or not all of these civilian casualties they believed were caused by that secondary fire or explosion. And he would not go that far, saying that the investigation is still underway. He did float the possibility that there were munitions near that -- the site of the strike that could have ignited and caused a secondary explosion. But he did not say that for certain. He said that that is one of the avenues that the Israeli military is indeed exploring. What he really emphasized was the fact that, in the surveillance that the Israeli military carried out before this strike, that the assessment was that there would not be civilian casualties. And that's why they carried out that civilian, that surveillance ahead of time. But again things like munitions being present are something that militaries tend to assess before they carry out strikes. Sometimes they miss those things. We have seen incidents involving other militaries, including the U.S. military, where unknown stashes of munitions can cause secondary explosions. But again, the Israeli  military is not providing any evidence for that at this stage, simply saying that that is a theory that they are exploring. What is clear though, is that the injuries to civilians that we have seen are not solely burn injuries. They are injuries caused by shrapnel, caused by an explosion, certainly of some type. Whether or not those are explosions related to these two munitions that the Israeli military dropped or some secondary explosion is not clear but we should specify that the catastrophic injuries that we have seen to the bodies of civilians, including children and babies, are not solely consistent with burns caused by a fire.",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm not sure we've seen an incident where the U.S. has independently investigated an incident or anaccident or an event that the Israelis have already investigated. And that's because the U.S. largely relies on Israel to carry out its own investigations. And generally at least according to the statements we've heard from both the Biden administration and U.S. officials they tend to believe that these investigations are credible. That they, the Israelis have done a thorough job of investigating what happened here, at least as of right now, there is no attempt to investigate this independently from the United States, according to a U.S. official and they will wait to see what the Israeli investigation turns up. Now does that violate the U.S.' and President Joe Biden's red line? We haven't heard a definitive answer on that but it's worth pointing out that Biden's red line was about an Israeli grounded incursion into Rafah. And that red line was there because of the harm to civilians. Now even if we haven't seen a large-scale ground incursion into Rafah, although according to eyewitnesses, we have seen tanks in central Rafah, we have now seen exactly what the Biden administration was trying to avoid. Trying to make sure that the Israelis didn't cause, which is civilian casualties on a large scale and humanitarian catastrophe. So even if we haven't heard about a specific incident like this that the administration was looking for, this is the exact cause and consequence of an Israeli operation. A strike that the administration was desperately trying to prevent. And yet here we are. A spokesperson for the White House is -- or rather for the National Security Council called this heartbreaking and made it clear at least for now the U.S. sees the blame and the responsibility here. The devastating images following the IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking. Does the U.S. choose to take any additional measures from this point on? That will be a key question throughout the day today as the U.S. waits for more information from the Israelis on how this all unfolded and how so many Palestinians, including women and children, are now dead.",

And we've just seen the eyewitness reports coming through on these Israeli military tanks in central Gaza as well. Daniel Hagari didn't give any information on that.

And remember when President Biden talked about what would be his red line, he was talking about a kind of all-out Israeli military offensive that would go into the center of the most densely populated part of the city. So this is a fair question to ask as to whether or not this crosses that red line for him. What we should note of course, is the fact that nearly 1 million Palestinians who were living in Rafah have evacuated so far, most of those in eastern Rafah where the Israeli military has issued evacuation orders. But also in parts of central Rafah, even before the Israeli military advanced there. There was a sense of fear and panic spreading throughout the city that pushed people even in the central or even in the western part of the city to begin to head north in anticipation and out of fear of a potentially larger Israeli military offensive. So for now what we know is that it appears that there are Israeli tanks in the central downtown part of Rafah already. And the question now of course, turns to Washington and to the White House in terms of how that tracks with their red line that the president set out and whether or not this will have any ramifications.",

And he's denying the things that people testified to on the witness stand over this seven week trial. So far, he has hammered home the point that the defense really wants to make to the jury, Michael Cohen lied to you. That is the words of this defense attorney in his closing arguments. Michael Cohen being that personal attorney to Donald Trump, who testified that he was getting reimbursed for the payments he was making to Stormy Daniels in 2016 to keep her quiet. Trump knew that it was fraud to reimburse Cohen in the way that he did on the books, calling it a legal expense when it was not. And the Donald Trump at that time was making those reimbursements out of a political motivation to protect his presidential campaign in 2016. That is a large part of the defense case undercutting Michael Cohen's testimony since he is the closest witness to these payments. He's clearly the star witness for the prosecutors here. Many other witnesses fleshed out how he was untrustworthy as a person but also how he was in contact with Trump and doing this work on his behalf. The other point the defense is making in this three-hour or so closing argument that we still have quite a bit of time left in, is that they keep saying, Todd Blanche keeps underlining for the jury that the evidence just isn't there. The prosecutors were relying so far on books that Donald Trump wrote decades ago to tell the jury about his character and that the evidence that was presented in this case about these payments, about Donald Trump's intent to commit a crime, that, he says, the evidence should leave you wanting more. It's just not there. And the defense is asking the jury not to convict the former president in this first criminal trial, Erica.",

      "sentences": "The reports that the pope made these remarks, that using an offensive anti-gay slang word duringmeeting with Italian bishops, has caused a real stir. Now the pope allegedly reportedly made these remarks when he was talking to the Italian bishops about whether to admit gay men to the priesthood. And Francis has consistently said that's not possible. But the statement from the Vatican says, and I quote, in concerning the slang word, the pope is reported to views that, \"The pope never intended to offend or express himself in homophobic terms. And he extends his apologies to those who felt offended by the use of this -- of a term as reported by others.\" Now the statement also says that the pope has consistently insisted that the church must welcome everyone, including everyone as they are. Of course, this has been the pope's consistent message during his pontificate, particularly when it comes to LGBTQ+ Catholics. Francis said early on, \"Who am I to judge,\" when it came to gay priests. He has offered the possibility of blessings for same-sex couples and called for the decriminalization of homosexuality. And so this is why his reported remarks really did cause huge surprise. It has been reported the pope was not fully aware of how offensive the term he used was, of course, Italian, which he was speaking during the meet -- the language he was speaking during the meeting to the Italian bishops. Italian is not his first language but the pope, by authorizing the issue of the -- issuing of the statement has shown he is someone willing to apologize for his mistakes and he clearly felt the need to do so, given this story was threatening to undermine the work that he's done to offer a welcome to gay Catholics during his pontificate.",

From their side right now, just a reminder here, Donald Trump is accused of falsifying business records to cover up that $130,000 hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. That payment was made before the 2016 election. The records that were allegedly falsified, that came a little bit later. He is, of course, the first former U.S. president to be there in a criminal trial facing charges. He's denied those charges. CNN's Brynn Gingras covering this very closely for us. Brynn, what more are we hearing from the defense at this point as to why they are telling the jury nothing to see here?",
