We'll be updating you on that in a few moments. Firstly other headlines this hour Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he is hoping elections can be held next year as scheduled although he added a caveat that it will be difficult while the war is ongoing. In Georgia in the U.S. Ex-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows is attempting to move his state case to federal court. We will see the strength of District Attorney Fani Willis' case against Former President Donald Trump. At the same time in Washington the judge weighing the arguments over the start dates of Donald Trump's federal trial. And in Jacksonville, Florida the manifesto of a 21-year-old shooter shows his killing of three black people was racially motivated. The attack is being investigated as a hate crime. Well, wherever you're watching in the world it is a very warm welcome back to \"Connect the World\". I'm Becky Anderson for you. Luis Rubiales is in hot water. The Spanish Football Federation Chief will now be investigated by the Spanish prosecutor's office for his unwarranted case of player Jennifer Hermoso following her team's World Cup win. Because of this more than a week after that historic triumph over England, it's not football we're speaking about. The victory overshadowed by an unwanted and unwarranted kiss in the aftermath of the game. Players and fans across the world have shown their outrage on social media and on the pitch. Hermoso's teammates are refusing to play again for Spain until Rubiales quits or is removed. Well instead, the Spanish Football Federation has so far been standing by its man ignoring the requests of its World Cup heroes. So tonight we ask when women will be heard by football's leadership. Well, news of the investigation against Rubiales coming as Spain's Football Federation holds what it describes as an urgent meeting presumably to discuss Rubiales' future. Atika Shubert looks at how all of this reached this point and what may happen next. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Euphoric celebrations for an historic Women's World Cup quickly turned into a moment of reckoning when Luis Rubiales President of the Spanish Football Federation planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso doing the medal ceremony in Sydney. The kiss she later said she had not consented to. Facing domestic and international criticism Rubiales was pressured to resign but he defiantly refused. He double down saying the kiss was consensual to the applause of men in the room.",

      "sentences": "Yes listen, FIFA world football's governing body will say they are letting their actions do the talking. Theyare the ones who took the decision to open disciplinary proceedings against Luis Rubiales and provisionally suspend him for 90 days. As Atika rightly pointed to there, we've had the players speaking out that is something we need to remember that they and many around Spanish Football have done not for the first time this week. They were the 15 who wrote the letters months ago, raising concerns about the treatment. The management structures the respect they were getting, and they were brushed under the carpet. It's something that the Spanish women's players raised in 2015 after the World Cup, and then it was something that was waived back in 2011. This has happened time and time and time again. We have now got to the point that the Spanish federal authorities, the prosecutors, as you mentioned have now opened proceedings. They've said they want to speak to Jenni Hermoso and inform her of her rights as a victim of an alleged crime of sexual aggression, as they put it. But the Spanish Football Federation themselves up until this point have stood by their man. And perhaps more importantly, European Football's governing body UEFA has said nothing. Luis Rubiales has been the head of Spanish Football since 2018 prior to that, he was Head of the Spanish Players Association. He is a fifth -- UEFA Vice President reelected only in April this year. There has been nothing from UEFA. And at that point, you have to say this is football politics once again coming into play. We know he is one of the closest allies of the UEFA President Ceferin. We have the UEFA Congress meeting being held in Madrid next year, the annual meeting is being held in February in Madrid. We know there is a lot of pride about the fact that Spain is part of the bid to co-host the 2030 World Cup alongside Portugal and Morocco. That is really high stakes for not only people in Spain, but also people at European football's governing body. So that is a lot of the background. That is why a lot is perhaps being said behind closed doors, but not publicly. And that is why there is so much unrest. People feel the stakes are too high to come out and perhaps say what they want but you know UEFA is an organization that only allowed women onto its executive committee in April this year for the first time. That tells you just some indicator of how much progress still needs to be made.",

Andthen, of course, you've got the Spanish Football Federation. And during the meeting, of course, on Friday, when Rubiales did not resign, when many people thought he had he was actually applauded. And I have to say, by both men and women, so you can really see the kind of disconnect here. I want to read this quote, from Spanish Footballer Andres Iniesta on the incident. He said, and I quote him here. We have had to put up with a President who has held on to his position, who has not admitted that his behavior has been unacceptable. And that it is damaging the image of our country and our football around the world. He's getting pressure from female players, from male players from fans, why has he not stepped down? Our big question tonight is simply when will women be heard by football's leadership?",

And to be quitehonest with you, I'm not really sure if I'm allowed to say it on television. But there are definitely a lot of ideas and thoughts. I'll just put it as delicately as I can. There are all kinds of allegations, very serious allegations, obviously innocent until proven guilty. And he has denied these for a very long time and they are still under investigation. But there are allegations of criminal activity of sexist behavior, misogynistic behavior as well, for years that have been reported to the police have been reported to courts by men and women for a very long time. You read the statement of Andres Iniesta. Well, you should read the statement of Javier Tebas, the President of LALIGA, because he's very forthright about his thoughts about the type of man that Rubiales is and also explains fairly explicitly as to why he believes he's still in power. Another way to put it is there's been plenty of controversies and scandals that he's been able to overcome and been able to come out on the other side of. So there are a lot of ideas and theories as to why that may be. And again, I'm not so sure I can say this or not. But I definitely recommend you look into it. Because it is very common knowledge here in Spain of public knowledge here about very specific allegations as they relate to the government and his relationship with the government which is why it is very suspected that there are very severe tensions between the governments and the Federation and Rubiales himself, which could lead to why this whole thing had been dragged out in the first place and why he hasn't previously been removed when he absolutely should have been?",

Everyone had to respond to it even though people have been saying this for so many years in private, and it was hidden in plain sight. Sadly, no one really cared enough to do anything about it. Nobody really listened to them, any one paid attention to them. So if we don't do it now, then when are we going to do it? So I think this has to be the moment that we really capitalize on this and galvanize a proper movement here to say, right, we need to fight for women's equality, in terms of rights as it relates to men and greater society. And of course, within football, which is why there's been such a big cry, to raise the Federation to the ground to get everybody out and to start over to build a brand new structure and organization from within. A space within which the women can feel safe a safe environment, because let's not forget this is a work environment after all, and they have to deal with this on their daily lives.

The fact that he should say they should be held is significant, because it suggests that he wants to go in the way of democracy. And this is important. But he points out; it has to be done with money from allies, since the money that's being used here for the war effort can't be diverted for that. So it's an important concession that he's making to some of his critics who suggested that he might try and hold on to power as a result of what was going on in the country. I think the most important thing that he said to the journalist today speaking to Ukrainian media, though, Becky was more about what he's preparing to ask the United States for now. He'd already been saying these last few days, that he intends for September to be an extremely productive month. He will be asking once again, of course for the weapons that Ukrainian so badly need to help them wage this counter offensive. But he's also saying that he's going to be looking at more security guarantees. And what we learned today from his interview was a little bit more detail about what he intends to ask for. Beyond the questions of NATO accession that we've been talking about so much these last few weeks, what he's going to ask Washington for Becky is an Israel style deal, something that will allow Ukraine to keep up a bilateral agreement with the United States specifically. So you're talking about long term security, guarantees, weaponry, things that will confirm that relationship and give him the kind of guarantees that he believes he needs to stabilize the country and look ahead to its future. Different enemy is set to Israel, same idea. So we'll have to see what the response is to that. I think that was probably the most important thing that came out of the interview today. What we're seeing now is the counter offensive continuing just south of here in Zaporizhzhia. We've just been hearing these last few minutes Becky that across the river in Enerhodar, which is where the Zaporizhzhia power plant is. That is where a drone has just hit a police station the efforts of the Ukrainian resistance. An important reminder that even as Becky, the forces, the regular Ukrainian forces trying to push ahead with that Ukrainian counter offensive making those important dents as they have around places like -- . There are still Ukrainians inside the occupied territories day-in day-out carrying out what actions they can to try and disrupt life there. For that attack no casualties, but a police station evacuated. And again, a reminder that even on the other side of the line, that resistance continues Becky.",

The judge making clear today though, that they're not going to, the Trump team was not going to have two years to prepare for this trial, even though they were arguing that there was so much evidence that they needed that much time to be ready. They've basically been saying that this timeline is rushed. The judge clearly is disagreeing with him here though and saying March 4, 2024 this trial is going to start again, that is very close to when prosecutors from the Justice Department when they are proposing that this trial start just in January.

It's likely that the main opposition party will go to the courts. But again, they have said several times they don't believe the court system are an arbiter. That is anything other than holding what the government wants in that country. Now, that has been again, disputed by both the government and the legal system over the year.

Well, that case happened more than a week ago, after Spain's historic win over England in the Women's World Cup final. The excitement for that win has been overshadowed by the actions of one man and the federation behind him. But the focus shouldn't be on those men. It should be on the players' especially star player midfielder Jennifer Hermoso, the reluctant receiver of the kit. She was crowned a world champion after helping her team to clinch its first World Cup title. Just take a listen to how excited she was after that win. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As unfortunate as it is, this episode is not unique. For many Spaniards it was a stark reminder that the country for all of its progress on gender equality and women's rights still has that macho mentality entrenched in many men's behaviors. Whether it appears in cases of domestic violence that have left nearly 40 women dead in Spain this year, or in everyday life where men still dominate in positions of power. And that is precisely why sport is so important in advancing gender equality. But don't take it from me. Hear it from the world's greatest female player. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
