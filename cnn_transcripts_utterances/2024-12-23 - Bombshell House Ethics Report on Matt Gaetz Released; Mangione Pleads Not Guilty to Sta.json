Thanks so much for joining me today for another hour of CNN NEWSROOM.The US House Ethics Committee has released a damaging report into former US Congressman Matt Gaetz today, a report that many feared might never be made public. The 37-page document lays out what it calls substantial evidence that Gaetz regularly paid for sex and drugs, along with a litany of other highly explosive charges. All of this from the man President-elect trump initially wanted to become the highest ranking law enforcement officer in America. Gaetz has said that his past behavior was, \"embarrassing but not criminal.\" He has also pointed out that the US Justice Department declined to file charges against him. That is true. I spoke with Katelyn Polantz last hour about some of the most damaging findings of the just released report, from what we should note, is a bipartisan committee in Congress. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

All of that put together in this House Ethics report, where the House says they believe that Matt Gaetz engaged in commercial sex, meaning paying for sex with women, statutory rape that is specifically related to the incident in 2017 at a party that summer where he had sex twice, allegedly with a woman who at the time was an underage girl, 17 years old, heading into her senior year of high school. The House believes that may be a violation of Florida law, though Gaetz has not been charged with any crime. The Justice Department looked at some charges on the federal side, declined to bring any case against him. The House also say that -- they also say in this report, they believe Matt Gaetz was using illicit drugs, and so they have compiled this all, not just in a narrative of what they found, documenting the evidence the text messages, the payments that the House has been able to trace, but also testimony they received from more than a half dozen people and that woman who was an underage girl, having sex with him when she was 17. They have all of that together. They also have put out the evidence in the report released today that Matt Gaetz has been unable to stop. He wanted to stop the release of that report.

He takes issue with the fact that the committee was releasing it.Now, the committee did take a vote to decide to put this out there. This report was something that they had been working on for several years of this investigation, essentially picking up the work of the Justice Department after the Justice Department looked at Matt Gaetz, declined to charge him, and then the House Ethics Committee began doing much more in interviewing the witnesses, gathering the evidence, putting together this report, and they are deviating from what the past expectation was here, releasing this after Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. One thing that they found here and Gaetz does deny a lot, if not all of these allegations that the committee has made just flat out saying they are false. They are saying that they did not find any violations of federal sex trafficking by the former congressman. But this is all notable sitting here out in the public when Gaetz is still a prominent person in the conservative movement. He is now on a right wing news network, and then on top of that, he is a person that Donald Trump wanted to have as his attorney general and withdrew just eight days after receiving that nomination just a couple of weeks ago.

There is how AFD is capitalizing on this attack, and then there's the very troubled history and the strange logic that drove the attacker himself, at least as far as we can figure out.So AFD has been already campaigning on decreasing immigration, sending many immigrants back to the countries they came from, especially Muslim immigrants, pulling Germany out of the EU, ending weapons supplies to Ukraine. But it leads with this anti-other, anti-immigrant policy and the current AFD chief, who is the candidate for chancellor in the February snap elections coming up. AFD is doing well in the polls. It is already running second to the Christian Democrats, has already said, look, this person might not have been an immigrant who came in in 2014, but he is from somewhere else. And the overall message is, as they often and say, Germany is for the Germans.

Well, several families of Israeli hostages taken captive by Hamas and still held in Gaza say they have recently received signs of life of their loved ones. The news comes as Israel's prime minister says that \"Certain progress has been made in negotiations to secure the hostages release and a ceasefire in Gaza.\" In remarks in Parliament today, Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas is taking blows while Iran and Hezbollah are licking their wounds. He is vowing that Israel will act against Houthi rebels in Yemen the same way it did against other of Iran's proxies in the region. In Gaza, the director of one of the last functioning hospitals there is making an urgent plea for the world to help before it is \"too late.\" He says that Kamal Adwan Hospital is under constant bombardment, accusing Israel of trying to kill or forcibly displace those inside. Gaza's Health Ministry says the IDF has now placed what it described as explosive robots at the gates of the hospital. Israel denies that, calling it Hamas propaganda. Horrific scenes, though, are emerging from Central Gaza after an Israeli military operation inside a refugee camp there. Authorities say more than 50 people have been killed or injured, all of them civilians. They say 20 residential units were destroyed by Israeli forces.

When ambulance crews were finally able to retrieve bodies, they found cats feeding on them. The video is too graphic to show. The IDF did not respond to requests for comment. In the north of Gaza, the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital says it has been under siege for almost three months. He now says Israel has placed what he describes as explosive robots at the gates of the hospital. On Sunday, the IDF told CNN there had been no strikes in the area in the preceding 24 hours. Against this backdrop, there is renewed optimism about ceasefire talks aimed at securing the release of the hundred or so hostages still being held captive in Gaza. Israel believes around a third of the hostages are dead, but according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, several Israeli families say that they recently received what they describe as signs of life from their loved ones. Any deal, though, would need to be signed off by Hamas and of course, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

So, that's the piece of the allegations of sexual harassment. Then the other big piece here, she says, because she raised these issues and these concerns in an effort to achieve a safer work environment for herself and her employees, but then she was retaliated against. And you ask about the details and the proof. Well, in this lawsuit, there are hundreds of screenshots of text messages between Justin Baldoni's team which Blake Lively's team says proves that they had a sophisticated and coordinated campaign to essentially take her down behind the scenes. Now Baldoni's team is fiercely denying this. They are saying that it is completely normal for publicists to have private communications behind the scenes.

There's some snow on the radar, but most of it's in Ontario and Quebec right now. But we do have winter weather advisories that's way down from winter storm warnings like they have on up in Maine.

San Francisco, even toward Dallas, Fort Worth, maybe for tomorrow with a little bit of rain. But here is the problem. Here is the 8:00 a.m. forecast.

So, 89.7 million drivers will be out there going somewhere this time. The problem, Jim, is that the sun is at the lowest angle of the year. It's called Winter Solstice. It means the days as short as could be. It means the sun is low in the sky. So, if you are traveling this week, please clean the inside of your windshield because that sun's going to be right in your eyeballs and outside I know you have wipers for that, but it's the inside that gets dirty. You don't know why, but it does, and that film on the inside of the window could make your travel a whole lot harder than it really has to be if you just get out there and wipe it off, clean it up. Use some Windex, whatever you need to do. So yes, there'll be some rain. Not a lot of white on the map, I'm afraid so. Not a lot of white Christmases out there. Airport delays, probably New York and even down to Philadelphia because of the icing tomorrow and then some clouds still into San Francisco. But here's where the icing could be. And that's not even a quarter inch, but it's just enough if it's on your roadway. So yes, the forecast for snow accumulation is on up into the north of the Poconos, really on just the Alleghenies, and into the Adirondacks and also the Catskills. Back out west though, let's pay attention to this big snow event. If you're going skiing in Tahoe, you pick the right week.
