He has not, which is so odd because all of the times in the past he argued against people who wouldn't negotiate. As vice president, he put the Biden team together to negotiate on the debt limit.The Democrats have done this every time. When President Trump was in, Nancy Pelosi said, you cannot pass a debt limit without having negotiations on spending. This is how it is happened all of the time before. The senator at the time, Senator Biden, voted four times to raise the debt limit if they did something on the fiscal end. Then the four times that he voted it against it, he only voted against it based upon thinking the economic changes didn't go far enough. So, what has changed, Mr. President? You've gone so far as you won't even negotiate to put America in debt? That is not how the leader of the free world should act. That is not how America wants to you act. You said at the very beginning we had to show you a plan, even though the Democrats have shown no plan. Not only did we show you a plan, we're the only ones to pass a plan. So, I think it is up to you now, whether the economy goes in any trouble, it is you, because the Republicans raised the debt limit. You have not. Neither has Schumer.",

How do you do that? Milton Freeman, one of the greatest economists of all times, says inflation has only started through Washington spending. That is what the Democrats did, harmed every single American. We eliminate wasteful Washington spending to curb inflation. We said we could grow the economy to make us energy independent, to actually cut the red tape so we could build things in America again. We passed HR- 1, we put it in here as well. So, we limit the future spending of Washington, the growth, the president makes some audacious, crazy comments about it and all we're saying is we should spend exactly what we spent four months ago. This president wants to spend more money than we spent during COVID. This president thinks even though he would sign the bill that the pandemic is over, that they should keep the billions of dollars sitting out there that has not been spent, that sat there for two years over COVID. You know what? That is not the president's money. That is the American hardworking taxpayer money and we should pull them back and save them money because it wasn't spent.",

We've said when we put forth HR-1, that we just stand firm to make our energy independent in America and build our economy. We passed that. We looked and said when we watched D.C. decriminalize every form of crime that we stood up the first time in 30 years of Congress to do that and you all asked me the same question, what is going to happen when the Senate stops it? Well the Senate didn't stop it. It passed it. What is going to happen when the president said beforehand, why would you even vote on it, because he wasn't going to sign it, he signed it. When we passed the bill to end the pandemic so we could get back to work again, you said why even do it, the Senate is not going to take it up, the president said he's going to veto, it is law today. So, every question that you continue to raise, you guys have been wrong. You've underestimated us. But the one place that they haven't underestimate? The American public. Why? Because those are the people we're working for day in and day out. And just as it took me 15 rounds to win speaker, the one thing I promised American public, I will never give up on you.

Really, for the past couple of months, Kevin McCarthy trying to put together a coalition within his own Republican conference to get this bill through, getting various factions on board in his narrowly divided conference and ultimately pushing this through the House on the narrowest of margins, passed on a vote of 217 to 215.There were four Republicans who voted against this plan. That is all he could afford to lose. If he lost one more, this bill would have collapsed on the House floor. But he was able to win most of his members. Other than these four, that is Andy Biggs of Arizona, a conservative member, as well as other conservatives, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Matt Gaetz of Florida, and Ken Buck of Colorado. But now that this bill has passed, you heard Kevin McCarthy right there. They are going to make the argument going forward that the House is the only chamber to have passed a bill that would raise the national debt limit. It would do just that, raising it until next year or sometime in March or if it reaches $1.5 trillion more in spending, that is what this bill would do, along with a wide range of spending cuts and conservative priorities, things that he needed to add to the bill in order to get Republicans to support. But the White House, Senate Democrats have already rejected that, Wolf, demanding that the debt limit be increased without any conditions, without any negotiations, whatsoever. So, you're seeing the two sides on completely opposite sides on this issue as we head into a monumental series of weeks here and the potential first ever U.S. debt default could hit as soon as June and talks between the two sides not even occurring, Wolf.",

And the fact that the Republicans believe that this is going to all of a sudden unlock some type of negotiation or meeting with the president and the speaker over the debt limit, that is not the plan on the White House side of things. And if there was any question about that, the president himself addressed it earlier just a few hours before the vote after a press conference with the South Korean president. He was asked if he would sit down with Speaker McCarthy, as they were leading into this vote, the president made it clear, no negotiations on the debt limit, happy to negotiate over longer term issues, not the debt limit.

A board of appointees by DeSantis voted today to nullify an agreement between Disney and the special taxing district that oversees the land around the theme parks. Disney said at this point it had no choice but to file a lawsuit alleging that the governor's office has engaged in a year-long revenge effort to punish the company for opposing that law that you just mentioned.In this lawsuit, Disney alleges, quote, a targeted campaign of government retaliation orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech. Disney is basically saying the state violated its constitutional rights and went after its First Amendment ability to talk about issues without getting punished. [18:40:06] And it is asking a judge to undo a bunch of the actions that DeSantis has taken against the company and give it back its control of its special district. But DeSantis' office is not backing down. They signaled they were going to continue to fight in this battle. They released a statement to us earlier today in which they said, quote, we are unaware of any legal rights that a company has to operate its own government or maintain special privileges not held by other businesses in their state. So, Wolf, This is the latest escalation of this fight. It has been going on for 14 months now, and now it is headed to the courts.",

And that is his pitch to Republican voters. There is an audience for it in the Republican Party.But you have to ask yourself, is he kind of losing sight of the bigger picture here. I understand you can't worry about a general election unless and until you win the primary. But six-week abortion ban, permit-less carry, widespread book bans, classroom censorship and now a death match with Mickey Mouse does not seem like the ideal recipe or menu to recapture the suburban white collar voters who have moved away from the Republican Party and produced three disappointing results for the GOP in the last three elections.",

Yes, he wants to show he's a fighter. It's not that he's Trump without baggage, it's that he'll fight and also win. I think that's the contrast he's drawing, is that I'm going to pursue these things until we actually win them as opposed to just pursue them until I get distracted by something else.",

Three quarters of independents, three quarters of Americans younger than 45, three quarters of voters of color and over 80 percent of whites with a college degree said they did not want a Trump presidency if he is convicted -- a second term presidency if he was convicted of a crime. That is the dilemma. And in a single data point, the party wants to go one way despite all the clear warning signs about what the country thinks about Trump returning to the oval office.",

That is their freedom, personal freedom. That is the word that Republicans try to own. But in the era of abortion bans and book bans and classroom censorship and attempts to influence the behavior of private companies that DeSantis and Trump embody, they have left an opening for Democrats to try to reclaim some of those ideas about who really is standing up for freedom.

Jean Carroll was on the stand for most of the day, testifying about what she says was this alleged rape in addressing them of a New York department store in 1996. Now, at times, her testimony was emotional, but she told the jury in graphic details what she claims happened that night in the spring of 1996.She says that she had a chance encounter with the former president as he, then a New York real estate tycoon, was walking into Bergdorf Goodman department store as she was walking out. She said they engage in some flirtatious banter. He asked for her help buying a gift for someone. She said that they looked at handbags and hats and then made their way to the sixth floor, with a laundry department was. Carroll said that they continue joking and flirting around over whether someone should try on a piece of lingerie. That is when she said things turned violent. She alleges that Trump took her into the dressing room, shoved her up against the wall, closed the door, pulled down her tightened raped her. Now, Trump, of course, has vigorously denied that this rape ever occurred. But Carroll says that the fallout from that was swift. She says that she lost her job after the former president came out with his public denials of this. She also said that she has been criticized by Trump, particularly that she is doing this for political gains and for money. And to that, Carroll's attorney asked to that point directly. Here's what she said. She said, I'm not settling a political score. I'm sending a personal score because he called me a lie repeatedly and it really has decimated my reputation. I'm a journalist. The one thing I have to have is the trust of the readers. And Carroll testified that she lost her job as a columnist at \"Elle\" magazine after Trump called her a liar and said that she made up this alleged assault. She also said received threats and bought bullets for a gun that she owned, given the sort of vitriol that she was receiving. Now, the judge also, outside of the presence of the jury today, addressed this issue. Trump had posted on his social media website, Truth Social, about the trial. The judge had asked all the parties to refrain from doing that. And the judge warned Trump's attorney that his client -- that is, the former president -- may or may not be running close to violating certain U.S. statutes. The judge did not say what they were. But the question here is whether they can get Trump to tamp down some of his rhetoric. His attorneys said that he did talk to his client and will follow with him again -- Wolf.",
