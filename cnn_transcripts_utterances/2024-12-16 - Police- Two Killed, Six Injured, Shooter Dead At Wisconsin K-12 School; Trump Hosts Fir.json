We are coming on the air with breaking news -- all too familiar, a tragic a grim story in this country, another school shooting in America. At least two people killed, multiple people injured after a shooting at abundantly Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin. The shooter, who police believe to be a student at the school, was found dead. CNN's Veronica Miracle joins me now. Veronica, the latest death toll, as we have it is two. Earlier, police had mistakenly said four. Tell us what the latest is. You're learning about the circumstances here, the shooter and the number of casualties.",

And then during the press conference, he was given an update in real time. But it turns out that number was incorrect. It appears that there was some kind of confusion at the hospitals as they were bringing those casualties -- some of the injured, to the hospitals. There was confusion.So what we understand now is that two victims were killed. A suspect was also killed. So that's three people dead and six others are injured. And their injuries range from -- anywhere from minor to life- threatening injuries. So, of course, these numbers could also change as the day progresses. But that is what the police chief has released at this hour. They're not releasing further information about exactly who was killed, whether they were students or staff members. But we do understand that the shooter was a juvenile. So, under the age of 18, a student at the school. But anything beyond that, they're not releasing right now. The chief was very adamant about the fact that they want to notify the next of kin of those who have been killed before they release anything to the media. Throughout the day, we have seen there's a unification center and young children being reunited with their parents. This is a small school, ages -- or grades, rather K through 12. The police chief, visibly emotional during the press conference. Take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is very important. People need to know it. Parents who had not been unified as a then with their kids needed to know the sort of, you know, how, how, how, how big the footprint was, so to speak.And now the investigation begins, in particular, since they know who did it, what kind of hints did he leave? Who might have known were -- were teachers talking about him? And as you know, Jim, sort of in the last couple of years, a new sort of cause of action here in the United States, where prosecutors will examine, the parents were -- were grossly negligent in allowing a -- presumably, a minor access to a gun or possession of a gun, and that will be clearly part of this as we learn more about him.",

You've seen some slightly better background checks on guns, though not yet universal background checks.Is there any evidence that any of those incremental steps taken have made a difference? I mean, the graphs only going in one direction. KAYYEM:  Right. It's very hard to measure preventative efforts, right? So we do know, obviously, that, you know, guns are confiscated from schools. Lots of schools have put up preventative measures, including early intervention as well as the hardening of these places like metal detectors. My understanding is the school today did not have one as well as teacher interventions should they -- should they need it. You also -- you know, Uvalde is sort of the worst of today. I think you saw the best of in many ways of police preparedness for school shootings. You don't wait, you don't -- you just go in. And the police chief talked about that, talked ironically that today was, in fact, a, I think a mass casualty training for the paramedics. This is what they do to prepare. But to be able to measure or did that stop anything? That's very hard. What we do know though is its not going down, and in fact, its sort of it -- sort of ticks up. And it's not just like the Uvalde. It's like these horrible situations where we just had the anniversary of Sandy Hook, you know, these -- these -- these -- these big ones that we remember, these school shootings are represent, you know, one student dead, two students dead. That's an -- that's enough, right? And so we're not -- we're not absorbing them in the way that we might in sort of a greater mass casualty event. This today, if these numbers hold, will not qualify as a mass casualty event in the United States. Its I hate to say it, it's just a school shooting, right. And so will not -- will not be picked up in the statistics about mass casualty, which generally is four or more, not including the assailant.",

So you can get interesting political alliances. I do take some comfort that even if you can't get the weaponry, a lot of research is now being done. Maybe in consequence of the fact that we can't get gun -- significant gun legislation passed in this country about early intervention. It's an area that that actually can be successful if parents and communities are willing to step forward, not simply, yellow flag or red flag laws, but also getting these students, getting these young people, uh, not defending anyone, but who cannot process stress, isolation, bullying in the way that perhaps adults can, the kind of help that they need. I -- I don't believe in the -- in the -- is it mental health or is it the guns? I'm sort of in the all -- all of the above camp, and -- and I suspect we will likely learn that many people had concerns about this student well before what happened today.",

The difficulty is that you put in the hands of school administrators, teachers, fellow students, right, a judgment about a future potential crime, which is a fundamentally difficult thing to do, right?I mean, that's in effect where you're handing the almost the law enforcement responsibility here is for members of the community who are not in law enforcement to make what are extremely difficult judgments.",

The school was relatively small, you know, just the number of kids who we know that there's a crisis in these issues.But you're exactly right that we -- because, you know, every crime has a means and a motive, right? And because we can't get to the means politically, even though the American public is there, the American publics polling is pretty consistent on this, tougher laws of access for -- for people, trying to ban certain guns. We don't know what gun was used in this in this case, we are sort of forced to turn to intervention on the motive, if you can, if you can step in, it's not ideal. You'd have a combination of both. But I think that's what we'll be looking at, given the politics of where this country is headed, next year, that it is unlikely that the Senate and the House would align on anything, let alone the White House voting for it at this stage.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And you know, Pete Hegseth gave up a lot because he was going big places in Fox -- big, big places, a lot of money. I think the Middle East is -- will be in a good place. I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation. I did have a dinner with Tim Cook.

Kennedy is on Capitol Hill today meeting with senators who will ultimately have to vote on whether to confirm him for that cabinet position or not to and defy President-elect Donald Trump. Lets bring in CNN reporter Stephen Collinson. Stephen, before we get to Trump's comments today, I do want to note something that you reminded me during the break, and that is that 12 years ago today, then-President Obama gave a heartfelt address to the nation about those sad events at Sandy Hook at a time when it just really seemed, of course, Congress couldn't fail to act this time in a decisive way.

I want to ask you specifically about what he said about Ukraine, because there's a great deal of speculation and consternation about what he will do regarding Ukraine. Will he end aid? Will he force Ukraine into a deal that perhaps it doesn't want? This line from him: What's happening there, he's describing Ukraine as far worse than people are reporting from both sides. So we're going to do our best and we've been doing our best, and well see what happens. I mean, the both sides line they're given, it is, of course, Russia that invaded the country and is responsible for this war, caught my attention, although it is true that both sides have been suffering enormous casualties of late.

This was a president elect who was predicting that he would solve the Ukraine crisis within 24 hours, even before he became president.So, obviously, things have changed on the ground. I think the big question for a lot of people looking at this, not just in the United States, but Europe, is how do you bring President Putin to the table, given the fact that he appears to be at least on the battlefield right now, notwithstanding severe, you know, economic consequences in Russia, in the ascendancy? Putin isn't just going to come to the negotiating table because Trump wants to do a deal. And how do you how does Trump build some leverage to do that? Some people have even been talking about him continuing arms, you know, exports to Ukraine, even though that doesn't seem very likely from what we know about Trump's temperament and desire to please -- Putin. So this is obviously going to be a lot more complicated than Trump believes. We -- we understand that there were talks about this when he met Emmanuel Macron, the French president, a couple of weeks ago in Paris. The question is how much land does Putin get for what was an illegal invasion of a sovereign, democratic country? And how do you do a peace deal that doesn't lead to the war breaking out again in five years, when Putin has reconstituted his forces? It doesn't seem to me that Trump has thought that through very carefully, although I would say people like his incoming national security adviser, Representative Waltz, Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, these are serious people, and they are thinking about this. But a lot of it comes down to what Trump thinks at any one moment. And it doesn't seem clear that he's got any idea right now how he's going to end this war.",

But it fits in to me -- it fits into a broader pattern and a bigger question, which is what are going to be the guardrails on Trump as he comes back into office? I mean, the circumstances really could not be more different, as I think he alluded to, in his news conference. I mean, when he came in the first time, you had Republican leaders in the House and the Senate, Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell, who were very skeptical of him. You had a Supreme Court that was 4 to 4 at that point with a, you know, very moderate and somewhat unpredictable Republican swing justice in Anthony Kennedy. You had a business community that was much more keeping its distance not clear that any of those barriers are, you know, are really effective going into a second term. They are all clearly weakened, and they are weakened at a time when Trump has run on a more militant and explicit agenda that he himself called, you know, retribution.

I did not go or enter into that crime scene, but if you can imagine, most schools, the students go together, but they are segregated. So, on each different floor and each different group.

I can tell you that our mayor and our county exec has committed resources to not only public health, but also mental health. I can tell you that every teacher that I've ever had contact with at MMSD cares deeply about their students. Every staff member I talked to staff members all the time who tell me things that are going on in the schools and want to do whatever they can, even if it's under anonymity, to let me know that they want to have a safe school.So my reassurance to the public is that if you see something, say something. If you know someone who may be going through a difficult time, please reach out to someone. And I think what I can do is make sure that our police department is transparent and open and honest and inviting for people to call and give information. I think MMSD does an excellent job of that, and the same thing can be said for any other private school.
