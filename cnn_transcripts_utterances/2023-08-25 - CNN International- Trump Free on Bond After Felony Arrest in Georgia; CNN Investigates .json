      "sentences": "Let's bring in Thomas Gift. He's the director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at the University College of London. And he is joining us live this hour from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Thanks for joining us, Thomas. We want to bring up that mug shot again because it's interesting looking at it, isn't it, and the fact that he's actually using it as part of his campaign I thought was pretty interesting. We were under the impression that he would resist having a mug shot taken but he is using it to his advantage now.THOMAS GIFT, CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LONDON: Well good morning, Max and good morning, Bianca. It's great to be with you. You know, this mug shot is certainly going to go down as one of the most iconic images I think of the Trump years and it will mean different things for each side. But from a political perspective, I think this is a real gift for Trump. It's hard to deny. It's basically the perfect visual metaphor for the same story that Trump's been telling over and over, that he is the victim of a partisan vendetta. And I think that he's going to  spin this and he's going to get cute with it -- which he already is posting it on social media, as you suggest, and embracing it. Trump's team discussed what they wanted the photo to look like. He's scowling. So it's all curated I think to some extent. And the photo, it's going to be shared and re-shared especially among right-wing networks. To say nothing to the fact that this, you know, campaign can make all sorts of paraphernalia around it. That is a massive wind fall for the Trump war chest. So absolutely, he's definitely using this to his advantage.",

      "sentences": "Thomas, I apologize for how broad this question is, but we so frequently talk about polarization in American politics. Obviously the higher the stakes get the more the situation with the former president escalates. Surely the deeper that polarization becomes. Because for Democrats, this is considered I think embarrassing that former president is going through this legal process but perhaps a relief that the legal system is doing its job. For Republicans, they often see these charges as completely false. You know, what impact is this having on the fabric of society in the states?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianca, I think, you know, this going to get worse before it gets better. And its basically corruption clashing with the law and the hyperpolarization of American politics as you are suggesting. And it is kind of remarkable, I think to some degree, how routine this has all become. You know, nothing about these primaries or Trump's court cases are typical. So I think it is unclear how the standard rules apply and what this actually means for the fabric of American democracy.We're kind of in this bizarre situation that Trump is winning the GOP primaries by infinity points. He's also facing these four indictments. He's running a campaign essentially outside of a courtroom. And all of his rivals look like they're either gunning for second place or their candidacies are on life support. Plus, it's only August. I think the one thing that we can say about Trump, is that his legal troubles right now are greater than his political troubles as reflected by the fact that his base continues to support him. And because he perceives that, maybe his best chance to obtain immunity or to avoid conviction is to be in the White House in a couple years. I think that that means his political and his legal strategies all morph into one and they get subsumed by the political essentially. So I expect him to continue to double down and to the extent that he does, it has again a sort of reinforcing effect on polarization.",

You know, to a large extent, you know, these indictments have become not a feature of Trump's campaign but they are his campaign. You know, his pitch to Republican voters is essentially I'm the inevitable nominee and I'm the inevitable nominee because you can't abandon me when Democrats are weaponizing the judicial system against us.So Trump is using it to his advantage. And it's almost this paradox where criminal charges are his get out of jail free card politically. And he is betting that these donations and the spikes in poll numbers, continue to keep coming in. You know, Trump right now -- space right now generally when he's just outside of the courtroom. You know, he's talking about the deep state, witch hunt, overzealous prosecutors, Trump hating judges. So indictment number four I think feeds into that playbook. But to the extent that it really does takes direct aim at American institutions, I think it is a big problem.",

Now, aviation experts told us this is highly unusual, and it suggests those on board were trying to stabilize the plane after something happened to it. In other words, the destruction was not big enough to obliterate everyone and everything instantly.POLGLASE (voice-over): Expert opinion is split on what exactly happened, likely an explosion, perhaps a bomb on board or a missile hitting it, or even something else. Whatever it was, was clearly powerful as the plane is visibly falling without a wing. The tail ends up over here, 2.6 kilometers away from where the rest of the debris lands. Videos show fires at the crash site. Some are graphic. Human remains strewn amid the debris. Since then, Russian authorities have taken the bodies away for examination and begun an investigation. But many have already made up their minds as to who they think was behind the Wagner aircraft's violent end. (END VIDEOTAPE) POLGLASE (on camera): Now clearly there needs to be an on the ground investigation into what happened and that will require the cooperation of not only Russia but also Brazil who were the makers of this plane and investigators will need access to the black box. All of this might be quite difficult to obtain. The U.S. is saying there's currently no indication that it was a missile hitting the plane, but clearly, they are exploring other options, potentially a bomb on board the plane as well. And in terms of whether Prigozhin was on this plane, well the U.S. said yesterday they think it is likely. Today U.K. authorities also coming out saying that they think it is highly likely he was on board this plane. And as to whether who was behind it, well, that is still unknown, but President Biden had clear words yesterday. He said there is not much that happens in Russia that Putin is not behind. And I think that really speaks to the international sentiment around this incident.",

He almost came out in panic right at the beginning of that mutiny. He was saying it was a stab in the back, that it was treason, that they would have to crush. And by the end of that day -- end of that day President Putin had given Prigozhin a free ride. A get out of jail. He was allowed as we know for two months to roam around Russia, roam around the world. And that made President Putin look very weak. So everyone knows that as Bill Burns said, he doesn't forget.
