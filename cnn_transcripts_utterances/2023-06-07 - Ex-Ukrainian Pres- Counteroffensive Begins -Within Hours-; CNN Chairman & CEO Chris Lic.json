Now, CNN cannot independently confirm that.With current officials, U.S. and Western officials, are seeing signs though that the long-awaited counteroffensive is actually underway. One senior NATO official noted a substantial increase in fighting on the Eastern Front in the past 48 hours. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is joining us now. What exactly are they seeing that indicates that finally, this offensive has begun?",

      "sentences": "Sara, they're seeing a lot of increased activity that is essentially out of the ordinary for what has been happening over the last several months. Including, as you mentioned, that intensified fighting over the last 48 hours. And what they are seeing essentially is Ukraine beginning to probe more actively Russian defenses and try to figure out where there are gaps where they can try to punch through and essentially create momentum so that larger forces within the Ukrainian military can then move in and try to take more territory.And they're seeing activity in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region between Kherson and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that seems new. They're also seeing increased Ukrainian activity south of the city of Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine, that appears to be a new offensive. But look, the bottom line that we have been hearing from NATO officials, as well as European officials and U.S. officials is that it likely is not going to be something that is announced, right? It's going to be a series of kind of subtle attacks by the Ukrainians to try to punch through various Russian defensive positions in a way that will then allow them to move forward en masse. And so, what we are hearing now from the Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister, actually is that this is going to be a counteroffensive that is going to be taking place at multiple points across the frontline. So again, not just one big kind of moving in in one location, but a series of several different attacks using artillery strikes and ground attacks that the Ukrainians will do to try to throw the Russians off balance and try to test their defensive positions here. Now, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, he has said that he does believe the Ukrainians are very well-prepared for this counteroffensive. Here's what he told CNN earlier this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: I think the Ukrainians are very well-prepared. As you know very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and really around the world have provided training and ammunition and advice, intelligence etcetera. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Police said it was mostly peaceful, except for a small group of people whose behavior they deemed became unsafe.They said they arrested at least three people on various charges including unlawful use of pepper spray and obstructing police in the course of their duties. And they said that their efforts to de- escalate failed. So, after 6:00 p.m., they ordered the crowd to disperse. Now, at that point, the school board meeting was going on and the board unanimously voted to pass their resolution to approve -- to recognize June as LGBTQ Plus Pride Month, which is certainly not the first year they've done that. The district says there's a lot of misinformation that's out there about what is actually taught to elementary students. And to be clear, the schools have been following California state law that's been in place for more than a decade, which requires including the representation -- fair representation of diverse populations when teaching history or social studies. And that includes people in the LGBTQ Plus communities. Here's the superintendent explaining. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
