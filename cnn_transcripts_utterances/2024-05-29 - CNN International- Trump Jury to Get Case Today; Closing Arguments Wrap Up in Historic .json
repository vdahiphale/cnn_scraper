It's 4 a.m. in New York where jury deliberations are expected to begin today in the historic hush money trial of Donald Trump.Both sides wrapped up their closing arguments on Tuesday in the first criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Made for a long day in court, the defense spoke for just under three hours going after the credibility of some witnesses and urging jurors to consider reasonable doubt. Meanwhile, the prosecution spent more than four and a half hours walking the jury through all the evidence and timeline of events. The court heard from nearly two dozen witnesses over 21 days. Trump is required to be in the courthouse today as he has been for the entire trial. The judge says it'll take about an hour to deliver the instructions for the jury and then deliberations will begin. CNN's Kara Scannell has further details on the closing arguments. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This case is not about Michael Cohen, it's about Mr. Trump. The prosecution with the final word to the jury in the Trump hush money trial, the first criminal case ever brought against a former president. Cleaning up some a star witness Michael Cohen's testimony after Trump's defense repeatedly painted him as a liar and thief who the jury could not trust. The defendant chose Michael Cohen as his fixer because he's willing to lie and cheat on his behalf, lead prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said. Mr. Trump chose Mr. Cohen for the same qualities that his attorneys now urge you to reject his testimony because of it. The Manhattan District Attorney accuses Trump of conspiring to undermine the 2016 election by illegally falsifying business records to conceal a payment Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her quiet about an alleged affair. Her story is messy, it makes people uncomfortable to hear but that's kind of the point. That's what the defendant did not want the American people to see, Steinglass said, referring to Stormy Daniels. It turned out to be one of the most valuable contributions anyone ever made to the Trump campaign, Steinglass told the jury, while ticking through evidence of another catch-and-kill deal involving former Playboy model Karen McDougal when Cohen recorded a conversation with Trump.",

So it has to be something where you're so firmly convinced as to the guilt of Donald Trump in order to get beyond that hump of beyond a reasonable doubt.

The IDF says it's a strike targeting two senior Hamas officials may have unintentionally set off weapons stored in a nearby compound, which then caused the fire. A CNN analysis of the video from the scene shows Israel used U.S.-made munitions. Two more strikes in Gaza have killed at least 29 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and witnesses report seeing Israeli tanks deep inside Rafah's city center for the first time in this war.

The Israeli military has said that they were carrying out aerial surveillance of this area ahead of that strike. And despite that, of course, that strike continued to go on, despite the number of civilians there. Take a listen to what Daniel Hagari had to say yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADMIRAL DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Despite our efforts to minimize civilian casualties during the strike, the fire that broke out was unexpected and unintended. The strike was conducted using two munitions with small warheads suited for this targeted strike. We're talking about munition with 17 kilos of explosive material.

We've heard from weapons experts who have been speaking to CNN saying that while these precision weapons munitions are designed to be used at pointed targets, any use of munitions in such a densely populated area carries the risk of, of course, civilian casualties. And that is certainly what we saw.

We've heard from the U.N. ambassador for France saying that it is high time for the U.N. Security Council to take action and to adopt a new resolution. Of course, this comes less than a week after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its assault, its operation and offensive in Rafah.

It is being moved back to the port of Ashdod in Israel, where it is going to be undergoing repairs that are going to take at least a week, according to the Pentagon deputy press secretary.Now, this pier project has been really beset with issues since it became operational just over a week ago. It was originally delayed because of bad weather conditions, and then last weekend, army vessels that were attached to the pier were actually also impacted by heavy seas and bad weather conditions and were beached along the coast of Israel and Gaza. And so this has been a very complex mission, one that involved over 1,000 U.S. troops constructing it over the last two-plus months off the coast of Gaza. And it only became operational a little over a week ago. And in the span of a short amount of time, really, the Pentagon insists that they did manage to get over 1,000 tons of aid into Gaza, something that they say made the project worth it alone. But still, this is a very, very expensive mission, costing over $320 million, and of course, a very risky one, involving this 1,000-plus U.S. troops right there off the coast of Gaza and potentially in harm's way. So it remains to be seen just when this pier is going to be back up and running. But the Pentagon says they do expect to put it right back where it was over the last week and hope that it becomes fully operational again within the next several days, if not about a week from now. But again, you know, this is a mission that aid groups were deeply skeptical of. They want to see those land routes open rather than just this maritime corridor. But the Biden administration, for its part, insisting that this maritime aspect of this humanitarian mission was always meant to be supplemental to those land routes and not replace them entirely. And as of right now, they say it is working, at least partially, to get much-needed humanitarian supplies into Gaza. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, at the Pentagon.
