Hello and welcome back to this special edition of \"Connectthe World\" we'll have all the latest updates from the FIFA 2022 World Cup for you in just a moment. First, though, as you would expect from us important news updates to bring you and we begin with a new wave of Russian attacks across Ukraine and more reports of loss life and power also a lack of water there. Ukrainian energy firm says every region of the country is now seeing power outages after the strikes hit critical infrastructure. Kyiv authorities say three people including a 17-year-old girl were killed when one of those missiles hit a residential building. The Mayor says part of the city is in the dark and that there is currently no water, he adds more than 30 missiles flew towards the city today 21 of them was shot down. Now this is all coming hours after a Russian strike in the Zaporizhzhia region where authorities say a maternity ward was hit and a newborn baby there was killed. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Odessa and he joins us live from there now. Matthew, let's start with the capital I know you're not there. We've just been reporting on the strikes that were directed at the city, some of which were taken out. How bad is the situation as you understand it now in the capital?",

But where the missiles struck I mean, there's obviously scenes of devastation, I've seen the video from there. And there are, you know, small fires that are continued to be burning. And of course, a residential block appears to have been struck in this attack with at least three people who have been killed. And so that fits into a pattern of missile strikes that have been coming from Russia hitting various cities and of course, targeting first and foremost the energy infrastructure projects or facilities in those cities in order to disable them. And that's been relatively effective in the sense that it's caused power cuts and a loss of heat and lighting across many areas of the country. I'm talking to you now from Odessa in the south of Ukraine, you can tell you look, I mean, it's a completely pitch black city, what is it just about six o'clock at night here, local time and any lights on, across the whole of the city. People have their own generators, of course and so they're doing that, you know, as much as they can too for their own personal need but in general that the city is an almost total darkness. We've seen another attack taking place as well in various places, but one particularly in which you refer to in Zaporizhzhia, which struck a maternity clinic, in which a two year old sorry, a two day old baby was killed in an attack. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble of those maternity clinic absolutely terrible scenes there. And yet another tragedy to pile on top of the kind of countless tragedies that we've been witnessing in this conflict and of course the situation is not showing any signs of improving because those missile strikes taking out power systems at a time when demand for energy as we approach the winter as we continue in the winter it gets much, much higher Becky.",

What's your response to those? AL-FAISAL: Where do you see the numbers, - don't lie. We hosted our first Boxing International match in 2018. And at the time, we had only six teams in Saudi that had boxing, today we have 57. And the increase of participants grew by 300 percent. That's by just hosting one event. So we host these events to showcase to the Saudis what the international standard is. And they can be part of that, because they see it in front of their eyes. And the participation has grown or had grown in the past couple of years. Our target for 2030 was 40 percent of Saudis to participate in sports half an hour or more a week, we've reached to 48 percent in 2022. So that showcases that the country is active.

And this is a Germany side, who their coach Hansi Flick sat down yesterday. And he said, we need to be really careful that we don't do an Argentina, and that they talked as a team about the importance of getting off to a good start for the mentality and the momentum going forward. Because that was where they felt they went wrong four years ago, but this is a Japan side who have a sort of their squad of 26, who play their football in Germany, a lot of them play around Europe. They know this team; they know how to play this team. And they have a point to prove themselves and they've got a little bit of added motivation. Their coach was involved in it now infamous match that took place here in Qatar, which meant that Japan missed out on the World Cup in 1994. It was called the tragedy of Doha. And they've used that as motivation heading into this. And there's a lot of talk about turning that tragedy into triumph. And they've certainly got off a good start.",

When FIFA said that if that happens, teams and players would be punished with yellow cards, the UAFA working group for human rights then said we're angry at this. But we will look at what else we can do. And Germany is the first team who have come out and actually taken that step. And this is what they've opted to do. They issued a really, really strong statement, basically saying, this is not about making a political statement. Human rights are non-negotiable. This should be taken for granted.
