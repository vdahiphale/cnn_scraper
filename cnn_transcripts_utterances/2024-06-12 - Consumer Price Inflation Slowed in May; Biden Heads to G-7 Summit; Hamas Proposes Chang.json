      "sentences": "Yes, John, it may be summer outside, but it is cooling off in the inflation report, at least this inflation report. So, this is CPI, the Consumer Price Index. And what it shows is a better-than-expected measure on really every level, John. So, let's talk about headline annual inflation. That came in at 3.3 percent. This index increasing at 3.3 percent. That is better than we saw the month prior. That is better than economists were expecting when you look at it on a monthly basis.Now, we haven't seen a figure like this since July of 2022, I want to say, and so inflation did not increase on a monthly basis. You like to see that. Now, CPI is a basket of goods and services. And the government sort of measures the price difference over time. And so that's what we're talking about here. But, John, even if you were to remove the volatile categories, categories like food, categories like energy, you get what's called core inflation. And this is a better underlying indicator of inflation and what the Federal Reserve has control over. That also came at better-than-expected, both on a headline annual basis and on a monthly basis. Really quickly to talk about some of the sectors, which we're showing you here, gas prices, energy prices, those fell. Food prices did tick up slightly, ever so slightly. And shelter, which has been especially stubborn, has also increased in the month, which it continues to do. Now, let me tell you why futures are popping on this news, are so happy about this news. Investors welcoming this news with open arms because, John, as you might remember, earlier this year, we had a string - not sure if the Dow was correct because a moment ago when I saw the Dow it was actually up about 220 points. So, we'll work on that for you. But the reason why futures were largely up, at least they were a few moments ago, is because we had gotten a string, report after report after report, whether it was inflation, whether it was the labor market, that was coming in stronger than expected. And what that did, those hot reports, essentially through water on the idea that we might see rate cuts anytime soon. And so you get a report like this, I'll pull it up here, you get a report like this from the BLS, which suggests that, OK, inflation is starting to cool again. It is starting to accommodate and be accommodating. Well, that then puts rate cuts back on the table. There are four rate meetings the rest of this year after this meeting. We will obviously here from Jay Powell in about six hours. But after this meeting, there are four meetings. And so, do we see more than one rate cut again? And so it just makes that conversation more active again because after these really hot inflation reports, it started to feel like, well maybe we won't get any rate cuts, or maybe we will only get one. And so we're back in the game, John. For all of those who were hoping for a rate cut, they are back in the game after a report like this.",

And obviously Israel gets a lot of international criticism, and understandably so because of all the civilian casualties being inflicted in Gaza.But let's listen to what Secretary Blinken, President Biden, and other G-7 leaders are saying, which is that right now the fault lies with Hamas. They could stop the war tomorrow if they would just agree to these ceasefire terms. They refuse to do so because, as Nic Robertson was pointing out, there's every indication that the Hamas leadership thinks it's in their interest to see more dead Palestinians, because that puts more pressure on Israel.",

But keeping it all in perspective, there are also a lot of countries where the far-right did not do so well. And at that end of the day, the far-right is stilled only going to be something like the fifth largest party in the European parliament. It's still the center right and the center left, which are the largest party.

It's just a coincidence that right now this case of Hunter Biden will be proceeding on appeals as the U.S. Supreme Court is clarifying the rules for when a defendant can challenge a federal gun regulation. Right now the justices are resolving just what those standards should be. And the whole ordeal at the court traces to a ruling two years ago that greatly expanded Second Amendment gun rights. The justices ruled in a way that said that a gun regulation could be upheld only if it's part of America's historical tradition of firearm regulation. That is a very high standard to make - meet, and it's also a confusing standard for lower court judges who have tried to look at, you know, what about gun possession for someone who was a drug addict or a drug user, as in Hunter Biden's case, or in the case the justices are deciding right now, what about someone who is subject to a domestic violence restraining order and under federal law would be prohibited from owning a firearm. That individual, a man by the name of Rahimi, has challenged the case that the justices are now deciding. And, John, they could even give us an answer as soon as tomorrow. And the question is, how does that standard from two years ago tie to the historical tradition of firearm regulation play out now for what you would think would be more modern regulation. For example, for someone subject to a domestic violence restraining order. So, we'll get more clarity from the justices on that part of federal firearms law. But at the same time, there's also a case up there that really is similar to Hunter Biden's, where a defendant is challenging a part of the federal law that prohibits gun possession for someone who either was a drug user or addicted to drugs at the time. And a lower court has ruled that under the Supreme Court's test of two years ago, that federal law cannot be enforced. The federal government is defending that law in the case of another defendant, not at all related to the Hunter Biden case. But as you can see, John, however the justices begin to clarify this will affect how Hunter Biden might be able to appeal his gun conviction. John.",

I think that it's just - it's reality.There are - there are - two things can be true here, Kate. You know, Donald Trump was found guilty by a jury in New York, which, you know, was overwhelmingly voted against Donald Trump in the general election, and Hunter Biden was found guilty in a state where his family is loved and beloved. I mean, you saw the jurors - the jury pool here. Lots of folks and, you know, ties to the Biden family, and he was convicted. So, I don't believe that the statement by the - by the speaker is a hundred percent correct, that there are two systems of justice here. I think this case kind of illustrates that point. If the president had something to do with it, you think he'd let his son, his - you know, he's lost one son to a tragic death and he's got a son now whose faced some serious, serious, you know, substance abuse issues.
