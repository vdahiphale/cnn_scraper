The Pentagon says an American contractor was killed and five U.S. service members injured when an Iranian-made drone struck a base in Northeastern Syria. The U.S. then retaliated with an airstrike to the south. This is video posted online that reportedly captures the strike on one facility linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in Syria.

And we are told that this drone, this suspected Iranian drone that targeted that coalition military base in Northeastern Syria, it was a -- quote -- \"suicide drone.\" It was used kind of as a one-and-done-type drone just to attack and then depart. And we are told that the U.S. did retaliate, of course. They did target facilities inside Syria that they believe that the Iranian proxy groups were using in order to store munitions, as well as gather intelligence. And this is not the first time that the U.S. has targeted Iranian proxy groups in the region. It has been done many times before, including as recently as August of 2022, when President Biden ordered yet another strike on Iranian groups in Syria. But this is happening with -- well, this is happening very often now. And that is what is really concerning to the United States, because the U.S. has about 900 U.S. troops in Syria who are part of the anti-ISIS coalition. And so the U.S. has been trying to deter Iran from carrying out these strikes. But, at the same time, the U.S. does not want an escalation with Iran, and they certainly do not want a war.

The grand jury is going to be reconvening on Monday. And in another criminal case encircling the former President, Trump's defense attorney Evan Corcoran is testifying today to a grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents investigation. Corcoran will not be protected by attorney-client privilege, after the Justice Department convinced a federal judge that Trump's interactions with Corcoran were part of a possible crime or fraud. With me now is CNN senior political correspondent and the anchor of \"INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY\" Abby Phillip. Abby, how significant is Corcoran's testimony here today for the special counsel's probe?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Brianna.I think it's very significant. I start from the place of understanding that, when we talk about former President Trump as a defendant, he is someone who is not like a lot of other modern-day defendants. He doesn't e-mail. He doesn't often have much of a paper trail. He doesn't use text messages in the same way, historically, as other people might today. And so what you're trying to establish what he was thinking, what he asked people to do, what he may have ordered them to do, it's really important to speak to the people who he would have given that information to. And I think, in this case, his attorney would be at the center of this. And on top of that, you're talking about trying to -- I think the government is trying to determine whether Trump played a role in trying to obscure their knowledge of what was in Mar-a-Lago, what documents were there, how many were there, and whether they were trying to hide that from the government. And the fact that they were able to get a judge to approve a crime- fraud exception, I think, says quite a lot about what they were able to show in court that would necessitate this kind of order.",

      "sentences": "Well, I hate to see them move forward as the first case being the hush money case. It doesn't mean that what happened in that case was -- that there was nothing wrong with it. There clearly appears to have been something wrong.But the issue for me is that that's a misdemeanor charge, and that they are having to think at this point about how to charge that in a certain way and present certain evidence to actually make it a felony. And I hate to see what I think is probably the weaker of the cases move forward first, because that oftentimes has a tendency to create bad law that can hurt good cases. I liked the idea and I appreciate the fact that Jack Smith's special cast is moving forward quickly. By all accounts, he's got both feet on the gas. And that's going to be an important thing as we go. I think those cases, because of the sort of the nationwide jurisdiction that he has, the ability to look at all that, those, to me, strike me as the stronger cases. Then, of course, you have got the Georgia case. And the district attorneys trying to make a decision about which, if any charges, she will proceed, given the special grand jury's recommendation. Again, she's not bound by that. She doesn't have to do a thing if she doesn't want to. But all indications are that she will move forward with some indictment. We just don't know against which defendants or what charges specifically. She has a very clear case, I think, as it relates to the phone call to Raffensperger. That's another strong case. But, again, we get into a situation where I just think from a -- maybe a historical perspective, and also as we think about looking forward, given the nature of this type of action, that there's some comfort in the idea of a nonpartisan special counsel looking at bringing charges, if those charges are in fact going to be brought, against a former president of the United States, not because it's Trump, but because I think about what happens 50 years from now. Are we going to have local prosecutors indicting presidents when they leave office, or are we better off having a system that sort of centralizes that from an apolitical point of view?",

This is just what he does. He goes up to a line. And he -- it's a line that doesn't exist for any other politician, but he doesn't cross it. And he also causes a lot of his Republican friends on Capitol Hill to suddenly not have seen anything on TRUTH Social or not have their glasses on them at the time when reporters address them.

There are fears of its collapse that are rippling throughout the banking system. American bank stocks are mixed on the news. And right on cue, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is holding a closed- door meeting with regulators about all of this turmoil that we're seeing here. Let's discuss this now with Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi. Mark, thank you for being with us here. This isn't what we wanted to see, right? Deutsche Bank's stock down more than 8 percent when markets closed in Europe. It's echoing what happened with Credit Suisse earlier this month. How fragile is the global financial system right now? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Well, there's a lot of angst out there, Brianna, understandably. It's been a difficult two weeks in the global financial system, a number of failures, and, of course, what happened with Credit Suisse. And so I think this just reflects a general angst among investors, folks that own stocks in banks and bondholders that invest in the bonds of these banks. And you can see it in the borrowing the banks are doing at the Federal Reserve, the discount window borrowing, the borrowing against their new credit facility, the bank term funding facility. You can see it in the borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks system. You can see it in the borrowing at central banks with the Fed. So the system is obviously under a lot of stress.

Over in Europe, the Swiss Central Bank and other governments are standing firmly behind their institutions. So I don't think there's any concern about this -- the banking system in general. But if you're a shareholder or stockholder in these companies, or if you're a bondholder, and you have lent money to these companies, there's -- I think there's some concern there about the -- not only about the viability, but more so about the long-term growth prospects in the context of the things that are going on.
