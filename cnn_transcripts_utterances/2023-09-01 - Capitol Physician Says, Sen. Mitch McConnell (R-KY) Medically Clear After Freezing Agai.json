Joining us now is the editor of the National Review, Rich Lowry. Rich, I appreciate your time because I think it's important to point out to people that McConnell is often a lightning rod in conservative circles. He's often a convenient punching bag for kind of the far right conservatives of the party. You guys are not that traditional with McConnell. You had a call in 2020 that McConnell world was very pleased with, the title, I think, was McConnell, master of the Senate, kind of walking through the way he operates and why he's been successful, from your perspective.

Now, this isn't an urgent crisis. It doesn't need to happen today or tomorrow or next week, but we think he needs to make the decision that it's time to step aside and then set the wheels in motion. And I'm sure he thinks -- as you know, he thinks carefully about everything. He probably has shrewd thoughts about how actually to carry it out.

But he's not the only old political leader in the United States, right? We have Joe Biden, who I think at the moment, is not in the kind of shape that you would want for Senate leader, but is in the most demanding job on the planet.And we're urging McConnell and Republicans to be realistic about this but the entire Democratic Party has their heads in the sand about state of Joe Biden, who is really declining in front of our eyes.

They are planning to double down in Iowa, double down in New Hampshire, double down in South Carolina, but, B, it also shows that the original belief that Ron DeSantis was going to come in and just kind of really take it to Trump has not materialized.
