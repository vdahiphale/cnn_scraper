We'll have much more on the trial coming up, including the latest. But first, we do have breaking news out of the Middle East as Hamas has agreed to the cease-fire proposal from Egypt and Qatar. The U.S. and Israel say they are now reviewing it as we await their response. People of Gaza -- they're already celebrating the news as you see here, while hostage families took to the streets demanding that Israeli leaders accept the deal as well. This possible agreement comes after Israel's military ordered thousands in eastern Rafah in Gaza to evacuate immediately. That is where an offensive has long been threatened. Let's bring CNN's Nic Robertson in for more. So, Nic, we've seen this and you cover this very closely back and forth on these negotiations for some time, they stalled on the weekend as a mosque demanded that Israel commit to end the war entirely. Then we had the continuing threat of the Israeli invasion of Rafah. Let me ask you this. Hamas says it has agreed. The U.S. says it is still reviewing that response. We're not quite sure of Israel's response. Can you give us the state of play?",

He's got his right flank saying that the government will fall if he agrees.

At the same time, that report said that there were -- Israel has not provided any evidence about the allegations about UNRWA somehow being infiltrated by Hamas.

But at this point, it's unclear just whether the embassy is having any success and actually getting access to him. But obviously this is just one of several Americans that Russia currently has detained in its prison system, including Paul Whelan and Evan Gershkovich. And so, it's going to be very tough, likely for the U.S. to get him released, particularly because of course he is a U.S. soldier. He is very possibly valuable for that reason.

We are back live at 100 Center Street in Lower Manhattan for the eighth day of testimony in former President Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial. Today's focus has been on following the money. On the stand now is Deborah Tarasoff, an accountant for Trump Organization, who helped arrange the monthly payments wired straight from Trumps personal account, and this is key, to his then attorney Michael Cohen, transfers that began after Trump was in the White House. She was following her boss, Trump Organization bookkeeper Jeffrey McConney, who testified this morning. Plus, the judge ruling another violation of Trump's gag order. The judge fined Trump for the tenth time after he publicly disparage the jury pool in a radio interview. He said that Trump is now hereby put on notice, that's a quote, that jail time is on the table if he does not fall in line and follow the gag order. CNN's Jessica Schneider is following this all and solid joins me now. Jessica, the testimony today you could say it's the receipts, right, following the money trail here, but significant, is it not, because you have employees of Trump Organization saying this was money that came out of Trump's personal account.

Now, we talked a lot about the fact that Donald Trump has a lot of money that he's a billionaire. Donald Trump does not like parting with money. He's very involved as we've seen through this trial in every kind of transaction that involves his money. So, he doesn't like the fact that he's had to pay the money. The other part of this, of course, is the fact that the judge has now threatened this potential jail time. We can also talk all about the fact that Donald Trump had taken these mug shots and then use them for political gain and fundraising as well as trying to get up his poll numbers. The fact, is the Donald Trump when he went to go take that mug shot, said that he was basically humiliated, that they believed that this was beneath him to have to actually take this mugshot and the idea of him sitting in jail is not something that Donald Trump wants to do. Now, I will say that if it does end up happening, he, of course, will claim that he is like Nelson Mandela, which is what he has said in the past already, these mean politically persecuted, but up until then, Donald Trump does not want to pay any more money or sit in jail. So the, the big question is whether or not he can actually control himself because that's really what this all comes down to. He's been briefed by his lawyers. He has been putting some of his actual posts in front of them for he pulls the trigger on them trying to make sure that they fall underneath this gag order, which so far they have. But again, Donald Trump is quick to just put out what he's thinking. So, whether or not you can actually control himself, that's the real question.",

He was particularly concerned about female voters. He was concerned how they would respond if the story of him having an affair with Stormy Daniels got out, right before the election so showing that all of this is happening, right after he is indeed elected president is the part of the prosecutions case. And another thing I think was important today was the irregularity of these payments. So Stormy Daniels payment by Michael Cohen was $130,000, yet the pavement to Michael Cohen is much more than almost three times that amount. Actual testimony that some of the money was used to pay for his taxes related to the $130,000. So we know in a typical legal bill situation, lawyers don't get paid the taxes for the legal fees that they charge their clients.

He's attacked the judge, but he is remained in compliance with the gag order as it relates to the witnesses and the jurors. And I think it's because of the sturdiness and the rules that have been set by this judge. Obviously, that's the only way to control Donald Trump and the behavior that he's demonstrated in all of these criminal proceedings.",

Now, whether or not that will be sufficient for Netanyahu to avoid not going into the Rafah is anyone's best guess. But at the moment, even while these negotiations were ongoing and people were calling on the negotiations to be successful and hostages to be returned home to their families, and evading the eventuality of an invasion into Rafah with a widespread massacre, which is what the Belgian foreign minister I believe said would happen today, they were still saying we're going to go on into Rafah one way or the other, deal or no deal. So the question is, should we take Netanyahu at his word or not?",

I mean, U.S. officials have been saying in recent days and weeks that they're not convinced that Netanyahu will stick to that commitment, that some of those statements are meant for domestic political consumption. We know that U.S. officials have put pressure on Israel to at least limit its operations inside Rafah.Is there -- do you find it plausible that Israel could limit operations inside Rafah to the extent that negotiations continue? Or does any sized operation in Rafah effectively killed the negotiations? So, one point that I'd just like to clarify here, there's no real American pressure on Israel when we say pressure, what were talking about is rhetoric as strong rhetoric from the White House in terms of, you know, don't go in without a plan for evacuation of civilians, don't do this, don't do that. But in terms of pressure, there's not being the slightest bit of leverage that is being used by the United States to hold Israel back over the past seven months, including on this operation, when it comes to the provision of weapons, when it comes to the U.N. Security Council and political cover.",

But generally speaking, over the past seven months, it's been very clear the United States has been low to use any actual leverage. It has so pressure here is really limited to rhetoric (ph).When it comes to the negotiations and being successful while an operation is going on, you know, you could look into this of one of two ways, over the last few weeks, there have been operations already ongoing in Rafah. Dozens of people dying on a daily basis and we've seen that according to the United Nations and others, where the humanitarian situation is already in a very abysmal state, where famine and starvation is all around the Rafah and Gaza, and yet the negotiations have continued. So I think that that its very possible that it will continue, that they will continue until it goes past a certain point where the Israelis say, were not doing negotiations anymore.",

What we can't say that they were responding to the actual statement from the Israeli prime minister's office when they were saying that they're not going to characterize the deal that has been agreed to by Hamas and they're going to be in discussions with their partners -- of course, the Israelis, the Egyptians, and also the Qataris. [15But now that we have Israel coming forth and making this pronouncement, but also saying that they're going to be sending some mid-level folks to continue negotiations on this front, we'll have to watch and see what the U.S. assessment of the Hamas response actually is here. Even though the Israelis are saying it wasn't the same as what they put on the table. It seems that the door hasn't been completely closed on negotiations going forward, so we're just going to have to watch and see what U.S. officials say in the coming hours really on this. It's noteworthy that the CIA Director Bill Burns is in Qatar right now and State Department and the White House were very clear to say that he is working on this in real time with those folks who are the mediators, the Egyptians, the Qataris, were speaking with Hamas and then, of course, with the Israelis as well -- Jim.",
