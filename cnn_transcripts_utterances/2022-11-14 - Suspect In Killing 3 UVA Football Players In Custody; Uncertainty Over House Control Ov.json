Now, university police said that at 10:40 last night, they responded to shots fired call near a parking garage. We now know those shots were fired on a charter bus packed with students who had just returned from a field trip.",

Well, one, he was a student here, the three dead were students here, the two injured here -- were students here -- students here, the three dead were all juniors all on the football team here at UVA. But I want to show you guys what's happening here right now. The bus that they were on -- that they were all on and where it sounds like all of this took place, they're getting ready to move it now. The state police had a vehicle in there that they were going through all the forensic material in there. And now they have that bus hooked up to a tow truck and they are going to move it.We know that Christopher Jones, 22 years old, was picked up about 75 miles from here near Richmond, Virginia, and Henrico County by police there without incident, about 13 hours after all of this started. Witnesses tell us that they heard -- people who are close to that bus last night around 10:30, 10:15 or so said that they heard gunshots on the bus and then everybody exiting that bus. It was coming back from -- they're watching a play in Washington, DC, they were coming back onto campus you know 10:30 p.m., on a Sunday evening just a normal day, and then this. Just shocking to hear how normal the situation was and then to hear witnesses say that they heard those gunshots on that bus, people then tumbling out of it getting off of there, three people killed on that bus all young men with their lives ahead of them, two others injured, one in good condition, one in critical condition, so let's hope that that last one makes it. But all part of the football team here as well. The suspect in this, Mr. Chris -- Mr. Jones was also part of the football team back in 2018. It doesn't appear that he ever played on any games. And it doesn't appear that he was on the team in the last year or two but just shocked that it's happened yet again on yet another American Campus. Back to you, guys.",

Republicans thought they would sweep the midterms, that they would be in the power in the Senate, and that they would have a significant majority in the House. Instead, they are in the minority in the Senate for the next two years and they're looking at a very narrow House majority, assuming that they do get the majority, which seems likely at this point.But still, the fact that is very likely going to be a narrow Republican House Majority as a problem for Kevin McCarthy because on the floor of the House in January, he needs to get 218 votes to become a speaker. If they have a majority of say 220 seats or so that they lose a heavy -- they lose a handful of defectors, hardliners who are already threatening to vote against him, that could be enough to complicate his bid to center the speakership. Later this afternoon, House Republicans meet behind closed doors to start to discuss their way forward. And then tomorrow, the House Republicans will actually vote to nominate their choice for Speaker. At that meeting, we do expect a potential challenge from the right. One person who was mentioned, Congressman Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, in an effort to try to show that McCarthy does not have the votes right now to get to become a speaker forcing him to make negotiation -- make some concessions to that hard light -- hard-right faction. On the Senate side, Mitch McConnell does have the votes to become leader once again. But there are a number of conservatives who are saying, hold on, let's hit the brakes, let's not move forward on this leadership election on Wednesday because of their concerns that this election did not go the way they wanted. But at the moment, House -- the Senate Republican leaders are plowing ahead, plan to have that vote on Wednesday, and we'll go behind closed doors to hear those concerns tomorrow afternoon, guys.",

Democrats would need 14 more to give them the majority. So, if you look at this map here, that means the Democrats would have to hold on. I can actually show you the uncalled races. There are 19 uncalled races, every race has got a color here has yet to be called. The Democrats would need to hold all the blue ones and flip four of these red ones to blue in order to maintain control.And it's tough to find the numbers right now. There are a couple of very close races in California. This race here, just 84 votes separate the Republican John Duarte and Adam Gray, only 46 percent. And that could really go either way, a tossup. California's 22nd District David Valadao, he's up by nearly 3000 votes, but only 39 percent, some of the votes that's been coming back skews democrats. This is really a tossup also at this point. But that's where it stops for the Democrats and gets much harder largely because of what we're just seeing, frankly, over the last 24 hours and in some cases the last hour in Arizona, this seat right here, David Schweikert, the Republican is ahead by 894 votes. But Saturday, the Democrats actually lead here. You can see over the weekend, more votes were counted there and that is now skewing toward the Republicans. Also in Arizona, down here, Arizona's 6th congressional district, we just received new vote counts 30 minutes ago from here. And John -- Juan Ciscomani has expanded his lead from about 7700 to 2074. So, he lead -- his lead seems to be growing incidentally. If you want to look at the governor's race there in Arizona, since we're talking about Arizona, the Democrat Katie Hobbs leads by 24,772 over Kari Lake, but that lead narrow because of the same vote counts that just came into the congressional race it had to do with Pinal County, which is a Republican county. They got about 3000 new votes in there. And Kari Lake picked up about 1000. She was able to close the gap by about 1000 votes in Arizona, guys.",

They have an understanding, but no agreement -- no overlap.China is not going to stop menacing Taiwan. They're not going to ease up on their human rights abuses of the Uyghurs and the Hong Kongers and the Tibetans. They're not going to stop their unfair trade practices. In fact, everything that was in trouble about the U.S.- China relationship yesterday is even-- it's going to get worse over the next weeks and months. That's my prediction, frankly. Now, the headline for today is like, OK, well, at least we're talking to each other. That's good. There's no doubt that we have to understand each other. It's great that they can sit down. In that system, Victor, Xi Jinping is the only man with power. He just consolidated power. He's going to be a dictator for life.
