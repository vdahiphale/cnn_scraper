Now, he worked with MichaelCohen, Trump's former personal lawyer, you'll remember. Prosecutors are asking him to go over banking regulations. This, after Trump's former assistant took the stand. Now, Rhona Graff's testimony was brief, but impactful. She revealed that she saw Stormy Daniels in Trump Tower before his 2016 campaign. Graff assumed Daniels was there to discuss being cast in Trump's reality show, \"The Apprentice.\" Graff said she kept contact information for both Daniels and Karen McDougal, the model who also alleges an affair with Donald Trump. Now, I want to alert everyone on the left-hand side of your screen, you we will see key updates from the trial ongoing at this hour. There are no cameras allowed in the proceedings, but CNN has reporters inside the courthouse behind me. They're keeping us up-to-date, so just have a look at that side panel and we will parse everything going on as we see it and hear it. Zachary Cohen is doing that for us as well in Washington. Now, Zachary, David Pecker, the National -- the former head of \"National Enquirer\" just finished his testimony after quite a few days, and yet we moved on to what I just described as impactful testimony from Trump's former assistant. What did Miss Graff had to say and how is that supposed to contribute to the prosecution's case?",

She was somebody who managed his calendar, somebody who managed his contacts for the Trump Organization, somebody who was really just always around Donald Trump, both in his office, outside of his office, heard and observed things about Donald Trump while he was at Trump Tower and she confirmed and testified today under subpoena, by the way, she made very clear she did not want to be there today. But she confirmed that Donald Trump was working out of Trump Tower in January 2017. That's a key timeframe that prosecutors are trying to establish that Trump met with David Pecker to discuss these catch and kill transactions. She was also able to confirm, too, that she as you mentioned, saw -- remember seeing Stormy Daniels, the porn star at the center of this hush money case at Trump Tower before Donald Trump's presidential campaign. When questioned by defense attorneys who picked up on this after the prosecution was done, she was asked why she thought that Stormy Daniels was there and she said that she assumed it was because she was interviewing or applying for a role on \"The Apprentice.\" She said that -- made very clear that that was her assumption, but still this observation and this testimony about Stormy Daniels being physically present at Trump Tower before Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Also, the introduction of calendars, the introduction of e-mails between Graff and Trump's assistant at the White House introduced as evidence.

Now, he finished up this afternoon after more than 10 hours on the stand across four days. Prosecutors tried to reestablish his credibility after the defense highlighted what were very small inconsistencies in Pecker's past statements. Now, Trump's lawyers also got him to say a few things that they will use for their defense. Pecker said, he didn't use the words \"catch and kill\" when he met with Trump and Michael Cohen in 2015. The prosecutors had Pecker explain that he nonetheless agreed to flag negative stories for Donald Trump. Now, Pecker said: \"I would speak to Michael Cohen and tell him that these are the stories that are going to be for sale, that if we don't buy them, somebody else will.\" Gregory Germain is a law professor at Syracuse University and glad to have you here to help us parse exactly what went on over those four days of testimony before we get to what is at issue right now. In terms of David Pecker being on the stand and obviously being a witness for the prosecution, did he do what he needed to do? So beyond all of the salacious things that we have heard this week, did he do a good job of really having the jury understand what the prosecution is alleging, that these were financial crimes and closely connected to fraud involving the 2016 campaign?",

If you're thejury here, what the defense is trying to say is that look, first off, Donald Trump denies having an affair even if any of that happened, even if they were trying to cover that up, none of this was illegal. Is that what you're trying to get at? Or is this about the fact that David Pecker did not pay Stormy Daniels? He said categorically on the stand, he says to Michael Cohen, \"I'm not a bank, I'm not going to have anything to do with this.\"",

And that the misrepresentation on the internal reimbursements were to commit an independent crime and we don't know what that independent crime is. So there has to be proof by the prosecution that there was an intent to commit fraud and an independent crime, and none of that is established in any way by Pecker who is talking about other transactions that he was involved in including the Karen McDougal payment and the doorman payment that was made. So it was very strange that they started with Pecker. I mean, I think its embarrassing information, but it really doesn't relate to the charges in the indictment.",

Before I let you go, I just want to get your opinion as well in terms of when we saw some cross-examination from Donald Trump's lawyers. They were really kid gloves on David Pecker.

Although, the record seem to back up everything he said, so I don't know that they are going to have much luck in impeaching him because he is likely telling the truth. So the real issue in this case are the legal issues and legal issues are going to wait till all this evidence is in and the judge has to put together the jury instructions and the jury instructions are going to be absolutely key to this prosecution and whether they clearly set forth the elements that the district attorney has to prove is going to be the big issue when we get to the end of the trial. So, the factual phase, you know, it may be interesting on a day-to-day basis to watch, but it is not the crux of this case. The real disputes in this case are whether he made these false entries to commit fraud on someone, what was that fraud? And whether it was to hide an independent crime and what was that independent crime? And we are not going to get to that until we get to the legal arguments at the end of the trial.",

Now, you and I talked about this significant progress that not only the students, but also the university had confirmed that had been -- that they had been able to move forward with in these negotiations. We asked exactly what that progress was over and they said its at least over investment disclosures, basically, they understand that they might be able to get little more information from the university about the investments with companies tied to Israel, which speaks to the issue of divestment. But also, they've been able to make some progress in terms of that wrong -- that statement from the president of the university, but they wouldn't exactly elaborate on that. There is still a lot of uncertainty here, Bianna, because I asked if these negotiations will likely continue into the weekend. One of those two negotiators at the table told me that they simply don't know at this point. So that speaks to that at uncertainty, but in meantime as for this encampment, it continues now. About a week-and-a-half, and I was told by one of the organizers that we can expect, they will be hosting actually a shabbat dinner some of the Jewish members of this pro-Palestinian movement will be hosting a shabbat dinner here with some of the other attendees. And finally, an interesting note that I heard from the organizer today is that they don't have any reason to believe that the encampment has actually grown in its last 10 days or so, so it doesn't seem to get any bigger, but it doesn't seem to we going anywhere. And so now, there is still perhaps another layer of uncertainty as we find -- as we wait to see what the next step will be for the university, it is very clear that both sides would like to avoid a scenario just like last week where Columbia reached out to the NYPD to then make their way onto the campus and clear out one of these encampments only to see it pop up again.",

Pecker said that he told Trump's fixer Michael Cohen that Stormy Daniels was selling her story. That story, of course, is of her alleged affair with Donald Trump. However, Pecker refuse to catch and kill it himself. The defense then tried to poke holes in Pecker's recollection of events highlighting some minor inconsistencies in his past statements. We've now moved on to other witnesses. Trump's former assistant Rhona Graff, says that she saw Stormy Daniels at Trump Tower before the 2016 campaign. Michael Cohen's former banker Gary Farro, then took the stand. He presumably -- he'll presumably continue his testimony when court is back in session next Tuesday.
