The gruesome attack hit a gathering at a cafe to mourn a fallen soldier. And in Syria, a deadly drone attack on a military college has left at least 89 people dead and wounded hundreds more. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Thursday's attack. And I will get you back to both of those stories with updates. Fred Pleitgen on the ground there at the site of that attack in Ukraine will join us shortly. First up, though, we begin with a landmark moment in the fight for women's rights in Iran. Activists Narges Mohammadi has been awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The Nobel committee saying it honored her for, and I quote them here, \"her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.\" Mohammadi is only the second Iranian in history to receive the honor after Shirin Ebadi's win 20 years ago. But Mohammadi cannot accept the prize in person. She is currently serving a sentence of more than 10 years in prison accused of acting against Iran's national security. Well, Jomana Karadsheh has spoken exclusively to Mohammadi who is in Evin Prison in Tehran. Tell us when you spoke to her and what she told you.",

Female protesters and prisoners sexually assaulted. As Iranians rose up on the streets last year, she lent her powerful voice to the uprising and for that she was recently sentenced to another year in prison. (On-camera): But that hasn't deterred Mohammadi who with the help of intermediaries responded to CNN questions in writing, detailing incidents of sexual assault dating back to 1999. She also mentioned her own experience but since the protest, she says, they have increased significantly, describing them now as systematic. (Voice-over): She writes, \"In prison, I have heard the narratives of three protesting women who were sexually assaulted. One of them was a well-known activist of the student movement, who, upon entering the prison, filed a complaint with the authorities and announced that after being arrested on the street, her one hand and one leg were cuffed and tied. And in that position, she was sexually assaulted. I went with one of my cell mates under the pretext of taking food for a prisoner. We saw bruises on her stomach, thighs, arms, and legs. The Iranian regime has denied allegations including a CNN investigation of using sexual violence and rape to suppress the protests, calling them baseless and false. For years, Mohammadi has been the voice of the voiceless, fighting for political prisoners against the death penalty and solitary confinement. Something she and her husband, Taghi Rahmani, have both endured. Rahmani, a former political prisoner who was jailed for 14 years, now lives in exile with the children in Paris. He's had to be both father and mother to Kiana and Ali. TAGHI RAHMANI, NARGES MOHAMMADI'S HUSBAND (through translator): Kiana used to always say when mommy is here, Daddy isn't, and when Daddy is here Mom isn't. It's not good but when someone chooses a path, they must endure all the hardships.",

And in that preprepared statement, Becky, she said, I will never stop striving for the realization of democracy, freedom, and equality. And she said that she will remain in Iran.

An Iskander missile. And if you look behind me you can see that the building that these people were in who were killed was just absolutely annihilated. There really isn't very much left of it over here except some of the foundations. You can see behind me that there is a big pile of debris. That is what that house used to be. That has already been cleared now by the authorities here because they say there simply is no chance of finding any more survivors. Here is what we are learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Utter destruction and chaos after the massive explosion. As night fell, bodies still strewn across the area as search and rescue crews scoured the debris. This man, weeping in front of a body bag, too shaken to talk to us, we learned his name is Sergei and the deceased was his wife. (On-camera): As you can see, this building was completely annihilated when it was hit by the missile. The Ukrainians are saying that this was an Iskander missile launched by the Russians. That is a very heavy missile that is normally used to destroy large troop formations or even armored vehicles. And as you can see, it completely devastated this building right here. The Ukrainians say more than 50 people were killed. It's very difficult for them to identify some of the bodies because they are in such bad shape. They also say what was going on here was an event around a funeral and they say that the people who were attending that event were all local folks. (Voice-over): There was chaos, the chief investigator tells us. There was a fire which was extinguished by firefighters. Of course, evacuation measures were taken to get people out of the rubble. (On-camera): Obviously all of this is still very fresh and a lot of the search and rescue crews are still very much at work. We can see over there that some of the first responders are still busy sort of doing the forensics on the scene here, and also still putting bodies into body bags. There's a lot of them laying around here and a lot of them being taken away by some of these crews here. One of the other things that we can see over there is that obviously this was some sort of recreational area. There still seems to be some sort of playground that was also heavily damaged when the missile hit. (Voice-over): Ukraine's president visiting Spain pinning the blame on Russia. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Tragically, because of this inhuman terrorist attack, 50 civilians were killed during a funeral.
