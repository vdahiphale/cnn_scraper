And so it's a little strange for this much redactions, but I think one of the things that we see is the judge is trying to address the sensitivity. The things that you guys are just raising, which is the fact that this is only 18 days before the presidential election.Among the things that we see in here, obviously some tweets, we see some of the documents that underpin the whole idea of this -- these fake electoral certificates. But one of the things that's getting a lot of attention is this interview with a White House aide who was interviewed by the January 6th committee and some of these details have been previously redacted, so we're getting to see a little bit of what this person said in this interview. And what they're describing is that the former president back in January 6th gets back to the Oval Office and that he's informed that the networks essentially are covering this riot that is unfolding at the Capitol and what he says is this. He says: I took off Trump's outer coat, got a TV, handed Trump the remote, after which he went to retrieve a Diet Coke for the former president. And one of the things that we learned there is obviously that Donald Trump learns that there's a riot undergoing, happening at the Capitol. And he wants to sit and watch it and he gets a Diet Coke from the refrigerator there in the kitchen and sits down to watch the coverage of what was happening. That's part of what Jack Smith is trying to try to portray and he wants to, you know, jurors to see that the former president essentially did nothing to try to stop the rioting on that day.",

He's calling it election interference. And she points out in her ruling that if the court had withheld this it could be interpreted itself as election interference because this is information that the public has a right to know.

He's an actor of course who is endorsing Harris and spoke with 15 or more members of this group about why they are also endorsing the Democratic nominee for president. Mandy thank you so much for joining us today. This conversation that you had got quite heated especially when discussing former President Donald Trump. I want to play a bit from that.

SECRETARY: He awakened a sleeping beast of such evil in this country that we thought that my family that marched within civil rights movement had eradicated and he brought it right back. When you have protesters for Black Lives Matter, peaceful protesters for Black Lives Matter and he wants to deploy the National Guard to stop people from executing -- exercising their First Amendment right. He does not care. He doesn't think I'm a human being. He ran away from, he had bone spurs, he never went to war. My entire family has served. My entire family. But he thinks we're suckers, he thinks we're losers and he probably doesn't even think I'm a human being. That's the kind of man that was in that office before. We cannot let him back in.

They couldn't be more articulate in saying things about how equipped she is to run this country and be the United States's ambassador to the world and bring us into a national security safety zone both here and abroad.At the same time really just with tears in their eyes and a passion where they only could not sit down and control themselves, many of them, most of them, about the dangers they felt of having this man back in the White House for another four years. They thought it would be devastating to the security for the United States of America and the security of our country and the security for other countries abroad and they couldn't have been more emphatic about it. These are people who are not used to going out of their comfort zone to protect the commander-in-chief whether they are in power or where -- and whether these people are in power. Most of these people, I think all of them, were retired at this point. There were over 700 that came out with this letter a few weeks ago. I think that number is up to 741 now and another 250 of them just joined. Many of them Republicans, also some Democrats, but mostly Republicans really going out on the line with their friends and just feeling that this is absolutely a desperate moment for their country. Most of them have voted Republican most of their lives and they are voting for Kamala Harris.",

One of them in particular is a very dear friend of mine, and he certainly is not voting for Donald Trump. And he is very, very concerned of the state and the polarity of our country.And he, like I, wish more than anything that we have at least, at the very least, a two party situation in our country where people can reach across the aisle, like in the old days, and speak civilly to each other and represent the parental body of the nation's dinner table to teach the children, which is all of us, how to speak and be kind and respectful and listen to each other. And there is nothing more than I know all of them wish is to hold on to their Republican identity, most of these people, but not at the stake of democracy and the country and fascism that they believe this man will turn this country back 200 years or more. And they -- it is it is a moment of crisis in their opinion. That is why they've stepped out of their comfort zone. You know, what did I just say? I said 900 strong over 900 strong at this moment. And these are the top leaders of the military, all areas of the military. It is extraordinary to watch them weep in front of you grown men and women with their passion for this country. It is extraordinary. It is moving beyond description and of all walks and lives and religion and color and ages. It was it was just one of the most moving experiences of my life to see such patriotism, you know, and their articulation, which we've all heard. You know, everybody's, you know, saying things about the disrespect for the military that this man has in closing up the fascists and dictators that he has his inability to accept elections and the decent and proper transfer of power. And the list goes on and on and on. And they can't take it. They have defended their lives. They have lost their friends lives. They have led American soldiers, you know, for the sake of the lives of every human being in this country. And they beg you to get out and vote. Do not waste your vote. Young people for the first time to vote, get out and register. Less than 20 percent have done that. That could turn every election up and down the ballot on in this country.",
