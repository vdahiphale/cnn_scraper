What are the chance of some happy events happen. OK, one in 120 billion if you pick the perfect NCAA bracket. One in 300 million of winning the Mega Millions, which, of course, is complete chance. Or one in 650,000 for a royal poker flush. So, by far, the chance of a perfect NCAA bracket is the lowest. You have a better chance of playing the lottery and winning hundreds of millions if not a billion dollars that way. And, has there ever been one? Well, the answer is, no, not that we know of. The closest ever was in 2019. There was a perfect through round two of six. So, that gives you an understanding. Very, very difficult. In 2022, there were no perfect brackets after round one.

Do you think that maybe the - you know, the pressure is off now, that things are going to go back to normal, or is there still more fallout here? O'LEARY: No, they'll never go back to normal. Two things are going to happen. This quick move, this policy decision was to try and stop a run on small banks, mid-sized banks. I don't think long-term that's going to work because why would you take even 1 percent of risk keeping your money, or at least all of it, in a small, regional bank. You're going to diversify. And I think that's the first lesson that wasn't being adhered to is, when you have liquid assets, you want to make sure it's diversified. And the rule we've put in place for our powerful companies is no more than 20 percent in any one financial institution because you never know where the black swan is swimming. In other words, every single institution has an idiot manager, big ones, small ones, that's been proven by history. You just don't know where they are. And that's the same for every sector of the economy. But the banking system is different. We have 11 sectors in our economy. The banking system, financial services, is one of them. But it services all other ten.
