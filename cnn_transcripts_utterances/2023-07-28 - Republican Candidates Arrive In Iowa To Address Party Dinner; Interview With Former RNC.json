And the short- term is what we have typically seen from Republican candidates. They criticize the Department of Justice, and that seems to be it. I'm reminded of the song, \"Once in a Lifetime\" by the Talking Heads, same as it ever was, same as it ever was.So, this weekend could be when it's not the same. The debate coming up next month could be when it's not the same. But for this primary process to change or caucus process with Iowa, the -- you need to do something different. You have to change if you want things to change. And maybe it doesn't have to be this weekend, but if every time Donald Trump is indicted, he gets a pass, nothing's going to change based on everything we've seen. And what's so remarkable about this, John and Rahel, is in any other campaign, House, Senate, governor, Statehouse or any other candidate but Donald Trump, when your opponent is indicted once, much less multiple times, you pounce on that immediately and you don't let go.",

TIM SCOTT (R-SC), U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: There is no silver lining in freedom -- in slavery. The truth is that anything that you can learn that -- any benefits that people suggest you had during slavery, you would have had as a free person.

This primary is not going to go around Donald Trump, it's going to go through him.But when you have an opportunity to throw an anchor on opponent who's struggling to tread water in politics, you do that, which again is why it's surprising that no one has gone after Donald Trump at all, by and large, and attacked his lack of winnability, potentially, in this race. And again, these candidates, as we see this weekend, it's going to tell us a little bit more of what we can expect in the future debate coming up.

It's also showing me that they're also starting to deploy some of the reserves that they had.
