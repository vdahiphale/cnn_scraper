And I've got to tell you it was cold. And the caucus site where I spoke -- still, the organizers were telling me that they were surprised at how many people came out. Look, I think it is crystal clear President Trump is going to be the nominee. The sooner we get to that realization in the other campaigns the better. And then we can start drawing those contrasts with what the economy looked like under President Trump with how it is now. What the border looked like then and how it now.
