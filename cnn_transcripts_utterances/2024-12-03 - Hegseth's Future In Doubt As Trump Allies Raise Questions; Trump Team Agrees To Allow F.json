Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. Pete, Pete Hegseth, to be specific, he's Donald Trump's pick to steer the Pentagon, and he might be in trouble. Tomorrow, he's going to return to his old stomping grounds, Fox News, for an interview that he may need in order to save his would-be job. The Republican senators that he needs in his corner to green light his nomination, several of them are now skeptical. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Some of these articles are very disturbing. He, you know, obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but, you know, some of this stuff is going to be difficult. You know, time will tell. SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): As I've repeatedly said to you, I believe that we need an FBI background check to evaluate the allegations. We need to have the normal committee process of questionnaires. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Elliot, I'm going to get to you in just a second, but, Scott Jennings, you know the Senate as well as anybody else.

So, they need to be vetted. They need to go through this process.And the Senate is not -- obviously, there's a group of them, they're not interested in rolling over on the process because -- on these vital positions, and they shouldn't. Now, Hegseth, I think, has every right to defend himself and should be able to have that chance if this nomination continues. And I'm sure that they'll give him a fair hearing.
