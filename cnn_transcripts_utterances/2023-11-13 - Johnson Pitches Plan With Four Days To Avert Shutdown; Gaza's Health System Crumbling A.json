What the Republicans are doing here and the speaker, in particular, is he's keeping funding levels at the same place that they have been over the course of the last year. But what he's doing is having two separate deadlines for various government agencies to run out of that money. The first deadline will come on January 19. The second deadline will come on February 2.Now, there are a number of Democrats who had been warning that this approach was complicated, that it was gimmicky. That it really didn't make sense in terms of how Congress typically handles these kinds of showdowns. And yet, what you are hearing from a lot of Democrats is they are keeping their options open, keeping their powder dry, and really staying on the sidelines right now because the likelihood is that they probably are going to have to get behind this plan if they want to avert a shutdown by Friday. So all eyes are on what House Democrats are going to do in the next couple of days. The House Rules Committee, like you said, is going to vote today. They're going to move forward with this proposal. Then there is going to be a critical test for Speaker Johnson because in order to pass this on the floor he's going to have to bring a procedural step -- that rule vote to the floor of the House. Typically, it is up to the majority party to get those rules across the finish line to get on to voting on the actual underlying legislation -- in this case, the spending bill -- but it's not clear that Republicans and conservatives are going to help him out on that rule. So that opens the question of just how much help is he going to need from Democrats --",

But obviously, this two-step approach is unique, it is unprecedented, and it is something that Democrats do feel like is going to cause multiple different showdowns once the near year begins.And so, there's just going to be a little bit of a case where Democrats are sitting back to watch what Johnson can get in terms of votes on his own.

More than 70,000 child care programs could close and about 3.2 million children could lose their spots, and that's according to estimates from The Century Foundation.The child care subsidy programs, which ended on September 30, were a Band-Aid for an industry that has long had very deep problems. Now, America's child care problem is about to get worse -- much worse. And as our next guest writes, quote, \"When these child care businesses do shut down, they can send shock waves throughout their local economies.\" Joining us now is Catherine Rampell, a CNN economics and political commentator and Washington Post opinion columnist. I liked this column so much because it was on the ground. It was showing the kind of macro effects. Part of the issue in maintaining programs like this is the ability to show the macro effects of it.

It's a softer form of infrastructure but it's the reason why so many parents are able to work. And if you look at the kinds of effects we've seen from that over the past few years it's been phenomenal.So one of the bright spots of this economy -- of this economic recovery post-pandemic is the fact that women -- what's called prime working-age women's labor force participation has been around record high. And why has it been around record highs? There are a lot of factors that go into that but part of it has to do with the fact that women are able to go to work because there is this infrastructure there that enables society, in some function and some form, to help watch their children so they can go to work. And that is a collective responsibility. Yes, the parents have to pay those child care tuition fees. But there's a gap between what child care providers are able to charge parents and what they are able to pay their workers who are already very low wage. And that gap in the last couple of years has been filled in part by these federal funds. That has enabled the children to be looked after in high-quality programs. It's enabled their parents to work. It's enabled employers to fill some of those labor shortages that they have been struggling with.",

Congress is struggling to even keep the current level of funding going without that money -- current level of funding for other programs, that is.But beyond that, I think that there are some -- there's some form of cultural resistance as well. Like, there are parts of society who don't like the idea that women should be working. I think it's a smaller and smaller segment of society. There is also a part of our electorate that thinks well, this is the responsibility of families. The whole idea of it takes a village to raise a child, forget that. Families should be responsible for their own children's care arrangements. And why should taxpayers have to, again, fill that gap? But again, that ignores the downstream consequences to the rest of communities and to the rest of the economy. And it ignores the fact that there is this fundamental wedge between what parents can afford and what the providers can afford to pay. Already, as I said, child care workers are earning less than your typical animal caretaker, your typical parking attendant. They earn very, very little money. And yet, child care is just phenomenally expensive for families because of the structure of the business. It's just a really untenable business model if it is left to its own private devices.",
