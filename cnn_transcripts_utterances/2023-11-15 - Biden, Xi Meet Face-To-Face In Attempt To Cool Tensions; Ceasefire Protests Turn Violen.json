Today, we watched carefully orchestrated diplomatic theater between these two superpowers, a handshake, a walk outside, a Hollywood mansion in Woodside, California, but the stakes are far more consequential than fiction, to take a tumultuous year and basically put it to the side.

Now when the U.S. is mired in wars in other parts of the world, like Ukraine, when there's war breaking and potentially in the Middle East, China then understands that there's a position of the leverage with the United States.

So, I don't know what kind of gotcha game you're trying to play, but we can get to the policy debate because it's actually pretty important on this subject. It's an important subject for the U.S.Right now, the U.S. posture is strategic ambiguity. Both parties refuse to say whether the U.S. will defend Taiwan, so much so that you'll remember you all derided President Trump for even picking up a phone call from the Taiwanese president, for violating diplomatic protocol. I think that status quo is unacceptable. I think that the U.S. currently embraces the One China policy. So, that policy of strategic ambiguity now is not strong enough, so I would upgrade from that, be crystal clear that the U.S. will affirmatively defend Taiwan, something that no other politician is saying with clarity, until we achieve semiconductor independence, because we depend on Taiwan for those chips that power or modern way of life. I don't want China having an economic gun to our head if they control that semiconductor supply chain. That will be a disaster for the U.S. So we will defend militarily. After we have achieved semiconductor independence, we resume the status quo of strategic ambiguity. Yes, that would be a change, a change now and a change later. And I think with that clarity, Xi Jinping would have to be foolish to invade Taiwan to sit on the semiconductor supply chain. That's how we advance principles that put our country first. PHILLIP Just as a final point of clarity on this, once the United States achieves semiconductor independence, do you believe it will be in the United States' national interest to deter China from invading Taiwan?",

We will be armed and ready for you cowardly punks this Wednesday. He also wrote, we're armed and ready for you punks and we don't have any ounce of fear.

So there is precedent for the ADC to do this. However, the difference is -- is that Gary Gilbert is a minority owner. He doesn't really have, as the Cleveland Cavaliers have said today, a major role within the company. His brother, Dan Gilbert, owns the franchise. So I do believe that the NBA will address this. I think they will take their time in response. But I also know that Adam Silver, the commissioner, has been very clear that there is no room for that in the NBA.

      "sentences": "Well, there's a lot going on, as you said, Abby. Thank you for inviting me. I think this interview with Donald Trump a few days ago was a missed golden opportunity. I think the interview was sugar-coated. I think there were a lot of questions that needed to be asked that weren't asked.And considering the fact that Donald Trump has not given any recent interviews and he has not been in any debates, this was an opportunity to ask many questions, especially questions that Hispanics needed to have the answers for. That didn't happen and I think during the interview there were several assertions that were false that needed to be heavily challenged because there's ample evidence to prove the contrary and that didn't happen. And the question is why, and there's you know, there's this New situation in which Televisa which is a very powerful mega media company from Mexico has now great influence in Univision, which is a number one Hispanic television network and it helps shape the perception of the viewers and perception, as you will know, turns to turning to reality eventually. PHILLIP: So Televisa, as you just pointed out, and Univision merged in 2021, Trump also hosted several of the Univision executives at Mar-a- Lago during this hour-long interview. But one of the things that Democrats are pointing out are a couple of facts that have come out in the reporting, which is that Univision ad reps canceled Biden's campaign spots that were purchased to run during Trump's interview. They said it's because they have a rule now against airing campaign ads during interviews like this. But do you think that there is an effort by Univision executives to get cozy with Trump? Is that what is causing this shift in what seems to be a shift, I should say, in the network's posture?",

First of all, I think it's very unusual to have an interview with a former president and have the executive of your company present a few steps away. I cannot imagine the stress that this reporter, which is a good reporter, must have been through under those circumstances, knowing that, you know, Trump is buddy-buddy with his bosses and the bosses are especially good friends with the son-in-law.And, you know, very few people can stand up to that. You know, there were several instances in which the reporter was smiling every time that Trump answered a question. I don't think that's correct. You know, I've conducted many interviews with former presidential candidates, and that's one thing that you don't do, because it seems like you agree with what they're saying, even if you don't. But, you know, it gives way to be misinterpreted. And you know, what people have to understand is that Televisa and these executives, you are very powerful in Mexico. They're the biggest, they're a mega media giant which for decades influenced the programming to favor their political, you know, cronies and friends. And it had a lot of benefits in return because of that philosophy. And what we don't want is to have a mega media company from another country influencing our due electoral process of electing a president. And that's something that we should be very worried about.",

But one other scenario here, though, is just the sheer politics of it all and the business of it all, even. There's a new CNN poll that shows that the former president only trails Biden by four points among Hispanic voters.I think we all have seen Trump trying to gain inroads with Hispanic voters. Are Univision executives looking at that and saying, well, some of our viewers might be Trump fans, and maybe the network needs to make a shift? Do you think some of this is also just about politics and perhaps public opinion?",

It would also give local law enforcement the authority to arrest and deport migrants. Now, civil rights organizations are warning that this could lead to racial profiling.

And there's a lot of Latinos in Texas that agree with these kind of very strong laws, contrary to what most people would think.However, the danger with this law that you just mentioned is very simple. It's allowing law enforcement at the local and state level to arrest people that they suspect, keyword suspect, to be migrants that have crossed the border illegally. And that's where the danger comes because suspecting is very subjective and can lead to, as you said, racial profiling of people that live in Texas, people that are going about their own business and may get into a lot of trouble while it gets, you know, sorted out just because they have brown skin, just to give you an example. And also, what worries me is that this law does not contemplate funding anything for the education of the agents or making sure that they have knowledge of the immigration laws so that there's no issues that can affect an arrest. And you know how all the things that we've seen in the media throughout the years concerning, you know, law enforcement and immigration and migrants.
