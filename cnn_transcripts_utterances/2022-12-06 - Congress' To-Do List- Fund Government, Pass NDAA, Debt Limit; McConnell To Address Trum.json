Mitch McConnell's endgame is to not have to deal with House Republicans that have no ability to find consensus at this moment in time that may change, about the big issues that allow the government to function beyond September, the end of September, in this moment in time, and he has very clear asked that he's given the President Biden that he's given to Chuck Schumer as well. We don't know whether or not they're going to be able to reconcile those differences.McConnell is the person to watch on the end of Congress, the end of the lame duck session right now, McCarthy doesn't matter. They're in the lame duck. And he's focused on one thing and one thing only. And I think the question right now that I have is they really start to have real meetings for the first time the President with the top appropriators, McConnell and Schumer meeting as well as we're 10 days away from the spending deadline, that means we're about eight days away from things getting really serious, which means then they'll punted from another week is when does the reality of we don't want to deal with this next year, we don't want to deal with this with all the uncertainty about what the House Republican Conference will look like, start to overtake the realities of well, I want this added on or I want that added on, tends to happen, whether it will or not, that still an open question.",

And the McCarthy piece of it, the House Republican turmoil and the transition from Democrat to Republican just adds another uncertainty to what is always a quicksand environment, it just adds even more to it. So if you're the president, you want a spending plan. And you prefer what's called an omnibus, forgive me, America, an omnibus that's a full year spending plan, as opposed to a continuing resolution where you say we're going to fund the government for a month or two, and then we'll fight about it all over again. You need the annual defense spending bill.It's not just the money there. It's the policy for the Pentagon and the defense secretary says in the middle of the war with, you know, helping support Ukraine and the war with Russia. Let's have clarity, please. The House will vote on the Senate version now of the -- to protect same sex marriage. We believe that one will be done. But the challenge here is to your point is that the President is negotiating and Schumer's negotiate with Mitch McConnell to try to get a deal on as many of the big issues as you can, that you can then sell to the House Democrats who only have a four or five seat majority four seats now, I believe after the death of Congressman McEachin. So to get them, to do that before the Republicans take charge, so Ron Klain, the White House Chief of Staff says it's complicated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There aren't many things that he does that haven't had multiple different second and third orders behind them to some degree. I think McConnell views things right now. One, he thinks he can get a good deal on the omnibus, particularly in terms of dropping parity between defense spending and non-defense domestic spending, which would be a big shift and a big win for Republicans.Two, I think that he looks at the House Republican conference right now to everything we're saying. And it's what can you do now to lock in wins, knowing that you have no clue where things are going to land next year, both because it's divided government and because you don't necessarily trust where leadership is going to be. NDAA has to get done. The Defense Authorization Bill has to be done. It's been done 60 plus years in a row. Omnibus is where McConnell clearly wants something done looking to next year. Can he find a way to thread the needle? And frankly, can President Biden find a way to get his Democrats in the same place to get that done knowing what's coming next.",

You know, he condemns it. You know, Trump has also repeatedly launched racist attacks against McConnell's wife.But you know, McConnell is going to condemn it because of this. These are four key McConnell allies in the Senate John Cornyn says I think it's irresponsible what Trump said. John Thune says I couldn't disagree more.

And it's been made very clear, they didn't want the name to even come out of his mouth. Obviously, they have not spoken since shortly after January 6th. The thing that I'm intrigued by right now, this is the last Election Day of the midterm cycle. Is today a day where McConnell makes clear publicly what is very obvious privately in the sense that he does not think Trump is fit to be president of the United States, he wants any other Republican But Trump and would probably support wholeheartedly, every dozen plus Republicans who are considering it right now. Is this the day to do it? I have no sense of whether or not but like that time needs to come at some point. Because as we've seen over the course of the last two years, if you let President Trump hang around and just talk behind the scenes about why you don't think he's fit for office, he will maintain his position inside the party in that grip. This is a moment once again, where it feels like there's a loosening, can they make an actual pivot from him? Or do we go through what we've gone through last year?",

I think the challenge that McConnell and other Republicans are grappling with is they want Trump out of the party. They don't want him to be the front runner, but they don't want to lose his voter base.

I don't think this plan sees the light of day if they, A, had not thought very deeply about what it would mean in the backlash it was certain to receive. And B, if they were very comfortable with that reality before they released it, I think the President's top advisors did not do this ad hoc. This had been thought through. It is sending a very clear message. They believe on the substance of the matter, they have both the moral high ground and the sense that this really elevates black voters, which are the backbone of the Democratic Party, and certainly were the backbone of President Biden's ability to win the Democratic nomination back in 2020.And they also believe they have the political high ground given where the party has shifted. And also, you know, implicit in all of this is -- this really lines up with where Joe Biden wants to be in terms of his political constituency. They knew the fights were coming, they were expecting the fights, I don't think they're going to shy away in any way, shape, or form. What this does more than anything else, is for a president who is often deliberative to a fault to some degree, and is not necessarily willing to go ahead and just put this down on certain issues.
