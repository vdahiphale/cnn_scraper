Certainly more alert than they were a few weeks ago. This morning, the Biden administration is firing back after China is now accusing the U.S. of illegally flying high- altitude balloons into Chinese air space. More than ten times, they say, in the last year. All as officials in a northeast Chinese province claimed they were preparing to shoot down an unidentified flying object as well this weekend.For more on the trio of objects shot down by U.S. fighter jets over the weekend, let's begin with CNN Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann, also CNN senior White House correspondent MJ Lee. But first to you, Oren. Can you tell us what we're learning about the new objects shot down this weekend and what exactly -- or at least how much of a threat the Pentagon believes them to be?",

      "sentences": "So to recap, there was one object shot down over Alaska on Friday, one over Canada Saturday, northwest Alaska, and then the one over Lake Huron pretty much right before the Super Bowl. The problem is the Pentagon hasn't really put out a description of what we're looking at or what these are, simply describing them as objects. They are very small in size and the Pentagon has said they don't believe they posed any military threat, but because of that their altitude, between 20,000 and 40,000 feet, they were roughly where commercial air space flies so they were viewed as a hazard to civil aviation, and for that reason were taken down. There are recovery efforts in all three cases, but crucially theobjects have not yet been discovered, so we haven't gotten a better description of what it is the Pentagon is looking at or what the additional concerns may be. Adding to the confusion, we've heard from a few U.S. officials, including Jake Sullivan, describing these as \"balloons,\" but the Pentagon won't quite go that far in saying that these are balloons. Last night a Pentagon official did say that there are a number of other entities, such as companies or research organizations that launch objects into the atmosphere, into the skies, suggesting perhaps that's the explanation here. But they haven't come in on one explanation and said, this is what's responsible. They have said that they're very different, not only in size, but apparently in terms of capabilities as well, from the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down off the coast of South Carolina about a week and a half ago. So, we do know that much. But a further description, still very much wanting in this case, especially because these were objects shot down in U.S. air space, and that's a key point here. Now, also adding to the confusion, and broadening out this story, is the accusation now coming from China that there were objects in Chinese air space. That got a forceful reaction from the Pentagon, which said the U.S. doesn't have a surveillance balloon program, that's China that has that program. Erica and Jim.",

Maybe there was a self-destruct mechanism in it so some of them maybe burned in addition to whatever damage the sea water does to it.The other three objects, they don't seem to be -- have the same signature. Could they be reconnaissance? Sure. Could they be from Russia instead of China? Sure. Could it be from North Korea? Of course. Could it be some misguided effort by some fishing fleet trying to look for salmon off the coast of Alaska and it got disoriented by the wind? You know, we need to really get to the bottom of it.

No one's taken credit for it from the United States.So, I think, you know, it's a -- it was a hazard to aircraft and let's see what the facts show. Maybe when people wake up on Monday and they - and they look at their reports from their balloons over the weekend, they'll discover that this balloon's not reporting, they'll call the Pentagon and they'll acknowledge they did something that was a hazard to civil aviation.

And I do want to give you a sense of how you're seeing this view from a bird's eye view. We are standing on a bridge that goes right over the street. It is perfectly fine. There is no bowing. There is no cracks. What this speaks to, because you see some of the other buildings as well, if you look just past the rubble, there is a building that is still standing. And what you are seeing many people have been complaining about is that some of these buildings are just not built well. They are, as someone said, bad buildings that have crumbled in the face of a 7.8 and then a subsequent 7.6 earthquake. Those are huge earthquakes, make no mistake about it, but you can definitely see the difference between how some buildings have withstood them, even though they're damaged, and how some buildings have pancaked, which is a definite sign that something is wrong. And the government is now going after dozens of people, investigating them for bad building practices. I do want to give you a sense, though, because we have this bird's-eye view, we're on this bridge, looking down at all of this. And if you look to the right, if you just go past these cables, you will see people sitting there. They have made makeshift stoves. They are drinking coffee and tea, which is very common in Turkey. They have wonderful, wonderful tea. But they are sitting there because they are waiting for the potential of their family members to be rescued or recovered. Family after family after family sit in the absolute freezing cold waiting to see if there's any signs of life or even at this point if there is any signs of their loved ones so that they can give them a proper burial. We have seen so many scenes of sorrow here. And that's the hardest thing to take. The buildings are buildings, but the people here who are dealing with this know that they will be dealing with this for months if not years to come because it is such a vast destruction area across southern Turkey. I do want to let you hear from a woman we spoke to, Erica and Jim, who was so distraught and she's just one example of what people are going through now as she waited to try and find the body of her husband.
