An earthquake jolt New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia with tremors even felt right here in Washington D.C. That 4.8 magnitude quake shook the region at 10It said people scrambling from apartment, buildings and storefronts confused, but quite calm. As you can see and some pictures we have here. The NYPD says there are no major impacts at this time. No major injuries that we are aware of. We do expect New York City Mayor Eric Adams to hold a press briefing at any moment. Minutes ago, the governor of New York said JFK and Newark airports are on a full ground stop, but Amtrak is on a full schedule. The worry that the aftershocks may still rattle the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): They're taking this extremely seriously and here's why. There is always the possibility of aftershocks. This is one of the largest earthquakes on these coasts occur in the last century. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as you hear from New York City officials in the last few minutes that there is no life-threatening situation right there. That has that they've been reported no signs of any damage, no sign of any injuries.That being said, officials are certainly assessing the infrastructure things like bridges and tunnels to make sure that those are safe because the impact of this morning's event is certainly what's now becoming the bigger story. They're certainly the impact on air travel, nearly 9000 people according to USGS likely felt as we described as strong shaking. But nearly 23 million people likely felt what's been described by officials as light shaking. So that gives you a sense of just the impact here. Here at street level, I can tell you that it is kind of business as usual. Speaking to folks New Yorker, speaking to tourists a bit, some mixed reaction. Some people felt it, others didn't like myself. Also spoke to a family visiting from Belgium. They were in one of the tallest outdoor observation decks in the world here in New York City. They said that that sort of wobbling, thought it was actually the children that were jumping up and down. Then they received the report on their phone, confirming that in fact it was a 4.8 magnitude earthquake. So certainly, I wouldn't really call it concern, but certainly something that people are talking about here in New York City, as we wait to hear more from officials later today. Dana?",

What did you feel?CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: I was sitting right here, Dana, working at my desk in my home office. And what it really felt like was like a small explosion. I felt like -- I thought maybe either our home boiler blew, or our generator blew. I went from our -- upstairs where my offices. The house was shaking, seriously shaking. And I ran downstairs where my wife was to try to see what was going on. She was on her way up to see if I knew what was going on. And it probably was shaking pretty hard for -- I'd say 15 to 20 seconds. And then it started to diminish a bit and then it stopped.",

I didn't know whether it was the wind or something else that was shaking, you know, it was kind of an old house that we had down there at the time.This was really violent shaking. And you could hear your house. The windows rattling, the doors rattling, you know, I could feel as I was going down the stairs, the stairs moving. So, this was significantly different than what I experienced. That was probably, I think, around 2013 or '14 or so. And that was nothing compared to what I felt earlier today.",

It was just such a foreign feeling.And it's, again, not something that people in New Jersey, in New York and elsewhere on the East Coast are used to. Can you just kind of give a sense to people -- you sort of said, you're just a resident from New Jersey. You're obviously a two-term governor of New Jersey. What it is that officials should be looking for now? Because I will just say here in D.C., everybody thought it was fine.

It's in West Trenton, where all of our emergency first responding leadership gathers. I'm sure the governor will probably be there. What they're going to want to do is a few things.First, you're going to want to see if there were any injuries and take care of anybody who might have been injured. I haven't heard of anything like that yet. But that's priority number one is what's happened to human life. Secondly then, I would be looking at all of the major large structures in the state. We have a fairly decent skyline in Jersey City, New Jersey. The Goldman Sachs tower being the largest one. I would be sending out as governor, the folks that we have in the Department of Community Affairs, which will have structural engineers to go out and begin working on some of the bigger structures in the state to make sure that they're stable. And then I think you're going to have to work county by county with the -- with each of the county folks who are oversee building inspections and all the rest in their individual counties to let them know. I'm especially near where I am. Like you said, I'm about 15 to 17 miles away from the epicenter. I think you start there in western -- northwestern New Jersey. And then work your way in concentric circles out as governor to try to check on the structural safety of homes. You know, we have a number of different types of -- you know, temporary homes here in New Jersey that are -- you know, and by temporary, I mean, at the Jersey Shore. As you know, smaller homes that don't have foundations and all the rest. So, I think that's the way you work it out. Start with human life, the very large structures, which could create other problems if they were unstable, both for the people who are working in them and for those in the surrounding neighborhoods. And then ultimately, down to individual homes, which can be dealt with at the county level.",

This is not on any active seismic area.We've been talking about the earthquake in Taiwan earlier in the week. That's where you're sitting in a hotbed, right on top of fault-lines volcanoes, like that's very common. This is not that. So, I think that's just a lot of what -- you know, people are reacting with confusion because 4.8 magnitude is definitely significant enough for that shaking to be felt for miles and miles. You know, we're thankfully not getting the reports of the damage. But especially in this area, it's just not what they feel. And it was pretty shallow --",

We felt the impact of this 4.7 magnitude earthquake. The epicenter was in Lebanon, New Jersey, about 50 miles from New York City. And as you notice is a developing situation where you always concern about aftershocks and after an earthquake. But New Yorkers should go about their normal day. First responders are working to make sure the city safe. And one thing we do so well in our city is bringing together all of the agencies that are involved and our partners and other entities. Everything from the MTA to the Department of Buildings. The parents who are concerned about their school children. Chancellor Banks would be here to report on that. But we say over and over again, the safest place for our students we believe will continue to be in school. At this point, we do not have any reports of major impacts to our infrastructure or injuries. But of course, we're still assessing the situation. And we'll continue to update the public. We're in touch with the White House, the governor's office and local elected officials. And I encourage New Yorkers to check on their loved ones to make sure that they are fine, not only from the infrastructure damage, but this could be a traumatic moment for individuals going through an earthquake. And if you feel an aftershock, dropped to the floor, cover your head and neck and take cover under a solid piece of furniture next to an interior wall or in a doorway. So, I want to thank the emergency staff and first responders for the work to keep New Yorkers safe. Earthquakes don't happen every day in New York. So, this can be extremely dramatic. The number of texts calls and inquiries of their people sent out to not only our administration, but to family members, checking on them. We know how this can impact you.

Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Good afternoon, everyone. So, the earthquake was felt across the entire city and across many of our schools, across all five boroughs. In fact, I was at LaGuardia High School at an event this morning when the earthquake hit. I did not personally feel it but many people in the room felt it. So first and foremost, what's most important to understand. So, we want to emphasize that we've received no reports of any injury to staff or students. And that's the most important thing as safety is our top priority and ensuring that everyone is safe in our schools. Immediately following the earthquake, our teams both within New York City public schools and across the city immediately jumped into action. We've been in close and constant communication with City Hall, the Office of Emergency Management, School Construction Authority and other agencies as well. So, at this moment, there is no indication that any of our buildings were compromised. And our facility staff at the School Construction Authority are quickly and thoroughly inspecting buildings to ensure a safety. And out of an abundance of caution, we've assembled all of our building response teams as well. So, we've instructed all of our school principals to continue operations and dismissal as normal. We ask the school staff and families to remain calm. And to model that for all of our students, all of our children. Parents do not need to pick up their child early as a result of today's earthquake. Additionally, all after school programs will continue as planned. If conditions change, our schools will committed -- communicate directly with families. We also will post updates on our social media pages, which can be found at NYC schools. I want to thank all of our school staff and our facility staff for keeping our students safe during times like these. Their professionalism in the face of an emergency is a role model for all of our students. Again, the top lines, all of our students across the school system are safe. All of our staff are safe. We have no reports of any structural damage to any of our school facilities, while many schools and felt -- in fact felt some tremors from the earthquake. Thank you so much.",

He is going to be spending the day, meeting with local leaders there and meeting of course with some of the family members of the six people who died as a result of that bridge collapsing.
