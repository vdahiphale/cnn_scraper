Now any minute, weare expecting to hear from the U.S. Defense Chief who has been meeting with dozens of his counterparts in Germany on Ukraine at stake here, what firepower they'll give Kyiv as it moves into its second year of Russia's war. The German Defense Minister says Germany still hasn't decided on sending the tanks Ukraine has been pleading for, but it's ready to move quickly if and when that decision is made. So what does this all mean for Ukraine now and moving forward? A lot to talk about we've got CNN Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward in Kyiv for us. She'll join us in just a moment. CNN's International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson joins us from London. And we also have White House reporter Natasha Bertrand, in Washington for us. Natasha, I'm going to start with you. The U.S. has said actually for months that Abrams tanks are off the table. Germany says it won't go at it alone, sending leopard tanks. From the U.S.'s standpoint, what is the sticking issue? What is the sticking point?",

And their rationale for this is that essentially, these run on jet fuel and that is extremely expensive and hard to obtain whereas the leopard tanks do not. The leopard tanks that Germany and many other European countries have in their inventory are not as difficult and costly to maintain for the Ukrainians and it just makes more sense for them to have those tanks rather than the American made tanks.

      "sentences": "Good afternoon, everyone and thank you Secretary Austin for your leadership in this eighth Ukrainiancontact group in support of Ukrainian freedom. And thanks as well to all the ministers in the jobs the chiefs of defense that were here, who represented 54 different countries today a special thank you also to Ukrainian Minister of Defense, Reznikov and Deputy Chief of Defense. I had recently had an opportunity to meet with General in Poland, and General Moissac was here representing him. They all represent the exceptional bravery of the Ukrainian army, and most importantly, the Ukrainian people. This week after meeting Generals - I had an opportunity to visit some of the training and the - infantry that we are doing at - in a training area in Germany also had an opportunity to do some coordination meetings - and then attended the NATO chats military committee meeting were all members of all the tribes of NATO. I had an opportunity to meet with one of the primary topics being support to Ukraine and then of course, this week ending it today this week with the contact group. I think that over my 43 years in uniform, this is the most unified I've ever seen NATO and I've dipped in and out of NATO over many, many years. Now the war has evolved over the last 11 months. But the mission of this group this contact group under General Austin's leadership and Secretary Austin's leadership has remained the same. We are effectively committed to support Ukraine, with capabilities to defend itself against the illegal and unprovoked Russian aggression. And the word of President Biden, Secretary Austin and many other national leaders as much as it takes for as long as it takes in order to keep Ukraine free, independent, and sovereign. These contact group meetings play an important role as we support Ukraine in the Defense of its territory, and they are a clear, unambiguous demonstration of the unity and resolve of the allied nations. Yesterday, Secretary Austin just mentioned, President Biden released our 30th security assistance package signifying our continued commitment to Ukraine. This package combined with our previous one includes combined arms maneuver capabilities, with supporting artillery, equivalent to at least two combined arms maneuver brigades, or six - infantry battalions. 10 motorized infantry battalions and four artillery battalions along with a lot of other equipment. This package this U.S. package along with the allied denote donations that are indicated today signify our collective resolve in our commitment to Ukraine to protect their population from the indiscriminate Russian attacks and to provide the armor necessary to go on the offensive to liberate Russian occupied Ukraine. Additionally, this week in Germany, we began battalion and brigade collective training that I had an opportunity to visit at the Combined Arms Maneuver Training Center, here in - in support of the Ukrainian army. That training, in addition to the equipment will significantly increase Ukrainians capability to defend itself from further Russian attacks and to go on the tactical and operational offensive to liberate the occupied areas. With the training that the United States and our partners are doing the Ukrainians will advance their command and control their tactics, techniques and procedures, their ability to integrate fires with maneuver, and they will more effectively synchronize all of the combined arms in order to execute maneuver based operations. The support that we discussed today in this contact group meeting, the training that we discussed today, and the way ahead, is really an extension of what's been going on since 2014. And today signifies a very real and tangible difference in the Ukraine's efforts to defend itself. International aggression, where large countries use military force to attack small countries and change, recognize borders, cannot be allowed to stand. Eventually, President Putin, Russia will realize the full extent of their strategic miscalculation. But until Putin ends this war, his war of choice, the nations of this contact group will continue to support the Defense of Ukraine in order to uphold the rules based international order. Thank you and I to welcome to your questions.",

And how can Germany still are seen as a reliable ally, given what is widely perceived as them dragging their feet on something so simple? And for the Chairman, is there any prohibition on the use of American weapons by the Ukrainians in Crimea currently?

      "sentences": "And my first question. Typically, we're not going to discuss I don't discuss either prohibitions or permissions authorities on the use ofweapons, et cetera, that goes towards rules of engagement and we don't typically discuss those in a public forum. On the second question, President Biden, President Zelenskyy and most of the leaders of Europe have said that this war is likely to end in a negotiation. And then from a military standpoint, that's a very, very difficult fight. This fight stretches all the way from right now as the front line goes from all the way from Kharkiv, down to Kyrgyzstan. And the significant fighting ongoing and it's more or less a static front line right this minute, with the exception of Bakhmut and Soledar with a significant offensive action going on, really from both sides the distance that for the United States that are about from, I guess, Washington, D.C. to Atlanta so that is a significant amount of territory. And in that territory, are still remaining a lot of Russian forces in Russian occupied Ukraine. So, from a military standpoint, I still maintain that for this year, it would be very, very difficult to militarily eject the Russian forces from all every inch of Ukrainian occupied or Russian occupied Ukraine. That doesn't mean it can't happen, doesn't mean it won't happen. But it'd be very, very difficult. I think what can happen is a continued defense stabilizing the front; I think it's possible to clearly do that. And I think it's depending on the delivery and training of all of this equipment. I do think it's very, very possible to for the Ukrainians to run a significant tactical or even operational level offensive operation to liberate as much Ukrainian territory as possible. And then we'll see where it goes. But I do think at the end of the day, this war, like many wars in the past will end at some sort of negotiating table. And that'll be determined in terms of timing, by the leaders of both countries, both Russia and Ukraine. President Putin could end this war today, if he started it, it's his war of choice. And he could end it today, because it's turning into an absolute catastrophe for Russia, massive amounts of casualties, lots of other damage to the Russian military, et cetera. So, he should and could end this war right now right today.",

And we are training Ukrainian soldiers on maneuver and other things and specialty things here in Germany as well. So, Germany has opened continues to open its doors and make the training areas and facilities available for us to continue to do the work that we need to do. And Germany has also training troops and training battalion and brigade headquarters. So, you know, they have a big oar in the water, like the rest of the Contact Group does. And, and they're working hand in hand with the rest of our colleagues here. So, I think he just asked me earlier, if, Germany was, was a leader, was that the right question? Oh, yes, OK. Yes, they are a reliable ally. And they've been that way for a very, very long time. And I, I truly believe that they'll continue to be a reliable ally going forward. Not to mention, they have Germany is host to 39,000 of my troops and their families and also 10,000 civilians here. And so, we've had a great relationship throughout over the years.

      "sentences": "So, Dan on the, in order to execute a successful offensive operation at the tactical or operational level, which is really what we'retalking about here, for the Ukrainians, you've got to not only man, the unit, which the Ukrainians have the personnel, but they have to be trained. And so, they got to be married up with equipment, and then they got to be trained. And if you look at the weather and terrain, et cetera, you can see that you have a relatively short window of time to accomplish both those key tests. So that's very, very challenging to do that. For all these different nations that were here today, to assemble all of the equipment, get it all synchronized, get it; get the Ukrainian troops trained, et cetera. That'll be a very, very heavy lift. So confident, yes, I think it can be done. But I think that it'll be a challenge, there was no question about it. So, we'll see. I don't want to predict one way or the other. But the Ukrainian forces so far, have executed at least two and perhaps even more than that, very successful offensive operations, one up around Kharkiv, crossing the Moscow River and over into the Russian lines to the east of Kharkiv. And then they've run a very successful operation down in Kherson. So, it remains to be seen, but the equipment's got it married up with the people, the people got to get trained on the equipment, and all that's going to have to get shipped in into Ukraine et cetera, all put together inside of a coherent plan. Obviously, General --and I and others have discussed, what his visions are not an executable level detail yet, but he's working on that. And, and we'll see which way it goes. In terms of casualties, you know, the numbers of casualties in war, always suspect in, but I would tell you that the Russian casualties last time I reported out on it publicly, I said it was well over 100,000, I would say it's significantly well over 100,000. Now, so the Russians have suffered a tremendous amount of casualties in their military. And that includes their regular military and also their mercenaries in the Wagner group, and other types of forces that are fighting with the Russians. They have really suffered a lot. Now, you saw that the Russians did a call up have called out, I think, called up mobilization 300,000, I think they were able to get maybe 250,000, something that range. So, they're replacing their losses in terms of manpower, but they have suffered a huge amount. Ukraine has also suffered tremendously, you know, that there's a significant amount of innocent civilians that have been killed. And as a result of the Russian actions, the Russians are hitting civilian infrastructure. There's a significant amount of economic damage, significant amount of damage to the energy infrastructure. And the Russian or the Ukrainian military has suffered a significant amount of casualties themselves. So, this is a very, very bloody war. And there are significant casualties on both sides. And this is why I say that I think that sooner or later, this is going to have to get to a negotiating table at some point in order to bring this to a conclusion. And that will have to happen when the end state which is a free sovereign, independent Ukraine with his territory in --. When that day comes when people sit down and negotiate an end to this, but there's been a huge amount of suffering on both sides.",

We also have White House reporter Natasha Bertrand in Washington. Nic, what they didn't really talk about in their official statements. In fact, they didn't talk about at all was the question on the leopard tanks. The Germany has again not decided on whether they will send Donetsk, the U.S. saying that they will not be sending Abrams tanks.

      "sentences": "I think one of the big and important parts of the messaging came quite high up from SecretaryAustin, he said several times that the need in Ukraine is urgent. So that was one of my big takeaways that the reminder there that this is work that needs to be done that this equipment needs to go urgently, all the military equipment, the military equipment, he specified as what they could best use this time for what they need. And the other word that he used a lot there was unity. He multiple times talked about, you know, this being the eighth session of this contact group, that there was building unity that there was momentum towards greater unity, because obviously what sort of the way that this meeting has been set up or not set up but cast as really disunity between the United States and Germany and over the issue of tanks. And he was very clear that he said that Germany just has not taken that decision yet. So, the emphasis here is on the urgent need is on unity. But it was very interesting listening to General Mark Milley say that essentially, that this war is going to go on beyond this year that Ukraine won't be able to take back the territories that it wants. And of course, he is a general who has been quite forward in talking about the need to get to a negotiating table. Perhaps the other takeaway is the sheer scale of what Ukraine is getting in terms of you know, when it's talked about rather than in numbers of pieces of equipment, 350 up armored Humvees, 90 strikers, Bradley Fighting Vehicles when it's set up in terms of sort of brigades or battalions, battalion of equipment worth of equipment coming from Sweden, for example, and all the other nations. It's a huge amount of equipment. And you begin to see that Ukraine, as, as General Milley said can operate tactically, but really to be effective as a modern army with all this modern equipment is going to need to be a lot more joined up. So, the big takeaway is the decision on tanks yet to be firmed up, that this fight is going to go on for a long time. And really Ukraine is only in the process of building the army that's ultimately going to do the job that they want it to do that we're told there is the support to do.",

The U.S. says it's doing what it can, it reiterated just how much aid it's been offering Ukraine. And it seems that the question on the tanks keeps on coming up, because that is a sticking point, not so much in terms of what impact it could have on the ground, but in terms of the relations between the U.S. and Germany, which is becoming interesting.",

Now, some countries, primarily Eastern European countries, countries like Finland, for example, they believe that what Ukraine could really use now are these tanks. Because they represent one of the most important and direct offensive weapons that Ukraine could use to potentially drive Russians out of their territory, because the Ukrainians are also of course, not getting those longer-range missiles that they have been asking for. So, tank seem to be, according to many European officials that we speak to one of the most effective things that they could use to drive Russians out of their territory. But of course, we see that this is causing a lot of heartburn in Berlin, for moral reasons, for historical reasons. They just are very wary of sending those tanks to the Ukrainians right now and are really not willing to do so. We are told, without coordination with the United States on this, they want to be seen as being in lockstep with the U.S. when it comes to sending those tanks. So, it really remains to be seen whether this changes because of course, the Germans are still considering it. They have not said that it is completely off the table. But those you know, Europeans, like the polls, for example and the fence, they're really itching to send these leopard tanks that they have in their inventory to Ukraine.

He's trying to play it all down. Yet on the other hand, you have people like the former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev saying, no one's going to take on and crush the Russian, the Russian state. And if they do, we use nuclear weapons. So, you know, raising the threat there. What the Kremlin has been doing is trying to play every piece of military equipment that is sent to Ukraine as a NATO threat against Russia, because that's what it requires to mobilize its population to go and die in Ukraine. They don't want to go there and fight and die for Putin's belief that Ukraine is part of Russia. But if the Kremlin can convince them that they at home in their homes in Moscow will be under threat from NATO, then that can be a motivating force. And perhaps that's part of why we're beginning to see some air defense systems being put on the roofs of government buildings in Moscow. It conveys that message, the Russian population that you're under threat; commit your sons, your daughters, your husbands, et cetera to the frontline in Ukraine.

He joins us now from Florida via Skype to help shed light on this. You know, this has been making the rounds. And I was asking myself am I shocked that oil companies could have known about this as far back as the 1970s. You've concluded that ExxonMobil did accurately predict global warming. They've downplayed this; they've denied perhaps plausible deniability. Are you surprised by the findings? And that's something perhaps could have been done decades ago. GEOFFREY SUPRAN, LEAD AUTHOR, \"ASSESSING EXXONMOBIL'S GLOBAL WARMING PROJECTIONS\": Hi Eleni, thanks for having me. Yes, of course, in some sense, I think along the same lines, as you, you know, we had no reason to be surprised because we and other scholars and journalists have been investigating Exxon's history on climate change for a number of years. And so, we knew going into this, broadly speaking, that the company has had a broad involvement in climate science research for decades. But I have to say that the first time I extracted and plotted all of Exxon's global warming predictions on one graph. And then overlaid real world historical observed temperatures and you see all of Exxon's curves line up right on or around that that curves of reality it really took my breath away. Because you know, that chart and our statistical analysis of it show that Exxon didn't just vaguely know something about global warming decades ago. They knew as much as anybody as independent, academic and government scientists, specifically, they knew that burning fossil fuels would heat our planet by 0.2 degrees Celsius, every single decade. And so, in that sense, arguably, they knew all they needed to know, more than a decade before I was even born, of course, only to then spend almost my entire lifetime attacking that very climate science.",

But then it comes to question in terms of the action to hold ExxonMobil accountable for its impact on climate change and the fact that they knew and look, here's the reality, oil companies, mining companies, they employ environmental impact. Scientists, they take a look at what the impacts are. Now, it's a rule that you have to have EIA done within your business operations. But surely there needs to be some sort of change a chain of responsibility here.",

And that is green washing 101, talk green and act dirty. And so unfortunately, their response to our study is frankly, just a distraction from what is really just black and white data, their own data that shows what they knew and when.",

But you know, to put it frankly, ExxonMobil is nowmisleading the public about its history of misleading the public, because their response, simply blanket saying that we're wrong, is afraid just not how science works. You know, what we've done, in a way is extremely straightforward. We have taken the company's own global warming predictions. We plotted them together on a graph. And then we've overlaid historical observations. And they line up both visually and statistically. And so, in that sense, this is an open and show case, and they can't just dismiss our data with they're wrong. Again, I'm not a lawyer, but the impression I get from those I speak to is that this sort of quantitative evidence that can literally put a number on and paint a picture of how Exxon knew and misled may be compelling in both courts and the courts of public opinion.",

Deception, in simple terms is what did they know? And then how did they act? And what did they say with that knowledge? And so, by bringing statistical rigor to the early climate knowledge and contrasting that against with decades of climate denial, we strengthen the case that ExxonMobil misled the public and policymakers.",

Hastings changed the way we watch movies and television by creating Netflix more than 25 years ago. The company reported its fourth quarter results saying growth is accelerating thanks to original content like Harry and Megan. Netflix added more than 7 million subscribers during the fourth quarter now more than 230 million around the world. CNN's Paula Monica joining us, it's an end of an era interesting that he says that even CEOs and founders need to evolve. What does this mean for Netflix? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: Yes. I'm not sure it marks that dramatic of a change to be honest, Eleni because for one Reed Hastings is staying at Netflix and he's now at the executive chairman level. So, he's arguably even a bigger boss than he was, as a Co-CEO, this would be more of a shock if it was, hey, there might be a job opening at Disney when Bob Iger re- retires, and Reed Hastings decided to go there. That would obviously be something that would completely upset the streaming media landscape. And that, of course, is not happening. So, I think this is really more an evolution at Netflix and it's a sign. As we've seen with their earnings results, there was a lot of flak that the company took when they finally caved if you will, and announced that they were adopting a lower price service with ads. Subscriber growth seems to suggest that they are gaining new customers for that product and that people with existing premium subscriptions are trading down because on the conference call, they said the executives that they did not see evidence that existing long term subscribers were opting for that cheaper plan. They were sticking with the premium one. So, I think that's great news for Netflix, if they're gaining new customers and keeping the older ones at that higher price point.",
