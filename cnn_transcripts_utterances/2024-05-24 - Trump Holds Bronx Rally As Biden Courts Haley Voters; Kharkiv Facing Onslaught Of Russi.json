How does the Biden campaign thread this needle?

This is just southwest of Oklahoma City. Look at the multiple little vortexes that are wrapping around the base of this tornado, really fascinating to see that. And I'm sure scientists, meteorologists will be studying that video footage because that shows the initial formation stages of a tornado, what causes the environment to spin up a deadly tornado? Or at least a dangerous tornado? Seventy-six tornado reports since Sunday, the active streak continues. In fact, it's not just tornadoes. We've got baseball size hail stones falling from the sky as well out of Oklahoma. Here's today's threat. This is part of a multi-day severe weather threat that covers over 80 million Americans. Chicago, all the way to Dallas, Little Rock in Memphis included in that greatest probability of tornadoes exists across the northern sections of Illinois and southern portions of Wisconsin. We are way above average year to date in terms of tornado numbers across the U.S. and we'll likely add to that through the course of this Memorial Day weekend. Here's our active weather now we have severe thunderstorm watches that are valid through about 8:00 a.m. central time. I want to focus in on a storm that's rocking Little Rock right now, line of severe weather still impacting portions of central Arkansas and then it won't stop today. Tomorrow, we already have an enhanced risk. This time across the central and Southern Plains, large hail tornadoes possible north of Oklahoma City and then that threat shifts a little further to the north and east, including St. Louis, Cincinnati, and portions of Nashville for Sunday.
