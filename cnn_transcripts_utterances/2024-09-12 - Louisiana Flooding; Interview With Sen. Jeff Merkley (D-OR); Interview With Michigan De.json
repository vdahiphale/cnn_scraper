He will give a fiery speech this hour. We will bring it to you live. And a daring and historic feat hundreds of miles above Earth, a four- person crew of civilians completing the first ever commercial space walk. Hello. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and you're in the CNN NEWSROOM. Today, the candidates are back out there on the campaign trail stumping in key battleground states. Vice President Kamala Harris is delivering remarks in North Carolina, a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat at the top of the ticket since 2008. Donald Trump is in Arizona fresh off what he says was his best debate yet. But many of his top allies say otherwise. Today, they're in damage control, telling CNN that his performance was at best a wash and at worst a loss. And they're also trying to downplay what could be a key voter turnout issue, Taylor Swift endorsing Kamala Harris. Trump's running mate is claiming the pop superstar is -- quote -- \"fundamentally disconnected from the problems of most Americans.\" But rather than respond to those attacks, Taylor Swift is encouraging her fans to get out and vote. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Right.So, today, we're going to see Donald Trump in Tucson, Arizona, as you mentioned, his first rally since that debate. The event is being billed by his campaign it's focusing on Latino voters. We know, tomorrow, he's also going to have an event in Las Vegas which is supposed to be geared toward his messaging on the economy. We will see if he sticks to it. But, look, these are two issues from my conversations with people behind the scenes, Trump's advisers, his allies, that they say they wish he talked about more and messaged better on Tuesday night on that debate stage. When -- even though you're hearing -- and you mentioned this -- Donald Trump, what, publicly saying that he had the best date debate performance of his life that he thought he won the debate, people within his orbit do not agree. They have been arguing to me that he -- she clearly won delivery and style, but also that they're frustrated that he did not deliver on many of the talking points that they had spent weeks preparing. Our own Kaitlan Collins had even reported he did more preparation for this debate than he did for the debate in June against Joe Biden. Now, when I talk to these advisers, they say, look, it was clear he was distracted, he got derailed. But that was exactly what they did not want him to do. And so I think these events are trying to get him back on message and talking about the things that they wanted him to talk about, again, the economy, immigration, crime, all things they think he got thrown off on, on Tuesday. Now, we did hear directly from one of these people, RFK Jr. Ever since his endorsement of Donald Trump, he's become a top Trump campaign surrogate. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Vice President Harris clearly won the debate in terms of her delivery, her polish, her organization, and her preparation. I think, on substance, President Trump wins in terms of his governance. And -- but he didn't tell that story. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And one of the clear things that just is underlying all of this, I have been told, is that they think there were missed opportunities. And so I think that's something they're currently reconciling.",

They're reminding people who Donald Trump is, who he was as president, and who he will be if we let him back in the White House. And we know that things like refusing to say he won't veto a national abortion ban and other things that he said at that debate are not the things that people of Michigan want to hear.

I am neutral on this question about the long-range missiles being used further into Russia. Russia has talked about using more dangerous weapons and an allusion to the possibility of nuclear weapons.
