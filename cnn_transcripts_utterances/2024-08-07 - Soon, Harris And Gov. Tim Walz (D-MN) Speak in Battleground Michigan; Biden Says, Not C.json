The problem is that the reason why January 6th happened is because former President Trump doesn't believe that the 2020 election was valid and he continues to tell his supporters that it wasn't, continuing to sow doubt over the last four years.One way to ensure that we have a peaceful transfer of power, whoever it is, is for Donald Trump to accept the election results of 2020, but he won't, normal, his running mate, normal, many people in the Republican Party. So, I am grateful to the humble servants that run the elections and election workers, some that were under attack because of Donald Trump and the threats that they received, like Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss. We don't have to be that we don't have to have doubts in our elections, but it does start with leadership. And Donald Trump is one of the reasons why so many people have doubt. And he's already laying the foundation for people to question it now. I hope we do not have a repeat of January 6th, but it is going to take people to stand up to Donald Trump and J.D.

I mean, that is as moderate and independent as it comes.And so I think what you are seeing is that it's not a vulnerability. It's an opportunity. The policies of the Vice President Harris and Governor Walz stand for are feeding hungry children, protecting children, making sure that there's a booming economy in the state of Minnesota but across the country.

Now, with Hezbollah, potentially a rogue actor doing their own thing in all of this, it remains to be seen if that's wishful thinking. Someone did put it to the U.N. mission of the Iranian U.N. Mission, and they basically said somewhat ambiguously, we're pursuing two objectives here, one, to get a ceasefire and, two, to punish the aggressors of this attack that killed Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas' political leaders.

And it seems like perhaps Iran is going to seize this opportunity to take credit for a ceasefire, if it can bring that pressure to bear. That is a long, long ways away for now, but it could provide an opportunity for the United States, which has been pressuring the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to agree to a ceasefire, to have even more ammo, to make their case to him.And it comes at a time when today we are hitting now ten months since this war began, since more than 240 hostages were taken captive by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, and the families of the hostages are also bringing more pressure to bear, urging the Israeli prime minister to seize this moment and accusing him of obstructing this deal, saying that he is continuing to thwart a deal, and in doing so, sentencing their family members to death. The Israeli prime minister's office, for its part, said today that, look, it's already given its response to the latest talks and now the ball is in Hamas' court. We know that Hamas also this past week put Yahya Sinwar as its top leader. Sinwar was Hamas' leader in Gaza. He is viewed as a more extreme figure, a more militant figure, and so that does not bode well for ceasefire talks either. But we have yet to see exactly how that will impact the talks. What is clear for now is that the Israeli prime minister in this latest round of responses Did put several 11th hour demands that were unlikely to be accepted by Hamas. And what's also clear is that if there is the possibility of a ceasefire here, it could dramatically lower the temperature in a region that seems like it's just a few degrees away from boiling over.

From your experience, what do you think makes him the best pick to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate? GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO):  Well, I served with Tim for ten years in the House as colleagues, and we were elected governor the same year, and he's been very active in our National Governors' Association, which I'm honored to chair. You know, Tim brings deep integrity to this position. He is what he says he is. He wears it on his sleeve. He's wonderful, right? This is a -- he served 24 years in the U.S. military. He actually was a ranking member of the Veterans Committee in his heart. He really has a strong place for our country's veterans. I played on the congressional baseball team with him. You know, he needs to practice a little bit in baseball. I think football is his main sport. But let me tell you, this is a guy that Americans can be proud of as our vice president.

Barak, what are you hearing from your sources and you have very good ones about how soon Hezbollah potentially could strike and what that could actually look like? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Hi, Wolf. Well, Israeli officials don't know exactly when Hezbollah is going to strike. They know it is a matter of days until this happens, and they're very concerned that Hezbollah is going to target military basis in central Israel, including in Tel Aviv, including the IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv, maybe the Mossad headquarters in northern Tel Aviv, and maybe other intelligence bases in Northern Tel Aviv. They are concerned about that also because there are many civilian neighborhoods in the area and they're concerned that Hezbollah is not going to be able to fire accurately and it will hit civilian population, Israeli civilian population, and Israeli officials are telling me that they told the U.S. both to the Pentagon and to the U.S. Central Command, that if this is the case, if Hezbollah fires missiles and eight Israeli civilians, the IDF will conduct this proportionate response against Hezbollah in Lebanon.",

I think this is also one of the diplomatic efforts that the U.S. and other countries are going to Israel, for example, French President Macron spoke to Netanyahu, but this just several hours ago, telling the Israelis, listen, we know that you are going to respond to whatever Hezbollah and Iranians do, but you need to cal this response and manage to contain it as much as possible.",

Let's get details from our chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh. Nick, what can you tell us? What's the latest yeah.NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT Wolf, according to Russian officials, this is indeed the Ukrainian regular military launching now for two days and encouraging across border into Russia, near a town called Sudzha. Now, they appear to have gotten inside that town according to videos that we're seeing, the mayor of it describing the situation is very tense. Now, Russia's president Vladimir Putin has called this a major provocation, even claim famed that these Ukrainian forces have been indiscriminately firing potentially in residential areas. Exactly what Russians have been doing in Ukraine for years, but it's a huge embarrassment and his chief of staffs claim that the advance has been halted. Well, that's not really backed up by the videos that we've been seeing that show Ukrainian forces spread over quite a wide area. While we can't entirely verify even suggesting they've taken a substantial number of Russian servicemen as prisoner. Why now? Well, Ukraine is urgently needed, frankly, some good news for them from the front lines. This may be it. It may also distract Russia's forces from the Donbas region, having to rush reinforcements to stop this embarrassment. And remember, Ukraine has had nothing but bad news from Donbas where the Russians are advancing very steadily burn a very consistent rate. But there are also some suggestions that perhaps the target for Ukrainian forces here is indeed a gas terminal on the border that helps gas gets shipped from Russia through Ukraine to Europe. Unclear quite what the fate of that terminal is right now, it may be in Ukrainian hands. But, look, this is a stark move. It seems by Ukraine's forces or Kyiv has not said rarely a word about this at all but it does suggest indeed that Ukraine is trying a new tactic here as it clearly falters and other parts of the front-line, Wolf.",
