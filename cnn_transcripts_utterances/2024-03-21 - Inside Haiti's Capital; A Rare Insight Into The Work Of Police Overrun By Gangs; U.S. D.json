Haiti's hell, a rare insight into the work of police in a capital city overrun by gangs. Cut to the core, the U.S. Department of Justice accusing Apple of using its grip on the global smartphone market to raise prices and hurt rivals. And a Shohei showtime scandal, the baseball superstar's long-time friend and interpreter fired amid accusations of a massive theft. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, still without a functioning government, still racked by violence with gangs controlling most of the territory.

And when you're with Haiti's national police force, one that is facing struggle and setback and diminishing resources, you realize just what they're up against, and that is constant gang activity. We're driving through areas that are highly contested between different gangs and the police. And they're trying to hold them back time after time. And yet, these attacks are constant and they come at all hours. The police often, especially with armored vehicles like this, are able to push them back. The issue comes in holding that space and keeping it secure. They don't have enough resources to do that. Many of them have told us that's where an international mission would help. As of now, though, they have to go in, push back, and then move on to other areas where gang activity has broken out. It's incredible to be inside this tank of sorts and to realize just how much it has seen. Evidence of that is along the windows.

But limiting our ability to move elsewhere, to communicate with other people, is not in the consumer interest.

I'm sitting in this beautiful new headquarters building here in Lincoln, Nebraska, because we're actually a spin-out of the university in Nebraska. And we've been building smaller and smaller and smaller robots really in support of our mission, which is quite audacious really, it's to make every operating room robot ready. So, we knew we needed to get small. There's great mainframe robots pioneered by companies like Intuitive Surgical on the market today, and they've done incredible work. But we know if you want to get to the other 90 percent of ORs and the other 90 percent of procedures that don't today have access to such robotic devices, we need it to be small and portable and be able to have easy setup and be able to form this type of minimally invasive surgery in any setting.",

So, the key statistic there was that 90 percent of U.S. operating rooms don't have access to this minimally invasive surgery todaybecause the setup is complex, it requires dedicated space.

But it can be set up in 10 minutes in any operating room. It doesn't need draping. And our first procedure, we consider the marquee procedure in soft tissue surgery is in colon resection, which is a multi-quadrant procedure. So, even out the gate here, we're going to be performing multi-quadrant surgery and have further indications for things like gynecology, surgery, hysterectomy, and the like, and further work in general surgery for hernia repair and gallbladder removal. So, we're just at the start of this journey, but I think it's a very exciting path forward.",

But, you know, to be able to, you know, survive the robustness of a rocket launch on a Falcon 9, and then to have six surgeons be able to perform simulated surgery tasks, all sitting here in Lincoln, up on the space station was tremendous. But it leads us to one day thinking about remote surgery across all types of environments. It could be a rural setting in the United States where you have a specialist at our hub and a simplified robotic setup at the patient's side. But also, you know, on mission work and in any operating room. That's our longer-term vision, you know, from making every OR robot ready.",

As you say, we knew that Shohei Ohtani was going to bea massive story in Major League Baseball this season, but we couldn't have imagined that this would be the story. He is one of the most talented players of all time. He's being paid $700 million by the Dodgers. But after Wednesday's season opener, he became caught up in something potentially quite serious. Let's start with how the Dodgers are presenting it. This is what they're saying. Otani's long-time interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara, has been fired over what is being described as massive theft. But the story initially was a bit different to that. Ohtani's spokesman originally told ESPN that Ohtani sent money to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts. But later, Ohtani's lawyers said that their client was a victim of this massive theft. This all played out on the first day of the new season. It initially came to light because federal investigators are looking into an illegal gambling operation in California. That was first reported by the L.A. Times. According to ESPN, Ohtani wired $4.5 million to the alleged bookmaking operation. Mizuhara originally told ESPN in a pretty lengthy interview that the transfers were to cover his losses. He said that Ohtani had \"zero involvement\" in the betting and none of the bets were on baseball. Mizuhara also told the ESPN that he didn't know gambling was illegal in California. And whilst Ohtani wasn't happy about his debt, he decided to pay it off for him. But as ESPN were getting to ready to publish the story on Wednesday, Ohtani's lawyers sent out this statement saying, \"In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities.\" Then on Wednesday, Mizuhara walked back much of what he just told ESPN saying Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling activities debts or efforts to repay them. CNN is attempting to contact Mizuhara, no comment yet from Major League Baseball. Mizuhara was in the dugout for Wednesday's season opener against the Padres. He was seen smiling and talking to Ohtani. He even did some translating for him. But Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers after the story came out. And I suspect, Julia, that this is just the beginning. I think there's lots more that we're going to hear about this, and it has the potential to be an absolutely massive baseball story.",
