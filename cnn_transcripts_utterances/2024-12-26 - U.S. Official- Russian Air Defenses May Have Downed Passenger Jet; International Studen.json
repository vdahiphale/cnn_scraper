A U.S. official tells CNN early indications suggest it was Putin's forces who may have taken down a passenger jet, killing dozens as Russian state TV tries to shift blame. Plus, a quote, it's a scary time. Countless international students now scrambling to make it back to major universities across the U.S. before Trump takes office. Why? I'll talk to one of those students. And the Trumpian Democrat. Meet the man who's embracing comparisons to the president-elect as he tries to become the next Democratic Party leader. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight: shot down. According to a U.S. official, early indications are that a Russian anti-aircraft system may have taken down a passenger jet, killing at least 38 people. Now, this is really terrifying video of the jets final moments that you're seeing here. You can see it plunging toward the ground in Kazakhstan and then bursting into flames. Miraculously, 29 people actually survived that fiery crash, including children. Huge questions though, now, with multiple investigations underway, here is what we know. The flight took off from Azerbaijan around 7:55 yesterday morning. Around 9:43, Kazakhstan says it received word from Russia the flight was being diverted. A Russian dispatcher claiming it was because of a control systems failure. Forty-five minutes later, the plane went down. Russia's state TV was quick to raise one possible explanation for the crash -- birds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The flight record shows the aircraft diverted off its scheduled route to crash on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea. Experts are now scouring for clues into the cause of the crash, as families of those on board await answers.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  As investigators race to determine the cause of the deadly Azerbaijan airlines plane crash. Early indications suggest that a Russian anti-aircraft system may be responsible, a U.S. official told CNN. The aircraft was traveling from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian republic of Chechnya when it attempted an emergency landing in Kazakhstan. The crash occurred shortly after Ukraine fired drones nearby at southern Russia, possibly leading Russia's defense systems to inadvertently strike the aircraft, the official said. Video from on board the flight shows panicked passengers praying and holes visible in the body of the aircraft. The source of the apparent damage has not been confirmed. The airline and Russia's federal air transport agency initially told local media the aircraft crashed after it collided with a flock of birds, an account disputed by Ukrainian counter disinformation official Andriy Kovalenko. Russian state media also reported that the plane had been rerouted due to heavy fog around Chechnya's capital. Several investigations have been opened, including one by a joint commission involving representatives from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Russia. ILHAM ALIYEV, AZERBAIJAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The commission's task is to fully investigate the matter, the causes and all the details of the accident and to inform both me and the people of Azerbaijan.",

Now, the official wasn't able to say what kind of system it was, but Russia certainly has a number of air defense systems capable of downing a commercial jet. And in fact, we have seen this before.It was a decade ago that a Russian air defense system operated by Russian backed separatists in eastern Ukraine shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight 17, killing those on board. So we have seen an example of something like this. Now, it's worth noting that just hours before this crash took place, there was a Ukrainian drone attack on this area in southern Russia. And defense experts have said that Russia's air defenses were active. So that very much raises the possibility that Russia, in trying to defend against a drone attack, may have mistaken a passenger airliner for some sort of attack on Russia, and in doing so, fired upon the commercial airliner. The U.S. official I spoke with said this if it proves correct, if it was a Russian air defense system shows the lack of training of Russian units who were unable to defend against a Russian drone -- rather a Ukrainian drone attack. So, Kate, more information on this as the investigations continue and as the U.S. continues to look into this.",

It took about a year and a half for a joint investigative committee to come up with a conclusion that it was the Russians. They -- the West, put together some not terribly effective sanctions. And in the meantime, Germany signed the Nord Stream II agreement that put a new Russian gas pipeline through to Europe. So the conclusion that Putin had to come to was there isn't much of a penalty at this point. We have put so many sanctions on Russia since the war began, nearly three years ago, that it's hard to imagine what more at this point the West would do. So other than the public condemnation, I wouldn't expect much of a penalty.",

And if you look at the damage to the aircraft that we have so far, and of course all we can see at this point is the tail section. But if the impact was mostly in the tail section, it would have avoided the fuel cells. It would have avoided the engines. All of the critical parts of keeping the aircraft flying were avoided.And if that's the case, then that missile would have just struck in the tail. And that would indicate to that. That's why we've lost the flight control, indicating that he's lost flight controls that could have been from a hydraulic leak caused by the -- by the impact as well. So it makes sense to me that, that that missile would have just hit in the rear section of the aircraft and it would have been able to continue to fly. But regarding where it went, I think its important to point out that the first alternate airport that they had was closed that day, and whether they had planned to use it or not.

Had we not neutralized that, it would have been very damaging to U.S. Air Force and U.S. naval aviation capabilities.So GPS jamming can impact commercial aviation as well as military aviation, and it can really throw aircraft, off course, if it's not accounted for.

And that is one Trump adviser's interpretation of some of what Donald Trump has been saying this week. They argued that Donald Trump wants to force these foreign leaders to the table to try and, one, bolster U.S. trade and put America in a better position as it comes to trade, but also with this idea of trying to curb both China and Russia's influence on the global stage. Now, for Panama, for example, Donald Trump's overarching goal, this adviser told me, is really to try and get lower prices for passage of American vessels in the canal. They said, quote, so that American companies have an easier time. He also believes that Chinese companies are controlling too many ports in the Panama Canal, and that's effectively giving them a lot of control over which vessels can go through, which ships can pass through, as well as control over a lot of the pricing. So that is one big part of why Donald Trump has been so fixated on this, I'm told, as it relates to Greenland. He believes that having some control over Greenland and over the territory would curb Russia's influence in the Arctic Region. Again, kind of playing back to that whole idea of wanting to really kneecap China and Russia where they can and try to exert the United States dominance as a global leader and paint himself as a strongman. Now, one thing as well that I found really interesting in some of my conversations with sources close to Donald Trump, Kate, is that they told me that this isn't the first time Donald Trump has been fixated on this. For example, with Panama, he brought up the Panama Canal in an August interview with Tucker Carlson on X, where essentially he said that he believed then-President Jimmy Carter made a mistake in signing this treaty and giving control of the Panama Canal to Panama. And it's something that he's brought up since then as well, I'm told. So, again, just to take a step back, all of this is, I'm told, part of a negotiating tactic. It's still unclear, you know, how serious he is about following through on some of these threats, but he does want to use this to try and bolster the United States position -- Kate.",
