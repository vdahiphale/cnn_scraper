And so we have things like volcanic salt, rocks that likely formed deep in the interior of Mars from magma. Then we transitioned from that crater floor into the sedimentary deposits and now we`re here in sandstones, conglomerates, mud stones, the kinds of rocks that are deposited by flowing water.",

The island nation gained independence from the U.K. in 1968. Now, Mauritius is an island nation that`s closely linked to its vast ebony forest. Historically, these durable black hardwood trees were used for building furniture, cabinets, even piano keys. But now, conservationists are doing reservation initiatives, looking to save the forest along with its exotic bird species. Our Zane Asher has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAIN ASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some 12,000 miles of the southeastern coast of Africa in the middle of the Indian Ocean lies the island where the iconic dodo bird once roamed. Centuries after its extinction, the flightless bird is still inextricably linked with the African nation of Mauritius. You can find it on banknotes, coins and the country`s coat of arms. Today, Dr. Nicolas Zuel and his team of conservationists are working hard to ensure other endemic species don`t go the way of the dodo. DR. NICOLAS ZUEL, CONSERVATION MANAGER, EBONY FOREST: Before human beings came to Mauritius, the forest would look like what you see around us.",
