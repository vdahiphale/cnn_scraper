      "sentences": "Bianca, the Pentagon says they've been tracking this for several days. Now, when it first crossed into the U.S. over U.S. airspace coming in from Canada into Montana, the Pentagon did launch F-22 fighter jets. In the end, the decision was made not to shoot it down, that's because of a couple of reasons.First, the threat to facilities and people on the ground and then second, the Pentagon officials say that this isn't some new Chinese capability that gives them something that their spy satellites haven't already given them. So because of that, at least for now, the decision was made by President Joe Biden and top military leaders not to shoot this down. But it is concerning where it is? Montana may be relatively empty. But it is a site of U.S. military facilities that house ballistic missile fields. So that is something worth keeping an eye on here. The Pentagon says it did travel over some sensitive sites but wouldn't detail what those sites are, in terms of the timing of this first, depending on keeps tracking this to see which way it goes in and what happens to it essentially? If it goes back over Canada comes down somewhere just keeps on floating. But also, if the decision has to be made at some point to go shoot this down to the Pentagon keeping military options on the table at this point. The timing again, it comes at a very sensitive time with high tensions between Beijing and Washington. Secretary of State Antony Blinken set to travel to Beijing in the coming days or weeks, one of the first visits by the top U.S. diplomat in six years to China. So this very well will probably be high on the agenda adding to the tensions that are already there. This was raised through diplomatic channels both in Washington and Beijing. China seems being a bit coy with their response, seeing the look into what the U.S. has said about this, as the U.S. tries to make its own decision and watches where this goes, Bianca.",

And the reason for that is of course, the Russians withdrew to the other side of the Dnieper River, which gives them a natural line of defense and they have installed grads, mortars, tanks.We've seen tanks fire straight across the river there, you can it's almost within small arms range some of the locations there. So it's an obvious target for the continued Russian campaign to try to break the spirit of the Ukrainian civilian population. And we're seeing that extended perhaps up in Kramatorsk, where my colleague, Fred Pleitgen yesterday had a very close call himself with an S 300 modified missile impacting on the same or similar location to another missile earlier on and gain a clear sign of indiscriminate shelling. In that case, a town closer to the much more active fighting and the frontline in the Donbas, but in Kherson, it's really a war of attrition. There is a fire from the Ukrainian side back across the river. No real anticipation, I don't think that either side would try to assault in any earnest terms across that river. But we are getting these intelligence reports from the Ukrainian saying that they believe the Russians are likely to launch a pretty violent campaign somewhere over the next few weeks, Bianca.",

His delegation is getting off the plane there. And President Salva Kiir is there at the airport to greet him and we're just waiting, I think for the Pope to get off the plane.And Pope Francis is hoping to bring attention to the young country's struggles including civil war, famine and floods. This comes after the pope received a warm welcome in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In addition to meeting the country's leaders and clergy, the pontiff met with victims of the ongoing civil war there. And he says that their stories left him without words.

And in that period, about 4000 people are believed to have died; almost 5 million people are displaced either within the country or within neighboring countries. And this builds on something that the Pope did in 2019. I want to show you this video from April of 2019 when the Pope hosted religious and political leaders from South Sudan and he kissed their feet, implored them to find a way to work together to peace. And in that time, the number of people dying has reduced but still they just haven't found a way to really stop the violence completely, Bianca.",

And he was very active on social media and then anti-mafia investigators here in Italy are constantly looking at this, looking at the people who are still most wanted, still looking for people who are on the run.

Those materials were said to be at the lower end of the classification spectrum. But as more and more sensitive materials are discovered where they shouldn't be. The National Archives has formally requested that Former Presidents and Vice Presidents check their personal records again for any errant documents that might be in their possession.

MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENTKeep in mind that it's not unusual for nations to always keep watch on each other. So this is attention getting, but it's not necessarily novel. But there are other things that could be discussed. Certainly, the military buildup in the Philippines an issue we talked about yesterday, it really shows the U.S. is beefing up its presence in the Asia Pacific region. But there are other things that can be talked about things that may actually lead to some agreements such as climate change, such as global health. Those are areas where actually we could see some substantive discussion. But then there is what I will call stress points, points that may not be so easy to have a diplomatic discussion about. And as I look at the list I've created we've got semiconductors, we've talked a lot about the import and export of semiconductors, the war in Ukraine, certainly a dominating headline, especially with China's relationship with Russia. We also have human rights and treatment of the Uyghurs. That's something that the Secretary of State has talked about before. And then of course, we have the looming issues with Taiwan and with trade. So it's a full list, a full grocery store list, if you will be ongoing issues that could come up for conversation.",

Secretary Blinken can pick up the phone and talk to his counterpart in China and at least have diplomatic discussion moving, because right now, that's just not happening.

The agreement is expected to be signed later this year in Washington after the transfer of power in Sudan to a civilian government. Sudan was part of the original Abraham accords normalizing Israeli relations with the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco.But the military coup in Sudan in 2021 stalled the final steps of the process with Khartoum. Recent outbreaks of deadly violence in Israel and the West Bank are shaking a region already on edge. CNN's Nic Robertson talked to one father whose family got caught in the middle of an Israeli Military raid in Jenin. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (on camera): So the soldiers came on to the roof of your house here. ROBERTSON (voice over): From the roof of his Jenin apartment. Mohammed Abu al-Hija shows me where Israeli troops fought a three-hour battle with Palestinian gunmen just a few feet away. MOHAMMED ABU AL-HIJA, JENIN APARTMENT RESIDENT: The whole house here was surrounded by Israeli troops. ROBERTSON (voice over): It was Thursday last week. The Raid killed 10 people, 7 of them Palestinian gunmen. One of the deadliest such West Bank operations in years, Mohammed thought he and his family might die too, because Israeli troops took over his apartment to fight the gunman. He shows where he says two soldiers shot from his window. ROBERTSON (on camera): --see all the bullet holes along the wall. ROBERTSON (voice over): They've spent bullet casings he says testimony to the ferocity of the firefight. He says the soldiers tied his hands behind his back, ordered him and his wife to get on the floor cover their two daughters is. ROBERTSON (on camera): This is one of the bullets that came into your room right here. ROBERTSON (voice over): The gunman began firing back at the Israeli soldiers hitting the wall and the door while he, his wife and his two- year-old and one-year-old daughters lay terrified on the floor. He thinks at least one soldier was it. AL-HIJA: So they cut this out here and there they're looking right over the house. This is the house they target. ROBERTSON (voice over): In his bedroom and he shows where he says the soldiers cut the bars of his window. ROBERTSON (on camera): And they fired the rocket from here on blast back here. ROBERTSON (voice over): The whole place shook he says there were three rockets. It was so loud. We were terrified. ROBERTSON (on camera): The Israeli Military say it was an urgent mission that when they arrived here their troops came under heavy fire those they returned fire. They say the suspects barricaded themselves in the house here so they fired a shoulder launch anti-tank missile at them. ROBERTSON (voice over): The buildings so damaged local officials had it bulldozed using apartments like Mohammed's to give covering fire is standard operating procedure. And Israeli Military Spokesman told CNN so that the action can be more precise. U.N. officials say the incident breaches international law. In the ground floor apartment beneath Mohammed, Ziad says he saw the firefight saw an Israeli soldier hide behind his car, shoot one of the gunmen. [08:25:00] ROBERTSON (voice over): This is the worst I've seen it much worse than the 2002 rates he says. There are lots more gunmen on the streets now. It's a younger generation. They were born into it. Upstairs Mohammed is close to tears when I asked him how safe he feels. We're not safe, not safe for a moment after what happened, he says. If they had killed me, no one would hold them accountable. You have to be very cautious. Despite the battle scars, it might look as if some kind of normality is returning. But in people's hearts here, there is fear. The worst is yet to come. Nic Robertson, CNN, Jenin camp, the West Bank. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
