Last week, Claudine Gay submitted corrections to two articles she published back in 2001 in 2017.But a CNN review found even clearer examples of plagiarism in her earlier work, including her dissertation back in 1997.",

      "sentences": "Boris and Brianna, Claudine Gay remains very much in the hot seat. Her writings are under intense scrutiny.And now Congress is cranking up the pressure here. The House Education and Workforce Committee is launching a review into these allegations over plagiarism. They're demanding answers from Harvard officials. And they're alleging that there is a double standard here. Let me read you what a House chair, Virginia Foxx, wrote in a letter. She said, quote, \"If a university is willing to look the other way and not hold faculty accountable for engaging in academically dishonest behavior, it cheapens its mission and the value of its education.\" Foxx has demanded a written response to a series of questions eight days from now. At the same time, Harvard has announced that Claudine Gay is planning to issue corrections to her 199y PhD dissertation over what the university described as, quote, \"inadequate citation.\" This is clearly another embarrassing setback for Gay. Remember, this is on top of the questions that were issued just last week concerning her academic writings in the 2000s. I would just note though that the way that this has played out, this drip, drip, drip, gradual spilling out of allegations over plagiarism has only complicated matters steel and turned up the pressure even more on Claudine Gay.",

Specifically $1,100 dollars. That is the exact same amount Whelan says is in his prison account. He alleges that there is no way those prisoners would know that amount were it not for this official. He did not pay up. He did not give them any money, any of this protection money. He says he was moved to a different barracks. He told our colleague, Jennifer, this new barracks \"would expose me to criminal behavior as well as the potential of assault. \"Most people carry knives here and many use stimulants, which can make them wild and violent.

And they did that not just on keeping the government open, and that's going to be hard because there's a difference between the House and Senate Republicans over how much money to spend for the entire federal government. That dispute, if they go too far, that will prompt pushback from Democrats and the White House. That would raise our government shutdown fear. Then what do they do about the pressing issue at the southern border with Mexico and try to come up with a policy of new immigration and border policy that Republicans say is essential to allowing Ukraine and Israel aid to move ahead. But getting a deal on immigration has been so hard from a handful of Senators, let alone getting buy in for the rest of Congress, the House and Senate, which is badly divided over this intractable issue of immigration.
