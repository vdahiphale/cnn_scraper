I have said that I think Israel needs to do a far better job in terms of reducing civilian casualties and with the delivery of humanitarian aid, while I completely agree that they need to dismantle Hamas, neutralize Hamas, and do a number of other things. So I think his statement in that regard is true.You know, I think when he says that if he were in office that this war would have never happened, October 7th would have never happened, clearly that's too hard to determine and we'll never know.

Investigators say cables were taken apart and set on fire on three high-speed railways. Workers say that fixing the damage is going to take several days.CNN international correspondent Melissa Bell has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The organizers of Paris 2024 believed they were ready for anything. But it was at 4 a.m., hours from the opening ceremony, that coordinated sabotage and arson caused chaos. PATRICE VERGRIETE, FRENCH DEPUTY TRANSPORT MINISTER (through translator): Today, all the information we have clearly shows that it was deliberate, the simultaneous nature. Everything happened at the same time. Everything now points to the fact that these were arson attacks, particularly the timing, which is more than suspicious. BELL (voice-over): Security in Paris is tight, with authorities keeping to make sure that things go smoothly. But this was one attack carried out simultaneously across the country that was impossible to imagine. No particular group has yet claimed responsibility.",

MAYOR ANNE HIDALGO, PARIS (through translator): I felt that the enthusiasm arrived a little before, during the passage of the flame in Paris on July 14th and 15th. The Olympic flame was paraded in Paris and there were people everywhere. Children, elderly people, all social classes. Everyone was really happy. And I said to myself that it's the magic of the Games working. BELL (voice-over): The opening ceremony will still go ahead as planned tonight along the River Seine, despite the train attack and the threat of rain. Whether it will further dampen spirits could depend more on the weather than the turnout. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It shows what is called a fire tornado or a fire vortex. This was taken in Butte County last night. And the man suspected of starting this fire has been arrested and is facing arson charges.

      "sentences": "So, Boris and Brianna, the prevailing theory, or at least the prevailing theme in this, is betrayal. It is a theme that you will find in that ever-evolving story of the Mexican drug cartels just south of the border. Essentially, what you have here are these drug leaders that have to make that decision. Are they hunted down by U.S. authorities, or do they choose to cooperate with them? And by multiple accounts, it seems that this is an example of the latter.In this case, a law enforcement official that's briefed on this investigation telling CNN that they believe that it was actually the son of Joaquin Guzman, who we all know as El Chapo, who actually cooperated with authorities and provided some inside help to actually track down and to actually capture Mayo. In this particular case, what we understand is that Mayo was lured onto a small Cessna plane yesterday morning, departed from Hermosillo, Mexico, with a destination in just north of El Paso. Now, at one point, that plane eventually landed there, that he was told that they would be flying to visit a property, potentially for purchase, that he was unaware that that plane would be met by U.S. law enforcement, which was the case. That is when Zambada was immediately arrested here. Now, in terms of who he is, he really is sort of that member of that last generation of, or the older generations of these drug lords. He was very low profile. It was, in fact, very difficult to even find recent photos of him. I re-read a piece from 2010 in which he actually offered a Mexican magazine an interview, and he spoke of that persistent concern that he had about being captured, even going as far as to tell the reporter back then, saying that if he were captured, he would even consider taking his own life. So that's certainly important. And then another thing to look out for in the coming days, certainly in the coming months, Boris and Brianna, is what potential repercussions we may see south of the border, because this is a significant void that he leaves behind, which means that we are likely to see a power struggle, perhaps even bloodshed among some of these cartel infighting because of what went down yesterday.",
