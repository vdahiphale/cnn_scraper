And now a top economic forecaster is warning that surging oil prices could be the greatest threat to the U.S. economy right now, the possible impacts of the spike ahead. And Israel announces plans to move forward with something the U.S. and other close allies have warned against, a ground invasion of Rafah in Gaza. What does this mean for the tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians who have sought shelter there? A former CNN reporter- turned-founder of an aid organization just left Gaza and she'll join us live to share what she saw in the hardest-hit areas. But we're going to start with our eclipse coverage, someone lucky enough to get a bird's-eye view of the eclipse, the CNN's Pete Muntean.

It was pretty amazing to see how dark it got on board this flight, Delta 1010, at 35,000 feet.Remember, this flight took off from Texas, where there was a lot of anxiety today about whether or not people would see the eclipse just in general on the ground because of the severe cloud cover there. We were above it all, and I have to tell you, it got incredibly dark on board before we got to totality. We were able to turn twice, left and right. The captain and the flight crew organized that with the FAA so we could see that. And I want you to listen now to one of the passengers on board. Some folks, especially those in the middle of the aisle, weren't able to totally see totality, but they said it was really more about the vibe and the experience of this than anything. Listen.

The penguins or the flamingos flocked for nighttime safety. It moved me to see NASA doing these amazing experiments to try to understand our star, Jake, which a lot of people don't appreciate. We focused on it today. A solar storm would have enormous impacts on Earth. The power you saw coming out of that, the corona there, those eruptions, it's its most active now. And so, one step closer with data that was gathered today to be able to predict space weather. When there's a solar storm, it takes only eight minutes for all that energy to reach Earth and has such an impact on our modern lives. But just the experience of it we saw was just universal awe and wonder. And it's such a novelty to have this sort of nonpartisan, a natural event that humanity can't control, can't speed up.

And it's charged with all these electrical particles that come from the sun and it affects radio waves. It affects terrestrial communication. NASA also had not only flying planes up to measure the corona and the ionosphere, but shoot rockets up to measure these changes.

It's too late to bring it up to an appeals court now.And second of all, just looking at the propriety here of charging this case in Manhattan, this is where the crime occurred, the alleged falsification of business records. Prosecutors do sometimes play games and try to charge a case in a district where a small part of the conduct happened to get a more favorable jury pool. That's not what's happening here. This case almost had to be charged in Manhattan. And finally, as judges often recognize, if there are jurors or potential jurors who are very biased against the defendant, that's what jury selection is for. It's a whole weeding out process.

We have to recognize that the trauma, especially when it comes to children, I mean, look, adults can barely cope with this, right? Like, a child just can't even begin to process it.

And then because it was completely covered and because we had the filter of clouds, we could see this prominence, as it's called, this blast, this solar flare style jolt of a huge magnetic field and charged particles off the sun that be very difficult to observe even with sun filter on, because the sun is so bright.

That's all the traditional planets are in about the same tabletop in space, but the moon is a little tilted relative to the Earth's equator, relative to the Earth's tabletop motion around the sun. And so it has to line up with the moon, the sun, and Earth where you are so that you get this total eclipse.Now, the word rare, there are total eclipses every year and a half or so, but they're usually in the middle of the ocean. And sure enough, there are hardcore eclipse chasing people that get on ships and go out there every couple years and make sure they see a total eclipse. And it's a worthy, spectacular thing.
