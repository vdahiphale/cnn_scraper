They require specialist medical evacuations. And we've heard from doctors who have told us that, in order to evacuate some of these patients, they will need more time, and they will need security guarantees, which they haven't received yet. Some of these patients, they said if they evacuate now, will die on the way. And that is the primary concern here. We have seen doctors at Al-Shifa Hospital working under just challenging and horrific circumstances over the last couple of weeks. And these situations, these -- the situation they are facing has really been deteriorating by the hour. We know, of course, that the Al-Shifa Hospital is not able to operate as a fully functional hospital anymore. We saw those videos of premature babies being removed from the neonatal unit at the hospital because of the lack of oxygen and supplies. They were then taken to another part of the hospital, cuddled together, wrapped in blankets and foil to keep them warm. And we've heard today from a number of human rights organizations and medical teams from across the globe, expressing widespread concern over the ongoing situation.

Negotiations are ongoing, largely held with the Qataris, who communicate with Hamas, the CIA and the Mossad, also involved in those conversations, to try to make some sort of progress. Worth noting, Israeli radio reported earlier today that the army has not found evidence that the hostages were found at Al-Shifa Hospital. So that part of the search continues as Israel tries to find some way to locate 239 hostages there. It's also worth noting that Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, whose headquarters was right here behind us, he met earlier today with the White House's special coordinator for the Middle East. Brett McGurk, in that discussion, according to a read-out of the call. Gallant, the defense minister, told McGurk that the operation would continue against Hamas until it's defeated and all the hostages are rescued. MATTINGLY: Oren Liebermann, Nada Bashir, thank you. Just into CNN, in a matter of hours, FBI director Christopher Wray plans to issue a stark warning that the Israel-Hamas war has, quote, \"raised the threat of an attack against Americans in the United States to a whole other level.\" Wray is set to speak before the House Homeland Security Committee. In his prepared remarks, he emphasizes law enforcement's efforts to root out potential terror threats to the U.S., saying that the FBI has, quote, \"kept our sights on Hamas and have multiple investigations into individuals affiliated with that foreign terrorist organization. He also says, quote, \"America should continue to be alert and careful, but they shouldn't stop going about their daily lives.

The biggest focus, more than anything else, is creating global stability. No pressure, right? That's tough, but that's certainly what many of the other 19 economies of the Asia-Pacific are going to be looking for as they're here for the other main event, of course, that being APEC. But if you have, for example, an agreement on a Chinese crackdown on fentanyl, if you have the reestablishing of military communications between the U.S. and China. If you even perhaps get something out of climate, that would be a win, no question. But these are very difficult things to come to an agreement on between the U.S. and China right now, when you just see so much is -- is really going in the opposite direction. More than anything else, this is going to be about stopping the downward spiral, Poppy.

And they should probably take that note from his supporters. But I mean, look, the problem is -- is that Trump is degenerating into something before our eyes that is far uglier and more dangerous historically than what we've dealt with in the past. It's not just the rhetoric that's authoritarian-adjacent. It's the policies that he's proposing. It's the -- it's the threats and the vengeance.
