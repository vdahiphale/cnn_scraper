And that includes, potentially, Trump's properties in New York. We've seen prosecutors in New York start to lay the groundwork, potentially, for that process to begin. But at the same time, there's also a key pre-trial hearing tomorrow in Trump's criminal case in New York. You'll remember that the trial itself was supposed to start tomorrow. But instead, Trump's lawyers are going to have an opportunity to argue for postponement and argue for the case even to be dismissed. That's an unlikely outcome. But we could get some clues as to when the judge in this case might set a trial date. The postponement due to discovery issues is expected to push this trial into about mid-April.

And look, a lot of this is, of course, the mechanics of how this would actually unfold or doesn't unfold tomorrow. But on Friday, Renato, Trump went on Truth Social, as he has frequently over this past week, to claim he has $500 million in cash that he would love to use on his campaign. But his lawyers quickly clarified, saying, no, he doesn't actually have that cash on hand. This case was part -- was basically found him liable for inflating the value of his assets. So, is he essentially repeating the same offense here while he's trying to avoid paying his bond?

Here on Truth Social, he was essentially lying to the public, which, let's face it, is something he's done very frequently, about the amount of money he had.The reason his lawyers jumped in quickly to clarify things is because they had previously told the court that he didn't have the money. So, what -- either they were lying or he was lying. And if it was them, they were going to be taken to task by the court. And of course, it would actually undercut his request for relief where we just -- you were just asking about a moment ago. As a practical matter, I really think that this statement that he made publicly is just going to be used by the attorney general to suggest that you can't really trust what Trump and his team are saying about the impact that this is going to have on his businesses. He's clearly, you know, making things up, exaggerating the truth, making false statements in order to essentially create a narrative about this when in actuality, this is a fairly routine occurrence when you lose a trial.

I talked to a number of Democrats over the last few days. They are telling me that they are willing to save Mike Johnson's job if he moves forward on Ukraine aid. This has been stalled for months. And there has been deep Republican divisions over moving ahead. Johnson has tried to see if there's a path forward on a separate bipartisan plan that is emerging in the House. Democrats have issues with that bipartisan bill. But there is the Senate package that was approved last month as $95 billion in aid to Ukraine, to Israel, to Taiwan. That does not deal with the issues of the border because Republicans were divided over that prospect. But because it is silent on border security money or any border security provisions, Johnson has said he would not move forward on that.

He missed six games with an injured oblique, but came back in time for Friday's tournament (INAUDIBLE) ran circles in this one around the Buffaloes. That put Marquette up for good, 21 points, 11 assists for the two-time All-American. MU in the Sweet 16 for the first time in 11 years. They got knocked out in the second-round last year.

But it is a play-in game or a game today as Northwestern and so many other teams try to punch their ticket to the Sweet 16. So, joining me now is Michael Wilbon, co-host of \"Pardon the Interruption\" on ESPN and longtime Northwestern alum, who I should mention is joining us from a Northwestern pep rally. It's loud in there to get everything we've got together for this matchup with the one-seed UConn. Great to see you. I want to start just with the tournament in general. We've seen some pretty incredible mid-major upsets early on in this tournament. The college landscape, is it just that different? Why does that upset -- dynamic seem to be so prevalent this year?",

And they're not as shocking because you have so many teams that have players, really good high school players, great high school players from all over the country. And if they're not happy where they are, they can transfer. They can go for whatever reasons they want, including name, image, and likeness money.So, there are a lot of reasons to go somewhere and play besides for just one of the Blue Bloods. You don't need to sit on a bench for one of the great, great traditional programs when you can play wherever you want and threaten one of those Blue Blood programs like Kentucky, which has already lost and out of the tournament. So, we've always had tournament upsets in March, but they're not as shocking as they used to be and they're going to continue.",

But over the last seven years, this is now their third time making it, their third time making it to the second round. What do you think has been so critical in being able to take a program like Northwestern to the next level athletically at a school that maybe has been more traditionally known for academics?",

No team, no athletic program can do it without a commitment from the school. We weren't committed to this sort of athletic interest 40, 50 years ago. We just weren't. It wasn't that important.It is important, and we see it's important to the entire university community, any university community. And so, at Northwestern, we ought to be competitive not just in classrooms but also in gyms and on fields. If Stanford can do this, if Duke can do this, why not us? And there has been a lot of that as an attitude. And that ought to have existed a long time ago. But it exists now. And so, yeah, this is our third appearance in the tournament in seven years, since 2017. Here's what's even more important. Twenty-four wins by the Northwestern basketball team the last two years is more than any team in the Big Ten, except for Purdue, number one seed Purdue, and Illinois, which is a three seed. That's it. Not Ohio State. Not Michigan. Not even the great time is on Michigan State. Northwestern, we've got the third most victories in the Big Ten men's basketball in that time. So, yes, there's an importance of continuity. Is it sustainable? Yeah, it appears to be. But you've got to have the right people in place. You have to have concentrated support for those programs. We've seen that in our women's programs. We've seen it in lacrosse, where there are eight national championships, in field hockey, where we recently won one and been to the finals three years in a row. We're seeing that more. We've seen it in football. We're now seeing it in men's basketball. And why not?",
