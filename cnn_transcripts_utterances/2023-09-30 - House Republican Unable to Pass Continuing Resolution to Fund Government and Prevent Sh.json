MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: The choice facing Congress is pretty straightforward. We can take the standard approach and fund the government for six weeks at the current rate of operations, or we can shut the government down in exchange for zero meaningful progress on policy.

This is their fourth conference meeting in about a week's time, Amara, and that just gives you a sense of the immediacy, the crisis that senators and Republican Democrats in the House are trying to figure out at the moment.And one thing that I will walk through is at the moment it is not clear what House Republicans could do to avoid a shutdown. McConnell has made it clear that he thinks the option is to work across the aisle with Democrats to accept whatever the Senate sends over. But last night House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made it clear that the Senate bill was dead on arrival because of Ukraine funding that was included in that legislation. We also know that behind closed doors this morning leadership gave their members a clear picture that there was not enough Republican support for a short-term C.R. for two weeks, 30 day, 45 days, that there remains a number of hard liners who are never going to be yes on those proposals. So that leaves McCarthy certainly facing the prospect that a shutdown is imminent. Now, again, he could potentially put something on the floor to change that calculus and to get some Democratic support. But doing so, working across the aisle with Democrats could potentially mean the end of his speakership, Amara. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RALPH NORMAN, (R-SC): But I'm not going to vote for them. For a clean C.R., that's what we were fighting against all the time. Border, nothing in it for the border. So, no, I won't be doing it. I won't be voting for it. We'll see how it goes. REP. NANCY MACE, (R-SC): We're supposed to have a budget in 12 separate appropriations bills. We don't in this place because they want to screw with the laws and have one massive spending bill that doesn't get vetted, doesn't get amendments put on it, and you don't get time to read it.

BARRON-LOPEZ: Well, so far to date all of the things that Speaker McCarthy has said and all of the things that Speaker McCarthy has shown that he chooses to side with the hard right Republicans, that he -- even when he became speaker he ended up striking an agreement with them, which was not necessarily made public but which they say he hasn't held to. And every time he has been faced with a choice to either do something that could potentially be more favorable to his moderate Republicans, the very Republicans that made his majority, those 18 House Republicans that are in Biden-won districts and are facing very tough reelections, or doing something that the hard right Republicans really want, he ends up going with what that hard right faction wants.

Do you think it's realistic that Democrats will be able to pass a stopgap bill without any money going to Ukraine to avoid a shutdown and appease some on the Republican side? BARRON-LOPEZ: It's looking more and more difficult for the White House, for Democrats, and, mind you, Senate Republican leadership. Mitch McConnell that Ukraine funding attached to a C.R. He wants it something on something that is ultimately passed to keep the government open. But it's looking as though that is becoming increasingly difficult because of the House Republicans that appear to be growing in opposition to any type of aid to Ukraine as well as some consternation among Senate Republican who don't necessarily want that to be attached to any government funding resolution. So opposition appears to be growing to that despite the fact there are a number of Senate Republicans including leadership who wants to see U.S. support for Ukraine continue well into next year, and it's only going to get harder.",

Basically, the Republican whip walked members through what he believes the reality, that there are not enough Republican votes to pass short term spending bills to keep the government funded, to have this sort of prolonged negotiation with the United States Senate. And so what was presented to members is they are trying to basically soften the blow of a potential shutdown by putting legislation on the floor that would extend FAA authorization, would also deal with some flood insurance issues, and would pay American troops while a shutdown was ongoing.Now, this is very fluid at the moment. And I just want to be very clear that this is a sign potentially that we are headed into a shutdown, but it also has been changing by the minute, so we want to be very careful and clear that these things are moving quickly, and the House speaker has been sort of all over the map in terms of what he's been eyeing. And so obviously, if there's a vote today on these measures, it is an opportunity for Republicans to try to put Democrats in a hard spot, force them to have to decide if they think America's troops should be paid during a shutdown.

And what happens in those instances, the FDA, which regulates about 80 percent of our U.S. food system, has to furlough employees. And we're only allowed to do work on what's considered imminent human health hazard, or something that will affect human life. So, in the last shutdown we were basically limited to only responding to problems once they occurred, and responding to what's referred to as class one recalls, recalls of foods that are of an urgent health issue to a consumer. So all the work that the FDA is expected to do, that Congress expect it to do, that the American people expect it to do in terms of prevention, preventing outbreak from happening in the first place, comes to a stall.",

It's not necessarily for the additional rain we're expecting today but rather all that rain yesterday, because it takes time for that water to recede, especially when you're talking such high amounts. [10:35:5] JFK airport set an all-time rainfall record yesterday, getting over eight inches, Valley Stream, New York picking up over nine inches of rain. And several other spots, not just New York but also Connecticut and New Jersey picking up six, even seven inches of rain total. So again, a significant amount of rain. We are still getting more today but nowhere near those totals. Here you can see a few more bands expected through the first half of the day, but really as we transition into the afternoon, a lot of those rain bands really start to recede very quickly. And then finally tomorrow, Sunday, sunshine from start to finish. It will be a nice day to allow things to dry back out. However, as that system is exiting, you're still getting spin from that storm, and that's going to push a lot of that water in. So you do still have potential for some coastal flooding, not just New York but also New Jersey and even Delaware. So you've got that coastal inundation up to one point possible today.",

Police say Duane Keith Davis admitted his role in the murder back in 2009 but couldn't be charged because of an earlier agreement that prohibited any statements from being used against him. Officials describe Davis as the ringmaster of the plot to kill Tupac, but it was his public bragging about the incident that provided evidence leading to his arrest on Friday.

There's nine administrative investigations in total, and four officers have been arrested. That's actually connected to another case. In September of 2020, a man was arrested and brought to a police department building, and when officers wanted to conduct a strip-search because they believed he had some drugs, the man was struggling. Those officers brought out their tasers, they started to tase the man several times. But they didn't realize it activated their body cameras. Later on, a supervisor became aware of how this went down. They watched what happened through an app and tried to have the body camera destroyed according to the chief. That way the video wouldn't be logged into a server. Now those four officers face charges for this. This goes deep into this community. The Baton Rouge mayor is speaking out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
