Vance.This will be an early and significant test of the party's enthusiasm for Vance, once a Trump critic and now the top prospect to lead the MAGA movement into the future. Welcome to CNN's convention coverage from inside the arena, where tonight's program is underway. I'm Anderson Cooper along with Jake Tapper.

He also plans to make his high-profile convention speech in an introductory way, introducing himself to the American people. We're told that Senator Vance will focus on his personal journey rising from nothing as he has put it to success, reaching this extraordinary moment in American history where he accepts the Republican vice- presidential nomination. Senator Vance will be introduced by his wife, Usha, a trial attorney, daughter of Indian immigrants. The Vances capping tonight's program, which includes remarks by North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a top VP contender who lost out to Vance, as well as a primetime speech by the former president's oldest son, Donald Trump, Jr. At this moment, a celebration for Republicans, we do have some breaking news on the Democratic side, a new setback for President Biden, a diagnosis of COVID in the midst of increasing pressure from fellow Democrats for him to exit the 2024 race. The president abruptly calling off an event in Nevada. His schedule now appearing uncertain at this intense moment of turmoil from his campaign. You see him on your screen there. It looks like he's having some difficulty getting up the stairs. Let us get more on this breaking news from the Democrats. Jeff Zeleny has that. Jeff, what are you picking up? What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, we know as President Biden is flying back to the East Coast tonight, after testing positive for COVID, as you said, and cutting his trip to Las Vegas short.We know that he is facing potentially a new moment in his campaign. He's been hearing for the last several days, from Democratic lawmakers, officials, and others about their concerns about his path forward here. I'm talking to a senior Democratic adviser tonight who is telling me this, he said, he believes the president is being, \"more receptive to these calls of concern.\" He goes on to say this, \"The private conversations with the Hill are continuing,\" this adviser tells me. \"He is being receptive, not as defiant as he is publicly.\" He goes on to saying, talking about Vice President Kamala Harris, who initially he wondered how she may fare in a campaign should it come to that? I'm told now he is asking questions saying, \"Do you think Kamala can win?\" Again, this adviser offers caution saying this: \"It is still unclear where he's going to land, but he seems to be listening.\" So, Jake, what we do know, this is a new moment for President Biden. Tomorrow marks three weeks since the debate in Atlanta, as you well know. He's heard so much concern from across the Democratic Party. Time is running short. The Democratic National Committee was thinking about starting their nomination process next week, that is now on hold, that will not get and until August 1st. So, there is a bit of time for the president to make this decision. But hanging over all of this is the same thing as it has been for the last three weeks. If not him, who? But tonight, as the president flies back to the East Coast from Las Vegas, it is certainly a new moment for him and his potential candidacy -- Jake.",

So, different from what you have been hearing, from what I have been hearing, from what you have been hearing, which is he's dug in. He doesn't want to listen. Our reporting about the fact that he is been having very combative conversations with House Democrats who are desperate for him to listen to their concerns and their fear, that it's not just him who could lose, but the House and the Senate as well. And this seems to be a potential, again, he was very cautious, but a potential turning point that there's even a remote possibility that the doors opened this much is something we have not heard up until right now.",

The big donors across the country have basically said we're not putting any more money into the Biden campaign with a situation that it is. And then, on top of everything else, with all the concerns about his mental acuity, to now have COVID and I must say it was, you know, the metaphor wrote itself. The caption wrote itself, as you saw him like a very old weak man, struggling to get up the stairs of Air Force One. If he isn't rethinking it, you'd have to say he's out of touch with reality. I'm not saying he's going to drop out. We don't know that, but there's an awful lot that is piling up.

And something has happened, Anderson, in the last several weeks between the debate, the events of Saturday, and the assassination attempt, and the way president -- former President Trump reacted to with the iconic photo.It has crystallized something that has sent the numbers spiraling to the degree they can in a very polarized country. So, look, there are three things that you look at. One is polling and the polling is getting worse. The battleground, which is getting larger, there were seven battleground -- maybe six or perhaps seven battleground states to start. Now, you have 11 or 12. And then, money. Do you have the resources to compete? And that money has dried up. And now donors are not talking about how do we shore up the president? They're talking about how do we shore up the House? How do we shore up the Senate? And that's where they're shifting their resources. This is inexorable and I don't say this with any pleasure at all because I worked with Joe Biden. He has served his country well for most of his life, and this is not the coda that he wants on his career. And I think that's what people are telling him that he can help improve the chances of winning a race that he says is existential, but the way he has to do it is to exit. And look, there will be a discussion about whether it's the vice president or not.

In the president's public comments, it has not stopped it.Some of the same Senior Democrats are calling back again and again and again, to David's point, the data is getting progressively worse and it's all being sent to the White House. We have zero indication the president is ready to say, okay, let's talk about this. But people who are in touch with his inner circle say the conversations with them in the last 24 hours are a little bit different. That they're not as defiant. They're not getting told, shut up, they're not getting told, go away, they're not getting told you're the problem by asking us to do this. Now, does that mean the president is getting the message? We don't know that. We do know -- I mean, it's sad, the president of United States has COVID, but we now know he's off the road. He's going to be back in Delaware. His wife has going there as well.

Biden's red tape has raised the price of the gas in your car, the cost of food on your table, the clothes on your back, and it's even raised your rent. Biden's green agenda feels like it was written by China, Russia and Iran. Let's look at Biden's EV mandates. Where do nearly all the batteries and rare earth minerals come from? China, you know. And the day that Biden halted permits for clean U.S. natural gas export facilities, just think about the party they must have thrown that night at the Kremlin because Biden's policies are making Russia and Iran filthy rich. And they're using that money to fund wars and terrorism against our allies. At home, Biden is acting like a dictator. He's using mandates to shut down reliable base load electricity. That's why your electric bills have soared upwards as our nation's electric grid reliability spirals downward. Four more years of Joe will usher an era of Biden brownouts and blackouts.
