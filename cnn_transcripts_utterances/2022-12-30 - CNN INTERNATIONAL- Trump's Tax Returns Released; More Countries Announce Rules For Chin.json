      "sentences": "Hello, I'm Lynda Kinkade at the CNN Center here in Atlanta. Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.Coming up, the release of six years of Donald Trump's tax returns raises questions about his business operations and loans to his children. Spain joins the list of countries putting new restrictions on Chinese travelers. And I get a sneak peek at the brand new musical devoted to the life of the hitmaker, Neil Diamond. For the business empire of Donald Trump is under scrutiny today like never before after tax returns he long sought to hide are finally made public. A US Congressional Committee released six years of returns that includes Trump's time in the White House. They show he claimed multimillion dollar losses that helped reduce his tax burden. In fact, in 2020, he paid no Federal income tax at all. The returns also showed that Trump held foreign bank accounts during his presidency, and despite a pledge to donate his presidential salary every single year, in 2020, he listed zero charitable contributions. And that's not all they are learning. CNN's Kristen Holmes has been combing through the documents and joins us now from Washington. Good to see you today. So Trump built his political campaign on the fact that he was not a politician, but a wealthy successful businessman. What do these records tell us about his track record in business?",

      "sentences": "Well, the one thing I do want to point out here, not only did he build his entire campaign on the fact that he was a businessman, but he said that because he was such a successful businessman that he could then successfully run a country. So this is an entire brand that he has built on.And it's not just the last couple of years that he's tried to shield this from the public, it has been decades that Trump has tried to keep his finances out of public view, which has raised a lot of questions. Now, when it comes to what we learned about his businesses, let us take a look at what he paid in income tax. As you noted, in 2017, he paid $750.00, then in 2018 and 2019, $1.1 million combined. 2020, zero dollars. Now, the way he was able to pay so low in income tax every year was because he used these large losses and he carried them forward to offset his income and in one case, obviously, completely eradicated, zero. But what's interesting about that zero number, and I've talked to a number of tax experts about it is that they say this is the number that starts to raise real questions about his businesses failing, that there are problems with his businesses. Some of it, of course, as we know, is strategic accounting, carrying those enormous losses over, but a zero number like that means there could have been actual real problems with his business that we are looking into. Now, the other thing I want to talk about is those foreign bank accounts because again, this is raising a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows. You note that in 2015, he had bank accounts in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and China. In 2016, UK, Ireland, China, St. Maarten; 2017, UK, Ireland, China; 2018 to 2020, only the UK. Obviously, there is one country on there that is raising the most eyebrows and that, of course, is China. The questions being, who were his associates in China? What exactly were his business interests? Was this at any way impacting the decisions that he was making in the White House because he had business interest in China? So that's raising a lot of questions. This also leads us to talk about foreign taxes, because this again, goes to this global question about Donald Trump's business interests while he was serving as President and representing the United States. While he was only paying $750.00 in US income tax, he was paying nearly a million dollars in foreign taxes. And again, this is not strange. It is not strange to expect him to pay taxes to foreign countries, given the fact that he is a global businessman, but what is interesting is that it is finally shedding light on where exactly his business interests lie, and in a number of countries -- India, China, Turkey, Mexico -- these all mean that he had notable business interests in these countries and he was paying taxes on that. Now the last thing I want to talk about is something that you had mentioned, those charitable contributions. Essentially what we learned is that over the years that he was in the White House, his charitable contributions significantly declined. [15:05:09] We saw that in 2017, it was $1.8 million, then $500,000.00 in 2018 and in 2019, and then again, as you mentioned, 2020 zero dollars. That again, starts to raise question about his business dealings, remember that charitable contributions are something that can be written off. So, there is a reason that he did not claim anything here, and yet he still had zero dollars to pay an income tax. Now, these are just a few of the findings that we had here. And again, it's hundreds of pages, we're going to continue to go through them. We're going to continue to have tax experts look at them. A lot of what they say is in the details. These extra documents that were provided, not necessarily just the tax returns, but the documents that were provided to essentially prove these tax returns, and that's what we're looking at closely to see what else we can uncover here.",

France will also impose mandatory COVID tests for travelers from China and South Korea and Spain have just announced that anyone arriving from China needs a negative COVID test.

That's one of the tools in the tool chest that they might use.But here is what they're doing in terms of travel. So in terms of travel, the US starting January 5th, is saying if you're going to come to the US from China, you need to have a negative test either antigen or PCR, within two days of your departure, no more than two days. Also at seven US airports, they are offering voluntary testing for select flights. So for hundreds of flights a week from China, when you land, you can raise your hand and say, You know what, test me and it's all anonymous, test me, and if you're positive, then they will also do genomic sequencing to see if it's any kind of new and scary variant. So you know, obviously, they are not going to get everyone to volunteer, but there actually have been some inroads made with this kind of testing and sort of seeing variants before they take off -- Lynda.",

All of those companies, including Amazon were overvalued.Now, obviously, it's not a perfect comparison, because Amazon is still around, they weren't a fraud. They didn't go out of business. But there was too much hype and too much enthusiasm about something that yes, it would eventually become a much bigger thing, and I kind of feel the same way about blockchain technology. We are eventually going to be doing far more transactions than we even do now, and even consumers, probably through the blockchain, we're just not there yet. And companies like Binance and FTX, and Coinbase probably didn't deserve their valuations in either the private markets or public markets.

And then why invest in boring stocks that may only go up 10 to 15 percent a year when you can buy crypto? That's what turned out to be the folly here.And I think that yes, people talk about how you know, you should have gold in your portfolio, too. But again, most sane people say two to three percent, maybe five, not 25 or 50 percent, and I feel the same way about crypto.
