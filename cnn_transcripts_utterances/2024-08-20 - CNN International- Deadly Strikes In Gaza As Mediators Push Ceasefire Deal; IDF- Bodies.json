In Gaza, two Israeli airstrikes killed at least 18 people. The majority of the victims were women and children. One strike targeted school which was sheltering displaced families, killing in that crushed their 12 people. The IDF said it was a precise strike on militants operating inside that school. Overnight, the Israeli military retrieved the bodies of six hostages, Israeli hostages from inside tunnels in Khan Younis in Gaza, 105 hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, remain in Gaza. Israel believes at least 36 of them are dead as well. The families of those still held continue to call on the Israeli government to finalize a ceasefire and hostage deal. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, is attempting to bridge the remaining gaps between Israel and Hamas arriving in Doha to continue those talks that after a stop in Egypt, but let's be frank, the public statements of the last few days appear to indicate the two sides remain far apart. CNN international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv. And, Nic, it seems now with some of the statements we're hearing from State Department officials that we know what the sticking points are now and that those sticking points may have gotten stickier, particularly on control of the Philadelphi corridor.",

We see this -- you and I covered the Iraq war. We studied actually the awakening, the strategy of Petraeus in Iraq. What was it about? Its offering a different option to the civilians, an option that is beyond terrorism and beyond terror and beyond the mass slaughter. And they're not offering the Palestinian that and, thus, Hamas as an ideology will continue. I'm not the one saying this. It's actually the security apparatus in Israel who are now admitting that you cannot defeat Hamas militarily. There's no military solution. Netanyahu understand that, but you know what, even after the ruling of the International Court of Justice, the toll the international community that they need to intervene because Israel is illegally occupying land, and is illegally annexing, the response from Netanyahu and his government, his far government, was to bombed Rafah 60 times in 42 hours.

Donald Trump made it something of a routine back in 2016, 2020, and this year as well.But when you look at the history of these nominating conventions, you know, it's not all that infrequent that a candidate is out on the trail in the lead-up. And I think back to 2008 when then candidate Barack Obama was campaigning in Kansas City, which is unique in its own way, I don't know why a candidate would be there this time around, but he was campaigning as his wife was addressing the convention and they beamed him in and Michelle Obama and her daughters kind of waved from the stage. So it's not all that unique, but certainly Kamala Harris is aware, Wisconsin is a critical battleground state. It's not that far away. And I think the goal of the campaign is to sort of hit two birds with one stone and have her out on the campaign trail. But certainly, you know, last night was quite a moment in this arena as President Biden was greeted with that raucous reception from the audience. He was overcome really when he stepped out, that sea of signs saying \"thank you, Joe\", I think the president has been in politics long enough that those signs had two meetings. One, thank you for the record that you're leaving, but also thank you for stepping aside, and allowing a Democratic nominee who is going to be more competitive to replace you. And that is, of course, was the bittersweet underpinnings of his entire address. You know, yesterday, we were saying that this was not necessarily the speech that President Biden wanted to give. I think I would revise that today to say it was not the night that he wanted to give it. It's easy to imagine an alternate universe the very speech he delivered being the one that he could have delivered as the nominee with the last ten minutes chopped off. You know, it wasn't a lengthy testimony about his vice president and the current nominee. He talked about his record in office. He talked about Donald Trump as a threat to democracy. That's the very campaign that he wanted to run. A lot of Democrats just didn't think that was going to work and he's no longer the nominee, but certainly I don't think you're going to hear any Democrats begrudge President Biden for delivering the speech that he delivered last night. But certainly, they are now moving to a more affirmative portion of this convention beginning with Barack Obama and the speech that he will deliver this evening. You know, I'm told that convention organizers deliberately chose Obama to kind of introduce Kamala Harris to an American public that may not have been paying attention up until this moment, in part because he's the party's most gifted orator, but also he knows Kamala Harris. They have a history going back 20 years. In fact, Kamala Harris was at the 2004 convention in Boston that really thrust Barack Obama into the national spotlight. Back then, he called himself a skinny guy with a funny name. Now he is entering the convention is something as a party elder, working to get Kamala Harris elected to the White House in November.",

He delivered the keynote address, really imploring Americans to find an optimistic way forward. He said there are no red states, there are no blue states.Well, in that audience that evening was Kamala Harris. She was the district attorney in San Francisco, a young lawyer who was captivated and taken by that message. It wasn't until several months later that the two would actually meet at a fundraiser that then-Senator Obama was having an in California, and that began a relationship that really is span these two decades. You'll remember that when Barack Obama was running for president, just four years after that convention speech, it was Kamala Harris who is in Iowa volunteering for him, helping him on the ground. She endorsed Obama's candidacy over Hillary Clinton's candidacy, and then over the years of President Obama, after he was elected, he helped her as well was, a featured at an advertisement for her Senate campaign for her attorney general's campaign. But I'm told it wasn't until really recent years and even weeks when the relationship has crystallized even more and he was a lead sounding board for her as she was really seizing the mantle of the Democratic Party in rapid fashion, and was looking for a running mate, he offered advice, I'm told he's walked her through and listened and served as a sounding board on several issues of the day from the economy, to the Middle East, to other matters. So that's what brings us to tonight. So we know that Barack Obama, the former president, now and one of the most widely respected members of his party, he'll be delivering the keynote address here tonight. And we'll be really arguing in a forceful way while he believes that Harris and Tim Walz, the Minnesota governor, are the right leaders for this moment, I'm told to also draw a contrast with former President Donald Trump. But, Jim, there's another Obama on the roster tonight as well. That's Michelle Obama. Right here in her hometown of Chicago. She's also expected to speak, and aides believed that her message and voices even more powerful because she, of course, has a far broader and deeper brand that exceeds politics, and really making the case for this Democratic ticket, but also trying to reach out to some voters who may be frustrated and disgusted by politics.

And I think that was also reflected in the conversation that I had. The hostages depend on it. The security of the country depends on it. The ability to really ensure that we don't have the conflict spreading to other places because Gaza is in many ways the key to making sure that we can actually move things in the north in Lebanon and Hezbollah in a better direction. It's the key to helping make sure that we can take down the temperature in the Red Sea with the Houthis. It's the key to seeing if we can pursue normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, which both countries remain very interested in. It's the key to actually putting everyone starting with Israel on a path to greater peace and security. And of course, is key to getting the hostages home which Israelis desperately want to see happen, and we want to see happen, we need to see happen. There are Americans who remain hostage in Gaza. And I was very clear about the American interests in making sure that our people come home to their families and that the remains of those who have perished are brought back. Thank you. Robert?",

As I said before, the bridging proposal is based on the May -- late May agreement that we put -- the President Biden put out, endorsed and incorporated a U.N. Security Council resolution and then we heard from both parties different comments on it. We tried to reflect some of those comments in this bridging proposal. And a bridge by definition has to two parties to it. There's the -- there are two points to a bridge. So we've tried to reflect that in the bridging proposal and now the process is making sure that Hamas fully understands it, and what's in it? And I believe that they should -- again, they should be prepared to endorse it. Just as Israel is endorsed it. And then the critical thing is getting clear understandings on implementation of the agreement, and there are some complicated pieces of business that are involved there. That's exactly why its so important that the negotiators who are working the details of this have maximum flexibility from the Israeli government and also from Hamas's leadership so that we can actually bring this to a conclusion, bring it over the finish line. And in this, as I said, the United States, Egypt, and Qatar are absolutely united and but they have a unique role in being able to engage with Hamas. We of course deeply engaged with Israel. And the three of us working together I believe can get this to where it needs to go. But as always, these things sometimes take more time than you want what we are all united on is the urgency of the moment, because as I said, with every passing day more bad things can happen to more people -- to more good people who don't deserve it and we're united in that, and we're going to continue to do the work. There's one other thing I should actually have shared with all of you, which is that, of course, we were intensely focused on Gaza during this during this visit. But in Egypt in particular, but also here in Qatar, we had extensive discussions about Sudan. And it's very important that people focus on that, too, because with everything else going on in the world, the worst humanitarian situation in the world right now is in Sudan. There are more people in Sudan who are suffering from fighting, from violence, from lack of access to food, and basic humanitarian assistance, and we are very determined to try to move that to a better place as well. We convene talks in Switzerland that are -- that are ongoing. At the same time, we've been working very closely with Egypt, with Saudi Arabia, with the United Arab Emirates, with the African Union, not only to try to get a cessation of hostilities and bring the parties together around that, and a way to verify the agreements that they hopefully will reach. But also to get humanitarian assistance into the tens of millions of people who need it. We have an agreement now over the last couple of days, that critical access zero points in Sudan to allow humanitarian assistance to get in will be opened by both the SAF and the RSF, the two competing parties. And we obviously need to see that move forward but that's critical in bringing life essential assistance to people who desperately need it and as we're doing that, of course, we're working on trying to get a broader agreement on a cessation of hostilities and their again, the work -- the coordination with Egypt has been absolutely critical. And I didn't want to leave this without telling you that this is something that we spent a fair bit of time on as well. Thanks, everyone.",
