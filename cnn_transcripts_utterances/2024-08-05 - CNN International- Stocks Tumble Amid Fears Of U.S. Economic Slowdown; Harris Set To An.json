Stocks are now beginning to recover off drug market meltdown this morning. The Dow opened more than 1,000 points lower. The S&amp;P was down over 4 percent. The Nasdaq, the tech heavy Nasdaq, was down by more than 6 percent at the close. The Wall Street losses are the result of global sell-offs. Now, it all starts, of course, in the U.S. last Friday, but then you've got Japan and overnight Sunday into Monday to the United States, then fueled of affairs are slowing economy. All in all, there are worries as well about bets on artificial intelligence that will be paying off in the future. Add in the job numbers that we saw and a volatile presidential election. Julia Chatterley is with me. Julia, of the maelstrom of misery that has made up this market, which do you think is the telling point?",

You actually can't decipher I think what the most important factor is, but I will tell you, it began earlier than Friday and that jobs number. You mentioned it. We've seen some of the strongest pillars of the financial markets under pressure now for some days and that's the tech stocks and that pressure continued.We also have that weaker than weaker-than-expected jobs number, manufacturing data and that made and raised palpable risks I think that the U.S. economy is slowing quicker than we thought, throwing them finger-pointing about the Federal Reserve and whether or not they should have cut rates. They have the capacity to cut rates if they need to. Fast forward to last night, and you've got the Japanese market selling off 12 percent. Now, I would call that panic, quite frankly, and you don't see that without seeing a knock on impact to U.S. markets, to throw in some geopolitical risk if you want to, with Iran and Israel, some are markets which means that a lot of people are on the beach and not trading that adds to choppiness, and this is the result you get. Richard, I would be tempted if this were just about that data from Friday to suggest that the markets, the stock markets are overreacting. But when you add in all of these things I think it makes sense for people to be a bit cautious here. And let's be clear, the stock markets is still up, what, 10 percent year-to-date.",

At the same time, what we are witnessing here in Israel is first of all, civilians kind of going about their life as usual, there has been no change yet in the home front command guidelines to civilians to tell them to limit large gatherings or remain in near shelters. Although there have been some guidelines issued by different municipalities like Haifa, where we are now instructing civilians to make some preparations, at least. There is also a lot of military activity. The military is on very high alert here, preparing not only for that massive air defense effort that might be required, but also beginning to examine a potential retaliatory scenarios. We know that the Israeli military's top general was reviewing potential of responses that they could deliver should Iran attack.

Dhaka is a battleground, that's how one witness described the chaotic scenes on Sunday as tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets, some wielding sticks and knives, demanding Hasina's resignation. Dozens of people were killed on Sunday alone in a resurgence of protests that have spread nationwide with violent clashes erupted between demonstrators, police, and ruling party supporters. Rallies that began last month over quotas for civil service jobs have escalated into widespread fury with protesters demanding Hasina and her ministers be held accountable for the rising death toll. Protests began in July, led by students angry over hiring rules that would reserve more than half of civil servant positions which are highly prioritized for select applicants. Students said its discriminatory system that would cut down on job opportunities in a workforce where an estimated 18 million young people are unemployed. In the clashes that followed, at least 150 people were killed, thousands injured, and about 10,000 arrested a military enforced curfew and a mobile and internet blackout attempted suppress protests, as well as the ruling by the country's Supreme Court to reduce the quotas. But public anger has only intensified with protests returning in recent days. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): It wasn't possible to stay at home anymore. Everyone is on the street.
