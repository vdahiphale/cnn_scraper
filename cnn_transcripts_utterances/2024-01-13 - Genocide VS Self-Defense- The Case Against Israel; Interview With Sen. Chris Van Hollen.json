In response, Israel argues it's acting in self-defense after the horrors of October 7th and the slaughter of its civilians by Hamas.

Meantime, the war on Gaza still threatens to drag in the rest of the region.The Biden administration's strong support for Israel divides his party on this particular issue heading into an election that Biden himself calls an existential choice for American democracy. Senator Chris Van Hollen is pushing back against the White House proposing an amendment that would put conditions on American aid to Israel, and he's joining me now from Washington. Welcome back to our program, Senator. So firstly, can I ask you, do you, like the State Department, believe that this case is meritless? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Christian, it's good to be with you. I agree with the State Department's point that Hamas initiated this war and that Hamas engaged in the atrocities on October 7th with the intent of destroying Israel. As to the South African claims, I am following the case closely. It is true that many Israeli government officials have made really outrageous statements about collective punishment, about equating all Palestinians with Hamas. But there's a long way to go between those individual statements and attributing that intent to the government of Israel. So I'll be watching it closely. For now I'm focused on the other questions that you just mentioned.",

They have succeeded in getting the Netanyahu government to make some very small changes in their conduct, but not nearly enough to achieve Secretary Blinken's goal and President Biden's goal of dramatically reducing the number of civilian casualties. We're now up to over 22,000 people dead, two- thirds of them women and children.And not enough leverage to get the kind of humanitarian assistance into Gaza that's needed to address a desperate situation that's getting worse.

There are three main points in that, Christiane. One is every recipient of U.S. military assistance must comply with international humanitarian law. And we must get that commitment from them in advance before we provide any military assistance. Two, those countries have to fully cooperate with U.S. efforts to provide humanitarian assistance in an area where U.S. weapons are used. So Gaza would be covered, so would Ukraine. And then there's a reporting requirement, insisting that the Biden administration provide us with information so we can determine whether or not the first two requirements have, in fact, been met with respect to all these countries. So in my view it's a very common-sense provision. We should require more accountability of all U.S. Recipients of military aid.",
