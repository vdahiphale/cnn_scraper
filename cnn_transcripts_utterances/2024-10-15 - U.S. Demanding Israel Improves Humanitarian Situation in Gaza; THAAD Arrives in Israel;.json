      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a new warning from the Bidenadministration as it tells Israel, improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, or possibly risk military aid. This as the first components of the powerful U.S. anti-missile defense systems arrive in Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu has reportedly assured the U.S., Israel will hit Iran's military, not nuclear or oil sites. We have the very latest for you. And in the U.S. state of Georgia, early voting has begun and officials say it could be a record breaking turnout. But first, tonight, as U.N. warns that Gaza is facing the worst restriction on aid since the war began, Israel's biggest backer is now giving a deadline for the humanitarian situation to improve. The Biden administration sent a letter to the Israeli government demanding it address the Gaza aid crisis within 30 days or risk a halt in U.S. military assistance. That deadline comes just after the U.S. election. But the State Department denies the two are linked. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  The bottom line is, we felt it was appropriate if we are making clear to the government of Israel that there are these changes that need to be implemented, that we give them an appropriate period of time to implement it, to implement them. I didn't think it was appropriate to send a letter and just say this has to happen overnight. We give them -- made clear there's a short window in which we want to see changes because the humanitarian situation is so dire on the ground, but it is appropriate to give them some time to work through the different issues and find ways to get the level of trucks, get the level of food, water, medicine back up to acceptable levels.

      "sentences": "Yes, well, over the course of the last week, we have seen a lot of communication between the U.S. andIsrael over what that response will actually look like, which targets Israel will hit as it has vowed that it will indeed respond militarily to that barrage of some 200 ballistic missiles fired by Iran a couple of weeks ago. And those conversations between the U.S. and Israel have been aimed on the U.S. side in terms of reining Israel and to ensure that the response that they deliver does not take things to a much higher level of escalation. And that is to say that we heard President Biden making clear that he opposed a strike on Israel's -- on Iran's nuclear facilities that he also opposed, a strike on oil facilities inside of Iran. And so, now, it appears that through those conversations and perhaps also by the U.S. offering Israel a new advanced anti-missile system to be deployed to Israel, that is already beginning to be deployed to Israel, that the U.S. has managed to convince Israel to limit its response to military targets inside of Iran. And that's because a person familiar with the matter has told us that Israeli officials, including the Israeli Prime Minister have communicated that Israel will not strike those nuclear or oil facilities. That being said, we are not hearing that from the Israeli government publicly for now. The Israeli Prime Minister's office saying that they will ultimately make their own final decision about what and when to strike as it relates to Iran. So, clearly, not publicly conveying for now that they have taken those other strike options off the table. We will ultimately only really find out once Israel actually carries out this action. We don't know when that will be, but we do know that, that new anti-missile defense system that has been provided to Israel, it has already begun to arrive. Components of it arriving in Israel today alongside some of the 100 U.S. troops who will operate it. The rest of those components and troops set to arrive in the coming days.",

Well, nearly 100 American medics who volunteered in Gazahospitals have written an open letter to the Biden administration urging it to immediately stop U.S. arms shipments to Israel. And they describe really in heartbreaking detail what they witnessed with their own eyes. And one passage says, \"every one of us who worked in an emergency intensive care or surgical setting, treated pre-teen children who were shot in the head or chest on a regular or even daily basis. It is impossible that such widespread shooting of young children throughout Gaza sustained over the course of an entire year is accidental\" -- their words. We're now joined by one of the doctors who signed that letter, Nabeel Rana is currently at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, he joins us now. Doctor, appreciate you being with us. Let me start really where that passage I just read out continues. And it reads, \"President Biden and Vice President Harris, we wish you could see the nightmares that plague so many of us since we have returned. Dreams of children maimed and mutilated by our weapons, and the inconsolable mothers begging us to save them.\" Can you just take a moment, doctor, and just share with our listeners, the viewers on what you have been seeing on the ground right now.

And so, all of that was being set up for a disaster from infectious disease standpoint and all these other things that we weren't even dealing with at that time. But that's why we're focusing on trauma because everything was damage control. And the difference now is the conditions have significantly worsened as expected. And I think it was orchestrated that way. Everyone is in much worse condition in their -- in their tents. Everything is tattered. Their clothes are tattered. People don't have shoes anymore.

It's not really a good bill effort to try to improve anything. In Indiana, if you want humanitarian aid, you have to stop dropping bombs on the civilians.

Her name is Julie Adams, and she made news earlier this Spring when she refused to certify the results of the presidential primary. But in his ruling, Judge McBurney being very clear, highlighting existing Georgia law, that certification is mandatory. Now, early voting has been massive, there's been record turnout already, we have five hours left to go and we're 20,000 more voters checking in than all of 2020 on the first day of early voting. So, about 154,000 people as of 1:00 p.m. And they're showing up to something that looks a little different than it did in 2020. For starters, there's going to be fewer absentee ballot drop boxes, those were a point of contention, if you remember, they were available 24/7. This time around though, they're only going to be available during normal business hours and they will be located inside elections offices or places for early voting. Also in 2021, a law that some here called pretty silly, you can't pass out food or water within 150 feet of where a ballot is being cast, that has gone into effect. But finally, they're expanding early voting, adding two Saturdays and potentially two Sundays as counties see fit. And you can already see the enthusiasm from those Georgia voters.

Who is the target audience, I should say, and what will be the message? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, her pitch really is grounded in her support for entrepreneurs. She thinks that, that message is particularly resonant with black men. So 1 million loans, up to $20,000. She's going to talk about that as part of a future Harris administration as well as legalizing marijuana and ensuring that black men actually have access to the industry and protecting cryptocurrency assets as well. And really what we're seeing from the Vice President and by extension, Democratic surrogates is that they are arguing -- listen, you know, some of these men may feel a kinship with the former President, may be connecting with him largely based on machismo, but it is ultimately her that will speak to the policies that will actually enrich their lives.

He hasn't obviously sat down with many in the mainstream media, but on top of that, he usually -- when we shout for the same questions about tariffs does not answer them. Specifically, he talked about his economic policy and those tariffs because of the fact that economists across the board have said that this would actually add to inflation. So, for the first time he had to push back on that and explain some of these economic policies, now Donald Trump did what Donald Trump does, which was, weave in and out of topics, talk about other conversations he's had with foreign leaders or business leaders, not directly answer quite a few questions, but he was put on the spot and did answer a few questions when it came to tariffs about how he thought that, that would be implemented. The other things that he was asked about was whether or not he had spoken to Vladimir Putin since leaving office, he refused to answer that question, at one point, saying he wouldn't talk about something like that, but if he did, if he did talk with Vladimir Putin, it would be the smart thing to do. So, you can take away what you want from that. The other thing is, he was asked about January 6th when he essentially said that, that day was about love and peace. Obviously, we know the day was not about love and peace. Then he also said there's a peaceful transition of power, something that did not happen when he left office. So, back-and-forth there, but I do -- I do want to quickly talk about campaigning because we are in the state of Georgia, obviously critical swing state, one of the things he is doing -- why you have Kamala Harris trying to reach out to men is, he today is trying to reach out to women. He is sitting down with \"Fox\" for an all women town-hall about women's issues. This is a group, a demographic that is completely plagued him. They have moved away from him since 2016, and he would like to secure as many female voters as he can. He even publicly has indicated that he feels confused as to why women wouldn't want to vote for him, saying, I would be your protector. I would take care of you. Many women don't feel comfortable with that language, but he continues to say it. And those who support him find that fine. But this is something that he has really tried to work towards. It seems unclear whether or not they'll ultimately move back towards Donald Trump, but clearly, sitting down for an all-woman town-hall, questions on women's issues is something that they plan to do, which clearly shows you where they're focused in this final critical stretch.",

The Biden administration is demanding Israel improves the humanitariansituation in Gaza within the next three days, or it could risk violating U.S. laws governing foreign military aid, suggesting if Israel does not comply, it could jeopardize U.S. military funding. Despite the stern warning, one of the U.S.'s most powerful anti-missile systems, the THAAD, is beginning to arrive as we heard from our Jeremy at the top of the hour in Israel. A source familiar with the discussion says Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assured the U.S. that any counterstrike with on Iran will be limited to military targets rather than Iran's oil or nuclear sites. In response to that report, Mr. Netanyahu's office says Israel will consider U.S. opinions, but ultimately, decide its own response.

He was killed alongside Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli attack on Beirut last month. Now, Fred Pleitgen joins me now from Tehran.

Along with the mourning, anger at the United States and Israel and vows for continued support of Hezbollah. Fatimeh Karach (ph) joining in the chants. We are one, she says. These geographical distances do not mean that we are separated from Hezbollah, from Lebanon. We are all one and we are all enemies of Israel. Abbas Nilforoushan was a career soldier. Among those paying their respects, much of Iran's political and military leadership, including Esmail Qaani, the head of the Revolutionary Guard's Quds Force, who had been out of public sight since the Nasrallah assassination. Bashir Roshani (ph) served under Abbas Nilforoushan in the Iran-Iraq war. We see it as our legal and religious duty to continue the path of the dear martyrs, he said. The criminal Israelis are killing oppressed children. And then, the deaths to Israel chants begin again. Israel targeted Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with a massive airstrike in Beirut on September 27th. Abbas Nilforoushan was at the scene as well and also killed. Iran hit back several days later, firing almost 200 ballistic missiles at Israel. The Iranians now warning that if Israel strikes back at Iran, Tehran will retaliate, not ruling out further escalation. Music to the ears of many of the hardliners here. Definitely, we can destroy Israel, she says. Iran is stronger, stronger than Israel can even imagine. Tough words as another senior figure is brought to his final resting place. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera):  So, as you can see, they're pretty charged up atmosphere there on the ground in Tehran today. I have to say, as we were walking along with that funeral procession that was going on, at the same time, the Iranians have now said that for them, there are no red lines as they put it in the defense of the Iranian population, but also their interests they say here in the Middle East. The Iranians, of course, also now warning countries of this region, Isa, not to allow Israel to use their airspace to attack Iran or for attacks on Iran, saying that could have detrimental effects for those countries.

But when we speak to people here in Tehran, of course, in other places also, they are quite concerned, not necessarily about these possible Israeli strikes that could happen in the not-too-distant future, but really much more about a possible larger escalation in the greater Middle East and at some point that pitting Iran and the United States directly against one another. I think the fear of larger instability here in the greater Middle East is certainly something that drives a lot of people. Worries a lot of people. They are quite concerned. At the same time, there is a lot of anger towards the U.S. and Israel, especially as far as that strike is concerned against Hassan Nasrallah, but certainly, also against that IRGC general as well.

Both Harrisand Donald Trump, along with their running mates, have visited the state multiple times this campaign cycle, vying for Michigan's all important, of course, 15 Electoral College votes. Joe Biden narrowly won Michigan back in 2020, beating Trump with just 3 percent of the vote. The margins even tighter if we go back to 2016, when Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just 10,000 votes. And the latest polling shows the state is still, as you can see there, pretty tossed up. The Critic Poll showed a Trump lead within, though, the margin of error. Joining us now with her on the ground perspective is Zoe Clark, Michigan, Radio Political Director. Zoe, really appreciate you being with us, trying to make sense of these crucial last few weeks. 21 days to go. Just give us a sense of what we can expect here, because we know it's a tight race, but what are you hearing from your listeners as to which way the state may go here?",

And what we're really noticing is over the past few weeks, the candidates have beenhere or trying to sort of tell their message, tell their story about why they are looking for maybe undecideds, for swing voters, independent voters. But here's the thing, absentee ballots have already started to go out in Michigan and in the City of Detroit. Michigan's largest city early, in- person voting begins Saturday. So, what we're really seeing is now a shift on the ground from sort of telling the story and the message to it is boots on the ground, trying to build up enthusiasm. And what we like to say is GOTV, get out the vote.",

That's different than undecided, but independent voters, but they tend to come home in the end, right? They tend to say, well, I don't know, but then they vote Democrat, or I don't know, and then they vote Republican. So, what we're watching right now is very interesting. The latest polling getting very small when it comes to the undecided, some possibly 1 percent in one poll that just came out this week. And as the political editor at that paper who sponsored the poll said, at that point, if you're still undecided, it's questionable whether you're even going to turn out and vote at this point.",

And this goes backto what we're saying in the states, this so-called sort of vibe election, right? The data may show one thing, but how folks are actually feeling when it comes to pocketbook issues, feeling when they're paying bills, when they're paying for daycare, looking for affordable housing or trying to buy gas. And what we know, as you asked, what we're hearing on the ground is indeed folks are saying the economy, the price of things, inflation, but there's this added nuance that I'm really hearing too. And I think this is for voters who maybe are or earlier stages in their life. So, I'm talking 20s, 30s, 40s, and it's not just the economy of right now in this moment, but it's forward-looking, right, this idea of wanting to build a better middle- class life for either them or for their current family or a perspective family. And so, when you dig into that question, there's also some voters who say, you know, when we're looking towards the future, that's really what Kamala Harris is talking about, that we're not going back, right. But whether or not she can deliver that, we're not going back, and here's what my future plans are, that's where I think there are some voters who are still really trying to understand what will her policies versus Trump policies mean for me and my family.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAMRA'A LUQMAN, COMMUNITY ORGANIZER:  I made the political calculation that I need to vote for Trump, whether I like it or not, in order to effectuate accountability for the genocide. With genocide, I think that even if you were to weigh all the domestic policies, the value of human life to me is - - it outweighs everything. It outweighs women's rights, student debt elimination, economy, health care, everything that I love and espouse and have fought for all my life, when I put that against human life, I -- it's nothing.

This was with our presidentialprimary, whether there was a vote between Joe Biden or literally, you could vote, check a box for uncommitted. 100,000 Michigan voters checked uncommitted and they were really hoping to show a sign, right? Just make a statement to the Democratic Party of how they were feeling. The fact is though, uncommitted is not on the ballot on November 5th. Uncommitted is really not a choice at this point. And so, what you're hearing from some voters is, well, we're going to vote for Harris because we think in terms of what's happening in Israel. And again, this is some voters that it's the least worst option. There's others who are saying, like the uncommitted movement, were neither endorsing Harris or Trump, but we're fervently anti-Trump there we'll say. Or there's others, like the voter that you spoke with, who is saying, look, we're going to take a stand and vote for Donald Trump. And so, this is what the campaigns are really trying to figure out, particularly in the Democratic Party, which is such a coalition government.",
