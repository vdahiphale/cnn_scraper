      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.Breaking the bank, Donald Trump needs about half a billion dollars ASAP. But the former President says he can't find anyone to help him cover the massive payment that's coming due, for fraud. A week from the deadline, Michael Cohen is here to respond. Also, are they getting the band back together? Because Paul Manafort, who once gave secret Trump polling data, to a Russian intelligence agent, not to mention was jailed for fraud and then pardoned by Trump, is now in talks to return, for the Republican National Convention. And after a flood of conspiracies, Princess Kate was just seen, on camera, for real, this time. We think. That renewed speculation since she underwent surgery, in January. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump is finally acknowledging, tonight, that he does not have the cash that he has long claimed he does. And it comes exactly one week before he needs to fork over at least $464 million, to cover that fraud judgment, against him, here in New York. I say, at least, because there's also interest, a $115,000 a day, to be precise. Trump's lawyers, telling a court today that their client is facing, quote, \"Insurmountable difficulties,\" that he can't pay the bond, and he can't find anyone to underwrite it. He was denied by more than 30 companies that they approached, to help, each one unwilling to accept his real estate holdings as collateral. Instead, they want money. That means the New York Attorney General, Tish James, could start collecting as soon as next week, as Trump is facing the very real prospect that some of his accounts could be frozen, his property seized, or both. It's a precarious situation, for the presumptive Republican nominee for president. And it gets to the very heart of what this whole fraud trial was about, inflating the value of his assets, claiming that they're worth more than they actually are. Not to mention inflating how much cash he actually has. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We have a lot of cash. I believe we have substantially in excess of $400 million cash, which is a lot for a developer. Developers usually don't have cash. They have assets, not cash. We have, I believe 400-plus and going up very substantially every month. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, to be fair, there are plenty of billionaires that could stroke that check, in a heartbeat. And many have, who have had issues for substantially greater than $500 million, which brings me to the point that Donald is so fast to call for everyone to be charged with perjury. That's his new thing. He likes everyone to get charged with the 1001 violation, myself included.

The Board declined to provide a statement, tonight, to THE SOURCE, about why. But they did share minutes, from a meeting, where it was alleged that Foster had revealed confidential information, and they claimed he had broken the law. He says, he was fired simply for responding to information requests, about the efforts, underway, to remove books that has been playing out there, in that city, for months. In early February, the Board of Trustees implemented new policies, banning the library, from buying new books, with sexual or LGBTQ content, for readers, who were 17-years-old or younger, or to move certain books with certain content, to different sections of the library. Tonight, that fired Library Director is sharing his story. And Andrew Foster joins me now. And it's great to have you here. Just when you look at this, do you believe that this was all motivated, by your pushback, to that change in the policy? ANDREW FOSTER, FORMER AUTAUGA-PRATTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY DIRECTOR: And it's good to be here. I definitely. In the reporting that's happened, especially at that local level, I think there have been several stories that have been published, including some that do seem to allude to that it was my disagreement, my asking many, many questions about it, to try and receive clarity, on how I was supposed to act, in my capacity, as Library Director, that that could have motivated it, though, I cannot speak for the Board on that.",

And in my asking for clarity, an important point is that I, as the Library Director, am answerable to the entire Board of the Library Board, not to individuals.And so, in my question asking in, my pushing for answers, several times I asked, I need this to be a clarification by the Board. I need this to be clarified to me, by the entirety of the Board, all six, seven, it's a seven-person board, but we had six members, in an open meetings, because that is legally, to my full understanding, how that process has to work. And there were several incidents, where I'd ask that pushback. And the Board lawyer would respond and say, no, we don't have to do this in an open meeting. The policies, say yes.",
