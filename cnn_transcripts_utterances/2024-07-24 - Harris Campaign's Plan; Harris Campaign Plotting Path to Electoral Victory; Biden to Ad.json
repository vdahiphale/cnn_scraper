That is what the Harris campaign says has opened up to Democrats after the vice president jumped into the race. That campaign released a memo overnight claiming that the campaign is redrawing its electoral map going beyond the blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. The Biden campaign, it sort of resigned itself to that strategy. The Harris campaign says it can expand. Meanwhile, President Biden is preparing to give an Oval Office address that he honestly never wanted to give, explaining why he has dropped his campaign. CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House.

The campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, released a memo this morning, arguing that they really believe Harris can expand from support in 2020, explicitly referencing her appeal among black, Latino, and young voters. And they also believe she has a real opening with the undecided voters in this campaign.What Jen O'Malley Dillon argued was that there is now an expanded universe of winnable voters. They believe many of these undecided voters are Democratic leaning and also, that they care about some of the issues Vice President Kamala Harris is set to champion in her campaign. Now, it's a bit of a difference from where the Biden campaign was just a few weeks ago. They are now -- Harris is saying that they will be able to play on offense in all of the battleground states when just two weeks ago, the Biden campaign had outlined that their clearest path to victory was simply in the blue wall, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. So, now, they really. are seeing many more multiple pathways to the presidency for Kamala Harris. Now, Harris yesterday made her battleground state debut in the battleground State of Wisconsin, really previewing the pitch she's planning to take to voters as she makes her case against Donald Trump, but also zeroing in on issues like expanding economic opportunity for the middle class and abortion rights. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We, who believe in reproductive freedom, will stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans because we trust women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.

Of course, with Kamala Harris now seeming like Donald Trump's more likely opponent this fall. But look, I think this rally today is going to be really interesting. It's going to essentially offer us the first glimpse of how Donald Trump and his campaign are trying to define Kamala Harris, which they now see as their most likely opponent come this fall.And remember, just four days ago, Donald Trump was back on the trail after having accepted the Republican presidential nomination in Milwaukee. And then, he was still facing off Joe Biden and a reach match with the president. Now, of course, the political terrain has shifted under his feet. And I'm really told that his campaign is trying to reimagine the playbook that they have had for over a year now that was solely focused on going after an 81-year-old unpopular incumbent. And now, they're really trying to figure out what best way to define Kamala Harris as they look ahead. Now, Donald Trump and his team have been workshopping different lines of attacks against Harris. We heard some of those during a call that Trump himself held with reporters yesterday. I will point out this is the first such call of its type this election cycle. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I haven't agreed to anything. I agreed to a debate with Joe Biden, but I want to debate her and she'll be no different because they have the same policies. I think debating is important for a presidential race. I really do.

His goal, to put the focus back on the war against Hamas and also getting hostages out. The Biden administration has voiced some renewed optimism around a possible hostage deal and ceasefire.But when it comes to Netanyahu specifically, many Democrats, nearly 90 of them now, they don't want to hear it. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers from both the House and Senate have said that they will not be attending Netanyahu's speech. Who will also not be there, Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican Vice Presidential Nominee J. D. Vance. Vance will not attend due to vice presidential nominee duties. That's according to the Trump campaign. And Kamala Harris is going to be meeting with Netanyahu privately tomorrow. Joining us right now is Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. It's good to see you again, Congresswoman. You announced yesterday you will not be attending the speech. I do remember you also did not attend his last address, I believe, to Congress some years back. Why are you not attending this time? REP. JAN SCHAKOWSKY (D-IL):  Well, first of all, Kate, thank you very much for having me today. You know, I am a proud Jewish woman, and I have had a long connection to the State of Israel. And frankly, that is why I am not going to hear Benjamin Netanyahu, who the majority, two-thirds of Israelis, want to see him gone. I'm really disappointed that he has been invited to speak at -- in the United States by both the Republicans and Democrats. And I hope that people will understand that he is a danger to the State of Israel, to peace in the region. He is in -- he is a danger to the -- you know, so many people want to see the hostages come out. And they are not going to because he doesn't care about them. And we are still seeing Palestinians that are dying in Gaza. And this is time for the war to end. He does not want this war to end. Because as long as he -- as it continues and he is in power, then he is happy. Because if he is not in power and he is thrown out like the -- most Israelis want, he could end up going to jail.

I cannot go there because I see, in some way, it is some kind of a justification for him. And I don't want to be there and I am concerned. He's a very clever guy.
