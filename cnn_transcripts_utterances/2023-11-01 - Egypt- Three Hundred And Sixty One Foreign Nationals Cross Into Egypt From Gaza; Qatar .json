We are told that one of them is 71- year-old Dr. Ramona Komora(ph), and she is -- she was a pediatric orthopedist who had been making orthopedics for Palestinian children when the war between Israel and Hamas broke out. And she, according to her brother who spoke to CNN crossed the Rafah Crossing early this morning around 4:00 a.m. local time. So that is expected to be very welcome news, obviously, not only for her family, but also for the U.S. government. They are hoping that all of the kind of 400- plus Americans as well as their family members who want to leave are going to be able to in the coming days. And so far, they are optimistic. According to our sources, they believe that this process has been going fairly smoothly today, and they expect it to continue. But look, all of this could be complicated by the strikes that we saw on the Palestinian refugee camp. The deal that was struck, we are told was struck before that strike happened, and they're of course, where very delicate negotiations going on between all of these third-party countries as well with the U.S. and Qatar to try to get these people out, particularly those who were wounded. We saw the Palestinians who were wounded were able to leave Gaza this morning. But all of this, you know, it is very sensitive, it is very delicate, and it could fall apart very easily. However, again, we are told that U.S. officials are confident at this point that Americans are going to be able to leave. They began leaving today. They're expected to continue being able to depart in the coming days in different tranches. And so, obviously, the U.S. watching this very closely to make sure nothing goes wrong here. One question that we have asked the IDF is whether they have seized their bombing of the area around the Rafah Crossing, ceased hostilities there to allow this to move forward. It does seem at this point like that is the case, however, they have not officially confirmed that on the record, Becky.",

Sources familiar with these negotiations say up to 500 foreign nationals could be allowed out, although U.S. officials say ultimately the number could be in the thousands.",

And so that is a sticking point. Also a sticking point about what may come through that Rafah border crossing as far as aid and fuel is concerned. Certainly at one point the demand was from Hamas for fuel and fuel for northern Gaza. The other key point here is a prisoner exchange. What do we understand? Well, at this point we are told here by the prime minister's advisor that the priority at this point is women and children being held in Gaza in exchange possibly for women and teenagers being held in Palestinian -- in Israeli jails. So a lot of parameters, Isa, and it's difficult to understand exactly where these talks are. Diplomatic sources telling me that these talks are ongoing. Nothing concrete as of yet when it comes to the hostages. But we have had the evacuations. So as I said, some light on what is a very dark period at this point. Let me get you to Melissa Bell, who is in Cairo. And she has been across everything that has been going on at that Rafah border crossing today. What do we know definitively at this point, Melissa?",

      "sentences": "What we've just been hearing, Becky, in the last few moments, that the first Americans have madetheir way out of Gaza into Egypt. One physician has had her family confirmed that she is amongst those to leave Gaza. But we have heard from the State Department. The first American citizens have come out. We heard earlier on the 361 foreigners, dual nationals, with British, French, Italian, Saudi, Jordanian nationals that had made it through the Rafah crossing into that very difficult and long process of getting their identity papers checked and then (INAUDIBLE) 63 making their way to Cairo. Others still going through the processing. And as for those who had not made it yet, remember that there are 491 scheduled to come out today. What we are hearing from officials involved in that evacuation process is that some of them may simply not have made it to the Rafah gate in time or may have refused to leave, as the rest of their family members were not on the list. So it gives you an idea I think of how complicated this process is going to be over the coming days. We've been hearing from American officials that they believe that there may be up to 7,000 foreign or dual national citizens inside of Gaza. What we understand as a result of the very complex negotiations you were speaking about, Becky, is that this is a comprehensive deal when it comes to the foreign dual nationals. All of them are to be allowed out in the coming days. I think is important to note that, even as we watch these foreigners come through the gate, the other important part of this is that it's the first Palestinians being allowed to leave Gaza since brutal siege on the enclave was announced by Israel more than three weeks ago now; 81 of the most severely wounded were penciled to come out today. We have seen the ambulances going out back and forth and taking them out. These are the very first Palestinians and we understand that there will be more to follow, Becky.",

Good to have you, Melissa, thank you very much indeed. You are, Isa, bang up to date with what we understand on the preapproved evacuations, more to come in the coming days of foreign nationals and these Palestinians who are severely injured and the separate file, we have to be very clear about that. The separate file that is the hostage file, those negotiations as I understand it still ongoing by the very tough. Back to you.",

Their rescue a major priority forIsraeli ground troops as they push deeper into Hamas-controlled enclaves. While a very small number of people have been freed since the October 7th attack, the majority remain captive, possibly hidden in a maze of tunnels in Gaza. The IDF say there are up to 240 hostages. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing immense pressure to get the captives home. Earlier today, in Jerusalem, a stark display. You are looking at dozens of empty beds and cribs lining the streets around the city hall. A reminder of all the people taken by Hamas on that horrific day, October the 7th. Ofri Bibas Levy's brother, her sister in law and their two sons, one of which is just 9 months old, were taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October the 7th. It is believed they are now being held hostage in Gaza. She joins me now from Golan Heights in Israel. Ofri, thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us this evening. We have seen on the show, we have been reporting here to our viewers, foreign nationals being able to leave Gaza; unfortunately, no hostages. We have though seen four hostages being released in the last few weeks, as you would've seen. Four out of 240, important to point out. Seeing the release, does that give you hope? Or does this cause you more pain? OFRI BIBAS LEVY, HAMAS HOSTAGE'S SISTER: I am happy for them. I am happy for the families. But for me, personally, it does cause a lot of pain. It is hard to see their release. It is part of the Hamas game, their propaganda. It is not part of any kind of negotiation or a massive move to get everyone out. Frankly, just hearing what is going on during this, almost a month since my family was taken, Israel bringing humanitarian aid inside Israel, is now letting people out. And we still don't know anything about our families. I don't know where they are. I don't know if the baby is getting his formula. I do not know if Ariel (ph) is getting enough food. He's 4 years old, was having problems gaining weight. He doesn't have reserve in his body. He could get to a malnutrition state really quick. I don't know if my brother, who was kidnapped, whether he was hurt. He was bleeding from his head. And they hit him with a hammer. I don't know if he was taken care of. But still, Israel is expected to do all of this humanitarian steps toward the civilians there. And my family, they are also civilians. They are babies and children and people who are hurt. And we don't know anything about them. For almost a month now we don't know anything about them. We don't know if they're alive or dead, if they're being fed, if they are being tortured or where they are. So -- (CROSSTALK)",

Maybe they think it is -- I'm just thinking all the time that they must be really, really, scared. Hoping that Ariel (ph), the baby, has not witnessed too many horrible things that children should not witness. I'm thinking about Ariel (ph) when I see my own daughter who is 4 years old and I see her playing in the afternoon or in the House in the morning, going to sleep in a bed. I'm thinking about him, where is he sleeping? What has he been doing for the last month? Is he being held in some dark room underground? I am thinking about my brother, which is hurt, and probably separated from them. He doesn't know what is going on with them. For sure, he doesn't know what's going on with him.
