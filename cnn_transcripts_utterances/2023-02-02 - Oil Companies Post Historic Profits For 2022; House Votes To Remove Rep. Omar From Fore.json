ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Shell all just posted record obliterating annual profits. If you think they're going to use the money to make your trip to the pump less painful, think again.CNN's Matt Egan is at the magic wall to help us understand this. Matt, how much money are we talking about here? And what exactly are they planning to do with it since it doesn't seem to be give the rest of us a break?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kasie, a big oil is minting money right now. Check out these eye-popping numbers. Shell, Exxon, Chevron, all of them have doubled their profits over the past year. All of them to record highs. Exxon alone, $59 billion. If you add all this up, you get a mountain of money, $135.5 billion to be exact. That is enough money to basically buy the NFL.Forbes pegs the valuation of the 32 NFL franchises at $137 billion. It could basically just use last year's profits to buy that to take this a step further. That's enough money where they could buy Ralph Lauren, Peloton, Delta, BestBuy, Etsy, Chipotle, combined. So what are these companies doing with all of this money? Well, they are spending on expensive drilling projects, but not aggressively enough, according to their critics, which includes the White House. They are spending aggressively on rewarding shareholders. Look at these buybacks that have been announced, $4 billion from Shell, $50 billion from Exxon, and Chevron alone, $75 billion in buybacks.

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, there's a number of factors here. The war in Ukraine, of course, sent prices for oil and natural gas sharply higher. Demand has bounced back from COVID.And this is a key one. Big Oil is under a lot of pressure from Wall Street. Investors don't want companies to spend on expensive drilling projects that may or may not pan out. They want them to reward shareholders with buybacks and big bullet Big Oil is certainly listening. One other important factor here, this is a notoriously boom to bust industry. When times are bad, they're really bad. Look at this, Exxon lost $22.4 billion in 2020. Some companies went out of business. But, Kasie, clearly, these latest numbers show that boom times are back in Big Oil.",

Demand is not the issue here, it's supply. Winter weather knocked out some refineries, that has caused gas prices to creep back up, 28 cents in the last month, 40 cents from the low in December.The question is, how much higher do gas prices go?

McCarthy vowed to take -- kick off Ilhan Omar for the past year and a half or so from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.But I asked him today whether or not this was just tit for tat. Republicans now going after Democrats retro -- political retribution of sorts. And he claimed this situation is different. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): We're not removing her from other committees.

And this wasn't just its second month of operation. Tom Foreman joins us now to help us understand this. Tom, I will admit, I had to get -- give myself a crash course in what this app was and what it does. So if you could kind of walk our viewers through.

It's not searching the internet. It's doing it from its database.It can write essays, basic business letters, notes to your mom, it can do all that in a very human like way. It can solve basic math problems. It can write simple computer code, I say simple because not the most elaborate and it can give human like unique results. It seems like a human is writing this in a matter of seconds. So for an example, one of our producers said let's ask it, how talented is CNN's Tom Foreman? This is the answer it wrote in just seconds. Tom Foreman is a highly talented journalist and correspondent for CNN. His extensive experience and reporting has covered many major news events.

Compare that to TikTok took nine months to reach that level when at launched. Instagram, two and a half years. So, yes, this is a sensation. We -- when we've reported on this so far, before it reached this level. I have said, get on board, start learning about this, because this will change your life, not just this, but where AI is going.

They're trying to figure out how they can stop that.There's a threat to jobs. I mean, look, if you're a company out there that currently has somebody who does some kind of writing for you at a low level, your plumbing company, and somebody has to write your business letters, if you have an AI app that will write them for you, that person may have lost a job. Cybersecurity concerns and interestingly, a lack of morals. Do think about this. The question is, it is still an AI bot. It doesn't know in a grand sense what it is saying. So it could embrace racist ideas, it could embrace -- they build safeguards in against that. The question is, how long does that last? And does that extend to other companies who then emulate this and move forward? Artificial Intelligence is a really interesting thing.

Part three is usually taken by med school graduates. We should note that the AI barely passed, but you know what they call a med school grad who barely passes the exam. They are still a doctor.

And the chatbot got the questions right more than half of the time.Researchers found that it had a greater than 50 percent accuracy and they also said that it exceeded 60 percent in most analyses. And 60 percent is the threshold that they use to gauge whether it passed or not. And what I mean by complicated questions. Here's an example. There's one question about a 52-year-old woman who developed an unusual cough. And it's important to note, she was taking lisinopril, that's a medication for high blood pressure. And the ChatGPT accurately answered this question. You want to know which one it was here? It was D. That was the correct answer. And the ChatGPT, not only correctly answered it, but it gave reasoning behind it, saying that the lisinopril was part of the reason why she developed this cough. It was an unusual side effect. So that's an example of how the ChatGPT, not only answered the questions accurately, Kasie, but it also gave reasoning behind it as well.
