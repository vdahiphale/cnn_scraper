The 45-page indictment narrates a Trump plot to undermine democracy and stay in power after losing an election. And it does so with some new evidence, including real time notes from then Vice President Mike Pence, the politics.The third Trump indictments with the Republican field into familiar camps with a headline exception. The charges will also test Joe Biden's resolve to do what is sometimes unnatural, stay quiet. The consequences how the prosecution plays out in court and on the campaign trail may determine the future of both Donald Trump and American democracy. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Tomorrow, a court date for the former president here in Washington. Today the country gets a line-by-line look at the plot against America and the alleged crimes of Donald Trump. Central to the indictment is the special counsel's assertion that yes, Mr. Trump knew that he lost the election and push lies to stand up its anyway. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These judges after the Capitol attack were in this building. Behind me they could see out their window, barricades, and militarized presence tags on the streets protecting the U.S. Capitol. After that riot, these judges have also had to make sure they are overseeing hundreds of rioter prosecutions getting those people through the system. Looking at those prosecutions sentencing many of those convicted rioter defendants from January 6. So now they turn to this additional case against Donald Trump himself. So, really just a notable scene that we're going to have tomorrow. And when you step back for a second and look at this, Dana, this is really a case that boils down the sweep of everything that the Justice Department had been looking into, everything that Congress had been looking into with the House Select Committee. And now, putting it together for a case against Donald Trump a conspiracy to defraud voters, to defraud the electoral college process to certify the vote, and the conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government itself and the transfer of power.",

It's probably one of the best things that he has done for himself, frankly, is that he is stuck to that script. And it is a challenge. It is going to be a challenge for prosecutors. What they're going to do is what you saw in that indictment, where they describe and they literally list all of the different people that the former president has relied on, that he picked, right. Vice President Pence, his intelligence, all the people in the intelligence community people, his former attorney general, his acting attorney general, his White House counsel, his chief of staff, everybody was telling him what was true. And he chose instead to listen to, you know, let's just say, you know, another group of people, right, who were not experts. And so, what the prosecutors are going to make the claim or they're going to draw a picture for a future jury is that he should have known because he was being told by all of the people that he relied on for all other matters of state importance, national security importance.

So, he tried to do that through, trying to corrupt the institution of the Justice Department, to try to get the Justice Department to take official actions that would undermine the election outcome. Try to get state legislatures to take actual actions, use their authority as government actors to overturn the election outcome, and try to use the authority of the institution of the vice president of the United States to overturn the rightful outcome of the election.

A jury of five men and seven women just moments ago sentenced 50-year-old Robert Bowers to death for those crimes.Now, Dana, we look through a lot of these jury for mitigating factors and aggravating factors. And I just want to explain to you some of the things that the jury clearly did not buy when it comes to the defense that Bowers' attorneys tried to mount. No jurors bought the alternative thesis for a motive that this was an attack about anything else other than trying to kill Jewish people. Zero jurors bought the defense that Robert Bowers suffered from schizophrenia. And they had a tremendous amount of skepticism about some of the earlier childhood difficulties that the defense tried to bring up to spare Mr. Bowers' life, including attempted suicides. And also, the jury was skeptical when the defense said that Mr. Bowers had abnormalities in the brain. All reasons the defense tried to say should spare Mr. Bowers' life. But in the end, when the jury weighed, those mitigating factors against the aggravating factors, killing 11 Jewish worshippers in October of 2018, specifically, because they were Jewish. Not only that but showing no remorse the prosecution argued throughout the duration of this trial. At one point, a defense witness actually testified that Robert Bowers enjoyed listening through the trial to the evidence that was presented. The jury agreed with the prosecution on that front. This is the result that we are looking at right now that sentence of death. And Dana, I just want to put this in a bit of perspective for you. There have only been two death penalty cases or trials in this Biden administration. But the prior one, the jury came back with a verdict of life in prison. So, this is the first death penalty verdict and decision and sentence in the Biden administration so far, again for 50-year-old Robert Bowers, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooter. Dana?",

The one that is a bit different is from Mike Pence. And one of the main reasons is because Mike Pence is so integral to the story. We saw some new information from the indictment, from the interview that the former vice president did with the special counsel. And here's what he said in his statement after the indictment. He said, today's indictment serves as an important reminder, anyone who puts himself over the constitution should never be president of the United States. Our country is more important than one man.
