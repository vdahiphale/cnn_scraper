And if the Wagner mercenaries are interposed within migrant groups, they could potentially become a stealthy entrant into a country like Poland where a country like Lithuania, so the frontier controls will have to be quite rigid when it comes to the migrants. It is absolutely true that the Belarusians have decided to use migrants as potential pressure point, and they're doing so at the behest of the Russians.But if the Polish authorities are paying as much attention to this, as we believe they are, then I think the migrant flow problem is one that can at least be managed.

It's the best and a times only way to access cities flooded by recent heavy rains. The boats navigating the tight streets at times floating up to the front doors of homes to ferry stranded residents to safer ground. Officials say over the weekend more than 500,000 people have been evacuated from the region, where a powerful storm named Doksuri made landfall as a typhoon Friday after battering the Philippines. It's since been downgraded. But officials are warning of torrential rain and hazardous flooding for any city in this path. And that's includes Beijing, which has been doused with heavy showers that are expected to continue until Tuesday. Authorities have urged residents in the Chinese capital to stay indoors, and thousands of people have already been evacuated from areas with flood risks. Authorities say there could be potentially hazardous conditions like those seen in other parts of the country. In eastern China, security camera footage captured a man caught in rushing waters on a street. A bus driver stopped to help him as the breeze surrounds them. But the man is eventually dragged out of the water with the help of some people passing by. In the southern part of the country, some residents are taking stock of the damage and trying to salvage what they can from their water logged homes. But that break may not last for long as another powerful storm could possibly make landfall in China later this week. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
