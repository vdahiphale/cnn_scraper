I don't care how you feel about the filibuster, this is performative bull from Joe Manchin, which he's very good at, by the way. It's the specialty of his. I've known him a long time because he knows -- I mean, I can tell you that in focus groups with black voters, they will -- Charlamagne tha God, even in his interview with The New York Times, talked about Joe Manchin blocking the Voting Rights Act using the filibuster. The conversation at the time was, should we have a carve-out for issues around constitutional rights? So it was actually around voting rights and reproductive rights. That was added to the conversation after Dobbs was overturned. So, he's being so disingenuous. This is an excuse for him to say, I'm not going to vote for Kamala. MARC LOTTER, FORMER STRATEGIC COMMS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: But how many times do we have to go down this slippery slope and for Democrats to make the mistake that they later pay for?

You sort of forfeit that when you start to become flip and kind of a pundit on your own thing.So, my advice to Moreno would be, look, maybe you've got some disagreements here, but what should you be talking about?

What Obama was able to do in 2012, that was the strategy. It is about getting out of the areas that we typically see candidates go to and talking to people in the more rural areas.

But, listen, I don't think either candidate is doing as they should. I think Donald Trump is worse because he was president. He gave tax cuts to billionaires and millionaires, but he did not raise the minimum wage. We had not raised the minimum wage since 2009. In fact, one of the tragedies was when eight Democrats joined all the Republicans in the Senate to block raising the minimum wage for 50 million people, which would have pumped $330-some billion into the economy.In North Carolina, you have 1.8 million poor and low wage voters. You have over a million voters that didn't vote last time who are poor and low wage. Trump only won by 74,000 votes in every battleground state. Poor and low wage voters now make up 35 to 43 percent of the electorate. There's not a state that's a battleground that if 10 to 12 percent of poor and low wage voters were to vote, that they would not change the outcome of the election. But what the campaigns have to understand, you have to talk to them. You have to say, if you elect me, your wages are going to go up, you're not going to have these low wages and you're going to have health care and you're going to have education, and that's what where we should be. And you have to go outside in North Carolina of the I-40 corridor, Charlotte, Winston, Salem, Greensboro, Raleigh and go to the west and Jackson County and Buncombe County and go to the east, and Trump has not been doing that.

He's not saying how he's going to pay for it or how it would actually work when he does mass deportations, tearing kids from their families, I guess, again. But all of the economists are saying it will increase inflation, we got inflation under three percent, finally, back down. It'll increase inflation. It will -- it's bad for job creation. And the worst of it all is who's going to pay? The working poor and the middle class up to $4000.",

I mean, you know, just today, my old boss Mitch McConnell made a rare comment about Trump and said he doesn't necessarily believe tariffs are a good idea. You're going to see debates like this within the party. I will say the energy is behind Trump on these matters right now.And I do think there's a reason that in our own CNN poll today, 51 percent of Americans said they judged Trump's term to be a success and only 37 percent have judged the Biden-Harris administration to be a success. There is something going on where people are remembering what he did, how he did it, and they're comparing it to what's happening right now. So, you can cherry pick these individual statements or policies. But if you look at the comparative and you look at our own polling, you realize he's hit upon an economic vein that is working for him in this election. He beats Harris on it, and he is viewed as a better president than Biden and Harris.",

They're forgetting about the fact that we lost three million jobs nearly when Trump was president. They're forgetting about the fact that he mismanaged the COVID crisis. They're forgetting about the fact that Donald Trump actually --is this true?Donald Trump has actually inherited -- everything I said is true -- inherited an economy that was doing well and left an economy that wasn't doing well. They're forgetting about the fact that actually -- that we've actually grown by having 16 million new jobs now and Donald Trump has the worst jobs record of any president in recent history. But also, there's another point that needs to be said here is that Donald Trump is a transactional politician. He doesn't have any fundamental beliefs. So, he just says whatever comes to his mind. And the real issue here with Donald Trump is that he's sold himself as this successful businessman who he never was. The guy had six bankruptcies before he even came into office, we know that, and it's not a debatable point. Not only that, but you know, he's got his Donald Trump media company, which is, now it's lost 70 percent of its value this year.",
