Thank you very much.Let's also talk about what Israel is facing in Gaza, should there be a ground incursion. You've got a vast labyrinth of tunnels underneath Gaza. The IDF says Hamas terrorists are hiding in a subterranean network under houses, under apartment buildings, of innocent Palestinian civilians. Hamas, in 2021, claimed to have built over 300 miles worth of these tunnels. And if that's true, it would be a little less than half the length of the New York City subway station - system, I should say. Just think about that. How does this underground network complicate Israel's offensive and efforts to rescue those hostages? With us at the wall, CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. Israel had claimed, John, a couple of years ago, 2021, to have destroyed a lot. They said 62 miles of this tunnel network. Even with that, what are they facing on the ground here?",

It's the way they avoid what is pervasive Israeli surveillance in terms of signals, satellites, cameras. So, it's - it's very important to them.You know, we talked about this earlier, with General Hertling, but these have secret entrances in buildings. They have entrances off the street. They go down hundreds of feet underground.
