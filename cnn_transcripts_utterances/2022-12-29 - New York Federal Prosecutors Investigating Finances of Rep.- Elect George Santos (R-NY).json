That is now gone. City hall, which is behind me, is opening today as are Erie County offices. And we mentioned the flooding. The goal with removing as much snow as possible is so that they can make sure that the drainage system is clear before temperatures reach nearly 50 tomorrow because they are preparing for expecting rapid snow melt as the temperatures rise. We've already seen a lot of snow melt as it is. And one more thing. We're expecting to get an update at the press conference at noon about what more there is to be done to clear the snow in the city and also the death toll. We know from the police commissioner that police did finish going through all of those checks, those 1,100 unanswered 911 calls. They did discover a substantial number of bodies. So, we could see that 37 number rise in a couple of hours here. Jessica?",

A large stretch of I-70 in Colorado finally reopening after severe snow storm weather forced a nine-hour closure that left drivers stranded overnight.

It is still going to be cold but it was the I-25 and the I-70 corridors that really almost shut down and for a while there, I- 70 eastbound to the west of Denver, trying to get back into Denver, nine hours, the road was shut because of semis that had crashed.There is the weather now moving away from Denver, moving into parts of Kansas and Nebraska. We're watching the west, though. This is the next storm system that will affect California, Oregon, Washington and even into Nevada. It will be next storm that makes winter storm weather, winter weather advisories and even flash flood watches in effect because there will be so much rainfall in a place that has been such drought-filled. There is the rain and snow for the west. There is even a little bit of a chance of some severe weather across the Deep South into tomorrow and into even Saturday. And eventually as we work our way into New Year's Eve night, yes, there could be some showers in the northeast and also the next storm system kind of rolling toward Las Vegas. An awful lot of rain and awful lot of snow still to come down in the west in places that desperately need it. But they could be ten inches of liquid equivalent, which is if you melt it all down, that's ten inches of liquid. That's going to be ten feet of snow on top of those mountains. Now, that is the snow that will melt later on this year, Jessica, and that will be helpful for all of those reservoirs that are so desperately low out there, anyway.",

CNN's KFile has also uncovered even more false claims from Santos, including that he was forced to leave a New York City private school when his family's real estate assets took a downturn. It turns out the school has no record of him attending.Let's discuss now Boston Globe Washington Bureau Chief Jackie Kucinich. Jackie, it is great to see you. Good morning. We are still hearing nothing from GOP leadership about these lies, these fabrications. Does Kevin McCarthy need to address this if the conversation continues into next week when they come back in-person, which is also when he will be running for speaker and that floor vote will happen on January 3rd?",

I guess it hasn't happened since the civil war.So, it really -- we're setting ourselves up for something unprecedented if, in fact, this does hold -- or unprecedented in recent times if, in fact, the members do stay together and force other votes or more votes on the floor.

I mean, I think -- so this stretches back before even this vote, because of the permission structure he's created for these members when they do step out of line, when they do things that does cause public condemnation, he really hasn't been someone who stands up to his membership. So, you have to wonder how this is going to look when he does have this very fragile majority of keeping people in line.He's shown them that he basically will do whatever he needs to do to get where he needs to be, but at the end of day, when you need members to take tough votes, you do need some leadership, and we haven't really seen that.

      "sentences": "You're right, this is not a quick read, which is why we have a whole team. It takes a village to try to mine the news out of these transcripts. This is just the latest in a series of batches of transcripts the committee has released. They interviewed approximately a thousand people and they've said that their plan is to release hundreds of these transcripts but they will keep back some that has sensitive information. So, they just released these after not releasing any yesterday.In this list, we're seeing Donald Trump Jr., we're seeing Stephen Miller, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Alyssa Farah Griffin, we know she's been very outspoken after she left the White House, also former White House Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham. These are the people that I think I would go to first. And what we're looking for is any new information, and we've really gotten a lot of new information, I will say, in a lot of these transcript dumps, any mew information about what has happening inside the White House, even slightly before the 2020 election all the way up to inauguration day, specifically when it comes to Donald Trump Jr., for example. Did he have any conversations with his father about the election, about efforts to block the certification of electoral results? When it comes to Stephen Miller, the same thing, what was going on inside the White House, what kind of meetings were taking place, what conversations were there with the Justice Department, with the state level officials? This is going to be a really interesting batch, and I'm curious to see how much news. We know over the past several days, really the past couple of weeks since they released report, we've gotten a lot of new information. For example, efforts to offer blanket pardons to people who were on the Hill on January 6th, the number of officials who told the former president that, in fact, he had lost the election. And that's really significant because one of his core defense is that he was just relying on the advice of his lawyers. So, these transcripts, in many ways, these have provided more news than the final report itself. So, our whole team, we're going to be digging into these and see what new information we can learn and we'll be joining you with that going ahead.",
