And we will have a lot more on the historic indictment of former president Donald Trump later this hour. First up, though, let him go. Those are the words of U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking to CNN about detained American Evan Gershkovich. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporter is now sitting in Russian detention, facing up to two decades in prison if convicted on spying charges. Well, the paper vehemently denies the allegations and stands firmly behind their reporter. At the same time, the Kremlin says accredited foreign journalists can continue working in Russia. This arrest ramping up already high tensions between Moscow and Washington as we hear from CNN's Matthew Chance who is in Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): News of the arrest was brief on Russian state television. A reporter from the \"Wall Street Journal\" was arrested on suspicion of espionage for the United States, the news anchor announces. Evan Gershkovich, he reads, now faces 20 years in prison. He was in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg, 1100 miles from Moscow, that Russia's Federal Security Service, the former KGB, say they terminated the illegal activity of the accredited journalist. They claimed he was on a mission from America to accumulate classified evidence on Russia's military industrial complex. At a brief court appearance in Moscow, the case was designated top secret. And the 31-year-old journalist was remanded in custody for nearly two months. A lawyer trying to represent Gershkovich says he was excluded from the proceedings. DANIIL BERMAN, LAWYER (through translator): I don't know how long it took, three or 15 minutes, and that's it. After that, I assume Evan has already been taken away from here. We don't know anything.",

There's already one U.S. citizen jailed in Russia, too, for espionage, Paul Whelan detained in 2018 serving a 16-year sentence. And it's been just a few months since U.S. basketball star Brittney Griner imprisoned in Moscow on contentious drug charges, was swapped for notorious arms smuggler Viktor Bout held for years in U.S. jail. The Russian Foreign Ministry says there's no question of another prisoner swap at this time. The \"Wall Street Journal\" says it vehemently denies the allegations against their reporter and say they're seeking his immediate release. But Russian officials are doubling down. MARIA ZAKHAROVA, RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON (through translator): Under the cover of journalism, this person was involved in a completely different activity.

But so far, according to the diplomats, that we've been speaking to, that access hasn't been granted. It's not even clear at this point where exactly Evan Gershkovich is being held, although because it's a sort of top secret case, the authorities aren't saying anything about it at all in public. The assumption is he's still at Lefortovo prison, a pre-detention center, a pre-trial detention center rather in Moscow, where cases like his involving crimes like espionage and other serious offenses the people associated with those are often held.

They were called out by hardline members of the government. That was the first time they'd come out and in numbers on the streets. And there was a sense that because the prime minister has decided to delay the judicial reforms that the pro-government supporters have really sort of gone quiet and taken a step back from the situation. Obviously, we've seen smaller anti-government, anti-reform protests continue, and we've talked to those protesters and that they say that they will keep protesting because they think this is just political maneuvering by the prime minister who hopes that if they disappear from the streets because of the pause in the reforms, therefore he, the prime minister, would just be able to get the actual reforms he wants through without any real compromise. So they say that they're going to keep coming out and protesting. So it is significant. That really for the second day you've seen these pro- government supporters come out. But one thing is being associated with these pro-government supporters that there are some tiny fringe right-wing elements amongst their numbers. And it was here on Monday, very close to one of those pro-government rallies, that there was a situation that developed where a Palestinian taxi driver was in fear for his life.
