Meantime -- I'm right, they tell me.To serious news this morning, and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is meeting today with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom. He announced a new package -- Sunak, that is -- of support for Ukraine's military. That includes hundreds of air defense missiles ahead of the highly-anticipated spring offensive. Sunak also promised to start training Ukrainian fighter pilots this summer. That is key. He has said fighter jets are on the table but has not yet taken that step. Zelenskyy has been touring NATO countries seeking to bolster support for Ukraine. He traveled over the weekend to meet the chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz. Also President Emmanuel Macron of France and Italy's President Mattarella. Also, Pope Francis while he was there at the Vatican. Meanwhile, Russia's military is dealing with setbacks, including two commanders killed on the battlefield in Ukraine. On top of this, over the weekend, \"The Washington Post\" reported classified document leaks reveal that President Zelenskyy -- Zelenskyy, the U.S. believes, is plotting an attack inside of Russia. U.S. officials tell CNN the administration is not aware of Ukraine using U.S.-provided weapons to attack Russian territory. There's a lot to get to, so let's begin this hour with Sam Kiley. He is live in Eastern Ukraine with more. Sam, good morning. What is key here? I mean, obviously, it's key to get that British training of Ukrainian fighter pilots.

In the case of Germany, $3 billion almost of military aid. In the case of the United Kingdom, yet another pledge. This time, among other things, for anti-aircraft missiles and very important fighter jet training program. Now, the Brits have said that the Ukrainians have actually backed away from asking the British for Typhoon. But they have added their voice to Zelenskyy's in saying that they would like to see the world that the allies supporting Ukraine give Ukraine F-16s. That, of course, has not yet happened.

They have been able to exploit -- exploit friction between Wagner and the regular Russian arms forces, a lack of coordination. And part of -- I think this is very significant, indeed, in the wider, psychological campaign that Zelenskyy's trip to Europe is part of, which is saying to the ordinary Russian soldier, you may not live to see the end of this year. We've got a lot of gear. We've got a lot of initiative. We've got a lot of intelligence. We can reach out now behind your lines with things like Storm Shadow from the United Kingdom, from -- with our own Ukrainian-built cruise missiles that you're seeing in action.

He's been in power for 20 years. He is now fighting for his political survival against the opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Turkey is a key NATO ally of the United States. But Erdogan has raised eyebrows in the West as they have maintained very warm ties with Russia, even despite that brutal invasion of Ukraine. Erdogan has continued to block Sweden from joining, NATO which would be a major blow to President Putin. CNN's international correspondent, Jomana Karadsheh, is tracking the results in Istanbul.

      "sentences": "Right. And I'll tell you why, Poppy, in just a second. But first, you know, you heard those comments from President Biden.Now, the fact is that this expected surge in illegal crossings, this was anticipated by federal officials initially. But the reality is, according to Alejandro Mayorkas, that did not happen, especially when you compare the numbers here over the weekend. The secretary telling our colleague Dana Bash that the average daily rate of encounters was about 9,000 to 10,000 leading up to the expiration of Title 42 but then quickly following that, that number dropping down to 6,300. Not to mention Saturday dropping again to 4,200. So the results is about a 50 percent decrease in border apprehensions. But this is where Representative Gonzales's argument is. The fact is that this means that there is still some overcrowding issues at some of the DHS processing facilities. And then all you have to do is look behind me to see that many of the shelters, especially here in El Paso downtown, are still dealing with numbers that are either at or exceeding capacity. So, the result is some of the folks, which I should mention are just a few dozen, immediately outside of one of the shelters. Well, they're having to sleep on the sidewalk here. The hope for them is that they will eventually be able to continue with their journey North. So, that really is some important context here, is that that 50 percent decrease in the number of people that were being put into the system for processing and then processed under Title 8. That number has decreased. And that is now allowing not just local officials but, certainly, federal officials an opportunity to get their head back above water. We saw over the weekend, in recently-filed federal court documents, a senior CBP official projects that we could potentially see that number of apprehensions go back up, potentially up to 14,000 in the coming days or weeks. But I can tell you after covering this all weekend here, immediately following the Title 42 expiration, Poppy, you don't see any sign of that.",

She was processed and released immediately before Title 42. But her concern is that her adult-aged daughters are still being held in detention. So she's basically just waiting here in El Paso. It was a very bitter Mother's Day for her, as she was waiting for word on when she could potentially see her two daughters, ages 18 and 20 years old. What you keep hearing again, Poppy, as we send things back to you is the number of asylum seekers arriving in American cities.

So this is incredibly critical. And you guys, on the point of those small business owners, they'realready starting to change their behavior. They're starting to put money away for payroll in case there's some kind of big drama this summer. So if you're putting money away for payroll, it means you're not spending it on other things. You're not making other investments. So already, we talk about that \"X\" date. Already, this is having an effect in the economy. Now, think of it also this way. If we have -- if the government has 80 cents for every dollar of its obligations, that means it won't be paying like veteran benefits. They won't be paying Social Security; maybe give you an IOU. Maybe Medicare won't get completely funded here. That would take the stock market and cause a likely recession. You would see big job loss.
