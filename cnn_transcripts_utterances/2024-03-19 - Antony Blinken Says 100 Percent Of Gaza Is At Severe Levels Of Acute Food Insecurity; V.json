Tonight, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkenurges Israel to provide more assistance to Gaza amid urgent warnings of famine. I will speak to the UNICEF who are in Rafah about the situation on the ground. Then violence explodes in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince. We have a unique look at what life is like for Haitians. They're living in fear. Plus, a closer look at Sudan's civil war. We have an exclusive CNN investigation into the tactics used by RSF militias to force people to enlist. But first this evening, Israel is pressing ahead with its assault on Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza city as a doctor inside the complex calls for urgent intervention, warning the hospital could turn into a mass grave. The IDF says it's killed 50 quote, \"terrorists' in close-range combat so far, it accuses Hamas of using the hospital as cover. Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinian civilians are seeking shelter there. One woman trapped inside told CNN that Israeli forces are firing on people who look out at windows or try to leave their rooms. And the raid comes amid a new push for a ceasefire. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will visit Egypt and Saudi Arabia this week after the latest talks in Qatar ended with no breakthrough. Today, Blinken talked about a new report on the famine, stalking Palestinian civilians. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But in the past, even he and other Israeli officials have made very clear that they were indeed trying to allow only the very bare minimum into Gaza as part of a policy that they have been executing during this war in Gaza. We have seen the Israeli government begin to allow some more aid via new avenues. They opened up a kind  of a test project to allow aid into northern Gaza directly from Israel. We've only seen a few trucks go in, in via that route. They've also, of course, been cooperating with organizations as well as other countries, so, opened up this Maritime corridor. So, clearly, they're starting to get the message, but they are not yet doing enough. That's according, of course, to aid organizations on the ground. But of course, also these international organizations who are increasingly accusing as the European Union's chief of Foreign Affairs officer did, accusing the Israeli government of using starvation as a weapon of war. And the facts on the ground, the reality that people are going through is simply undeniable, made all the more stark by this latest report by the leading global food security authority, which said that half of Gaza's population is now on the brink of far -- of starvation, and that famine is set to arrive in northern Gaza any day now.",

They have been torn during that time between longing for their families in Gaza, wanting to be by their side. But of course, the terror of having to go back there, but this week, they will indeed be sent back by the Israeli government, and they are uncertain and afraid of what awaits them.

This week, that will be torn away, war will become her new reality. \"I might go back and invade Rafah\", her mother Nima(ph) says, \"I'll be the one responsible for anything that harms them. If I go back with the twins, where do I go with them? Where would I get diapers and milk. Gaza is not the same anymore.\" For nearly six months, these three mothers have been living, sleeping and nursing their five babies in this hospital room together. Before the war, their high-risk pregnancies made them eligible to leave Gaza and give birth in Jerusalem hospitals. But now, they've packed their bags after learning that the Israeli government is sending them back to Gaza, where Israel's brutal military campaign has made survival a daily struggle. Hanan(ph), the mother of twins says she's scared of going back to Gaza without a ceasefire. There are diseases spreading, infections, she says, it's not a normal life. They will be among the 22 Palestinians set to be bused on Wednesday to the Kerem Shalom Crossing in the south. Her husband is in the north, and Hanan(ph) is still trying to find a place to live. Despite that uncertainty, Asthma(ph) wants to return to Gaza. \"My daughter is there, she needs me\", Asthma(ph) says. \"Every time she speaks to me, she asks when I'm coming back. Every time, there's an airstrike, children go to hug their mothers, mine has no one to hug.\" At nearby Augusta, Victoria Hospital, nearly 50 Gazan cancer patients have been receiving treatments since before October 7th, watching from afar as their families endure the horrors of war.

Itbasically allows state officials to arrest as well as detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally. The bill was signed into law by Texas Governor Greg Abbott back in December. And it has raised concerns of among other things, increased racial profiling in Texas. Just news coming in, the U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for Texas to begin enforcing this controversial immigration law. We'll stay across, as soon as there are any more developments, we will of course, bring out to you. And staying in the U.S., a hearing is underway examining the military's withdrawal from Afghanistan. The House Foreign Affairs Committee is looking at the chaos surrounding the fall of Kabul and the Biden administration's role in it. General Mark Milley started his comments by acknowledging the families of those who died and how the withdrawal and their deaths was personal for him. He then stated the only -- he only supported withdrawal if certain conditions were met. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And there are family members of those who were killed in the Abbey Gate bombing in the closing days of the withdrawal. But you're right that Democratic lawmakers ripped this as a political hearing.

The RSF, they say, is weaponizing hunger, denying food to those who won't join. Aid groups say almost 4 million children in Sudan are already malnourished as the country faces mass starvation. If aid agencies can't get food to those in need, almost a quarter of a million children could die. Jazira is Sudan's breadbasket. It's heartland. To control this part of Sudan is to exert control over who lives and who dies. The RSF deny they are responsible for the hunger gripping the country. Yet, they control every aspect of farming this land. They control the warehouses of food and aid meant to support the most vulnerable. They control the seed supplies, fertilizer, pesticides, agricultural machinery and irrigation channels. And it's not just the infrastructure. Farmers are being targeted, brutalized, degraded, and even killed. Not just to control food, but to force allegiance.",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, officials at the White House are still combing through this decision from the Supreme Court,but it's certainly a disappointment for the Biden administration. The Justice Department had long argued that as before, this immigration law enacted by the state of Texas would contradict the years of precedence where the federal government was in charge of immigration enforcement. The White House has called this unconstitutional and has pushed back on this specific law waiting for this court to make a decision. Now, President Biden right now is traveling in Reno, Nevada. He just speaking -- finished speaking at an event with campaign workers and volunteers, so we will see whether the president directly will have any comments on this in the coming hours. But it does come as we have seen these clashes between the federal government and the state of Texas over the issue of border security. Texas Governor Greg Abbott taking several steps, including with the state of Texas passing this immigration law which would allow its state agents to arrest people that they suspect have entered the U.S. illegal, that is something -- illegally, that is something that is typically been left to the federal government. Of course, there will still be an appeals process, a legal process that plays out as other challenges are being made to this law. But it does come at a tense moment when it comes to border security policy, especially within the 2024 campaign. We have seen Republicans really tried to use the issue of the U.S. southern border against President Biden, trying to turn this into a major liability for him heading into the election at a time when immigration and border security has really risen among the top concerns for American voters heading into November. President Biden, of course, had pushed for that bipartisan border security bill, something that was negotiated over in the Senate, but ultimately was squashed by Republicans at the urging of Former President Donald Trump. So, this enforcement of the law certainly will be a disappointment for the Biden administration. We are still awaiting official reaction, but it comes at a very tense moment around the debate relating to border security policy and what President Biden has or hasn't done in the views of many Republicans relating to that issue.",
