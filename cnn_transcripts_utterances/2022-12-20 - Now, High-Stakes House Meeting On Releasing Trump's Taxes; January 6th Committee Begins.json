We're waiting a vote on Capitol Hill that could deliver a defeat to Trump after years of his fighting to keep taxes secret.Also tonight, the January 6th committee begins handing over transcripts and other evidence to the Justice Department as it prepares to release its final report. Will the information persuade prosecutors to charge Trump with crimes as the panel is recommending? And breaking news, plans are underway for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to visit the White House tomorrow, as President Biden is set to officially announce the U.S. is sending Patriot missile systems to Ukraine. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Brianna Keilar, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin with two investigations of former President Donald Trump that are moving forward tonight, a House committee deciding whether the public will finally see Trump's tax returns and the Justice Department beginning to receive the January 6th committee's evidence against the former president. Lauren Fox and Katelyn Polantz are following these stories as they unfold this hour. First, I want to go to Lauren who was on Capitol Hill. So, Lauren, how soon could we get a decision on Trump's tax returns?",

Most notably, that security assistance, sources say, is expected to include the U.S. decision to send Patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine. This has been a top priority for President Zelenskyy over t course of the last several months, one that U.S. officials had initially not been willing to move forward on that, has shifted over the course of the last several weeks. The Pentagon has been in process of working on this, as well as the National Security Council. And tomorrow, should this visit go through, as expected, that will be announced with the visit of President Zelenskyy. Now, keep in mind, President Biden has made very clear throughout the course of Russia's war on Ukraine, starting back in February that the U.S. would be behind and beside Ukraine and President Zelenskyy, not just in the near-term but for the long-term and in his word, as long as it takes. Probably nothing will underscore that reality more than the White House and Washington, D.C. serving as the first place for Zelenskyy to visit. And likely, it looks like it won't just be the White House. While plans are still very fluid mostly due to security concerns, there is tentative planning underway for President Zelenskyy also to go down the street of Pennsylvania Avenue to Capitol Hill, potentially to give a joint address to Congress. Again, that is not completely confirmed yet, but officials say that is something that is also being planned here. Keep in mind, he would be on Capitol Hill at the same exact moment lawmakers are considering a spending bill that includes an additional $40 plus billion in assistance to Ukraine, again, something that underscores both in a bipartisan manner and a very significant manner the weight of the U.S. support behind Ukraine's effort over the course of the last nine months, Brianna.",

And when you look at how President Zelenskyy has been working with the media, whether it was official media or media that he himself has generated, it is pretty remarkable. It's kind of like a line out of his T.V. series, Servant of the People, where he played the Ukrainian president, and now, of course, he is the real Ukrainian president.

But that's kind of a weak response compared to the actual fact of visiting Washington and making Washington Zelenskyy's first foreign visit since the start of the war.So, what Putin may do is he may redouble his efforts with Iran. He may try to speed up production of his weapons systems. He may also try to work a more of a draft-type situation in terms of conscription for Russians and get them to really say, hey, the west is ganging up on us. Therefore, we need more troops.

And as the fate of Title 42 remains up in the air, kind of tied up in the courts, it's been a day of political gamesmanship and photo-ops here in El Paso. You're looking at a live drone image of the border. This is where migrants have been lining up for most of the last week. Earlier today, Texas National Guard, sent by the Texas governor, set up a chain link fence with razor wire.You can see dozens of migrants passed all of that, lining up, still waiting to get in. This is the kind of photo-op that the Texas governor has always enjoyed. And this is why we're at where we're at here today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAVANDERA (voice over):  Just hours before sunrise, Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas state troopers constructed a nearly mile-long fence covered in razor wire along the Rio Grande, in the very spot where federal border patrol agents started processing thousands of migrants in the last week. The Texas Military Department says the National Guard did not alert the border patrol or local officials that this fence would be constructed. On Monday, El Paso officials said National Guard soldiers would primarily focus on humanitarian efforts, and with security of migrants who are already in the city, not with deterrent efforts. MARIO D'AGOSTINO, DEPUTY CITY MANAGER, ELPASO, TEXAS:  The state is preparing resources and relocating them to El Paso. They are not activated anything other than security.

And essentially what that has done throughout the course of the day is that migrants have walked to either side of it and then walked back around it. So that is why many here in El Paso are calling this simply a political stunt. This, as the number of migrants that have crossed in the last week because of the latest surge ahead of the possible end of Title 42, has really dwindled drastically.
