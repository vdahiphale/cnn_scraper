The U.S. is now waiting for a verdict as jury deliberation stretch into day two at Trump's trial in Lower Manhattan. So far this week, the panel of 12 New Yorkers have been deliberating for more than nine hours. They have asked to see dense pieces of testimony from former tabloid publisher, David Pecker, and key prosecution witness Michael Cohen. Seven men and five women are carefully deciding whether Trump is guilty of all or any of the 34 felony charges against him, of falsifying business records to hide in effect, a hush money payment to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider joins me now from Washington. Several questions from the jury, some of which was to hear back testimony as we mentioned there from David Pecker and Michael Cohen, and some of which was to hear specific portions of the jury instructions given to them before they begin deliberations. Can you give us the highlights of what they requested specifically?",

      "sentences": "Well, they requested four different parts of testimony, and the takeaway from all of that testimonywas really this hush money \"catch and kill\" scheme that Donald Trump, David Pecker and Michael Cohen entered into right around August 2015. So, all four bits of the testimony that they wanted re-read really had to do with how that scheme was initially formulated and then how it extended in particular to Karen McDougal's deal. The fact that Donald Trump knew who she was, and that the \"National Enquirer\" did pay Karen McDougal off was not reimbursed, which of course goes to this idea of working to promote Donald Trump as a candidate in violation of election law. So, it does seem like the jury is working methodically and chronologically through the evidence that the prosecution laid out. They also wanted to hear back jury instructions because of course, Judge Merchan yesterday gave very detailed jury instructions for about an hour, but the jury is not allowed to take those instructions back to the jury room. They basically have to go by memory or notes they've written down. And Jim, there were a lot of jury instructions that were read back, Judge Merchan didn't read all of them, but they did pertain to things like what the -- what the state has to prove the whole beyond a reasonable doubt -- the definition of that to help the jury understand how much the state has to prove its case. It also talked about the credibility of witnesses, how much you should take and do account when you're evaluating the testimony of witnesses like David Pecker who had a non-prosecution agreement, and Michael Cohen, who has previously pleaded guilty and been convicted of lying to Congress. So, it was really interesting that right now the jury seems to be focused on that whole scheme to pay off people for the benefit of Donald Trump's campaign. And then also wanting to know how exactly do we apply this again to the New York law that we are supposed to be evaluating here.",

There are some really of the first images I want to show you here right now from the scene. Gaza officials are warning people not to return home yet, saying still too dangerous. They say some residents who attempted to enter the area were shot and wounded by critical obtained(ph) drones. That information confirmed by a local journalist working for CNN. Israeli forces say they continue to operate against, quote, \"terrorist infrastructure\". In the south, let's focus on the south because the IDF has said it now has operational control over the Philadelphi Corridor. I want to show you what that is. We're talking about this line here, this long line here between Egypt and Rafah, that's roughly a 14 kilometer buffer zone along Rafah's borders you can see there with Egypt. The IDF today saying it has found about 20 tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza. But Egypt, of course, today, saying -- denying that the tunnels exist. Meantime, Save the Children is calling for urgent international action to protect civilians in Rafah. It says at least 66 people, including children, have been killed in attacks on safe zones there in just the past four days. Israel has denied attacking humanitarian zones. I want to bring in our Jeremy Diamond who is live for us in Jerusalem.

It's actually dissolve parliament and lead to new election. At the moment, they do not. And what is also notable about the timing as it comes on the heels of new polling that shows Benny Gantz actually losing numbers, losing some of his gains we should say that he has been making since the beginning of this war. He's still favored to be the person charged with leading the next -- or trying to form the next government, winning the most seats in the Knesset with his party. But that being said, he is losing seats compared to what he was -- the numbers he was polling about a month ago or so. But we do know that, that -- there is another date coming up, and that is June 8th, about a week from Saturday when Benny Gantz has said that if the Israeli prime minister doesn't give answers about a long-term strategy in Gaza a day after strategy, although, a Palestinian body that would be able to take the reins and fill the power vacuum once Israel defeats Hamas. That he will leave the governments, and it appears that, that is very much what is going to happen that won't lead to the dissolution of the government because Netanyahu still has his right-wing coalition keeping him in power.

We're a little over nine hours in, as you can see there, into jury deliberations. Yesterday, on their first day of deliberations, the jury made two requests. First, for the judge to read back portions of testimony from witnesses Michael Cohen and David Pecker. We'll get to the significance of that in a moment. As well as portions of the 55 pages of jury instructions from the judge. The jury then presented a third note a few hours ago, also involving those instructions. And New York State jurors are not allowed to have a physical copy of the instructions given to them by the judge before they begin their deliberations. A bit of an impediment given how long and complicated they are. Joining us now, Defense Attorney Misty Marris. Misty, good to have you on here. You know, I'm reluctant to ask you to read tea leaves that this is -- these are 12 people in there making a decision in private by design. But we do get an indication as to what they're focused on based on these requests to the judge. First of all, on the portion of the jury instructions that they're asking to have read back here, can you explain to our viewers the significance as you can tell of that, or at least the focus of the jurors based on what they asked to have read back to them?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Jim. So, first of all, they wanted the juror -- certain sections of the jury instructions read back. Noquestion that 55 pages of a jury instructions, when you don't have it written in front of you, you might need to hear a little bit of a repeat. But the significance is they were really looking at the legal standards. They wanted to hear about reasonable doubt. They wanted to hear about what the prosecution has to prove. They wanted to hear about how to make evidentiary inferences. What does that really mean? So, it tells me that the jurors are very, very focused on getting the law right. They want to understand what those legal standards are, the burden of proof, and the obligations of the prosecution in this case. So, all in all, these were the types of things that are really, really central to the case and it seems like they're getting really down to the core by virtue of what they were looking for.",

      "sentences": "Now, as you said, we never really know what's in their mind, but to me, I thought this was very, very telling on a couple of different fronts.Number one, that meeting, the prosecutors said in their closing arguments, you have to look, jury, at every piece of evidence through the prism of the meeting that took place in August 2015 between Pecker, Cohen, and Trump. The prosecution's theory at this meeting, a plan is hatched, and every single thing that happens after that is in furtherance of the plan. Whether or not Donald Trump is actually right there very close to the transaction, or it's Michael Cohen, or it's somebody else, it's all in furtherance of this plan or scheme. So, that's really telling. And the other part of it, Jim, is that that's central to the predicate crime, which is conspiracy to prevent or promote an election through unlawful means. So, that really speaks to that meeting of the minds. Now, again, we also know Michael Cohen, his testimony. Obviously has credibility issues. So, the other piece of that is, the jury may be looking back and comparing consistencies or inconsistencies between Pecker and Cohen. So, all very central to the case.",

      "sentences": "Definitely, because that really relates to how the jury weighs the credibility of each individual witness. And the jury makes a determinationabout whether or not they find any witness credible. And there is an instruction that says that -- those are all the standard instructions about what to take into consideration. So, that's very relevant. There's an instruction that says, if you don't believe that somebody was telling the truth about a material fact, you can actually disregard all of their testimony. So, the jurors actually have to weigh the credibility and then they have to determine whether or not a certain aspect of the testimony they are going to say they believe it and then they actually have to put weight on that as well. So, it's really something that I think is relevant that they wanted to dig into that, especially when we have a problematic witness from a credibility perspective like Michael Cohen.",

In the 2020election, both Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and rapper Cardi B endorsed Biden, but this year both say they will not publicly endorse any candidate. Stars however, such as George Clooney and Julia Roberts are publicly supporting Biden. They will be hosting a fundraiser in fact for Mr. Biden in June. Remains to be seen if younger Hollywood stars will follow their lead. Many are hesitant in part due to the war in Gaza. Joining us now from Washington is Kayla Tausche. And I wonder how the White House is receiving this, right? Because, listen, they're on a fundraising spree right now, and Hollywood money often flows their way.",

And so, it went in this morning, bringing passengers into Port-au-Prince and on the outbound leg returning to Miami, it brought the remains of Davy and Natalie.

If you've been online lately, there's a good chance you've come across a post that's been dominating social media.The A.I. generated image, \"All Eyes on Rafah,\" you can see there, has been shared more than 46 million times on Instagram alone. It is unclear what the image exactly is, but it is stirring up emotions. Some argue posting an ambiguous graphic does not depict the sheer horror, of course, that is taking place in Gaza, while others say it can be used and as opportunity to raise awareness. So, there's lots for us to discuss here. I want to bring in our media correspondent Hadas Gold. And, Hadas, this is -- this -- I mean, this is pretty much everywhere on social media, Instagram, X, TikTok. And it's an A.I. image, like we said. Do we know at this stage where the phrase may have originated from? Who may be behind this image?",
