It's 9 am here in London, 11 am in Lebanon, where a new ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect a few hours ago.But already the Israeli military is saying soldiers opened fire in Lebanon at several vehicles to prevent them from reaching a restricted area, causing them to withdraw. The IDF did not say where the incident took place. This was the scene in central Lebanon a short time ago, highways packed as displaced residents make their way south, despite warnings from both countries that it's not safe to return just yet. Some residents near Beirut waved Hezbollah flags in celebration of the ceasefire agreement. The Lebanese capital's southern suburbs are known to be a key area of support for Hezbollah. The ceasefire is based on a 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution, and the U.S. and France will help to enforce the deal. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Christina, it certainly appears to be holding at this point. There is this incident, though, that we've been told about from the Israeli military saying that they fired towards vehicles which were driving towards a restricted area. And they said that those vehicles then turned around and went the other way.We're also hearing from the Israeli Defense Minister that potentially referring to the same incident, saying in light of Hezbollah militants entering Kila, which is an area just along the border with Israel, that the IDF has been told to act forcefully and without compromise if need be, saying that if they see Hezbollah fighters moving towards a restricted area, they should try and detain them, and if not possible, they can fire upon them. So that part is similar to what we have heard consistently from Israel, saying that if they saw or they believed that the ceasefire proposal was being violated in any way by Hezbollah, then they reserved the right to respond. Now, this is one individual incident at this point. We will wait to see whether there is any further response to it. But for the most part, what we are seeing is a ceasefire holding, and it is a 60-day ceasefire, which all those involved hope will then form the basis of a more permanent truce between the two sides. Now, we are seeing in southern Lebanon, or coming towards southern Lebanon, many cars, according to state media, and we're seeing the images, forming traffic and moving with entire families back to their homes in southern Lebanon. It's something that the Lebanese officials are saying, delay your return to these areas. The Israeli military has said that people should not move back to southern Lebanon until they are given the all- clear. And the reason for this is the IDF is not expected to leave southern Lebanon immediately under this deal. They have to leave southern Lebanon and leave Lebanese territory completely within the 60-day ceasefire. And we've heard from one senior Biden administration official that they do not want to leave too soon in case there forms some kind of vacuum. They want to make sure that the Lebanese military, who is tasked with patrolling this area, along with UNIFIL and the UN peacekeepers, are making sure that Hezbollah does not reform and rearm. They want to make sure that they are in place and they have been strengthened before they fully withdraw. Now, we're also not seeing much of a movement in northern Israel at this point. We know that tens of thousands of residents were displaced there after October 8th of last year when the Hezbollah rockets started flying. And there isn't a blanket approval in Israel of this ceasefire. It did pass the security cabinet with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, 10 to 1. But there was some criticism from the more far- right elements of his coalition. We've also heard from some mayors in towns in northern Israel that they believe it was too soon, that they are concerned that the threat from Hezbollah has not been completely eradicated. So there is certainly optimism that this ceasefire has been put in place, but it is cautious optimism on both sides of the border at this point, hoping that it can hold. Christina?",

A notable choice is Jamieson Greer, set to serve as U.S. Trade Representative. He served as Chief of Staff to the Trade Representative in Trump's first term, when the president signed on to the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and implemented high tariffs on China. And those could return when Trump is back in the White House. This week, he rattled key trading partners with a threat of punishing new tariffs, not just against China, but also against America's neighbors, Canada and Mexico. His claim that taxes on imported goods would be retaliation for illegal immigration, crime and drugs entering the U.S. Mexico's president is warning that one tariff will lead to another, risking a trade war and putting shared companies at risk.

A U.S. company buys it, pays the import tariff and then makes a choice. Eat the cost or pass it to you. Before the higher tariffs announced Monday night, Americans could expect to spend $2,600 more each year under Trump's original tariff proposal. Inflation is expected to rise by 1%.

PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY: Any airline that failed to proactively offer refunds to passengers could be in violation of federal law. MUNTEAN (voice-over): The new pressure comes as a just-released Senate report shows airlines made $12 billion over five years by charging for so-called junk fees like seat selection and carry-on bags. It's insult to injury on what's to be another travel rush for the record books. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): The airlines are relying more and more on these junk fees as a source of revenue, and they are obscuring them. Very often, you as a passenger won't know how much you're being charged until after you buy the ticket. MUNTEAN (on camera): Airlines insist that separating out fees has made tickets themselves cost less, though AAA says the average price for airfare has gone up about 3% compared to a year ago.
