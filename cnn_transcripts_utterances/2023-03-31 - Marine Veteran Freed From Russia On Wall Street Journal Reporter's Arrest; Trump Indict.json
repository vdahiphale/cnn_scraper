      "sentences": "All right. This morning, you can see here, an American reporter for The Wall Street Journal is waking up in detention in Russia on charges of espionage. Evan Gershkovich is a 31- year-old correspondent based in Moscow. He was arrested yesterday and accused of trying to steal state secrets about a Russian military factory -- accusations that we should take with a grain of salt considering where they're coming from.In a statement, the Journal said it, quote, \"...vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter.\" Russia has not arrested a reporter on charges like this since the Cold War in 1986. That's the last time that an American journalist was detained by Russia, simply for doing their job, on charges of espionage. Few people really know what Evan Gershkovich could be going through right now possibly. One of them, though, is Trevor Reed. He was released last April in a prisoner swap after he was detained in Russia for 985 days. Reed is a former Marine. He had been sentenced to nine years in prison in July 2020 for apparently and allegedly endangering the life and health of Russian police officers in an altercation. Those are charges we should note that he has steadfastly denied. I spoke to Trevor Reed last night about the arrest of Evan Gershkovich. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
