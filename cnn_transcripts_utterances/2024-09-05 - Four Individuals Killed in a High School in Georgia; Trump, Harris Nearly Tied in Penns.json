[03:10:07] If it's -- if it's a crime, then they should be charged with that and accountability should be applied. And, you know, we need to have a conversation about what level of threats we're going to take so seriously that we remove a 14 year old from school and maybe put them in a juvenile facility. Because up until the day of the shooting, it's only a threat and a lot of these threats are not taken seriously. But I think that it's a multiple-tiered solution. I think you have to have less access to those weapons. You have to have more accountability to anyone that allows access to those weapons, to children like this who are troubled. And you need to have better monitoring procedures in place at schools when a kid is identified as somebody who made a threat. What are we doing to monitor that kid and his behavior?

It's a Democratic district. It went for Biden in 2020, though Trump won it in 2016. So that's the easiest path of victory, if it actually falls together. But Kamala Harris needs backup. Every candidate needs backup. And her backup is the southern route, North Carolina. Georgia plus the southwestern route, Nevada and Arizona. A combination of those states would allow her to lose, for example, Pennsylvania. For Trump, it's very similar to the path that he won in 2016. He didn't win the popular vote, but that doesn't count. He won the electoral vote, and he won the three blue wall states in the north, that plus all the normal Republican states would be enough to put him well over 270. So we've got a real horse race.

I'm not just opposing Donald Trump. I'm voting for Harris. So did former Congressman and her colleague on the January 6th committee, Adam Kinzinger. He did the same thing at the convention. The reason this is so significant is Liz Cheney is one of the best recognized Republicans in the country. Her father was a two-term vice president under President George W. Bush. Dick Cheney is a very conservative Republican. Now, he's very anti-Trump, too. He hasn't said what he will do presidentially, but this is kind of a hint. And to Republicans who are mainstream conservatives who supported the Bushes and the Cheneys, and the other Republican nominees that came up in the 90s and the first couple of decades of the 2000s, this is a very significant move.

Speaking to the media on Wednesday, he said he is not going to change his policies to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza and claimed the Israeli military is already taking unprecedented steps to do so.
