So, the Philadelphi corridor is the strip of land between Gaza and Israel, and the peace agreement between Egypt and Israel signed in 1979 establishes this as a demilitarized zone, and that is why you have the Egyptians who have said in recent months, recent weeks, that the presence of Israeli troops along that corridor would be a violation of that peace agreement if they didn't give their permission. And there is no indication that Egypt has given its permission thus far.As you pointed out, Israel says that they are in tactical control of that border, of that strip of land. It doesn't necessarily mean that there are boots on the ground all up and down at, though, but they're certainly in control of it. And because there was a naval blockade of Gaza, and of course, the Israelis control the other two borders of Gaza, really, this strip of land is the only connection that Gaza has with the outside world beyond Egypt. And so, now that Israel is in control of it, it makes it even harder than it was to get anything or anyone in and out of there. We've already seen it with the closure of the Rafah border crossing there. Aid has been getting in through the other crossings at an absolute trickle. Of course, Israel has for years and years also complained about the tunnels that Hamas has built underneath of that corridor. They say that they discovered 20 more, some of them new, and they say that they informed the Egyptians. But, an Egyptian official speaking on state affiliated TV said that there are no tunnels, and Israel has not informed Egypt of anything. Omar.",

And this comes as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken appears to be softening his language around Kyiv of striking, excuse me, within Russian territory. Now, some NATO countries say Ukraine should be allowed to strike inside Russia. The U.S., however, has been opposed to that. But now, Blinken is hinting at a possible shift. He is expected to meet with the Czech President. He is, as you can see on your screen there, he is on the right, in about half an hour. We will be keeping an eye on that. We are also hearing that Russia is now waging a war of sexual violence in the occupied areas of Ukraine. Survivors tell CNN, the victims are often men.

      "sentences": "Well, I think to hear from him, much of what we've heard over the course of last few days, he has been speaking in Sofia. He has been elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and very consistently, speaking about the need now to take the fight for Ukraine up a notch, and essentially what he is asking allies to do, and he has been followed now by France, Germany, Poland, is to allow Kyiv to use the weapons they gifted against targets inside Russia from where attacks on Kyiv -- on Ukraine are launched. And this is something that appears to be making headway with some allies, not all. I think we'll hear a lot more about that and his reasoning behind it.Essentially, the rationale he has been laying out so far is that this is first of all, of course, a war that Russia started, and it is asking Ukraine to fight with its hands tied behind its back. And when you consider also this in the context, Omar, and I think this is important of this new front to the north of Kharkiv, the third front that was opened by Russia just a few weeks ago, the fact that so much of this damage is being done, not just on the pressure that's been brought to the frontlines, but to the civilians of the Kharkiv region from just across the border is an important reminder of the need in its defense that Ukraine be able to hit the military targets just over the border there. That's the rationale that I think we're likely to hear him lay out as he urges allies to follow his call. We have also heard from Secretary Blinken in response to that yesterday, Omar, when he was speaking in Moldova on the Moldovan leg of this trip ahead of this trip to Prague, where he said, look, there is no change of the American position for now. And of course, all eyes are very much on what the biggest donor of weapons to Ukraine will do on this issue or say on this issue. And yet, we have the Americans consistently adapted, adjusted to what's happened on the battleground, and I trust he said that we will continue to do so, a hint really that the position is certainly evolvable, that it can be negotiated and looked at. And I think that's important in terms of the message that it's sending to Vladimir Putin, which has been heard loud and clear. We've heard directly from the Russian President on Tuesday that this -- any use of Western weaponry on Russian targets, on Russian soil would constitute a serious escalation and the start of something very different from what we've seen before with a very direct threat made, without naming them, to those small and populous nations on NATO's eastern flank. So, Moscow is listening. And what we're hearing is a louder and louder recall that this now be something that be given to Kyiv, something that Kyiv, by the way, Omar, has been asking for fairly consistently over the course last couple of years, the ability to strike those Russian positions that are causing so much harm inside of Ukraine, Omar.",

      "sentences": "These charges are rigged. The whole thing is rigged.SCANNELL (voice-over): After nearly four hours of deliberations, the jury sent in their first note, asking for portions of testimony to be read back from former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, and former Trump fixer Michael Cohen, about a meeting at Trump Tower. Prosecutors say there was a 2015 meeting there between the two men and Trump, where Pecker allegedly agreed to be the eyes and ears for Trump's campaign and flag any negative stories to Cohen. There were several other meetings there that Pecker and Cohen testified about during the trial. The testimony will be read back to the jury at the start of deliberations on Thursday. The jury also had a second question before they were dismissed for the day about Judge Juan Merchan's instructions. Earlier, he explained that to find Trump guilty, they must unanimously find that he falsified business records with the intent to violate New York state election law, promoting or preventing the election of a candidate to public office by unlawful means. The jury does not need to be unanimous about what those unlawful means are. Prosecutors have put forward three theories about how Trump violated election law, a corporate donation or individual contribution exceeding $2,700, falsifying other business records such as Michael Cohen's bank records and tax law violations. As it did during his 17 hours of intense testimony and closing arguments, Michael Cohen and his credibility took center stage. Under our law, Michael Cohen is an accomplice, Judge Merchan said to the jury. Even if you find the testimony of Michael Cohen to be believable, you may not convict the defendant solely upon that testimony unless you also find it's corroborated by other evidence. Cohen, the prosecution's star witness and the only person called who could directly implicate Trump, testified he spoke to Trump twice to get his sign off just before making payments to Stormy Daniels. He said Trump approved the repayment scheme. Trump's defense painted Cohen as a liar and a thief who could not be trusted, out for revenge on his former boss. The judge left the jury to deliberate with these parting words. \"It is not my responsibility to judge the evidence here. It is yours\", Merchan said. \"You are the judges of the facts, and you are responsible for deciding whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.\" Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I want to start with one of the intricacies here that the judge has made a distinction in his instructions to the jury saying, although a felony conviction -- with a felony conviction, they have to be unanimous that he falsified records with the intent to commit, aide or conceal another crime, which in this case violation of New York election law.

You don't have to agree to the unlawful means.And let me give you an analogy that I'm frankly stealing from a dear friend of mine, who is a legal analyst. Burglary, burglary is the unlawful entry into someone's home, if you will, with the intent to commit another crime, such as theft, assault, rape, arson. So, you have to be unanimous on the burglary and you have to find that there was some unlawful purpose, but the jury doesn't have to agree on what unlawful purpose it is. So, a juror could think you're going in to burn the house down, a jerk or think you're going in to murder somebody, but they don't have to agree a unanimously. That's what's happening here.

This facility alone, when it's at full capacity and up and running within the next 12 months, will make nearly a third of that, 30,000 shells a month.LIEBERMANN (voice-over): The U.S. has committed more than $51 billion in security aid to Ukraine since the start of the war. The weapons go to Ukraine, but the vast majority of the money comes right back into the U.S. in manufacturing facilities, jobs and production. CHRISTINE WORMUTH, U.S. SECRETARY OF ARMY: I think what we've seen from the lessons learned in Ukraine is that all of us, the United States, our NATO allies, need more munitions. We need bigger stockpiles. Conflicts can be more drawn out than we thought LIEBERMANN (voice-over): And when one weapon from U.S. inventories goes to Ukraine, another newer weapon takes its place. Bradley infantry fighting vehicles sent into the thick of the fight will be replaced by the latest models of the armed and armored systems. Counter-battery radars, Ukraine has used to defend against incoming fire, will make way for newer radar systems. And ATACMS missiles that Ukraine has used to strike deep within occupied territory are to be replaced with advanced longer-range precision strike missiles.",

We're going to replace old with new. We are modernizing through the support that we're giving to the Ukrainians. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): To feed the Kremlin's war, President Vladimir Putin has placed Russia's economy on a full wartime footing, trying to outproduce the West in what is becoming a grinding war of attrition. Russia spends nearly seven percent of its GDP on defense, with plans to go even higher, far more than the U.S. or any Western nation. Even if Russian weapons are lower quality, an old military adage says that quantity has a quality of its own. When Russia burned through its own supply of artillery ammo too quickly, North Korea sent millions of rounds that made their way to the frontlines. Iranian Shahed drones have expanded on already deadly Russian arsenal and the Kremlin wants more. The U.S. effort to produce weapons at the speed of war took precious time to close the gap. For years, the U.S. relied on decades-old plans like this one in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to make artillery rounds, a World War Two-era defense industrial base that suddenly fell far short. This new artillery plant is part of a surge in weapons production that isn't done yet, with pressure on the U.S. to supply Ukraine's military, as it modernizes its own. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): It took two years from start to finish to bring us here, and now we're just in the process of building the munition stockpile that we need not only to help our allies in Europe and elsewhere, but to deter countries like China and Iran and North Korea.",

Look at that lave there. Lava flows have now cut off all but one road leading to the town of Grindavik, which remains largely evacuated after a previous eruption. But, the city's mayor now says the situation there is much better than initially feared, but those images still incredible. Iceland's famous tourist destination and geothermal hotspot, the Blue Lagoon, was evacuated on Wednesday before the volcano erupted. Incredible pictures aside, still a dangerous situation for many people in the area as that country continues to monitor.Now, here in the United States, throughout this week, we have seen plenty of tornado watches issued for many U.S. states including Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee. Three million people have been on the lookout for threatening weather conditions with damaging winds, heavy rain and very large hail. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam finds out more about the science of tornado forecasts. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DEREK VAN DAM, CNN METEOROLOGIST (voice-over): Really the precise weather conditions that spawn monster tornadoes is a topic heavily studied by forecasters. Now, that mystery is one step closer to being solved, thanks to a first-of-its-kind partnership. HANK SCHYMA (AKA PECOS HANK), STORM CHASER: So, this is a supercell that is in Oklahoma in May, and it's just beginning to start to drop its first tornado of the day. DAM (voice-over): Hank Schyma, also known as Pecos Hank, is a professional storm chaser who has documented some of the world's most intense tornadoes. He has collaborated with University of Wisconsin research scientist Dr. Leigh Orf, who utilizes one of the world's most powerful supercomputers to simulate the same twisters.",
