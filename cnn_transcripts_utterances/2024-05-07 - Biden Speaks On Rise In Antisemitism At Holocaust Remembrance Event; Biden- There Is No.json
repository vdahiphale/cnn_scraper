At one point, he said, what do you make of Stormy Daniels testimony thus far? RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORKER &amp; AUTHOR, \"CATCH AND KILL: Well, it's important to note that she really can't make or break the case in terms of the underlying charges. She doesn't have any knowledge of the cover up that happened with Michael Cohen. And the salacious details we're hearing today that prosecutors no doubt are very happy to get in. Don't really go to the core of what the case is about. Now what she can establish for prosecutors is the context of when the payments that were allegedly covered up happened. Donald Trump through Michael Cohen seem to not want to pay her initially before the election. There was a series of delays. And then finally, her lawyer, who I also interviewed for Catch and Kill actually objected and threatened that she was going to go public. And then in haste, Michael Cohen sets up this shell company and Pacer. So, getting that piece of context that this all happened in an electoral charged environment.

I doubt they'll have much prospect of success in that. Stormy Daniels is at the heart of this case. She can speak to the intent of these transactions. She can speak to the electoral timing. She is also someone, you know, who has a history of engaging in these kinds of deals, right? She signed on to this NDA initially before -- later challenging it.

And now they're going into the heart of the matter, which is much more related to these payments to Stormy, and whether they were covered up.I do think Karen's story remains at the heart of this. And the pieces of evidence about that that have been led in. Remember, the lawyer that represented both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal that has already testified in this case. So, all of those facts about Karen's role in this remain pretty salient. And in terms of the wider context, these pieces of information that are somewhat salacious about how Donald Trump behaves with women in these contexts that are being led in and that Trump's team is clearly unhappy with clearly finds prejudicial to the jury. There is a commonality there too. I mean, the prosecutors are incidentally to their main case, going out of their way to paint a picture of Donald Trump as someone who verges on the coercive in these interactions with women, you know, and their testimony just now. Stormy Daniels talked about emerging from a bathroom and being sort of shocked to find Donald Trump on the bed. You know, and not being sort of wholehearted and wanting to go all the way through with the sexual encounter, but then doing it anyway. And then it being brief and sort of unsatisfactory. These are all details that line up with Karen McDougal's account of her affair with Donald Trump. And it is salacious stuff and it's not totally relevant to the charges, and doubtless his attorneys are going to push back on that basis. But this is all character information that the jury is absorbing, and it does paint a cohesive picture.",

She still was interested in being on The Apprentice. And eventually she says that he called him and said that NBC wouldn't allow it. That was the last time she spoke to Trump when Trump called her out Jenna Jameson. Prosecutor has also gotten Daniels to say that -- to point out that many of these encounters, there were other people that hearing on speakerphone. There were other people present.

JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: You know, it is interesting by getting the testimony about the fact that Trump never seemed to want to keep it a secret back in 2007 and the years after.
