      "sentences": "Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.The moment of truth, for Donald Trump, is now just days away. Both sides have rested their cases, as a contentious new battle begins, over what the jury will hear before the case is in their hands. My lead source was in court for every moment. And we'll also speak live with Michael Cohen's attorney. And it was a moment that we could all hear for ourselves really. Hours after Trump left the door open, to restrictions on birth control, he now says he never said what he did, in fact, say. You can hear it for yourself in moments. And we have new reporting, tonight, on that terrifying scene in the skies. A passenger is dead, many more injured when extreme turbulence strikes without a warning. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump's fate will soon be in the hands of 12 New Yorkers. And with that, we will finally know whether the presumptive Republican nominee, the former President and the potential future President, will be running as a convicted criminal. Both sides in his hush money trial are now preparing for a critical moment, the closing arguments, after resting their cases. But this being the Trump trial, there's already a new battle underway. And it's one that could play a huge role, in what that verdict actually is. Judge Juan Merchan reprimanded one of Trump's attorneys today, as the prosecution and the defense argued, over what the judge is going to tell the jury, before they lock themselves in a room, and the rest of us wait for a verdict. At one point, during those arguments, this afternoon, Justice Merchan actually told Trump's attorney to sit down, and said please don't, when he kept raising one of his points. More on that with Michael Cohen's attorney in a moment. But the defense, in the meantime, has rested its case today, after calling just two witnesses in total. Neither of them was named Donald Trump, despite how he said repeatedly that he wanted to testify. If you've been following our reporting, here on THE SOURCE, you knew that was actually likely never going to happen. Though, Trump did have plenty to say, away from the witness stand, outside the courtroom. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We'll be resting pretty quickly. Resting meaning we're resting the case. I won't be resting. I don't rest. I'd like to rest sometimes, but I don't get to rest. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was widely reported on. And I was there. I witnessed it at times. So did courtroom sketch artist. And even just today, as those arguments were going on, the CNN team, in the courtroom, reported that Trump appeared to be dozing off a bit. At one point, his eyes closed, with his chin on his chest and his mouth open. We have the ultimate insiders here tonight, who I should note are wide awake.

And I don't know how the jurors felt about that. Because if he had something else that he wanted to say, they might take it as the prosecutors are not being that fair to him. I mean, the basic challenge here for prosecutors, is there -- well there are many challenges. But one is that they are telling a very neat compact story, which is just sort of clear. This is what happened. And this is why. And Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels in particular, putting Costello aside, but Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen, they have complicated motives. And so -- and David Pecker also has sort of complicated motives. And that makes it a more complicated story to tell. That having been said, there is a lot of documentary evidence. There is a lot of discussion, about matters that I am confident the former President would not want to be sitting discussing, over the course of five weeks. But what that looks like we don't know.",

And Miles, I mean, you just heard what the passenger on this plane lived through, what he was saying happened is everything, was just everywhere, during the turbulence. And the CNN animation shows, this is similar to what was experienced on that flight, before it made that emergency landing. What causes this? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Yes, it's horrifying. Isn't it, Kaitlan? I got to tell you that that really took me back, just hearing that story. What we're talking about here, most likely, is an event, where a crew flew into what is called a clear-air turbulence, which quite literally comes out of the blue. You can imagine invisible streams, rivers of air, we call them jet streams, at altitude, and the wind is hundreds of miles an hour. And it's kind of like a layer cake. They go in layers. And if you end up in a situation, where there is a sudden and dramatic change in the direction of these streams, the amount of lift on the wing changes quickly and dramatically. And that's why you get that kind of upset. And interestingly, there has been a trend, over the past 50 years, where more of these events have occurred, over longer periods of time, because of climate change. It unsettles the atmosphere, changes these jet streams in ways that are harder to predict. And perhaps, we're going to see more of these, as time goes on.

Pilot reports. And when we hear about turbulence, at a particular altitude, we get advisories, from air traffic control, and we change altitude. But somebody's got to be first. And sometimes, things happen this way. There are other kinds of turbulence that you can avoid, which are more associated with weather. Obviously, big towering cumulus clouds, associated with thunderstorms, you want to avoid those. There are weather events, just being in the wake of the big airplane, can cause turbulence. Mountain wave is another one, wind, and if it skips off a mountain. But this one insidious kind, clear-air turbulence, defies. It's invisible to the system, unfortunately.
