Craig's casting in 2006 was met with backlash, fans threatening to boycott because of his blond hair, blue eyes, and hunky looks. But the tone quickly changed after \"Casino Royale\" hit theaters and went on to play the \"Iconic Spy\" four more times.

That and more tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\" You know, I really could not wait to talk to all of you tonight. I'm between these former cops in Mississippi finally being sentenced for what they did to two innocent men, to Trump asking for absolute immunity. Well, we have got a lot to talk about, don't we? Well, tonight, Trump gave us all some more insight into why he thinks he should have absolute immunity, telling the Supreme Court in a brief that if they don't give him immunity, it would -- quote -- \"be the end of the Presidency as we know it and would irreparably damage our Republic.\" Hmm. Now, Trump talked about it just last month, saying the quiet part out loud. I don't know how quiet really is these days, but it's all about avoiding being indicted. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, one way is maybe not doing the things that might get you into what I digress details, as they say. Right?Now, Trump's legal team is arguing that future presidents could face -- quote -- \"de facto blackmail and extortion while in office\" if the justices don't buy his sweeping view of immunity. They've got a plan B, though, don't they? The ever popular delay, delay, delay tactic. Send the case back to the lower courts to see whether any partial theory of immunity might apply. And that, of course, would do what? It would delay and push a trial back for months. But that's a federal case even just in the slightest sense. And there are others, including state trials, are there not? There are parallels, obviously, between January 6th, the one happening in Washington, D.C., whenever that trial might take place, and the one in Georgia. And that one in Georgia, well, that captivated the nation, not just for the facts that have been alleged in the case and the number of co- defendants, but for the attempt to disqualify the lead prosecutors. And I'm talking about people like Fani Willis, the D.A. of Fulton County. And ever since I've been covering this case and, of course, that hearing, those dates of those hearings, I've had a lot of questions, especially since the judge decided to keep Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis on the case and tell Nathan Wade to leave. Well, tonight, I'll ask the lawyer who fought to disqualify her because she's here tonight to react to the ruling allowing her to stay on the case and what happens next. Joining me now, Ashleigh Merchant, the attorney who called for Fani Willis, the D.A. in Fulton County, to be disqualified. Ashleigh, so good to have you on the show this evening. How are you?",

A federal appeals court has just put Texas's controversial immigration law back on hold. In a brief order, a three-judge panel at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has already voted now to wipe away a previous ruling from a different panel on that circuit court that had temporarily put the law into effect. Joining me now, former Trump Homeland Security official Miles Taylor. Miles, so good to see you tonight. First of all, this has been quite the back and forth, whiplash to say the least, when it comes to this immigration law. And by the way, it's controversial because it allowed officials to arrest migrants -- and here's the keyword -- suspected of coming into the country illegally, which many looked at as a recipe for racial profiling.

So, Texas passed this law, SB4, which would have allowed Texas police to arrest people, as you noted, who are suspected of being illegal immigrants. Why is this an extraordinary precedent they were setting? Because historically, it's the U.S. federal government that enforces immigration law. Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution says that it's the federal government that can naturalize citizens, decide whether someone becomes a citizen, and as a result, the implication is that the federal government enforces immigration law. It would be very novel for a state to be enforcing federal laws. And more than just novel, as someone who used to be a chief of staff at DHS, it would be remarkably chaotic and confusing because you can imagine scenarios where the federal government and state governments would disagree on the enforcement of the law, and that could lead to flashpoints. So, this, of course, went to the courts, and then it got paused in the courts. It went up to the Supreme Court. It just got kicked back down. It got paused again. And, Laura, I would predict we are very, very likely to see this end up back in the Supreme Court, which, by the way, did not decide on the merits of the case today when they made their decision, but they're going to have to eventually because you can bet Texas is going to continue to appeal this.",

TAYLORAnd it's a dangerous precedent to start letting states compete with the federal government on enforcement of federal law. It leads to lots of problems. And down on the ground, again, that could lead to flashpoints between immigration officers that work for the Department of Homeland Security and people who work for Texas law enforcement. Now, if this were to have gone into effect right away, if this pause hadn't happened tonight, I'm sure Secretary Ali Mayorkas, who runs DHS, would have acted like a professional and tried to find a way to work with Texas law enforcement so this didn't get chaotic. But there's no guarantee of that. I'm sure the courts are open to those arguments. The Biden Justice Department has really pointed out that this is not a partisan thing, but that there really is a problem with chain of authority here if you've got that competition between the federal and the state government. But, Laura, this does expose the fact that, again, our immigration system is very broken, and Congress's refusal to take an action has created this circumstance where Texas is now trying to do the federal government's job, and you've got complete uncertainty in the U.S. justice system.",

But in the meantime, Peter Navarro's amateur hunt resulted in him pointing the finger at a bunch of people who were innocent and had not been criticizing the president. And so, he has a history of, again, going off the reservation, doing things that are going to get him in trouble. Of course, in this case, he refused to testify and answer to a subpoena in front of the January 6th Select Committee. The courts determined that, you know, he had no recourse there. He went through all of his due process. He refused to comply with that subpoena. And Congress has that authority to call people up as witnesses in these cases. And so, he's going to prison because of it. I think it sends a message, Laura, to other people in Trump's orbit that they are not above the law, that the law is the law, and regardless of their politics, they will be held accountable. Now, he made a defiant speech in front of the court. I think that probably fell on deaf ears.

And those officers called themselves the \"Goon Squad,\" of all things. It happened in January of 2023 just outside of Jackson, Mississippi. It started after one of the officers, white neighbors, said that several Black men were staying at a white woman's home. The officers then showed up at the house. They knocked the door down. And what happened next was nearly two hours of pure horror. Jenkins and Parker say they were handcuffed, they were kicked, they were waterboarded, they were tased, they were called racial slurs. They had milk, alcohol, chocolate poured on their faces. Officers attempted to sexually assault them. The torture culminating when one of the officers actually shoved a gun in Jenkins's mouth as part of a mock execution and ended up firing. The bullet lacerated his tongue and broke his jaw.

My mind goes back to a month before this happened.And Hunter Elward was with Christian Dedmon, and they abused another person named Alan Schmidt to the extreme. They say Elward was there and allowed Christian Dedmon to pull his pants down and put his private parts in the face of another victim that Elward had to plead guilty to crimes against also. And then -- so it wasn't just this incident. Elward has a career of abuse. My personal opinion is that Hunter Elward was sorry because he got caught, and if he hadn't got caught, he would be abusing and killing today. But I understand totally the trauma that Mr. Parker has been through. He has to be able to release, I understand that, but I believe that Hunter Elward, he's glad he's off of the streets, he's very dangerous, and I'm happy that justice has come to him.

It's not something subject to interpretation as far as someone repeating it over and over again. It's a provably false statement. He was not found liable for rape on that verdict form.Now, where it gets a little different, particularly in a public figure case, is whether George Stephanopoulos, when he makes these statements, is making them acknowledge that falsity, or are we in this world of a contextual semantic issue where most states don't really have a rape law? Most states called sexual assault or sexual battery. There are states that still call it rape, including New York. And in that respect, do we really have provable falsity or is it substantially true? Because if you're listening to that in Florida, we don't have a rape statute. When you say rape, it means sexual battery or sexual assault. And you do have a finding in that verdict form of sexual abuse, I think, or sexual assault. And so, when you say, is it defamation? Well, George Stephanopoulos certainly knows the verdict form does not say liable for rape. There's a clear no check there. I mean, you can't get around the fact that that's objective. But what I would assume they're going to defend with is saying to a regular common man listening to that, a common person listening to that, what does the word \"rape\" mean, and did he say it with that kind of context or did he mean as a term of art, as it would have read on the jury forms?

The verdict form says he wasn't found liable for rape. You're repeating this over and over. I mean, he would not let go of the terminology.But the question is, as he's saying that, is he meaning rape as a term of art under New York statutes or is he referring to the other part of the verdict where there was a finding of sexual abuse or assault? And, you know, I think that in a public figure case, that could be a fairly interesting issue. It has been used before. That defense, they would call it a substantially true defense. Right? I think Judge Kaplan actually addressed that at some point with respect to whether that difference in verbiage meant anything substantively. Right?
