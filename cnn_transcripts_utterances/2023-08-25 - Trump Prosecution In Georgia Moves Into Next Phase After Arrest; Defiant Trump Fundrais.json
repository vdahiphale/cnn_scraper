      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, in this case, like the other cases against Donald Trump, it is all about timing. He's running for president, there are four criminal cases that he is dead set on going to trial in, including this one in Georgia, and he's taking the same approach here as he has in the other cases, essentially spelling out that he doesn't want anything to happen quickly.Now, we're going to have to see how the judge is going to handle it for Trump himself, but as of right now, the district attorney has been quite clear she wants to start turning over evidence to all of these defendants in about three weeks starting September 15th. And she wants the trial to start here in Georgia for 19 defendants or however many the judge is willing to put on the calendar at that time, October 23rd. Right now, there are two defendants that seem to be in that ballpark, Ken Chesebro and Sidney Powell, both lawyers that were working around Donald Trump after the election, at a very high level with the campaign. And so, that piece of the puzzle could be moving a little bit separately from what Donald Trump wants. There could be defendants that want different things. There're also splits that occur with defendants in a lot of other ways. There are several defendants right now who want to try to move part of this case or at least their charges into federal court because of their role as federal officials. And then there is one defendant who is still in jail, a defendant named Harrison Floyd. And he is in jail because he turned himself in before the deadline here in Georgia this week without having a preset bond agreement. A judge took a look at his situation today and did think that because of some past charges he's still facing in another jurisdiction, there is the possibility that he could be a risk if he was released. And so it appears that Mr. Floyd is going to be spending the next few days, the weekend in jail.",

But, ironically, the speedy trial motion may cause more delay in the case, because, as Katelyn was talking about, it splits the interest of the defendants and you may start seeing more movement to severe it and all of that starts to eat up time.",

But I think he really realizes is that X is the bigger platform with much greater reach and he's using it for a purpose. He's raising money. We know that the money he's raising is not really going towards his campaign funds. Strictly, it is a legal defense fund. And so, to me, this just indicates that Donald Trump realizes that he needs support in order to pay for these lawyers, Steve Sadow and others, and he feels like X is the platform to reach as many people as possible.",

On Monday there is going to be, that judge, Tanya Chutkan, talking to both of the parties, talking about a trial date, a schedule.But, Wolf, also, nothing happens in a vacuum. And that federal case, we can't lose sight of it because as that hearing in Washington, D.C. is before Judge Chutkan, there will also be a hearing here in Georgia, in a federal court, where witnesses that are very likely to be part of the federal case, too, will be testifying about Mark Meadows, about that crucial call that Donald Trump made after the election to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in Georgia.

It is a very public show of support for an outspoken figure in Yevgeny Prigozhin, who, remember, staged an important (ph) uprising against the Kremlin and who has now been dramatically silenced.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (voice over):  Shocked, if not surprised, supporters of Russia's Wagner mercenary leader have been paying their respects, laying flowers and lighting candles at makeshift memorials across the country. For all his violent and foul-mouthed outbursts, often critical of Russia's military leadership, Yevgeny Prigozhin struck a chord, especially with people like Daria (ph) here in St. Petersburg, who told me how strong and interesting she found his personality. He always stood up for his fighters, she said, in the special military operation, what Russia calls the conflict in Ukraine. Are you sad that he is gone? I'm sad they were so vile to him, she answers. It was a bitterness many Russians now share. This photograph here, I think, probably one of the last ones of Prigozhin. And it says in Russian, in this hell, he was the best, speaking about him in the past tense. Some people have laid patches, Wagner mercenary group patches from the side of their uniforms, because a lot of the people that are paying their respects here today are either members of Wagner, or their families of members of Wagner. The organization is known for its cruelty, and this hammer here, it is very heavy, I'll pick it up, it has Wagner written on it, look, it is become a potent symbol of the just how ruthless Wagner was because it was with a tool like this that they executed someone they regarded as a traitor and they filmed it happen, absolutely gruesome. But that video consolidated Wagner's image as a ruthless, hyper violent organization that would do anything to protect the motherland. Even staged that dramatic uprising in June, marching troops towards Moscow in the biggest challenge to Kremlin authority for decades, many Russians suspect Prigozhin's presumed death in this plane crash was cold hearted revenge. But the Kremlin denies involvement. And few Russians there dare say otherwise, at least publicly. Some of my closest friend are Wagner, said this man, who asked us to hide his identity at the memorial. They're just Russian people, he tells me, who thought they were doing the right thing. But they can't talk for Prigozhin, he adds. Who do you think is responsible for his death? Who killed him? No comment. These are dangerous times in Russia to throw allegations around. (END VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (on camera):  Well, Wolf, tonight, there have been more denials of Kremlin involvement, this time from neighboring Belarus, a close Russian ally. Of course, the leader there saying that I can't imagine that Putin is to blame for the deadly plane crash that killed ten people. It was too rough and unprofessional for Putin, he said.",

And, of course, as we also know, they've opened up a legal defense fund for several of these lower-tier lower aides who needed legal help that Trump was paying for. So, that's where the real concern is, are they going to run out of money for these legal funds.",

That is what Representative Pressley is saying, that you have to be true to yourself, that you have to be uplifting of your community and you cannot act like the ills that affect black and brown people don't affect you. And for him to call her all types of names is just beneath the dignity of this type of civil discourse. Race is a very, very difficult issue for this country to grapple with. Ramaswamy in that comment showed that he's unable or unwilling or simply doesn't have the intellect necessary to tackle that issue of race by those comments that he made.",

That is what Ramaswamy was talking about, this idea that being black or being Hispanic mandates that you be a liberal or a progressive.Remember the Democratic Party, you hear Republicans all over country and races all over the country talking about this. And, by the way, there's some polling and evidence to indicate out there that is a little bit movement in Hispanic communities and African-American communities towards the Republican Party right now.

But it also says that if you have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution, and thereafter, give aid or comfort to the enemies of that Constitution, then you are disqualified, period. So, all of the charges against the president which, at the moment, don't happen to include insurrection, are really beside the point.This is not a punishment. It's a disqualification, just like the disqualification of someone who has run for president in the past twice and become president twice, or someone who doesn't meet the age limit, or someone who is not a natural born citizen. It's not a punishment, it's a disqualification. It operates automatically. Secretaries of state may have to set up their own way of determining whether this president gave aid or comfort to the enemies of the constitution, but when he said, he was going to pardon the ones who breached the Capitol and who had confederate flags in there, and caused mayhem, and even death, it sure sounds like giving aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution, and when he said that he would terminate the Constitution, it's hard to do that and say that you are an ally of the Constitution. So, this is going to have to be determined by the secretaries of state. In the first instance, they may file declaratory judgment suits. They may set up their own fact-finding procedures. But whatever they do and whichever way they go, they're going to be challenged, either by Trump, if they conclude he's disqualified, or by Trump's competitors or, possibly voters, if they conclude he's qualified. In either way, it's likely to get to the Supreme Court",
