      "sentences": "A good Friday morning to you. It is Christmas Eve eve. I'm Jim Sciutto.Let's begin with the massive winter storm slamming the U.S. with dangerously low temperatures, record-breaking wind chills and heavy snow, only becoming stronger today. The storm stretching from the Canadian border to the Mexican border is expected to become what's known as a bomb cyclone as it moves into the Great Lakes today with intense pressures matching that of a category two hurricane. Right now across the country, hundreds of thousands are without power. Travel plans upended for many going into the holiday weekend. More than 3,100 flights canceled already today. Dozens of governors creating emergency response plans heading into this holiday weekend, including opening temporary warming shelters just to get people out of the cold. I'm going to speak with one of those governors, Kentucky's Andy Beshear, in just a moment. First, let's get to our team covering what's being called a once in a generation storm. We begin in upstate New York where a blizzard warning is now in effect for the Buffalo area. The city and neighboring communities forecasted to see feet of snow, major wind gusts approaching 70 miles per hour. CNN's Polo Sandoval braving the cold there. Tell us what it's like.",

      "sentences": "You know, Jim, those pictures tell you everything you need to know. I've stood in many hurricanes, many tropical storms where the wind gusts of about 50 miles an hour and rising. We're slowly getting to at least tropical storm force winds here in Buffalo.Four hours ago, I was standing here in a fleece, zero rain, zero wind. It just speaks to how fast the conditions have been deteriorating here in western New York. The intersection that you see behind me, if you actually follow this street, it will take you to the lakefront here, close to downtown Buffalo. And that's where a big part of the concern is right now. This isn't going to necessarily be a snow event, this is going to be a wind, a flooding, a freezing event. And that's why authorities here on the ground have been warning people to simply stay put. We're actually sheltered here where we are in downtown Buffalo. But the concern is that many people will choose to brave some of these whiteout conditions and that will make, perhaps, some of those roadside rescues extremely difficult. And for those that are living in some of those lakefront communities, the warning there has been for people to evacuate if they can because once these complete whiteout conditions really do take over, Jim, then the concern is that they will not be able to be rescued out there. With these winds, as you're about to hear, and I'll have the control room repeat what they just said in my ear -- as these winds begin to kick up, then the concern is also about downed power lines. And that will mean power outages. So, authorities here in Buffalo -- this is just the first act of what will be a very long 30 hours, are hoping that people have everything they need, and it will stay where they are, especially as we approach Christmas Eve. The authorities hoping that folks will resist the urge to get out here. Back to you.",

We aren't really seeing folks on the streets.You know, you and I, Jim, have been doing this little weather back and forth for three days in a row now and the swiftness with which this arctic blast came barreling through Colorado is just remarkable. We went from something like a high of 50 degrees on Wednesday when we spoke to negative 24 Thursday morning. A 75 degree temperature swing that's been impacting travel, quality of life and just creating so much misery and chaos here in Colorado with flights canceled and people struggling to stay warm. Now, the temperatures have basically remained below zero for nearly 36 consecutive hours since that mercury dropped. It has not gotten back up. We are expecting things to turn around later today. But, of course, the city, the state trying to keep people safe. You know, you and I were talking in front of the Denver Coliseum, which was converted into a 24-hour warming center to give folks a safe place to overnight. There was so much demand for warm beds, Jim, that the city had to open up two more emergency centers just to meet the demand. And we're talking about anyone who needs to get out of the cold, whether it's families, homeless people or that influx of migrants that Denver has seen. Much of the metro area hunkering down, but we do expect things to slowly get back to normal. In fact, we could be seeing temperatures of around 50 degrees by Christmas, which is great news for us, not so much for the eastern part of the country.

And it's going to stay in the, you know, negatives with windchill for the next couple of days.The second piece is the roads continue to be treacherous. It's not as much of the flash freezing, which we were able to avoid with significant preparation, but we have just enough snow to where gusts of 40 to 50 miles an hour can create blizzard-like conditions very quickly. We have one major interstate, I-71, backed up right now. We have the National Guard, the state police, every resource we can get there assisting, checking on those that are in their cars. Whether they're Kentuckians or not, we want to make sure that you are safe. Right now we're taking a number of steps. First, we're under a state of emergency. So we pre-deployed National Guard all across the state. We have Fish and Wildlife, and Kentucky State Police pre-staged. The only good thing about this arctic front is we knew it was coming. So, we've been preparing with our transportation cabinet for about a week. But people need to stay home. People need to stay off the roads. If your travel plans change, listen, your family wants you home for Christmas, but they want you alive a lot more. Just be safe.",

You know, there's no need to get out. We haven't seen that many accidents or anything like that so far. They did do a fairly good job of deicing this road. You know, they did salt it earlier.

As you noted, the committee has this bold conclusion and then lays out the evidence to support it. That conclusion is that the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, who many others followed. They conclude that none of the events of January 6th would have happened without him.And it's interesting because the report takes a few steps back. They're not just focused on the violence on January 6th. They look at everything that happened from even before the election up to January 6th. And they conclude that there were efforts by the former president and his allies spread out across the country to try to overturn the election. Let's take a look at what they said about the effort to influence state officials. They say that Trump, in an effort to overturn the results in key states, he and his inner circle engaged in at least 200 attempts to pressure state officials. And it also says that Trump was the one spearheading this outreach and that they were mostly focused on states where he lost or where they had a GOP-led legislature. Of course those are states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona. They also say that the former president's decision to declare victory, even though he lost, that was premeditated.",

But they really undercut that here. In fact, they show, when it comes to John Eastman, his election attorney, who authored that memo, that strategy about how Pence could try to block the counting of electoral votes, the showed on the day that memo was written, Eastman reached out to the White House. He told a Trump aide that he wanted to confer with the president about, quote, our strategy. And the evidence they've gathered showed that he spoke with someone at the White House for 23 minutes.
