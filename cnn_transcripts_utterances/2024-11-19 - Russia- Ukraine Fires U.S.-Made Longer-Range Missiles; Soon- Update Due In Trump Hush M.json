The Russians claim that all five of these missiles were shot down. However, that parts of the missiles hit a military object, as that report said. Now, so far, there's been no confirmation of any of this coming from the Ukrainians or from the American side. So right now, it is only the Russians saying that. At the same time, of course, the other big breaking news story here in Russia is the fact that Vladimir Putin has now signed off on an update of Russia's military doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons. Now, all of this essentially makes it easier for Russians to conduct first use of these types of weapons. The Russians are now saying that if Russia is attacked by a non-nuclear country, like for instance Ukraine, using long-distance weapons, like the ones that the Russians claim have now been used, and that if it is aided by a nuclear nation, like, for instance, the United States, that then that could trigger a nuclear response from the Russians. The Russian spokesman for the Kremlin has come out and said that the Russians want any sort of adversaries to understand that a response from the Russians would be coming if there would be an aggression. It's unclear whether or not this will really change the game or change things on the ground. However, right now, it certainly seems as though the Russians are saying that if the Ukrainians fire missiles deep into Russian territory, that this could also pit the United States and NATO and Russia against one another.

Now, the defendants, they organized an unofficial primary election back in 2020 to prepare candidates to compete in elections for the city legislature. And that is essentially their crime, their plot that they were convicted of. This has all but killed off the once vibrant pro-democracy movement that thrived in the city until a crackdown that began four to five years ago with the imposition of a controversial national security law, part of a broader crackdown that has killed off independent newspapers in the city, and the protests and demonstrations that were once tolerated and, in fact, allowed to participate in the streets of the city. Outside the courtroom on Tuesday, a single woman tried to hold up a protest sign and carried away by police to a police van. That is symbolic of how dramatic the shift in political culture has been over the last four to five years. Critics of the crackdown and of this sentencing include human rights groups as well as the U.S. consulate here, which has condemned the sentencing and added the statement, quote, we call in China and the Hong Kong authorities to seize politically motivated prosecutions of Hong Kong citizens and to immediately release all political prisoners. The Hong Kong government and the Chinese national government have rejected this kind of criticism, arguing that this is meddling in Hong Kong's internal affairs. They contest that this court case has helped bring back stability to Hong Kong which went through nearly a year of anti-government protests in 2019 that had grown increasingly violent.

With a lot of these posts, particularly the ones as they relate to the economy, to trade, including,you know, the Treasury secretary, but also the commerce secretary, Donald Trump has really been looking for big names, big CEOs, people who are well known in the business world, who have the right credentials for the roles, but are also compatible with him. And also, when we think about compatibility, we know that Donald Trump really means loyalty. Now, what's interesting about him selecting Howard Lutnick for the role is a couple things. One, Howard Lutnick is currently in charge of Donald Trump's transition process. Both him and Linda McMahon, a former secretary of Donald Trump, have been kind of co-chairing the transition process. Lutnick handling the personnel side, McMahon handling the policy side. Now, you're right in the fact that Howard Lutnick had actually been pushing for the role of Treasury secretary, and he was very much in the running, one of the leading names that Donald Trump had been considering, along with another Wall Street person, a hedge fund manager, Scott Bessent. Those are really the two names, as of, like, last week, essentially, that Donald Trump was thinking that he was going to name one of them to the role. However, a lot of infighting and contentious, you know, things playing out behind the scenes has really contributed to Donald Trump rethinking that role. I know that many people in Donald Trump's orbit, those who are working on this transition process, many of them have been frustrated with how Lutnick had been -- has been handling it. They've argued that he has a really big ego, that he's been leaking to the press, that he's not operating in kind of the disciplined manner that really they had run their entire 2024 campaign as. And so there were some problems behind the scenes with him. And now we're seeing that he kind of was passed over for the role of Treasury secretary and now is going to be commerce secretary. Now the other interesting thing, and I know I'm getting into some of the palace intrigue here, but it is important as we think through how Donald Trump is really looking at these different appointments. Linda McMahon, the co-chair I was mentioning, who serves alongside Howard Lutnick for the transition, she was also really gunning for that commerce secretary role. I heard there's been some frustration now that it ended up going to Lutnick. All to say, there is a lot of uneasiness really within the transition team with a lot of these people who are, you know, really vying for the same roles. But I think one thing to keep in mind here is that we still don't now have a Treasury secretary. We do not know who Donald Trump is slated to pick. However, what we do know is that he has scheduled a series of meetings this week with other people that he is potentially considering for that role. Many again are big business names, people who Donald Trump believes will be loyal to him, but will also be kind of accepted with open arms from the business community.",

We're also hearing and we've also reported that the Republicans on the Ethics Committee are trying to bury this report through a number of ways. They're arguing that the report isn't finished. They're trying to delay the meetings with their Democrats on the committee. So, while we're expecting this meeting with the committee to happen tomorrow, the sources say there's a chance that Republicans try and delay it again. And this is -- and we also have House Speaker Mike Johnson, who continues to say publicly that this report should not see the light of day. And this is all coming as Republicans on the Senate are growing increasingly worried about Gaetz' chances of being confirmed and are making increased calls for this ethics report to be released. In fact, the incoming Senate Judiciary Chair, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, said, if this ethics report got released, it would make Gaetz' confirmation process move more quickly. So you have Senate Republicans who are increasingly calling for this report to be released, while you have House Republicans and Gaetz and Trump himself trying to push Gaetz as quickly as possible through this process. Of course, you also have Democrats who are swirling around all of this trying to get this report out. In fact, just moments ago, over nearly 100 House Democrats sent a letter to the House Ethics Committee calling in them to immediately release this ethics report.

This map shows some of the cities that have been levelled by Russia's grinding war of attrition. And before and after images show just how destructive Russian President Vladimir Putin's campaign has been. Mariupol, a coastal city on the Azov Sea, was one of the first objectives for Russian forces looking to establish a land bridge between the occupied regions of the Donbas and the Crimean Peninsula, annexed in 2014. After a nearly three-month siege, the city and its sprawling Azovstal steelworks fell to the Russians. Since its capture, the Russian government has pride to showcase its partial reconstruction. Ukrainian officials believe that more than 20,000 civilians died during the siege. In May last year, Russian forces claimed control of the eastern city of Bakhmut after more than 200 days of fighting. Once celebrated for its sparkling wine stored in a massive underground complex and its salt export, Bakhmut became synonymous with the horrific number of lives the Russians were willing to expend to capture this symbolic prize. The fighting has also turned smaller cities into abandoned ghost towns, such as Mar'inka and Vovchans'k. Putin justified the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by saying he intended to protect the largely Russian-speaking population in the country's east. But in effect, his so-called special military operation has nearly erased many of these cities from the map. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So the idea that this is somehow an escalation, it's really a way delayed response. But I do think all allies will come around and do the same thing.

A temporary one that Donald Trump can claim as victory, a win. He said, I will end the war. And if the fighting stops, he can claim that is what it means. I think there is the possibility that he can convince both Kyiv and Moscow to take a pause. I don't see a real negotiation. I don't see Ukraine accepting giving up territory, not being able to decide its own alliances. And, frankly, I don't see Vladimir Putin particularly interested in that as well. So I think the focus for Trump will be, in the initial months, on finding a way to end the fighting, at least temporarily, rather than finding a way towards peace, which is beyond his capability and, frankly, anyone else's.",

We're still waiting for exactly what the judge solidifies here, what the judge decides to do. But it is a big step in favor of what Donald Trump wants here for the prosecutors to take this position. They say that they don't want the proceedings of a sentencing to be happening until after the end of defendants' upcoming presidential term, so about four years. And they also give a little bit of explanation that they say that they believe this case still exists, that it's based on unofficial conduct for things that Donald Trump did that he doesn't have immunity for, that they want the court to continue to look at other issues Donald Trump is raising to challenge this case. The sort of thing that you get to do after a conviction by a jury appeals, filing dismissals based on what was presented at the trial. They want that to move forward. They just are saying, fine, he doesn't need to be sentenced. And the additional reason they give is that the prosecutors in Manhattan say they deeply respect the office of the president, are mindful of demands and obligations of the presidency. And acknowledge that Trump's inauguration will raise unprecedented legal questions, but they're trying to balance that with the jury's verdict and the constitutional system of justice that is set up across the country and in New York. Remember, this is the remaining case where Trump has something on the calendar moving forward, and obviously it's the only one out of four sets of charges in federal court, in state courts, where he has been convicted of crimes. And so that sentencing -- big question mark. The prosecutors say it shouldn't happen soon, but it should happen someday.",

Look, ultimately,this is up to Judge Merchan to decide whether or not he's going to side with them and continue to delay the sentencing in this case. But, you know, what strikes me as odd is that in most, if not all, criminal prosecutions, you cannot appeal your conviction until after you've been sentenced. Now, you don't have to serve your sentence while you're taking an appeal, but you need to be sentenced so that your conviction is final. So here the prosecution is saying, we don't mind you getting the pause button for four years until after the defendant has completed his service as president. But we want to elect the other motions and appeals take place and see what happens here. They're trying to avoid having to be the hard party here, who's now looking to sentence someone who's going to be installed as a president in January. And I understand that. But they're not really giving Judge Merchan that much leeway because you can't finalize the appeal until the sentence has been imposed. So I see what they're doing. They're also probably waiting to see what Jack Smith has to say in the two federal cases, what his final closeout report is, what his justification is on the federal side for abandoning his prosecutions. There, they have Department of Justice policy that says you can't take a criminal case forward against a sitting president, and those cases aren't going anywhere until after Trump becomes the next president. So I think they're sort of trying to play all of their cards and not trying to be the person who's going to come across as the ones who are attacking someone who's coming in to be a president.",

And in this case, prosecution has said nothing that was done was an official act. He can use those facts and deny their motion to dismiss and then move to sentencing. So I expected him to rule on the pending motion for dismissal, move to sentencing, sentence the former president as a defendant. And then hold the sentence in abeyance and say, you don't have to serve anything. Not that he was going to oppose jail time, but if he did, you don't have to serve any jail time. Probation, you don't have to serve any probation. No fines, no penalties, nothing. But now this case is closed and it can work its way through the New York State Court of Appeals. And then you can try and take it up to the federal system and then up to the U.S. Supreme Court to get a ruling there. That's what I expected to happen.
