They saying that the prime minister spent hot hours in the Sea of Galilee yesterday, which was actually under a -- currently under a heat advisory.We are going through a heatwave right now in this region. They say that today, the prime minister complained of mild dizziness, and on the recommendation of his personal doctor arrived at the Sheba Medical Center emergency room. Sheba Medical Center is located in a suburb of Tel Aviv. And see, the initial tests came out normal and no findings were found. The initial assessment they say is dehydration. That he is continuing to undergo additional routine tests. We know that in the last few hours, he was brought to the emergency room, is really media reporting that he was fully conscious. He walked in on his own volition. And the first day, we received from the Prime Minister's Office simply said he was brought to the emergency room and that he was undergoing medical evaluation, but that he was in good condition. Now, it has been very hot here. The prime minister, he is a 73-year- old man, and this is actually not the first time he's been brought to hospital out of concerns for his health, within the past year or so. Actually, in October of last year, during the Yom Kippur holiday. This is the Jewish holiday when observant Jews fast during the day. He felt unwell while at synagogue and was also brought to the emergency room where he was kept for overnight tests. So, as far as we understand he is still in pretty good condition. We have no information though yet on when and how and whether he will be released. What we know so far is that they are saying that it is most likely dehydration, and all of his initial tests are showing that there seems to be nothing of concern, just as of yet, Fred.",

They also say that everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert. Also, the National Weather Service office here in Las Vegas is taking a close look at the climbing temperatures because there is a possibility the city's official all-time record of 117 degrees could be tied sometime this weekend or Monday.

He is this, you know, we're prepared in this country, we are on course, in this country to repeat the mistake in 2016, where we have both parties re -- nominate the two most unpopular major candidates possible, so unpopular, they have a chance of losing to each other. And I think that's sort of a disaster.There are real concerns among Democrats who, you know, you go to CNN green rooms, and you'll talk to prominent Democrats who will share them freely away from the cameras. But this is good news for Joe Biden, it's better to be able to raise a lot of money. And remember, he doesn't have to spend a lot of money in the primaries, you know, against like Robert F. Kennedy. So he's building up a big war chest for the general election. And that's nothing but good for him. But I just don't know that money alone is going to solve his problems with lack of enthusiasm among base Democrat voters. Democrats under 30 don't want him to run again. I mean, this has been a consistent thing in the polls for a while. And I'm not sure that spending a lot on T.V. ads, which don't reach those constituencies anyway is going to change that.",

But also that Wagner as we've known it in Ukraine, is no longer in existence.I want to read you part of what he told the Kommersant newspaper in Russia, this is a quote, we do not have a law for private military organizations. It simply does not exist, the group exists, but legally, it does not exist. So that is rather confusing. Fredricka, he also detailed a fascinating meeting that was held five days after this mutiny at the Kremlin on June 29th, in which 35 Wagner commanders were invited to sit with Putin. And Putin said you can keep fighting we'd like you to keep fighting. In fact, you can do so under your current commander, a guy whose nickname is Sedoy, it means gray hair. He's a respected, retired colonel. And according to Putin, these commanders nodded in affirmation, saying, essentially saying that they would like to. But then Prigozhin spoke up and said, no, the guys do not agree. So open defiance by Prigozhin there of Putin. It's not clear what happened after that meeting. But it certainly does look, Fred, like Vladimir Putin is trying to drive a wedge between Prigozhin and his men. Fredricka?",

We can see the maps, we can see where they're making progress, some progress has been made on the Eastern Front. We were down to the southern front today. And the soldiers there tell us that they have also made progress there. But it is extremely slow going. We heard from a presidential adviser Andrii Yermak, who said that it is hard work, he said it's not going that fast, it is slow. That's exactly the same thing that we're told by the general who's in charge of the section of the southern front, where we are, and it's what the men are saying as well.Their morale is still high. They still believe that they can punch through that Russian line, and that this offensive will be successful. But the Russians have had months to prepare for this Ukrainian counter offensive, which was telegraphed well, before it was officially launched. And so they had time to lay mile upon mile of mines throughout the southern front. And so it's extremely tough going. Even though these Ukrainian fighters have new weapons from the west, new armored vehicles from the west, new training from the United States, it is very, very tough to cross those minefields. And as they try to cross, they're coming under ferocious Russian fire. So some very modest success, but it's extremely slow going it's a really tough fight, Fred.",
