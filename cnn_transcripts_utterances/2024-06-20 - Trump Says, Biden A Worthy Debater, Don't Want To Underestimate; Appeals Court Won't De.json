Great expectations or not so great expectations. Tonight, new sound from Donald Trump shows that the care that he's putting into a soft landing. Should Joe Biden put him on the canvas at next week's CNN presidential debate? Trump thinks that he will do well and that Biden is in cognitive decline. There's no evidence for that, of course, but Trump also says that Biden is a worthy debater. Just listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: All I can say is this. I watched him with Paul Ryan and he destroyed Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan with the water, he was chugging water at a left and right. I didn't think a human being would be able to drink so much water at one time, and he beat Paul Ryan. So, I'm not underestimating him. I'm not underestimating him. It is what it is. We'll see what happens. I assume he's going to be somebody that will be a worthy debater. Yes, I would say so.

Donald Trump will appear on screen left, and he will also go last, delivering the second closing arguments to voters.Joining me now is Philippe Reines. He is a former spokesperson for Hillary Clinton. He also played Donald Trump in her debate prep. Also with us, Bryan Lanza, former Deputy Communications Director for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Trump is taking this seriously. He's preparing. He's getting briefings. He's in debate prep and it sounds like he's trying to lower expectations. BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN: Listen, I think the challenge he has is really hard to lower expectations with sort of seeing the video of Joe Biden for the last three and a half years. You know, that's what everybody has. It feels like a little bar. I think the challenge that Biden has and the bar that Biden has to meet is defending his economic record. I think if Trump focuses and puts his target on there, it's a hard bar to defend.

This is someone who is breaking the law, who has been found guilty of felonies, who says that nearly a thousand people who were found guilty of insurrection and other related crimes on January 6th should go free and that his trials are bogus, you've got someone there who's basically saying, I don't believe justice and law applies to me.

But I would say this, one of the results of the trial that took place is Joe Biden had a financial advantage, a fundraising advantage before the trial. After the trial, the financial advantage is wiped out.So, it's positive and negative for Trump. You remember the Democrats are talking about how if Trump was found guilty, he's going to lose 20 percent of the Republican vote. This is going to be our election. He's now -- Emerson poll just came out today that shows him winning, you know, seven swing states. So, I think the dream scenario that we predicted that would take place, at least the Democrats were ready to take place, is not happening. And the fundraising, the money is coming in, and that's a good thing. REINES: I'm going to end on a bipartisan agreement with Bryan by saying Joe Biden has an absolute advantage by not being found guilty of 34 felonies and therefore not have to spend a hundred million dollars of his country contributors money to defend himself. That is why he has more money. He has more support among small donors. And if you remember in 2020, Donald Trump had a very, very high burn rate at the time. It took a lot of money for him to raise money from small donors. Now, in this case, luckily, as we saw tonight, he has several very large donors, which both campaigns do.

He still has this war room podcast going.And let's not forget, he was the one who was ratcheting things up right before January 6th. And you and I both know, because we covered the White House together, Bannon was a very important strategist to Donald Trump when he was president of the United States. I mean, I wrote about this in my book, came out five years ago. This is how long we've been dealing with all this, that Bannon and Trump sat together and came up with the idea of using the term enemy of the people to go after the press. And so Trump and Bannon have been sort of partners in crime in this sort of intimidation game that's been going on for six or seven years. If you're in the press, if you're an opponent, perceived enemy of the president, former president, they're going to come after you and they know the stakes in all of this, Abby. We know this all too well. Back in 2018, there was a pipe bomber named Cesar Sayoc sending pipe bombs to CNN and other folks that the president at that time was targeting out in the press.

You're giving me a scenario that can't be specifically addressed without knowing more of the details. I can only speak to the details regarding this specific bill that we enacted that I am knowledgeable and educated about on this subject. This is the bill. This is the bill that the state of Louisiana wanted and we enacted with a resounding positive yes. PHILLIP",
