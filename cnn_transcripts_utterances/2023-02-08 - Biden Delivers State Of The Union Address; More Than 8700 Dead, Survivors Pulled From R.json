In the last few minutes there's been a big jump in the death toll in Turkey and Syria as rescue crews race against the clock and a desperate search for earthquake survivors.Plus, we are following international reaction to U.S. President Joe Biden's contentious State of the Union address. We begin this hour with the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria that has claimed more than 8700 lives. Time is running out. The rescue crews trying to reach anyone who may still be alive buried under the rubble of collapsed buildings. And freezing temperatures in the region and making things all the more difficult. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is opening up hotels in a tourist hub of Antalya for people whose homes have been destroyed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, PRESIDENT OF TURKEY (through translator): We declare the 10 cities that are affected by the earthquake as disaster areas by the authority given to us by Article 119 of the constitution. We declare a state of emergency in the 10 cities that will last for three months in order to ensure that search and rescue operations and other work are done rapidly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joe Biden's annual State of the Union address focused on his major accomplishments during the first half of his presidency, which many Democrats say are underappreciated. He passed large historic pieces of legislation that could have transformational effects on the U.S. economy.But recent polls show that's not registering with many Americans. During his speech, the President repeatedly pushed for a boosting of the middle class, who he called the country's backbone and bipartisanship. And this was President Biden's first big address since Republicans took control of the House. And at times he faced open hostility. CNN's Phil Mattingly explains.",

And, of course, the geopolitical implications here? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITORPresident Biden has spoken in the past about, you know, we're giving them the weapons that we think that they need right now. Obviously, Ukraine thinks they need more. And it's generally been proven right over time. But there's sort of leadership position that President Biden talks about, if he had not spoken the way he did about uniting NATO partners. I think that would have caused concern but of course, that language was there. And I think another interesting part of his language, which looks beyond the conflict in Ukraine towards the potential of conflict. Although he said, we were he wants competition, not confrontation, not conflict with China. But he talked about how the United States was building bridges between Atlantic partners and Pacific partners. And if we look at the recent trip of the U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Japan, to South Korea, this sort of sense of building a stronger coalition of partners there and shoring up support for increased military bases has been part of United States growing focus on competition with China in that region. But we've also seen this growing support coming from countries like Japan for Ukraine. So, I think the speech got to some -- got to some of that, but what to expect going forward. I think the United States, President Biden and his allies know that this really can be potentially a very long-drawn-out fight and actually the next few months will be very critical.",

But this is a significant anniversary, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the military. Any anniversary with a zero or a five at the end is generally celebrated in style in Pyongyang.And what we've seen is that commercial satellite imagery has been looked at very carefully by international experts. And they believe that there have been practices with thousands of people involved in Kim Il-sung Square over recent months, so suggesting that it could be a significant parade. Now, it is important to watch these parades closely not just for what Kim Jong-un may say, if he gives a speech, and what he may show what he has already achieved. But many weapons experts will be looking for clues, any indications of what he could be looking to achieve in the future. We know he's in the midst of this five-year military plan. He's two years into that. So certainly, the arsenal and the weaponry and the missiles on display will be scrutinized by experts around the world. Now, it is a very military-heavy time at this point. We saw from state-run media Wednesday, that he had with his wife and his daughter, believed to be his daughter, Ju-ae, had gone to a military barracks to rally the troops, and who also said that he wanted to see the strengthening of the military. And that, again, came just a day after he met with military leaders, and said that he wanted to push forward with war readiness, also specifying he wanted to see more operational training, more military drills from his military.
