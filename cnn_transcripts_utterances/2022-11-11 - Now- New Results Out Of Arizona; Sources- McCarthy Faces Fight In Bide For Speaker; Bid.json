He is at a comfortable lead. We'll leave that to you to decide at home, 109,311, fifty-two if you round up to 46. He has held that lead, steady lead now since yesterday, and in the small batches we've gotten so far, he has done just fine in terms of what is the percentage he needs to hold that lead versus what Blake Masters needs to catch up. The Governor's race Wolf, very important Governor's race in a key battleground State is much closer, 20,453 vote lead for Katie Hobbs, 51 if you were to round that up to 50 percent for Kari Lake, the Republican there. It is an open seat here because the Republican Governor, the current Republican Governor can't run for reelection. So, the Democrat leading, but much more narrowly than the Senate candidate.",

      "sentences": "Let me slide this down a little bit. I won't lose it, but let me just put it down a little bit since we have the Governor's race up. Let me bring this down.This is just Pima County. Okay, this is just Pima County. I'll go to statewide in a minute. But this is a Democratic county. It is second largest county in the State  that is South of Maricopa County. So this is Tucson and the suburbs around it, then some rural areas and cities. So these numbers, these new numbers, you see them right here 6,644. They're not included in this math right here. So the raw numbers are obviously significant. That's how you get who has the most votes at the end, but this percentage is very significant in the sense that if you are the trailing candidate, you need to make up ground and the way to make up ground is to get a higher percentage every time votes come in than the last votes come in. So Katie Hobbs was getting 60 percent of the vote in Pima County, well, she's getting more than 60 percent of the vote now, because she just got 67 percent in this fact. So when these numbers are factored into those numbers, her percentage in the county is going to go up. If you're the candidate in the lead, that's gold. But if your Kari Lake in this Democratic county, you're at 40 percent, let's round that up. You've got 44 percent here. So your percentage might go up a bit in the county, but she's going to keep going up, right. In raw numbers and the percentage, she needs -- so think of it this way, Katie Hobbs is in the lead in this county. She is getting a higher percentage here. So, the building block, county by county 15 of them in Arizona, she is doing well. Let's switch over to the Senate race here. Let me move this up to the top and move it, try to keep it from disappearing in case I need it again. Here we go right here. So Mark Kelly, was getting 62 percent in Pima County. In this new batch, 15,000 votes, a little shy of that, 69 percent. So he is not only doing what he needs to do to keep his lead, he is doing better than what he needs to do to keep his lead. Blake Masters 4,593, thirty-one percent, that's less than he had, that's a smaller percentage. So this particular batch, it doesn't guarantee that it continues, it doesn't mean in the next one, he won't do very well. But as you go through these outstanding votes, still a lot of votes to count, she just told us. But every batch that comes in means the universe of possibilities shrinks, and this is not enough for Blake Masters. It's just simply not enough. It's actually you know, he is going in the wrong direction in that particular batch.",

And again, if you're at 52, you round that up, versus 46, you just need to stay up -- if Mark Kelly stays above 50 percent in the rest of the votes that come in, he wins, right? He wins.And so, this is again, the biggest bunch is still in Maricopa County, but the second largest batch is where we were just talking to Constance in Pima County. And so, where the most votes are outstanding and being counted, Mark Kelly just again, not only met his bar, but dramatically significantly exceeded his bar. So now let's look at the Governor's race from a statewide perspective. And again, this one is much closer. This one is much closer. So two things about that. Number one, Katie Hobbs more than met the bar she needed at the moment. Number two, that's good. But this one is so close that one vote batch don't -- in a vote batch like this, we have more ways to go. This one is closer. So this is more significant in the sense that Katie has such a big lead. I'm not saying you know if you're Katie Hobbs, you want to win every different report. Every time votes are reported, you want to come out on top or if you're in a red county, you want to be as close as possible. But this one is still closer. So we need more votes. We need more to get to the finish line here because she has a smaller lead. But again --",

This says 505,000. But we just got nearly 4,000. We're roughly around 501,000 now outstanding votes in Arizona and what we've done after we did that interview that you guys just did on the air with the Tucson -- with the Pima County elections official, we recalculated the numbers based on what she was telling us will be uploaded to the system. And look here now. Blake Masters, I mean, this number just keeps climbing for the Republican Senate candidate. He now needs 59 to 61 percent of the outstanding vote, the 505,000 that is still outstanding. Mark Kelly needs 37 to 39 percent of the vote that is outstanding. So you just -- when you look at the vote totals come in, you can see and by the way, the last votes that they just told you about in Coconino County, 70 percent went to Mark Kelly, so that is not going to help Masters. His numbers need to go up, so you see the dramatic uphill climb Masters has to overtake Kelly, but as John said, the biggest bucket is Maricopa, that's what we have to wait to see -- Wolf.",

We are expecting it any time now for about 4000 votes to be released, tabulated and then there is an additional 3,000 votes still to come.Meanwhile, we are now in one of the biggest counties, the biggest county in the State of Nevada, this is Clark County and the mail-in voting here is been very generous to the Democrats. And what I want to tell you is there are still lots of votes inside this building. There are 23,000 more votes, they are expected to be tabulated tomorrow. In addition to that, there is another 15,000 votes that are provisional ballots that have to be cured that have to be tabulated by next week. That's the deadline. So there's the potential for more than 38,000 votes to still come out of this building. In addition to that, under Nevada law, votes can come in until Saturday.

Let's take a closer look right now at some of the tightest House races that are still playing out across the country that potentially could tip the scales. In Colorado first, controversial Republican incumbent Lauren Boebert is holding on to a narrow lead over Democrat, Adam Frisch. Let's take a look at the numbers in Colorado right now. Her lead is only 1,122 over Adam Frisch right now, 50.2 percent to 49.8 percent. That's with the 99 percent of the estimated vote now in. Very, very close over there. In California's newly redrawn 13th District, look at this, the Republican John Duarte has a very slim advantage over Democrat, Adam Gray. Let's take a look closer at the numbers. You can see with 44 percent of the estimated vote now in, Duarte has 50.2 percent to Adam Gray's 49.8 percent. He is ahead by only 267 votes. Also in California right now. Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter is in a real squeaker with Republican Scott Bob. Look at this Porter, 50.8 percent to Scott Baugh's 49.2 percent. She has a lead right now of 2,970 votes, it's still close, 63 percent of the vote is their estimated is now in. In Arizona take a look at the race between Democrat Jevin Hodge and Republican incumbent David Schweikert. Let's take a look at those numbers. Hodge has 50.8 percent. He's the Democrat. Schweikert as 49.2 percent, Hodge's lead is 4,577. So, right now, he is slightly ahead in that critically important contest as well.

But I think people are probably wondering, why would the incumbent Governor Sisolak concede right now when we are still counting votes?
