I mean, in a way, you know, it wasn't the blockbuster that some people I think hope they might find but that's only because we've kind of already known and suspected what was going on. What we're seeing is the sort of censorship machine working and we're seeing that, you know, that a political campaign had a direct channel to Twitter to get them to suppress information that they didn't want folks to see right before a presidential election. And everybody who's concerned about free speech and Democracy in America should be very, very worried about that.I think what Representative Khanna said was exactly right, this is a, you know, a threat to free speech principles. You know, even if it wasn't a direct constitutional violation, the Biden team was not yet in power at that time. But of course, one of the, you know, really important things about this is the Biden team learned from this experience, and when they were in power, they kept doing the very same thing. They had their back chat on Twitter, they would communicate with Twitter about specific individuals like Mr. Berenson, the reporter, and about particular viewpoints and facts and information they did not want people to see online. And they were doing this with both Twitter and Facebook. This is, you know, really the most profound and systematic free speech violation of our time. Constitution does not allow governmental actors to encourage, promote or induce private parties to do what the government can't do itself. That's --",

RUBENFELDYou know, 50 years ago, 60, 70 years ago, there was a Senator Joseph McCarthy and other members of Congress got Hollywood, the Hollywood studios to blacklist people who were suspected of being leftist, not let them work, not let them produce, you know, films, we call that the blacklist. And we thought, you know, I thought we had learned our lesson of that. Those are private parties, but the government was trying to get them to censor. It did it.

      "sentences": "On Friday at the urging of President Biden, the DNC's rules and bylaws committee voted to tear up the traditional presidential primary calendar for 2024. Instead of kicking off with the Iowa caucus, as has been the case since 1972, the plan puts South Carolina first on February 3 to be followed by New Hampshire and Nevada, then Georgia, then Michigan. The idea is to test candidates earlier in crucial swing states instead of letting the momentum be decided by Iowa, whose voters are 90 percent white.In his letter proposing the framework, the President emphasized racial and geographic diversity. He said, \"For decades, black voters in particular had been the backbone of the Democratic Party but have been pushed to the back of the early primary process. It's time to stop taking these voters for granted.\" But South Carolina, of course, was also the key to securing President Biden's 2020 nomination, whereas he plays poorly in Iowa and New Hampshire. So is this helping the country, the party, the President? Joining me now to discuss, CNN Senior Political Commentator, David Axelrod, who of course, was Senior Advisor to President Obama. David, so nice to see you. Who will do the vetting?",

      "sentences": "Good to see you, Michael.Well, that's the issue. I mean, first of all, look, I think, in the main the idea of having a more diverse offering of states at the beginning of the process is a wise thing to do. I think the idea of geographic and demographic diversity is a good thing. And it was clear that Iowa was going to get the boot after 2020, not simply because they were unkind to Joe Biden, but because they didn't handle it well and they botched the caucuses, and we didn't know who won for a week, and that was problematical. So, that that was going to happen. But there was a huge push to make diversity -- to value diversity more at the beginning of the process, and I think that this does that. But as you know, Michael, because you're a student of this, Iowa, New Hampshire, they played unique roles, particularly Iowa in this process. And that candidates had to go and make very personal intimate appeals to small groups of voters over a long period of time, Barack Obama spent 87 days in Iowa in 2007. And had there not been in Iowa, I don't think there would have been a President Obama. Ironic, of course, because he was the first African American president. So I will miss that part of the process. I will miss the vetting that the voters do in that state. And I'm not sure given the nature of the calendar here and the fact that we'll start with a primary not caucus, I'm not sure that we're going to get the same effect here.",

I think that -- again, I'm no expert, but it seems to me it's not an issue of shelter. Or how about if I say it this way? It's not an issue of shelter alone. Do these folks need to be housed? Absolutely. And cared for? Certainly. But have you had any level of intersection? I mean, I have in Philly, in New York, in Washington, in the Tenderloin in San Fran and in skid row. It is so heartbreaking, the mental illness is pervasive and so is the drug addiction. So we need a better -- my two cents, we need a better descriptor. These are folks in crisis.

So, it seemed to me she had probably a better message to give than the one she eventually gave to Bashir.Really, the outcome could have been very different. The interview brought to an end what tenuous links there were still with the royal establishment. And apart from forcing my resignation also deprived Diana of some other messages of support.
