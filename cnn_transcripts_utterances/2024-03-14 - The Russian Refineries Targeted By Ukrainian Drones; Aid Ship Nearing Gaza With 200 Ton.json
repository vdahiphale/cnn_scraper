I mean, they're going around literally with ballot boxes, to people's houses, in some places, urging them to vote and getting the vote right there.

That seems to indicate both of these statements that Henry plans remain engaged with Haitian politics, which could complicate efforts to replace them.Henry has not been able to return to Haiti since gangs rose up and forced them to remain in Puerto Rico. It's simply too dangerous flights to come in and out of the country. And much of Haiti is on lockdown now, as the gangs have taken the streets. The challenge now for the U.S. State Department is getting these different groups, different political groups and civil groups within Haiti to decide who's going to be part of this Transition Council that will then pick a prime minister. There is a lot of infighting going on, although the State Department continues to maintain the process is moving forward. And then there will be a Transition Council that will help navigate Haiti's political impasse. For the moment at least, Kenyan troops that were supposed to come in and restore security and peace in Haiti are on hold. They're waiting, according to that country's president to see what happens with the political situation. The Kenyan President spoke with Secretary of State Antony Blinken by phone and assured him that the Kenyan troops will head to Haiti, about 1,000 of them just as soon as there is a new government in Haiti, and the political situation stabilizes there. But in the meantime, with no clear replacement government for Henry, and no sense of when those Kenyan troops will arrive, the gangs in Haiti continue to have the upper hand.

But of course, there is this narrative being pushed out by both stay media and some users that these platforms are banned, because they refuse to comply with Chinese laws and regulations to put their servers -- put their data as in China based servers. But of course, that's only partially true because a lot of those bans predated such laws and regulations. But a lot of people did, correctly pointed out that TikTok has been trying to in a way address and resolve some of the concerns raised by U.S. officials and politicians by for example, spending more than a billion dollars on so called Project Texas by agreeing to store us origin data. In Texas or in U.S. based servers operated by oracle at one point TikTok seemed to be even ready to sell a stake to American companies like Walmart and Oracle. But of course, all of that none of that has satisfied the U.S. government because of the concerns you have just heard, but also, because of the rising geopolitical tensions between the two countries and the Chinese really haven't helped themselves under the strongman leader, Xi Jinping, because of that whole strategy of reasserting the party's absolute control over every aspect of society. You have heard some of that, including the increasingly sweeping national security legislature being passed here, such as that counter espionage law passed last year that would give the security apparatus here, very broad power to review and inspect any data from any company operating here. And the other thing, of course, is at the end of the John, this, it really goes beyond this one app. And it's very secretive, but it's extremely effective algorithms, because it's really about the control of technologies between these two superpowers.
