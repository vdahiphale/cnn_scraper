You cannot get unauthorized access to voting machines in the state level. So that information was turned over a long time ago. So for us, certainly it's been interesting that it's taken this long to come back to them. I guess in defense of all their work there, I would say that there's just a lot of people, right?

The plan will forgive more than $39 billion in federal student loans. This comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Biden's plan to forgive up to $20,000 in student loan debts for tens of millions of borrowers. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for us at the White House. Jeremy, what's the Biden administration saying about this new loan forgiveness plan, which is obviously less than he promised to voters?",

This affects borrowers who have been income driven repayment plans where after 20 or 25 years, they are supposed to see the rest of their student debt forgiven. And so that -- those are the 804,000 borrowers who are going to see their debt wiped out altogether.Effectively, what this is doing is fixing mistakes that have occurred over several decades and providing loan forgiveness to people who have already earned it. Effectively, this is $39 billion worth of federal student loan aid altogether. But as you mentioned, Jake, this comes just after the Supreme Court last month struck down the President's broader plan to forgive student loan debt up to $20,000 per borrower for people under a certain income threshold. So this move today is not aimed at addressing that. The President is still moving forward with another plan to try and forgive much broader swaths of student loan debt. That process has already begun through the regulatory system, but that is going to take months, Jake, if not a year, for that to actually come to fruition. So in the meantime, President Biden says that he is committed to pursuing that alternative path for broader student loan forgiveness. And, Jake, he's also going after Republicans who are criticizing even today's decision on this. He says that this is hypocrisy based on the fact that they supported loan forgiveness during the Coronavirus pandemic for businesses. And he also says that their quote, disregard for working and middle class families is outrageous. Jake?",

I think the Republicans were wrong for not supporting it, but they made that decision. It does happen.I'm less concerned about the process than I am about the policy. The bill that the Republicans passed makes it more difficult for women to serve, makes it more difficult for the trans community to serve, makes it more difficult for people of color to serve. The policy that they were willing to vote for undermines our national security, and we should be focused on how bad that policy is. And that's why I and most Democrats voted against this bill. So that's the big problem. Process is the process they got the votes for it, so good for them.

Now, just because it's hot doesn't mean you get an advisory. You have to be a threshold above something, the normal 10, 15, 20 degrees. In parts of California will be 20 degrees above normal this week because of the heat dome. Now, this heat dome makes it hot, yes, but it does something else, Jake. It also makes the chance of getting a shower throughout the afternoon lower and lower because the heat is all the way to the top of the atmosphere. On a normal day, you start seeing these little convective things on the ground and you'll get a cloud about 3:00 or 4 o'clock, and you'll cool down a little bit. That's not happening because the atmosphere won't allow it. It's too hot up here to even get a cloud. So temperatures right now, 107 in Dallas. That's what it feels like. There certainly should be a shower around Dallas somewhere with that type of heat. It's not happening. Not going to happen for the rest of the week here. And also, we've had a thousand record highs over the past 40 days. And just over the weekend, we are likely going to see another 100 record highs, especially across the Southwest.
