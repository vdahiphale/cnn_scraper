The medication has been widely available for women across the nation for more than two decades.

Not only did it go through rigorous FDA approval 23 years ago but it's been used for 23 years in the United States by millions of women and has a very good safety profile. In fact, if you're really, really worried about deadly side effects of a drug, because that can happen with any drug, then you should take penicillin off the market, deadlier than this drug. You should take Viagra off the market, deadlier than this drug. So, this is a very safe drug.Right now, in the United States, at least 53 percent of abortions -- more than 53 percent of abortions are done with this drug and another drug in combination. Now, let's take a look at what this means. When we take a look at the United States, if you see the states in red, abortion is banned. They can't use these pills now anyhow, so this decision doesn't really affect them in the same way. But the yellow states where it's allowed with restrictions and the green states where it's allowed, it's going to really affect them. I was speaking with an attorney who represents several different abortion clinics. And she said, listen, I'm telling my clients starting Saturday, if nothing changes, starting Saturday, you cannot use these pills.

When a pharmaceutical company applies, they spend months and months going over -- sometimes years, going over the data consulting with external experts. They're all scientists. And the fact that one judge can just overturn it is unprecedented and really pretty scary.I want to take a look -- I want to read to you a part from one of the legal briefs that was filed by the government in this case, I think it's worth really spelling it out. In this brief, the government says, if longstanding FDA drug approvals were so easily enjoined, in other words, were so easily reversed even decades after being issued, pharmaceutical companies would be unable to confidently rely on FDA approval decisions to develop the pharmaceutical drug infrastructure that Americans depend on to treat a variety of health conditions. In other words, pharmaceutical companies might say, you know what, we don't want to invest millions of dollars in R&amp;D for a drug if just one guy or one gal, one judge can say, I don't like this drug, let's take it off the market.",

Thank you.Also this morning, the Department of Justice has now launched an investigation into the leak of Pentagon documents that were posted online. U.S. officials have confirmed that some of the documents are authentic. The leak poses a serious risk to relationships with U.S. allies and military options in Ukraine, but there is also a concern from Ukraine that the documents may have been altered or maybe part of a misinformation campaign. For perspective on this, joining us now is retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. I mean, this is astounding, because what these documents show, one, as The New York Times put it, that the U.S. has basically penetrated every Russian security apparatus, has great insight into it. But as David Sanger writes in The New York Times today, you know, this is a disclosure because it's fallout in real-time, because some of these documents already been 40 days old. So, you can actually see what they know right now about what's happening in Ukraine. MAJ. MIKE LYONS (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  Yes, that's right. I'm having a hard time getting my head around this. I mean, if there's 50 classified documents, there's 50 separate stories that are going to impact on the ground in Ukraine right now. The fact that they gave away their air defense platforms and where those locations were, the fact troop movements, they're talking about artillery rounds. We all know that Ukraine is running out of artillery. So, this level of breach is significant in the fact that we've kind of asleep at the switch, we've had indications that was going on the past few months. We've got to do a better job monitoring these sites, these Discord sites that have this kind of information out there. It came from the highest levels of our government, the Joint Staff. These documents, they were they were removed, obviously, from a briefing. There were there were pictures of these presentations. So, again, the damage assessment I still think is going on and it's very significant. And now all these holes are likely getting closed up.

They're being attended by a very controversial figure, Ben-Gvir, a very far right- wing minister here. He has been convicted in the past of terrorism, of inciting hate against Arabs. He is an extremely controversial figure that again visited the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex, known as Temple Mount to Jews, earlier this year. He has been a figure that has been this leading voice for this extremist, for this right-wing movement. Again, he's going to be part of the settlement protest at the West Bank where, again, there was these two funerals held where we just have this incident taking place, all of this again feeding, fueling fears and concerns and the worry that this just continues to mount this escalating violence, Poppy.",

Rule 49 says that the vice mayor at the next council meeting after there's a vacancy in an elected position announces the vacancy, we will do that tonight. And then we're supposed to wait four weeks.Typically, this happens because someone neither changes office, or someone passes away and clearly waiting for nominations come in. In this case, I think the council pretty clear about who we want to put in that position. It's Justin Jones. And if we get objections to suspending the rules, then we're back on rule 49 and we'll have to wait four weeks. If that happens, then we'll see if there's something else that we can do.
