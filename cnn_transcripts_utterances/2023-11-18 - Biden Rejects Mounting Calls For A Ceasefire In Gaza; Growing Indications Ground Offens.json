      "sentences": "Paula, this op-ed covers a few things related to both the Israel conflict as well as Ukraine. To start, the president does reject those calls for a ceasefire. Those have been mounting both domestically and abroad, and he writes, quote, \"As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire is not peace. To Hamas' members, every ceasefire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters, and restart the killing by attacking innocents again.\"Now this is in line with the administration's position, which is that there shouldn't be a ceasefire. Instead, they have been advocating for pauses in the fighting to get those hostages released that are held by Hamas, as well as to get aid into Gaza. But this op-ed also covers other key points. That includes calling for Israel to respect humanitarian law and protect innocent civilians. It also goes on to issue a warning saying that the U.S. is prepared to issue visa bans to extremists who are attacking civilians in the West Bank. This has been a key area of concern for the Biden administration. It also goes on to stress a two-state solution. President Biden spoke to that earlier this week, an idea that he has long endorsed. Again, mentioning it as the solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict. And of course, the president mentioning that his administration is still working feverishly for those hostages to be released by Hamas. But overall, in addition to talking about Israel, the president's message here is that the conflicts abroad, in Israel and Ukraine, do affect U.S. national security. He's reminding Americans of that in this op-ed. It's something that he did in a primetime address in October when his administration asked for billions of dollars in supplemental funding. Congress has not provided that funding as of yet. It continues to be a push by this administration. The president taking to an op-ed to remind Americans why all of that is necessary in this key moment -- Paula.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so far, the IDF has not been able to substantiate it and the government's claims that there is a complex bunker system beneath the Al-Shifa Hospital. So far they've shown a tunnel entrance and they say it's their intention and they will, they say, continue to investigate it further. It may take days, may take weeks, but they say that they will show the full extent of the tunnel network underneath the Shifa hospital that they say is there. But we haven't seen it yet.And so the proof of what the IDF said having arrived at the hospital three days ago isn't there. The spokesman for the IDF, Rear Admiral Hagari, this evening said that the IDF had helped hospital officials evacuate patients from the hospital. That's not what the doctors at the hospital are saying. They're saying that this was in essence a forced evacuation. The IDF is saying that the doctors asked them for the evacuation. We've heard from the Hamas-led government's health minister saying that all the hospitals in Gaza now are completely out of service and not working, and in reference to the Al-Shifa Hospital, he said that people were dying there for a lack of medicines. That the people had infections and the doctors quite simply don't have the equipment to treat them. And they say that there are many casualties there who quite simply cannot be evacuated for medical reasons. Their conditions are just too precarious. So even what's happening in and around the Shifa hospital is very, very hard for CNN to verify. The phone lines into Gaza are intermittent at best and most of the time cut. We don't have independent access there ourselves on a regular basis where we can have independent access to see what's happening there. So again verifying what's happening in Al-Shifa Hospital is difficult, and also across all of Gaza right now. It's incredibly difficult. And I think it's worth noting that, although the Shifa hospital is an epicenter for some of the fighting, there's plenty of it going on in other parts of Gaza. The northern part we're hearing behind us, heavy machine gunfire right now. Jets dropping a bomb before. There's been plenty of tank fire going in there as well. So very much a lot of Gaza is a very, very active combat zone right now.",

So far, those negotiations have yet to actually reach a deal for their freedom. But tonight, the pressure is being brought to bear on the Israeli government.

There's very much the sense from what I've been talking to people in the government about that Hamas is dictating the terms, and as long as Hamas is dictating the terms, they will see it as a victory and that's why the Israelis believe that they need to step up the military pressure on Hamas so that Israel will dictate the terms of any hostage release.",

Now, Israeli officials say that would complicate their tracking efforts.Do you think at this point, everything has to be on the table in order to get these hostages out? BASKIN: I think that Israel needs to do everything possible to bring as many hostages out as quickly as possible. In particular, the women, the children, the infants, the elderly, the sick and the wounded. And Israel needs to make compromises to do so including a ceasefire, including holding off the completion of the war until as many hostages can be brought out as possible. It's an inhuman situation to imagine what these hostages are going through. We've already seen hostages who have been killed after they were taken into Gaza. Just the other night, Hamas released another video of an elderly man who apparently died while being a hostage, and I'm afraid that we're going to see more of this the longer we wait.

My family home is still occupied by RSF forces. But I think, on the other hand, perhaps what it gives you as a journalist is a very necessary reminder that the choices we make around the ways we interview people, the protections we put in place, especially for those of us in investigations, it comes home very quickly to you. We were all very aware, the team were wonderful. The questions we were asking, the stories we were uncovering would have ramifications for people I loved very closely. And my uncle actually was able to come out and see us and he was in the documentary. But he could only come out to see me because the previous investigations we had done. If I had gone to him, I would have endangered him. I'm really grateful they were still willing to speak with us and to take those risks. Because I think everybody cares so much about getting this story out to the world. And it will be wonderful to have a whole hour dedicated to Sudan tomorrow night -- Paula?",
