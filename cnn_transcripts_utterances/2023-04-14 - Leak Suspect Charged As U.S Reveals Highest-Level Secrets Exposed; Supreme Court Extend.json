I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Tonight, we're getting a fuller picture of the suspected Pentagon leaker and the crimes he's accused of committing after his first court appearance in Boston. CNN National Correspondent Jason Carroll is on the story for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  Jack Teixeira's family leaving federal court in Boston this afternoon, refusing to answer any questions. The 21-year-old Massachusetts Air National Guardsman made his first appearance in front of a federal judge today, he's now charged with unauthorized retention and transmission of national defense information and unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents and/or material. An unsealed affidavit shows that Teixeira was granted top secret security clearance back in 2021. He had high level access to the nation's most guarded intelligence and other highly classified programs. The affidavit alleges he began posting classified documents starting in 2022, and then recently, on April 6th, used a government computer to search a database using the word, leak, once it was publicly revealed that someone was leaking classified documents.",

Investigators ultimately narrowed in on the chat group. According to a U.S. government source familiar with the case, Teixeira was under surveillance for at least a couple of days prior to his arrest. While, President Biden played down the security damage on Thursday, today released a statement saying, in part, I've directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information, and our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies.

They are certainly looking into, trying to get a much better assessment of what has been released out there. The major concern, Wolf, is to what's called sources and methods, who gathers this kind of intelligence, how it's gathered. There are clear references to humans or human intelligence in these documents. And so if you're an adversary reading these documents, you might look at this and say, who are the people who are around these areas, who are around these subjects who could become targets, there are certainly people who are named in these documents who could be targeted by adversaries. And then, Wolf, there are multiple references to signals intelligence, and that's how a lot of this information was gathered, and that is specifically eavesdropping or electronic communications that have been intercepted. What these documents show is that Russia's Ministry of Defense and Russian intelligence agencies have been significantly penetrated by U.S. intelligence agencies. They also show that allies, like Massad and the United Nations, are being spied on. So, all of those people could also change the ways in which they communicate, which could affect intelligence collection, Wolf.",

The big thing here is that the Pentagon really will need to find out exactly how he did this, whether it was through administrative I.T. privileges, since his job involved basically being an I.T. administrator and kind of the help desk guy, walking around, from what we can tell. It's also pretty clear that what they'll need to do is do a damage assessment, a complete assessment as to exactly not only how he was able to do this, but how he was able to exfiltrate this kind of information from this facility that he worked at in order to actually take those photographs in his home, as is alleged in the complaint.",
