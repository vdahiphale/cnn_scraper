It's wonderful to have you with us. This is the day, we think, that Donald Trump's legal team has been preparing for, the day they could get to cross-examine Michael Cohen and try to convince a jury that he simply cannot be believed. Trump's former lawyer and fixer returns to the stand this morning after testifying on Monday about payments that were made to kill potentially damaging stories about Trump, all he says at the direction of his former boss, in the final critical days before the 2016 election. His testimony designed to show just how close he was to Trump; involved in talks about the hush money at every turn. The juror has got to hear this conversation between Cohen and Trump about payments made to \"Playboy\" playmate -- playmate Karen McDougal. It was a conversation that Cohen secretly recorded.

Just get past the election. Because if I win, it has no relevance. I will be president.

How long do you think I'll be on the market for? Not long.\" Trump did not seem to like any of this at all.

And what you saw yesterday was so far the most direct evidence of that in the form of those conversations. And that recorded conversation between Cohen and Trump. Now, to be clear, it was the prosecution's evidence. It was friendly questioning back and forth. He has not been cross-examined about it yet. It's purely his memory of a conversation. And you are certainly not going to hear testimony from the other person who was there, because Donald Trump will not, quite frankly, should not testify.

So what we saw yesterday was this controlled demolition of really this one key chunk of the bridge wreckage that was sitting on the bow of the ship, weighing it down, preventing those crews from towing the ship away. As they broke up all that steel, you can see there's still some debris out there. There's concrete across the bow. Some of that they may have to come in and clear out with cranes. Some of the concrete they'll probably leave on for now. And the hope is within the next 48 hours, they're going to bring some tugboats over, and they're going to tow away the Dali ship and finally clear it now, seven weeks later. And again, as officials have said now for weeks, they want to have the entire channel reopened by the end of May. It's still a fluid timeline, but they say they're still on track.",
