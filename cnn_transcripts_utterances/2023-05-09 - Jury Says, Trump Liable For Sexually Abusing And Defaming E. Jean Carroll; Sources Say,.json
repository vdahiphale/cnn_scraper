Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room in the 1990s and subsequently defamed her. Carroll alleged Trump sexually assaulted her in the Bergdorf Goodman in the spring of 1996 and later defamed her when he denied her claims. The jury found his conduct was sexual abuse, sufficient to hold him liable for her civil battery claim, even though the jury found she did not prove his assault met the rape threshold. E.

Carroll's attorneys relied on that in their closing arguments. They said it was essentially a confession. So, he's going to argue that that should not have been allowed to come in.

And in this moment in court, it's a different ball game, right? It's one thing to just toss this stuff out on Truth Social or Twitter or whatever, it's another thing to say these things in court and to say these things in the public and have that scrutinized in court with evidence.

Certainly with the civil case, I think you see a hint of what might happen, were he to be found guilty in a criminal case, like Alvin Bragg's case, which is he'll deny he's liable. He's say the trial was fixed, and that's going to be his continuing strategy, just to move forward into the political realm and just ignore these things.

And what he was saying in his reports to the federal government about his campaign and the money he had, some questions that have arisen in the past about that, that we do believe would be part of an investigation are about him helping two very rich people who were donors to him as a Republican candidate transferred the sale of a yacht, a super yacht. We also know that he had reported a very sizeable loan to his campaign, almost a million dollars, $700,000 or so. And there was a big question of where would he get that sort of money. And so we don't know what these are yet. We do expect him to present himself in federal court to face charges as soon as Wednesday, and we do know that these would be out of New York.

McCarthy has doubled, tripled down on where he stands on all of this.No movement from him at all, he maintains that the president has got to negotiate the spending cuts with him in order to get this deal done. And, interestingly, Wolf, again, he was asked directly if, like Biden and McConnell and Schumer, he would agree that the U.S. will not default. He would not directly answer that question. Instead, kind of skirted around it, which was very interesting and telling.",
