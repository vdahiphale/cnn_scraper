Police say 57 people were arrested following requests from both schools to help disperse what they call illegal encampments.

But there was also asupport from many members of the faculty as you just shared with our viewers. And that was also something that was driving much of this movement on campus. But the difference, though, I think that when you look at what we were able to observe firsthand on Columbia University versus what happened in previous decades was that this was certainly not be Vietnam. This was certainly not the South African apartheid. This was a very divided -- divisive issue on campus. So it was creating basically division among students and some of that infighting. And because of that, I think that we did not see that united front that we perhaps saw in previous student movements. Again, some that actually proved to be successful. And on the other hand, also, the university, there was certainly a lot of pressure for the university to come to the negotiating table. And to their credit, they did. They negotiated with two of the negotiators that represented the members of the Columbia encampment. But by last weekend, that's when they reached that stalemate. And I think there is certainly a learning moment here when you look at the way other universities are handling this, for example, in neighboring New Jersey, there's Rutgers University. They announced that they reached an agreement with students that had participated in an encampment. One of the student -- the university, I should say, did confirm that they were able to reach an agreement, a resolution, and as part of that agreement, they said that they agreed to help at least 10 displaced Palestinian students helping them complete their studies at Rutgers University. They would revisit their relationship with a institution of higher learning on the West Bank. And that they would certainly re-examine this issue of divestment. So there was sort of a lets disagree to disagree. And for now, though, remove that encampment. So that perhaps could be a model that would be reviewed by other universities in terms of how you find common grounds with very passionate student movements that continue to spread throughout the U.S. and around the world.",

In 2020, the president formed -- there was a committee report that advised divestment and it's sort of been something that activists have been organizing around since then. There was -- there were two sit-ins in the fall, one in November, one in December, in total 61 students from Brown for arrested, 20 of those had their charges dropped and 41 of them still have their charges. In fact, that was one of the items on the negotiating table that the organizers were not able to have administration budge on. And then just this semester in February, there was a hunger strike. 19 undergraduate students embarked on an eight-day hunger strike. They urged the administration similar demands that they were able to get after this demonstration. And so someone who's kind of observed this progression it really, well, the encampment kind of pushed the envelope to get to the negotiating table. It's been a long time coming on Brown's campus.",

But a lot of those students are still actively participating and organizing at the encampment at Brown. It was pretty fluid of who could come in and out of the space and most days from noon to 1:00, there would be some sort of rally or larger group gathering that involved both encampers and students from the community. And occasionally even community members from Providence gathering peacefully, and sometimes another 41 students who were arrested in that sit-in would give a speech and talk about their experiences.

In fact, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders told our Christiane Amanpour that these are -- these new anti-war protests may be Biden's Vietnam, as he described it. A recent Harvard study found that while just 18 percent of voters aged 18 to 29 approved of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, it did actually rank near the bottom of issues that mattered most to them with the economy overwhelmingly the top concern.

And the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent. I want to bring in CNN's Matt Egan. Two questions here. Firstly, as far as investors are concerned, and we'll bring up these markets, they've taken off on the back of this. They're buying these markets. They clearly think this is, you know, this is comfortable territory at this point for a potential rate cut at some point soon, correct? Are they right at this point?",

We have seen thisjobs market could be really, really, really hot over the last several months. So we have to wait to see if this is part of a new trend. But directionally we were all really kind of hoping for Goldilocks, right? I think that's what investors wanted. That's what officials in the Fed wanted. Even officials in the White House were hoping for a Goldilocks. Not so hot that it raises those inflation fears and not so cold that it causes concern about anything like a recession. And I do think we got that, right, 175,000 jobs added. In a vacuum that's a really good number. In this environment, that is a slowdown, right? We're north of 300,000 jobs the month before. The unemployment rate was supposed to stay flat. It actually ticked higher to 3.9 percent. And I do think the Goldilocks vibe, you really do get that from wages, right. We saw that wages were up by 3.9 percent year over year in April. That is a good number, again, in a vacuum, but this is actually a slowdown. This is the slowest pace that we've seen in almost three years. So this is good news for workers in the sense that their paychecks are still growing faster than prices are, but it's also good from the sense of investors and officials in the Federal Reserve because that chart shows the blue lines starting to come down more and more. It shows that wage growth is cooling and so that does ease some of those inflation fears -- Becky.",

And then these other two pieces that are serving to be incredibly complicated, but these are also the pieces the U.S. is pinning its hopes on this future for a two- state solution, for a state for the Palestinians, as well as this normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. These are the pieces that they are discussing feverishly with Saudi officials, with other Arab officials. Secretary Blinken was just in the region this week and this was a big part of his conversations there, as well as with Israeli officials.

And it's strange because you know when this case and the prosecution knew and the defense attorneys knew that lawyers are goingto be a part of the trial, that there are going to be witnesses that are lawyers and former lawyers. Michael Cohen was a lawyer. So Keith Davidson was a lawyer or is a lawyer. So you're going to have these two jurors that are attorneys bring in their own experience, their own commonsense, their own legal expertise to make findings in this case as to credibility, as to, wait, hold up. Could that have been for legal fees? Is that the normal course of business between an attorney and client? Recordings of an attorney-client conversation, is that normal? Is that ethical? Is that what happens? And they're going to use their own experience to evaluate the credibility and everything happening in this case.",
