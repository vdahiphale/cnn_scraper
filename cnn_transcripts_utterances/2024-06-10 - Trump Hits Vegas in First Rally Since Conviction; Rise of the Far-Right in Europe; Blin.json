Then you have some of the more moderate Republicans that are just like, yes, we don't really care about that. Let's figure out the economic issues, some of the military issues, immigration issues. And so, I think what the former president is trying to do is have a balancing act of maintaining that drive with his ardent supporters, but also trying to touch on some of the issues with some of those modern leaning Republicans that somewhat are skeptical of some of his rhetoric.

So, these are, you know, sort of the next generation.And the first one that I think is the most closely watched involves the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug mifepristone, which is an abortion pill. Right now, in America, most women who need to end a pregnancy need do it through abortion medication, not through surgery. So, access to that mifepristone is crucial. This case tests the FDA's authority for finding any drug safe and effective as they did for mifepristone. And for practical consequences on the ground, it would involve whether the FDA regulations that have allowed it to be available at 10 weeks of pregnancy rather than seven, which had been the prior rule, and whether it could be obtained by mail rather than in person. But, more broadly, this case tests FDA authority for any drug's approval and the conditions for it. So, it really goes to broad federal regulatory authority. And a threshold question is, who can actually challenge that? In this case, a group of anti-abortion physicians have challenged it. And during oral arguments, Jim, the justices were pretty hung up on that, on whether these doctors actually had what's referred to as legal standing. So, this ruling could turn out to be more incremental than long lasting in terms of FDA authority. So, we're watching for that one, especially.",

Donald Trump is claiming absolute immunity in the election subversion case that Special Counsel Jack Smith has brought on behalf of the Department of Justice and on behalf of the American people, actually. So -- and he is claiming absolute immunity. The justices will probably reject that.

Now, you remember, Jim, this is one where a trial judge was about to actually start a trial of Donald Trump back in March, first week in March.
