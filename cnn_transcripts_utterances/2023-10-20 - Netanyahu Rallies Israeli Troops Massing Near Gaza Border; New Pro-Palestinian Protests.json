That's similar to the marks the president is getting in his approach to Ukraine. And -- but it is slightly higher than his overall approval rating, which sat at about 40 percent in that poll.

      "sentences": "Yes. That's such a critical point. It also underscores both the origin and rationale for the speech last night and the details of the emergency aid package that the White House will be sending up to Capitol Hill in just a matter of hours.And the details here matter, because they get at what Arlette was laying out. Not just the policy but also the politics and trying to figure out a path forward in a building that doesn't currently have an operating House of Representatives. So what's in the package? You heard the big kind of rhetorical soaring speech that the president had last night. The details here matter. And here's why. Not only does it include $60 billion for Ukraine, which roughly aligns with an annual appropriation to continue the U.S. aid towards Ukraine for a long period of time, not to have month-to-month reups that have caused so much political division, given House Republican opposition to much of that aid. When it comes to Israel, the president and his team having very in- depth discussions, I'm told, about what the Israelis needed, while the president was over there, landing around $14 billion. But there's also other elements, as well. Humanitarian aid, which has been critical, both Ukraine and other places around the world. But look at this, $14 billion for the border, drug trafficking, fentanyl. That's important, because Republicans will have to support this plan, as well. They can point to that as a critical need. The administration says it's critical, as well. And also, $7 billion for the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan. That is also a bipartisan issue. The administration, in this national security package, really trying to drive towards something that can get a majority support in the House and the Senate. They believe it's there, whether or not the House actually has a speaker. Still at this point an open question. Why the difference between Israel -- aid to Israel and Ukraine? This is an important point here. Because it's not as dramatic as it may look in this emergency package. In fact, the $14 billion is roughly what the Israelis were asking for in terms of needs. And here's in part why. If you look at the scale of U.S. assistance and you want to understand just how close this alliance is, $260 plus billion adjusted for inflation since World War II is more than any other country that the U.S. gives military aid to. Obviously, Israel was created in 1948. The difference is critical. Ukraine, so large in part because it's not just money going to Ukraine, it is going to help U.S. stocks and rebuilding those.

Much like they can now in the West Bank. Joining us now from the Magic Wall, CNN military analyst, retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. Sir, good to see you. I want to start with the flares. Because Nic Robertson was pointing this out. We showed video of it right now. And he made clear that that's not the norm, necessarily, in this moment. What does that tell you? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It just tells me that the Israeli forces are looking for something or they're trying to use a little bit of psychological warfare against the people inside of Gaza.

But the range from there to Israel is pretty far. And it's -- they don't have a great missile force, let's put it that way. But the other things that were occurring are -- would be a normal day in some -- in some countries. Like the drone attack at al-Tanf in Syria, that is a U.S. military base, and that particular reason, it's been there for a while. Other drone attacks, al Assad Air Force Base. I've been out there many times in Iraq, in Irbil, Baghdad and in the Southern part of Iraq, just tells me that the popular mobilization fronts, the Iranian-backed rebels, are actually targeting those kinds of locations, just as harassment attacks. There was also two Israeli citizens killed in Egypt, which just shows that there's a swell of a ground movement that is a result of some of the things that have been going on there.
