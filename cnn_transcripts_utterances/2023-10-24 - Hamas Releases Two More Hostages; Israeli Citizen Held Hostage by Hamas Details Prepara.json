You are talking about tunnels. We know these tunnels have ventilation. We know that they've been known to have air-conditioning. This has all been reports that we have heard from the Israelis over the years. But the fact that she is saying she was held underground for more than two weeks, that there was shampoo, there was antibiotics, there was a guard per hostage in the experience she had, that there were medics and paramedics. And, obviously, she is elderly. The other woman who was released also elderly and had medical needs, and they had the medicine needed, and if not something similar to replace it, it is pretty stunning, because you've got to contrast that with what's happening above the ground, right, where there isn't water, never mind shampoo, OK. They don't have water. They're using toilet water. There is no morphine for any kind of amputations, antibiotics, no, right.

So as much as Hamas is, again, giving this image of humane treatment to hostages, you must remember again that they were hostages. Remember what happened to the people who didn't get to become hostages. The horrible and brutal and inhuman method of their brutal massacre and slaughter. But then when they did take people hostages, they would separate. So a husband and wife not being together and she doesn't know where he is. And that, of course, is the obvious -- raises the obvious point, that we don't know where they are being held and are there any being held in larger groups.We know Hamas has said that some of the hostages have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. We don't know if they have been killed. We don't know if they were killed by Israeli airstrikes or anything else. But all we know at this point is what Hamas has said. They have indicated 22 have been killed in strikes. We just don't know if it's true. The Israeli forces preparing for the Gaza ground invasion are getting counsel from an American military leader now here on the ground in Israel. Marine Corps Lieutenant General James Glynn was head of the Marine Corps' special operations command, and it is unclear, though, while of course he has the experience and the resume for such a situation, it is unclear what his specific role is here. But an official does say General Glynn, of course, has decades of experience and can ask what they say are the hard questions as the United States does not have a clear of Israel's intentions in Gaza, right. They said they're going to get rid of Hamas in all respect. But beyond that, what that actually means, they have not provided any specifics. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Sderot, Israel, where he has been since the beginning of this war. As Nic, we have been in the midst of what is now 17 days into a war, what are you seeing in terms of military movement this morning in the context of, what, more than 300 strikes that Israel is saying they conducted in the past 24 hours in Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Yes, and just to go back to what you were saying there about the former marine general, I think the other piece of context here, of course, is the fact that we know that there is a marine expeditionary unit of 2,000 who have been on readiness and standby to come in give logistics support and other unspecified support to the Israeli military at a time when there are American hostages being held by Hamas inside Gaza.So it seems, when you pick and choose which general to come and give what sort of advice, you are also picking one who would be very familiar with the sort of expertise, readiness, and what these marines who are sitting just offshore have at their disposal. It speaks to me as coordination as well. Of course, that's not what we're being told. But when it comes to the readiness, we heard from the prime minister today, Prime Minister Netanyahu, when he was speaking with the French President Emmanuel Macron who has given his support to Israel's right to strike back to Hamas, the prime minister said it could be a long war. I am struck by the fact he said it could be because until now he has been very clear, saying we will go after them and we'll get the job done, we'll completely get hid of Hamas. But I think this is also indicative of the fact that there is no stepping back from the possibility of a ground incursion. We are not seeing anything on the ground at the moment that would indicate that. We'll sill hearing heavy detonations coming from within Gaza. We've heard military helicopters in the area this morning. So what we heard from the Israeli defense chief yesterday, head of general staff, saying that they are ready, that troops are ready, that they are getting additional training. But I think the posture is set for when the command comes that the troops are ready for that incursion. Very clear that they are being paused for a clear -- that has to do with humanitarian aid, has to do with hostages, quite the connections we don't see. But that force is there. It's ready to go. I don't see anyone pulling it back at the moment, Erin.",

Brock (ph) Rivi (ph) from \"Axios\" was just on reporting that Israel is willing to delay its ground invasion for a few more days. Obviously, it's already been delayed. You have been ready go for 16 days, 15 days, whatever the technical day point may be here that you want to say since you were ready. But they're willing to delay for a large hostage release, and a senior Israeli official telling him, if Hamas proposing a big package, of course, we will be ready to do things in return.

      "sentences": "Erin, I can't comment specifically, but I would say there are two conditions for any ground mobilization of the IDF. First of all, of course, the government decision to mobilize. There needs to be a green light from the government that tells us to go in. War is the political intercourse by other means, and that is why there is need for a political dialogue or diplomatic dialogue to be ongoing.The second component is operational -- the optimal operational requirements of a military ground operation. With every day that goes by, we are a more professional force, a more prepared, a better prepared, a better equipped force. So we are not in a rush. As you rightly pointed out, the government hasn't limited our timeframe for this operation. On the contrary, they have said it will take a long time because we understand that fighting this type of war is a very challenging process. So we are not in a rush. We are determined to destroy Hamas, make sure it can never, never ever attack our people, abduct our people, butcher our people, murder our people, and that's where we are heading at this time. So until those two conditions are made clear, that is basically where we will be standing. We need to be prepared. We need the government to give us that green light. BURNETT: I want to play something else that Yocheved Lifshitz, one the hostages, said when she was speaking this morning, specifically about Israeli intelligence and what happened to her that morning. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, HOSTAGE RELEASED BY HAMAS (through translator): The lack of awareness by Shin Bet and IDF hurt just a lot. They warned us three weeks beforehand. They sent fields, they sent fire balloons, and the IDF did not treat it seriously. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They need to release the hostages; they need to release them now. They need to let Yocheved's husband free. We heard from her daughter about the concern for her father, and they need to release the other 200 or so hostages go. They need to let them go now, that is what we're demanding.

It's about desalination plants.Don't forget the water, doctors tell us people are drinking brackish water, that they're seeing a huge spike in preeclampsia in pregnant women because of the lack of pure water. They need those generators to power those desalination plant efforts. And so, the knock-on effect of this lack of fuel is catastrophic. But despite the efforts of humanitarian organizations, regional governments, western diplomats, and everyone coming to the table, the Israelis said, as you just articulated, as they told Kaitlan Collins, that they believe that it can be used for military purposes, it can be stolen by Hamas. So, unclear how this issue will get resolved, but in the meantime, it is having dire consequences. We interviewed a doctor yesterday who said two days left. So potentially, you're talking about tomorrow, as early as tomorrow, totally running out of fuel. They have already, according to health officials inside Gaza, turned off lights, for example, turned off air conditioning. They have tried to limit their consumption to the maximum of their ability. But the reality is, without fuel, you are going to see a huge number of deaths potentially, and still no sense that there is progress being made on finding some kind of a mechanism to appropriately deal with this issue, Poppy.",
