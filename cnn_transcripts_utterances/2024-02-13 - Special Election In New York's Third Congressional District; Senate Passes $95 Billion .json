Then the Senate, over the last several days, has been pushing through this $95.3 billion measure dealing with Ukraine, dealing with Israel, and dealing with Taiwan. A bipartisan vote, 70 votes in the affirmative this morning, to get it over the finish line. But there is real tension around the ranks.One of the people who held up the votes over the last several days was Senator Rand Paul, a fellow Kentucky Republican who took aim at Mitch McConnell himself, even as Paul himself found some fire trained at him as well.

So, what they can do is they can get 218 signatures. People, Democrats would need to get some Republicans on board to sign on to a petition, essentially putting this bill on the floor, forcing a vote on the floor. But this rarely succeeds. It takes a lot of time for it to play out.Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic leader, just told his colleagues he wants to use, quote, 'every available tool' to try to force a vote. But Jeffries himself is expected to lose Democratic support over the fact that the Israel portion of this aid package does not include conditions in providing Israel with that money. So, he's going to lose some Democratic support, meaning he has to get even more Republicans to back it to get that majority threshold. And Republicans, of course, facing pressure from Donald Trump, from their leadership not to sign on to this effort.

That is actually a trigger, right? Which is actually -- we're above it right now on the border. So, it's not as you represent it. But what you would have is a credible fear threshold that would be increased such that you would actually -- and it would also create positions at the border to more quickly process people. So, you would -- yes, you would have some people granted asylum and more quickly, but you would also have people kicked out of the U.S. in greater numbers and more quickly.",

And they are willing to pass a bill that gives them additional resources that have been denied them by this administration. And it's actually the numbers that you're talking about, the 5,000 that we have worse numbers now. Under the Trump administration, it was less than 1,000. They want to codify 5,000 and make that normal. Do the math.That's 2 million people nearly coming through our borders illegally every year. That is not enforcing our laws. That is not shutting down our border. That's not actually listening to asylum claims where 80 percent to 90 percent of those who make the asylum claims actually don't even fit the rules for laws for asylum. But what that is doing is allowing up to 5,000 people, and actually it's even more than that, 5,000 on average a week, but it was 8,500 in a day could come before those laws were triggered, before those limits were triggered.
