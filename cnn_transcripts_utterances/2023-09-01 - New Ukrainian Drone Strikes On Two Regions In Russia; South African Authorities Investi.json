Officials say air defenses intercepted one drone headed to the Moscow region, while two others hit a city in the Kursk region Friday morning causing damage. But across the border, Ukraine says its troops are edging towards what could be the toughest line of Russian defenses in the south.Now, it's happening near the village of Robotyne, which Ukrainians recently captured. But now they're up against a maze of heavily fortified trenches and obstacles that Russia has been building for months. A Ukrainian brigade in that area acknowledges there is a tough fight ahead. Ukraine has faced criticism that its counteroffensive is too slow, which prompted an angry response from its foreign minister on Thursday. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They, last week, captured Robotyne, that small village on the southern front here. With Russia now continuing to press forward. And that in and of itself speaks to a confidence here. They're not standing still, they're not retreating, they are pushing forward.Despite the continued counterattacks by Russia, and as you mentioned, the heavily difficult fortified trenches, this is a difficult landscape really to navigate. Heavily mined as well and heavily defended by Russia. And it's been clear that while the progress, the land gains have been difficult, one of the key tactics by Ukraine has been to push the pressure into Russia elsewhere, move it away from the front line and push it into Russia's territory itself. And that is why we've been seeing these drone attacks earlier this week, some of the most intense drone assaults in Russia really since the beginning of the war and across a wide range of areas. And it's worth noting that Ukraine's drone manufacturing capacity has dramatically increased in this period. Just in the last month, we've seen the number of Ukrainian drone manufactures jumping from 200 last month to 300 this month. At the start of the war, it was just 30. This is a clear investment by Ukraine in drones as a way of taking this war forward and it's interesting bearing that in mind that the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said yesterday quite mysteriously that a Ukrainian long-range weapon had successfully hit a target 700 kilometers away. That's about 435 miles. Now, he didn't say what it was and we can't independently verify it. But it is interesting because one of the drone attacks earlier this week on Russia was in Pskov, a region just north of Moscow, about 700 kilometers away from Ukraine. Could it be that? We don't know. But it's interesting and it shows that drones are an investment that Ukraine is taking forward as the counteroffensive clearly has some challenges. Kim.",

He is the head of the Republican guard, this elite unit in the military, and now he gets to lead gabon.But opposition parties say that the people of Gabon should be grateful that the military junta took over power but it should be open to talks about the best solution forward for the country. They say that President Ali Bongo was wrongfully declared the winner of the election on Saturday before it was complete, and they believe they won the election rightfully. So that is an interesting development and this crisis, the entire coup began because the opposition and many in Gabon saw that the third term of Ali Bongo was illegitimate after a sham election.

So bringing in General Nguema is some type of a middle decision. This does not bring stability to Gabon at all.
