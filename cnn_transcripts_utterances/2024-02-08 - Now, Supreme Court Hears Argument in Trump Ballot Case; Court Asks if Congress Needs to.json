But when it comes to who's also in there on Trump's team, we're getting a bit of an idea of who he's dispatched to go in there, given he himself won't be there. That includes Jason Miller, a political aide, Boris Epshteyn, a political and legal aide to him, and also John Sauer. And that stuck out to me when I saw that he was seen entering the court, because he is, of course, the attorney who just made that argument about Trump having presidential immunity in front of that federal appeals court, a different courthouse here in Washington.

It's possible they might also ask the full circuit to hear the case. But it's notable, right? The Supreme Court is going to be such an enormous influence in the 2024 election cycle because as soon as they get out of court today, Trump's legal team, they need to go talk about what they're going to do for this immunity appeal.",

They're pretty confident they're going to win the ballot eligibility case on the merits, but the idea that presidents have absolute immunity is not something that they believe they could win on here at the high court. They lost at the trial court. They lost at the district court. But we know their legal strategy is really to just delay, delay as long as possible. Because if they do lose, that means Jack Smith can actually bring his federal election subversion case against Trump to trial. So, they're going to try anything they can to delay that outcome. But the big question is, what are the justices going to do with this anticipated appeal? It's unclear if they'll take out the case, if we'll be back here in a few months for another big Trump legal issue.

The one thing Chief Justice Roberts does not want is for his tenure as chief to be seen as the one where the justices inexorably split from one another, conservatives, liberals, never any consensus. And now he's got these challenges. The two, the one today about whether Trump will appear on the ballot, and the one you were talking about, whether Donald Trump can claim immunity in Jack Smith's criminal case, both of those, inevitably, whether they take them or not, and whichever way they come out, are going to impact the 2024 election.

Even if you talk about this from a legal perspective, the average voter, the average viewer, says, well, isn't that inherently political? And I'm still having a little bit of legal PTSD from Bush v. Gore. They don't want to weigh into that, even though it's a very valid question for this court to address. They're going to be cognizant of that.

      "sentences": "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. The Colorado Supreme Court held that President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons.The first reason is that President Trump is not covered by Section 3 because the president is not an officer of the United States, as that term is used, throughout the Constitution. Officer of the United States refers only to appointed officials, and it does not encompass elected individuals, such as the president or members of Congress. This is clear from the commission's clause, the impeachment clause, and the appointments clause, each of which uses officers of the United States to refer only to appointed and not elected officials. The second reason is that Section 3 cannot be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the ballot, even if that candidate is disqualified from serving as president under Section 3, because Congress can lift that disability after the candidate is elected but before he takes office. A state cannot exclude any candidate for federal office from the ballot on account of Section 3, and any state that does so is violating the holding of term limits by altering the Constitution's qualifications for federal office. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is no different from a state residency law that requires members of Congress to inhabit the state prior to Election Day when the Constitution requires only that members of Congress inhabit the state that they represent when elected. In both situations, a state is accelerating the deadline to meet a constitutionally imposed qualification, and is thereby violating the holding of term limits. And in this situation, a ruling from this court that affirms the decision below would not only violate term limits but take away the votes of potentially tens of millions of Americans. I welcome the court's questions. JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Mr. Mitchell, would you -- you didn't spend much time on your argument with respect to whether or not Section 3 is self-executing. So, would you address that? And in doing that, your argument is that it's not self-executing, but then in that case, what would the role of the state be, or is it entirely up to Congress to implement the disqualification in Section 3?",

      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "sentences": "It is entirely up to Congress, Justice Thomas, and our argument goes beyond actually saying that Section 3 is non-self- executing. We need to say something more than that, because a non- self-executing treaty or a non-self-executing constitutional provision normally can still be enforced by a state if it chooses to enact legislation.The holding of Griffin's case goes beyond even that by saying that a state is not allowed to implement or enforce Section 3 of the 14th Amendment unless and until Congress enacts implementing legislation allowing it to do so. So, under Griffin's case, which we believe is correctly decided, the Anderson litigants disagree with us on that point, but if this court were to adhere to the holding of Griffin's case, there would not be any rule for the states in enforcing Section 3 unless Congress were to enact a statute that gives them that authority. CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Counsel, what if somebody came in to a state secretary of state's office and said, I took the oath specified in Section 3, I participated in an insurrection, and I want to be on the ballot, does the secretary of state have the authority in that situation to say no, you're disqualified?",

So, if the candidate makes clear, perhaps through a sworn declaration or through his own statements, that he has no intention of relocating to that state before Election Day, then the secretary of state would be enforcing an extant constitutional qualification rather than enforcing a new state- imposed qualification.And that's the key under term limits. Is the state, in any way, altering the criteria for a federal office, either for Congress or for the presidency? And in this situation, the Colorado Supreme Court is going slightly beyond what Section 3 requires, because Section 3, on its face, bans an insurrectionist only from holding it.

Because, normally, I mean, every other provision of the 14th Amendment has been treated as self-executing.What we would argue in that hypothetical that Your Honor has suggested is that there are practical considerations unique to Section 3, that counsel in favor of a rule similar to what Chief Justice Chase spelled out in Griffin's case. And it goes to, I think, the policy concerns he talks about, where this was a case, Griffin's case involved, a convicted criminal who was seeking a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the judge who tried his case was an insurrectionist disqualified under Section 3. And Chief Justice Chase realizes that if he enforces Section 3 in this situation, it would nullify every official act taken not only by this particular judge, but by anyone who was an insurrectionist or arguably an insurrectionist under Section 3. And that was -- JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Why do you need those consequential concerns, though? I mean, it kind of seems to me that what Justice Kagan is getting at is, why don't you have an argument that the Constitution of its own force, that Section 3 of its own force, preempts the state's ability not necessarily, I think, not to enforce Section 3 against its own officers, but against federal officers, like in a Tarbel's (ph) case kind of way?",

Would it not permit -- would it not lead to the possibility that other states would say, using their choice of law rules and their rules on collateral estoppel, that there's non- mutual collateral estoppel against former President Trump, and so the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court could effectively decide this question for many other states, perhaps all other states?

They might conclude, as a matter of fact, that President Trump did not have any intent to engage in incitement or make some other finding that differs from what this trial court judge found.

So this -- in this decision, the trial court in Colorado thought that it was proper to admit the January 6 report and it also admitted the testimony of an expert who testified about the meaning of certain words and phrases to people who communicate with and among extremists, right?
