And indeed, whenever he was challenged about his father-in-law's wealth, he maintained that he was extremely proud of what he'd achieved. And as you say, it was completely congruent with conservative values that if you work hard, and opportunities are given to that any form of success is something to be proud of. And he was very defensive of his wife as well. And we've seen that in a number of media interviews. He speaks about his family quite frequently too. In the last leadership contest, he have frequently referred to his daughters in terms of their influence on him and his policies on climate change, and that they speak to him a lot and inform some of his opinions, too. He mentioned his own family when he wrote to the Ukrainians pledging support. He said that his family sends love to them. So he's definitely bringing a bit more of a personal touch.

And there's a lot of horse trading that goes on behind the scenes with these leadership contests. I was told by members of Parliament who back Rishi Sunak that he was deliberately trying to adopt a policy of not promising jobs. He wants to reward jobs, any reshuffling he does based on merit alone and who is best to be in that role in the national interest. And that there wasn't promises behind that, there weren't promises behind the scenes about oh, you support me and I'll give you this. That's their narrative, at least. It might make sense to bring Penny Mordaunt in a significant role in the cabinet purely because she obviously does have the support of a chunk of the party. It -- difficult to know how much because her public declarations, I don't believe reached 30. Even though her team were suggesting to us that she'd got over 90 nominations. But it would make sense to try and include big heavy hitters from different parts of the party in his governing approach. And that's because one of the biggest criticisms that people launched at Liz Truss is that she did the opposite. So without the mandate of the general election and without the support of M.P.s, she had more support from the Conservative Party membership. She plowed ahead and basically populated her cabinet with loyalists. That didn't go down well and given the party is so fractured that simply isn't a sustainable way to govern.

So I think that's something that the government need to focus on. Currently, the fiscal statement is due in just a week's time. And that's meant to put out all the forward estimates in terms of the government spending, economic growth, inflation, all these kinds of very important stats to then give a bit of calm to the markets when it comes to the value of the pound, as well as the government borrowing costs. But I think that's really just linked the short term issues here. I think what we want to hear from Rishi is actually a lot more about what is his plan for economic growth? We haven't heard anything so far. Obviously, Liz Truss, ultimately was not particularly successful. But I think she identified a really important issue, which is, the U.K. economy has been stagnant in terms of living standards for the last decade. We've -- coming out of a period of slowdown through COVID, a slowdown and inflation crashes as a result of the war in Ukraine. And then you've got underlying structural issues with an aging population, more pressure on public services, as well as questions about quality of life for the British people.

I'd like to see them make some tough decisions. I don't think there's necessarily going to be the case if you've got an issue like the pension triple lock in the U.K., where we guarantee that pensions are going to go up by 2.5 percent inflation or wages.

And there's not actually a lot of detail there. I mean, he talked to in broad terms about trying to reduce taxes in a few years time. We don't know if that's going to be able to happen anymore. We talked about reforming business rates to boost product -- productivity, looking at investment incentives, all sorts of different policy areas where he's said things that might not necessarily great for growth, but to fulfill a certain constituency, like not building on the Greenbelt or protecting agricultural lands, and so not putting up solar farms. There's all sorts of different commitments he made. I want you to see whether he keeps those commitments, whether he says we're in a new situation here, we need a slightly different approach to what I've talked about in the past. Here's my plan to get the U.K. economy going again, not only do we need to stabilize the finances, because the next step forward and that's what I'll be interested to see.",

      "sentences": "It's a poisoned chalice. But one that he knows well, given he was actually chancellor only until July of this year, whichis extraordinary when you think how much has happened since then. We do know a lot about him in terms of his economic thinking, particularly the leadership race, the first one we had over the summer where he spoke a lot about being essentially fiscally conservative that he won't be issuing any major tax cuts until he has inflation under control. And I think he was very -- well it was fiercely opposed really to so-called Trussanomics even before Liz Truss won that leadership race. So, I imagine we will see the continued unwinding of the so-called mini budget which of course sunk Truss's premiership. And I think we'll see a reverse of that possibly under Jeremy Hunt, who, of course, is the current chancellor. It'll be interesting to see whether he keeps that sort of continuity in there. We can show you what the markets have been doing today. I think ever since Boris Johnson, essentially removed himself from the race, we've seen quite a calm on financial markets. The pound hasn't been moving too much. It's been fairly stable. But it's actually U.K. government bonds where we've seen the most movement this morning. The 10-year-yield comfortably now below four percent which is a far cry from where we were just a few weeks ago under Liz Truss. We have a prime minister as well, Max, who of course, has the support of more than half of his party at this stage and a party that has a big majority in Parliament. So, barring anything we can't see at this stage and I say that because who knows what's around the corner in terms of U.K. politics. This should be a prime minister with some stability and one who knows the ins and outs of the economy and one that has great experience that being a chancellor during a really difficult era with a pandemic. So all being well, Rishi Sunak will perhaps be the prime minister until the next general election. But who knows.",

Are just -- we just heard a statement from the Irish prime minister saying -- congratulating Rishi Sunak andlooking forward to working with him on the political impasse in Northern Ireland. There's so much we don't know about him as a politician, because we know him mainly, as a finance expert. He's been so focused on that. A big challenge now is focusing on the economy which is the absolute priority. And then perhaps delegating a lot of these other parts of his job, you know, the war in Ukraine, we don't know where he really stands on that, do we? There's so many -- it's going to have so many distractions now whether or not he can keep focused on the economy, with all these other things going on as well. He's so much more as expected of him.",

And we don't know a huge amount of his thinking at the momentbecause he's been very quiet in this leadership contest. Everything we really know about where Rishi Sunak stands, is from the summer, when we had the six-week contest against Liz Truss, he's been incredibly quiet this time round. It will be interesting to see what he puts together in terms of the cabinet, whether or not he does pick people from the different factions from the Conservative Party, so that we can see some unity perhaps. I think that will be very important as to how he performs in the coming months. But all that to come I think the next few days will be really interesting. I think markets would like to see continuity in the role of chancellor given how much unstability we've had in recent weeks. So hopefully, for them, we'll see Jeremy Hunt in that position. But as you say, Rishi Sunak has been a chance that he's got all that experience. But actually now he almost needs to delegate that and look at all the different issues that people want to know where he stands on.",

It's the least disruptive, it takes the least amount of time. And it does present something of united front and a consensus. So that's a helpful step forward after the turbulence that we've seen over the last six weeks. In terms of what happens next, as you say, we wouldn't be expecting to hear from him on camera fairly shortly. I'm sure that he's fully received the criticism that Liz Truss's government had got over recent weeks of not communicating enough with the media, a poor performance in interviews, not telegraphing policies well enough in advance. So he'll want to establish right from the beginning that he's not going to make those same mistakes who will also be thinking about who to put in his cabinets, who -- which positions to reshuffle where he wants stability, where he wants change. And of course, before he does any of those things, officially, he'll need to actually go to the kingdom become prime minister. And as you know how that works, Max. Perhaps it will happen later this evening, Liz Truss goes to King Charles to resign. Then Rishi Sunak follow shortly after to be invited to form a government and become prime minister. But as ever, as a prime minister. He's hitting the ground running and I'm sure everyone will be glued to P.M. cues on Wednesday, even those of us who aren't usually because it will be fascinating to see him at the despatch box for the first time trying to rally the support of his benches and face off against Kier Starmer, leader of the opposition.",
