It's the House clerk, calling each member's name to vote, only in the end for McCarthy to fail to meet the threshold every single time. It's been a three-day stretch of defeats in a speaker contest that is now the longest in 164 years. Despite promising these major concessions to the Republican hold-outs, McCarthy did not gain any ground on vote after vote after vote yesterday. But he still says he's making progress, he thinks. And a lot to answer for when he left last night, as reporters swarmed him. CNN's Manu Raju was in the middle of it, pushing McCarthy for answers.

Eventually, folks got Paul Ryan to run. Paul Ryan, really a reluctant speaker; he didn't want the job either. And I think McCarthy looks back at that, seeing that Paul Ryan had some of the same problems he's experiencing now, and says what am I going to do, step aside and let somebody else get this job and, in six months, they're the enemy of the Freedom Caucus, or these 20 hardliners?

That same document says one of the surviving roommates says she was awoken around 4 a.m., heard crying from Xana Kernodle's room, and heard a voice say, \"It's OK. I'm going to help you.\" And that she heard the crying and saw a figure clad in black clothing and a mask. She describes him as 5'10\" or taller, male, not very muscular, but athletically built with bushy eyebrows, saying he walked past her as she stood in a frozen, shocked face. But questions still remain about why no one called 911 until almost eight hours later. The document also details multiple sightings of a suspect vehicle from surveillance footage, showing a white Hyundai Elantra like this one that helped lead to Kohberger's arrest. About two weeks after the murders, police from Washington State University, where Kohberger attended school, flagged his vehicle, later seen at a traffic stop in mid-December in Indiana while driving with his father to Pennsylvania.",

He had been working abroad in Europe, following a bike accident. And now that he's back, we've learned that he is staffing up. And Don, he is going to need all the help he can get, because we have learned that he has a mountain of new evidence to sift through, as he decides whether the former president and his associates should be charged related to January 6th. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL FANONE, D.C. POLICE OFFICER: We cannot afford to brush political violence under the rug or turn a blind eye when others encourage it. REID (voice-over): While President Biden commemorates the second anniversary of the January 6th Capitol attack by presenting medals to D.C. Police Officer Michael Fanone and other law enforcement officials who responded that day, the Justice Department continues the biggest criminal investigation in its history. Already, more than 950 people have been arrested for their alleged participation in the deadly riot. Roughly half have pleaded guilty, and 40 have been convicted at trial. Just one has been acquitted. The House Select Committee that also investigated January 6th believes that prosecutors should charge former President Trump and his associates, as well. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): We want to make sure that the key organizers and movers of this attack don't escape the scrutiny of the justice system. REID (voice-over): That decision is now up to special counsel Jack Smith, appointed to oversee the investigation, and efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election and the sitting president's stated intention to be a candidate, as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. REID (voice-over): Attorney General Merrick Garland promised that Smith's appointment wouldn't delay the investigation.",
