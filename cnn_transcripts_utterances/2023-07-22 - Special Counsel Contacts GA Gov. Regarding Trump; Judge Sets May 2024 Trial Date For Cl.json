We begin this afternoon with yet another pivotal moment in the special counsel investigation of former President Donald Trump.A spokesman for Georgia Governor Brian Kemp confirms that Jack Smith's office has contacted Kemp's office, but declined to release any further details. You'll recall Trump pushed Kemp to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results after he narrowly lost the state and its 16 electoral votes to Joe Biden. CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us now to talk about this. Marshall, in the past few weeks, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also sat for an interview with Smith's team. We shouldn't be surprised that they reached out to Brian Kemp as well.",

President Trump tried to have Governor Kemp help him overturn the election. He wanted Kemp to interfere with the vote counting to overturn the results of a recount. He wanted Kemp to convene the state legislature to appoint fake electors. And when all of that failed, he wanted Kemp to block certification of the results. Kemp didn't do any of that. But what he could tell investigators is about his calls with Trump on the phone where Trump was trying to twist his arm, that pressure might form the basis of a criminal charge. ACOSTA: Yes. And we know there was pressure. And what do we know about the possible timing of this next Trump indictment?

That's not going to happen. But Trump didn't get what he wanted, either. At least not at this moment.

But the latest numbers have it down about 70 percent. So even as border crossings have gone down, Greg Abbott has become more extreme and more cruel in his behavior. So that's a signal right away that this is not about border security or controlling migration. This is simply a way for Greg Abbott to feed red meat to a base of people who he thinks agree with him, even though the Texans that I've spoken to both Republicans and Democrats are shocked and embarrassed that their governor would take this kind of action. And so this is a -- this is the governor of Texas doing this on his own and using Texans money to put up razor wire, to leave a pregnant woman on that razor wire, to have the people under his command, have her cry for help and then she miscarries and still to be continuing this kind of behavior. I know there's also been a debate about, well, who are you going to believe because Greg Abbott and Steve McCraw who's the Head of Department of Public Safety, they've denied this. But bear in mind that this is a governor that has set a very harsh and ugly tone on immigration. But also, this is the same group of people, Steven McCraw and Greg Abbott, who lie to the country in the world.

Certainly, the FBI and the Department of energy believe that's the most likely cause. And now the administration, it has recognized that we just should not be funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology. There was no funding going from the United States government. It hasn't been for about three years now. But we need to keep digging.

Who, in early 2020, said that they knew that it came from nature and not from a lab, it turned out that in their private communications, they were saying, hey, this could very well come from a lab.

And it left a lot of room for improvement, which is kind of what you want.If they weren't back-to-back champs, I don't know that we would be dissecting it as much as we are. But they were expected to be the World Cup debutant in Vietnam. It was really just a matter of how big that goal differential was going to be. They left a lot of chances out there. But it was a lot of soccer to play. And they know this. It ended up being a great way to start this year's campaign. The U.S. possessed the ball for the majority of the game, which is what's important. Sophia Smith making her World Cup debut. She drove the ball into the back of the net to open the scoring in the 14th minute and really set the tone. And she was not done. Striking again deep in stoppage time at the end of the first half for her second goal of the game. And at just under 23 years old, she is one of the faces of this tournament, the second youngest player in U.S. women's team history to score multiple goals in a World Cup game. Then we have a veteran like we all know in Megan Rapinoe making a little history of her own in her fourth and final World Cup, coming in as a substitute in the second half for her 200th appearance for Team USA. Up next for the United States women is the Netherlands on Wednesday night. Their second Group E game and a rematch of the 2019 World Cup finals. So the tests only get tougher from here. Elsewhere, Lionel Messi's debut has been one of the most anticipated in recent memory. And somehow it lived up to the hype and then some. Seven months after winning the men's World Cup, the seven-time FIFA player of the year comes off the bench and delivers another one of these magical Messi moments that he's been known for. Throwing in a magnificent strike from outside the box in the 94th minute, which sent the crowd of more than 20,000 into a frenzy. That would turn out to be the game winner in the 2-1 game over Mexico. As you know, Jim, it's been Messi mania. Ticket prices up nearly 1000 percent since he's arrived in Miami. And so far, he has really delivered. We'll see what happens from here, but a great night all around for soccer. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
