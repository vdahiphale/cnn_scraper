It will be his fourth time booked on criminal charges. He won't be alone.The 98-page indictment also names 18 co-defendants including his former chief of staff, Mark Meadows. The 41 charges include racketeering and conspiracy. The Atlanta area District Attorney, Fani Willis, says those 19 defendants in total plotted against the Constitution which Trump swore to protect and defend and abuse the office Trump is, of course, running for once again. CNN's Paula Reid is at the courthouse in Atlanta. Paula compare to the federal election interference case, this one is wider both in terms of number of defendants but also took a different legal path for charging this.",

      "sentences": "That's right. A lot of key differences here not only in how it's structured, the District Attorney, Fani Willis, opting to pursue a racketeering or RICO case here.Now, RICO laws were designed to dismantle organized crime. And here she's also charging not only former president, Trump, but 18 of his allies and that's another key difference. Because for the first time people like Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows are facing charges for their involvement in efforts to overturn the election. Rudy Giuliani was, of course, a co-conspirator number one in the federal indictment, but Mark Meadows, who the January 6 Committee said was at the heart of this. They said all roads in this alleged conspiracy went right through Mark Meadows. He was conspicuously absent in the federal indictment, raising questions about whether he is cooperating, but here, he has been charged alongside these other 18 defendants. So it's a completely different approach. Logistically, Jim, it's going to be challenging, as she told our Sara Murray last night at the press conference that she wants to try them all together. But right now, these defendants have until next Friday at noon, to surrender. SCIUTTO: When you look at this case, what we know of the evidence to back up these charges, how much is new as compared to what was uncovered by the Special Counsel in his own investigation of the president's attempts to overturn the election as well as the - what the January 6 Committee discovered?",

It's really organically connected to the federal indictment. These are obviously different levels of government. But in our country, both the federal government and the state governments have responsibility for making sure that our elections are free and fair. The federal government, Jack Smith, and the Grand Jury have charged Donald Trump with leading a conspiracy in seven states to try to overturn the outcome of the 2020 Election. Now one of those states, Georgia, on its own, given its own responsibility, its own laws, is going after the president - former president and his lieutenants in that effort. So these are really connected. And so the question in our country should be, should the powerful be able to overturn an election without consequence? So, as far as I can see, the criminalization of the electoral process was not done or hasn't been done by the Georgia prosecutor or the federal prosecutor.
