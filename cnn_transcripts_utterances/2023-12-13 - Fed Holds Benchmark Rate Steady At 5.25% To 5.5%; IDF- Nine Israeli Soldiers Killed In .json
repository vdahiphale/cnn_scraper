The Dow above 1%, as you can see, and instant reaction to hearing what the Fed expects to do in terms of rate cuts next year. And that's the key. Those are the markets and these are the main events. It's a lucky number three. The Fed expects to cut interest rates three times by the end of next year. Heavy rain makes conditions even more difficult for displaced people in Gaza. And the US Supreme Court will consider restricting access to a widely used abortion drug, even in states where abortion is still allowed. Live from New York, it's Wednesday December 13th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest. And this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening once again. And tonight, Fed policymakers suggest they might pivot next year in the fight against inflation. As we speak, Fed Chair Jerome Powell discussing the bank's latest thoughts. It decides to hold its benchmark rate steady for a third straight meeting, so that's slide between 5.25% and 5.5%. Members of the Open Market Committee also discussed where they think rates are headed. Just take a look at the so-called dot plot. That's their forecast for interest rates going forward. They anticipate lower rates next year. Most expect a rate cut of at least half a percentage point. Powell said the Fed could also be done tightening. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You're seeing this, you know, really still pretty good jobs market starts to slow a little bit. You're seeing wage growth start to moderate. Jay Powell is hedging his bets as always.

The incident was one of the deadliest for the IDF since its invasion of Gaza. Meanwhile, heavy rain is also making life even more difficult for nearly two million people displaced in Gaza. Downpours overnight left their makeshift tents flooded. Social media video also shows the water rising ankle deep. Some people dug trenches even to try and stave off the flooding.

But the question is, when does this war transition from the intense bombing and ground offensive that we are seeing right now in both northern Gaza, as well as in southern Gaza around the Khan Younis area? And when does that transition to a kind of slower pace of fighting where you see a lot more special operations raids and kind of a different tempo of fighting. A lot of that is going to be decided in the coming weeks, and there are going to be some very important conversations happening beginning tomorrow when the US National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, is set to arrive here for meetings with Israeli officials.

They are reinforced with concrete, too. Two years ago, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers, more than 300 miles of them. The tunnels are spread all over Gaza -- this map, over two years old.

Now, it's not without its risks. There could be hostages in those tunnels. There are very few details about how precisely the water is getting into the tunnels, how much water, how fast it's going in, or what you do if you suddenly discover you're flooding hostages other than the IDF say they have begun carefully testing it, and that this method is being trialed on a limited, limited basis.",

They believe that we do not need to see any material weakness in the labor market in 2024. That is what some refer to as a soft landing. I think we certainly agree in the sense that there is room for them to cut in the back half of next year. But something has to give. I think the soft landing narrative is a bit naive. It is overly optimistic. And I think the Federal Reserve has to watch a feeding animal spirit too much in a desire to cut rates too soon.",

This is not the first time he had suggested, hold your horses, in some respects. They are still data dependent. That will be the case into next year, data dependency. Watch the data and we see how it goes. We will cut as much as we can but not too much, to your point.",

We have entered a higher interest rate world.You can still have central banks such as the Fed easing in 2024. But this is a clear positive for investors. I think the market, at times, can favor too much, desire too much near-term movements. But a longer term, we have entered a higher interest rate world. I think the Federal Reserve has to keep an eye on the labor market. I'm not saying that they aren't but they made a mistake over 50 years ago of cutting rates too early. It was one of the few times in U.S. history where we had a so-called soft landing. 1967. Unfortunately, 1.5 years later, they were raising rates aggressively because the labor market resurged and the recession came back. That is not our base on expectations. But when I start to see the market's reaction today, I start to wonder.",

It wasn'tthat long ago when all the world -- we were facing near zero interest rates. So the compound effect in your portfolio, with rates maintaining above the rate of inflation, as you mentioned, that will continue to be a positive force going forward. We are going to have ups and downs in the business cycle. But if we look back 10 years from now, back 10 years, I think we should be really pleasantly surprised by the change in trajectory for investors.",

As you said, they are focused on the labor market, not inflation. But when you know that significant of a portion of Americans own stocks, you still have to factor in asset prices beyond the traditional, which I think would've been housing, of course, into what happens when you make these moves. Does it put the bias more on protecting that, perhaps, than being willing to risk a recession? And therefore, perhaps, you'd cut more quickly than you otherwise might have done?",

I respectfully worry sometimes about central bankersreacting too quickly to financial conditions. Central banking is a really tough job. That said, I would look less at the computer screen in terms of the S&amp;P 500 and more on the economic fundamentals. Again, I think we go into next year with a labor market that is downshifting. But I have one eye on what happened over 50 years ago. You have to normalize. If not, we are back in the same mess we were a year ago. Different, somewhat, but nevertheless that tension. So I think it is steady as she goes in the near term for the Fed. We have not seen enough evidence, one way or the other, to start cutting.",
