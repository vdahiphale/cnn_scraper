Crossings have reopened partially to and from the Gaza Strip, and fuel trucks have been going in and been able to start replenishing their power stations.Fishing is also kind of reopening gradually, and Israel says that it will keep assessing the situation as it gradually reopens back to the way things were beforehand. But for now, the ceasefire is holding. It was a bit touch and go at the beginning. It was meant to come into effect at 10:00 p.m. local time. But Islamic Jihad militants continue to fire rockets for just over an hour more. And there were still Israeli airstrikes taking place up until about midnight. So now, for the past 12 hours, though, things have been calm and quiet, both for the people of Gaza and especially for the -- also for the Israeli communities in the area surrounding the Gaza Strip, who've pretty much been in lockdown in bomb shelters for the past five days. The result of these five days of hostilities, more than 1200 rockets fired by militants of Islamic Jihad towards Israel. Israel said it struck more than 370 targets, 33 Palestinians killed, including militants, as well as uninvolved civilians such as women and children. And there were two killed inside Israel as well. Of course, the big question is, will this continue to hold? Well, Israel has already said that quiet will be met with quiet, adding that if Israel is attacked or threatened, it will continue to do everything it needs to do to defend itself. Islamic Jihad and other militant factions, meanwhile, have said that this round of fighting is over, but the will to fight has not receded. And I don't think anyone is under any illusions that there will not be another flare up at some point in time. But for now, this ceasefire that was brokered by Egypt, which was thanked both by the Israeli side and by the militants of Islamic Jihad, this ceasefire is holding. And all eyes now, I suppose, are on this week's flag march through Jerusalem, including the eastern parts of Jerusalem, which Israelis celebrate as a reunification of Jerusalem and which has a tendency to result in violence and has indeed spilled over into flare ups with Gaza. That perhaps seems less likely now, but we're still watching very carefully to see what happens this coming Thursday. Kim.",

      "sentences": "Hi there, Kim. Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right. I think it is a very important symbol for both countries, both for the Germans as well as for the Ukrainians as well. For the Germans, obviously, because, you know, at the beginning of Russia's full-on invasion of Ukraine, they were seen as one of the countries who were sort of putting the brakes on military aid towards Ukraine. A lot of people felt that, especially Olaf Scholz, this chancellor himself, was moving too slow in providing some of that military aid.But Germany over the past couple of months has actually become one of the largest donors of military aid. And I think, you know, us seeing that very large military aid package being weighed through by the Germans just in the days running up to this visit is certainly something that is of huge significance. You're talking about EUR2.7 billion, that's about $3 billion in equipment. And some of that is extremely important and very modern equipment at that. You're talking about the IRIS-T air defense system, for instance. Main battle tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, some of the most modern Howitzers in the world. So Germany certainly plays a key role in that. You can see that the country has come a long way from being one of those who is maybe a little bit subdued in helping to the Ukrainians, to one that is really on the forefront, the Ukrainians themselves are now saying, of providing military aid. And of course, on top of that, one has to say Germany is one of the countries, at least in Europe, that produces the most military equipment that the Ukrainians really need. So for Volodymyr Zelenskyy to have that already, to know that there is going to be this big military aid package that is coming, is certainly something that is of huge importance to him. But there's another element also, and we're waiting right now here, by the way, Kim in the next couple of minutes, we expect a press conference from both Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz. But the second part of this day, I think, is also extremely important to the Ukrainians as well, when Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian President, will be awarded the Charlemagne Prize. And I was looking at the reasoning that the committee there was giving, and they were saying that the reason is that Ukraine is defending the values of Europe, not just its own sovereignty, but also the values of Europe and the European Union. And of course, one of the things that the Ukrainians have been wanting for a very long time and have been eyeing is membership in the European Union, membership in NATO as well. So certainly receiving that award will be something that is very important as a sort of stepping stone on that way. It might be symbolic, but it is definitely Europe acknowledging that they believe that the Ukrainians are defending the values of a united Europe. Kim.",

The whole system still holding on to some warm water there in the Bay of Bengal. About a degree, to a degree and a half degree Celsius, warmer than what it typically should be. So that was the fuel for the system now hitting the land, falling apart. Also, some drier air moving across Pakistan, parts of India and into the center of the storm helped to kind of dilute it a bit on the left- hand side. But notice all that deep blue, that's the moisture that kicked in, in that warm ocean water. As it pushes inland, again, the friction of the land within the next 24 to 36 hours really weakens the system to an area of low pressure. Regardless, strong winds still a problem. Now, the strongest have moved through this morning as that wall, eye wall, pushed on shore. Still holding on to some extreme wind gusts this morning -- in the afternoon, rather. And then, of course, the winds will weaken as we move into Monday and Tuesday. Heavy rain also another big problem. We've been dealing with it already with the outer bands and now that eye wall coming onto shore. This heavy rain is an ongoing situation through Sunday night and into Monday, then finally starting to weaken a bit by Tuesday. Scattered showers. But showers nonetheless on already saturated grounds. Torrential downfall, that's what we can expect with this rain. And you'll notice the reds, the deep reds. That's about 150 rain within the next five days. Isolated higher amounts are a possibility as well. Nearly about 250 next five days' time. And keep this in mind too. Notice the cone.

That's according to at least one senior CBP official. Of course referring to Customs and Border Protection was cited in a recently filed court document that says the 10-day average of migrant encounters currently stands at about 9000, which is well below what was expected.However, there is some concern and some projections that suggest that that number could go up to as many as 14,000 in the coming days or weeks. There is a number though, that is critically high here and that is the daily custody average, which is the total number of migrants that are in the custody of Customs and Border Protection. That number still stands at about 23,000. So this -- what you can perhaps call a temporary respite is allowing them opportunities to process those individuals to make room for others who may possibly choose to enter the country illegally. Now, there is some speculation here on the ground when you speak to some of those who are running the shelters that receive some of these migrants after their process. They seem to believe that perhaps some of the news coming from the Biden administration of the stricter policies could be making it south of the border. So you have many asylum -- potential asylum seekers just south of the border that are still weighing their options. There are, of course, those numbers that are likely to continue to grow, and that is the number of asylum seekers ending up in some of America's largest cities. Of course, many of them here in El Paso telling me that they are wanting to go to California, some wanting to stay in Texas.

Where people have watched their life savings pretty much lose value as the Turkish lira plummeted over the past couple of years, losing much of its value, the cost of living that has gone up with inflation that people can't keep up with.

      "sentences": "Well, to a certain extent, I think many people can relate to both sides of this issue because we're talking about two very complicated issues. One is immigration. And the other one is the lack of affordable housing that we see all across the country. So what we're seeing, for example, in Upstate New York, when some counties are trying to say that when they're trying basically to bar migrants or asylum seekers from coming to their counties or being resettled there legally, that's a very unsound approach because migrants, just like everyone else, they do have certain constitutional rights. What of them being equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. That means they can't be discriminated against in terms of where they live. So if you're looking at -- if your local community town seeking to barpeople in terms of their status as a member of a group, that really is not going to hold up in court. I think a better approach maybe would be in terms of being successful in these type of lawsuits, would be localities that focus, say, on their zoning laws or focus on whether or not a local motel or hotel can be used for long term housing. You know, it's a question of, how they target these laws versus how they are going to ultimately hold up in court.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. Those are two of the issues that are really in play here. One is just the lack of coordination. Some of these local communities say they're not fully informed about how many migrants are coming, for how long they will be coming, what the situation is will be for them long-term.And the other one is I wouldn't say necessarily xenophobia, but I would say definitely a lack of information or misinformation because I think many people might be afraid, depending on what they have heard in the media, that people might be coming who are potentially criminals or some type of lower elements. What I don't think many people realize is that migrants who have gone through processing at the border have been screened by the federal government. They have been vetted by Homeland Security before they're allowed into the country. So we are not looking at least based on people's prior records at, say, you know, people with violent history or criminal records being resettled in local towns. So it is a lack of communication information in play here.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, and then competition for resources as well. I mean, looking at the case of Chicago where the proposal was to open a center in the city South Side, it's not the case of, you know, a privileged group not wanting the migrants there. It's an underserved community feeling as though the migrants are kind of being dumped into an area that's under resourced as it is. Is that a fair defense?",

      "sentences": "Right, right, absolutely. Because, well, it is -- when we look at the bigger picture, it's natural that many of these migrants would choose to go to large American cities because that's where they have friends, they have relatives, they have potential support networks. But these countries that are -- these cities excuse me, that are receiving migrants, they are far from -- they are not ideal situations themselves because most major American cities, there are serious problems with homelessness, with affordable housing, and the city budgets are already strained. So, like I said, we're mixing two very serious problems. That's not to say I think there are potential solutions. I'm just not sure if they're politically viable. One of the solutions that has struck me was a proposal by Senator Bob Menendez from New Jersey, who has proposed to the administration that they potentially match up certain migrants, potentially, with states that have labor shortages. I mean, we're a country with, I think, 3.4% unemployment. We have 9 million available jobs. So I think there is a question of coordinating where we might potentially place migrants and which types of communities are ready, able, and willing to receive them. So it doesn't create this type of controversy and so it doesn't hit different communities and constituencies against each other.",
