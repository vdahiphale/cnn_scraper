This could have huge significance for stability in the region, huge. Both Hamas and Iran have promised harsh retaliation. Israel has not commented directly, but moments ago, the defense minister said the nation is, quote, prepared for all possibilities.We want to get right to Jeremy Diamond.

      "sentences": "Well, John, I'm joining you from a region that is very much on edge, unclear exactly what will follow. But it is clear that this assassination overnight of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's political leader, is going to reverberate throughout this region, having enormous implications for the stability of this region. Iranian state media reporting that it was an airborne guided projectile that killed Hamas's political leader while he was staying in the Iranian capital. This happened around 2But Haniyeh, of course, was Hamas's political leader. He was viewed as having a role in directing Hamas's attacks and its activities over the course of the last several months. And Israeli political leaders have made clear for months now that they would strike at any Hamas leader that they viewed as responsible for October 7th, and now doing so in extraordinary fashion, showing that they were capable of striking Haniyeh even within Iran. Now, we should note that Israeli officials have neither confirmed nor denied their activity, their involvement in this assassination, which is pretty much standard protocol for them. This will also have implications for those ongoing ceasefire negotiations. Because Haniyeh was one of the key interlocutors with Hamas -- with the mediators in these ongoing negotiations, his departure will certainly reverberate on those talks as well. But now, of course, we are waiting to see, how Iran will respond, if Iran will respond, or if their response will come instead from Hamas or from Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy in the region. As we have seen over the course of the last 24 hours, not only was Haniyeh assassinated in Tehran, but a senior Hezbollah commander was also killed in Beirut in an Israeli strike that the Israeli military has indeed acknowledged. And both of those strikes are certainly putting this region even more on edge than it already was, and as we are waiting here in northern Israel to see what, if any, response there will be. John?",

Back then, they didn't give the U.S. a heads-up either. And the reaction then from Iran, you'll remember on April 13th, was this massive barrage of drones and missiles fired at Israel that the U.S. helped defend against along with other countries. This strike against Haniyeh was arguably more provocative. It was in Tehran. It was following the inauguration of the new president. This was a special guest for the Iranians. The Iranians are going to be furious about this. They can respond in a number of ways, not just themselves, but proxies all across the region. And of course, John, that doesn't only implicate Israel. It could also have severe consequences for the U.S., of course, which has a military presence all across the region. So now we are seeing threats from the Iranians, the IRGC promising what they're calling a harsh and a painful response.

He has been the guy at the table for Hamas during the ceasefire negotiations, which up until today looked like they were going relatively well. We'd been hearing from U.S. officials that they were as close as they have been in months to a possible deal. Over the weekend, we saw a new round of meetings in Rome that was attended by the CIA Director Bill Burns as well as the head of Mossad, David Barnea, and the Qatari prime minister.These talks, if they aren't scuttled altogether, are certainly on ice. Haniyeh was the guy doing the negotiating. Of course, Yahya Sinwar, the head of Hamas in Gaza, he's the ultimate decision-maker. But it was Haniyeh who was transmitting those decisions, who was doing the negotiating with their direct counterparts, the Egyptians and the Qataris. We have an angry reaction this morning from the Qatari prime minister also at that table who says, how can mediation succeeds when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side? So this certainly puts a halt to these conversations for now. There is, of course, the possibility that there is so much concern here in Washington that there could be an immense amount of pressure put on Israel to actually agree to this ceasefire. But that remains to be seen. Certainly, this is not helping those ceasefire negotiations to say the least, John.",
