TheSupreme Court upholds a law barring domestic abusers from possessing guns, what it means, and what's next. Also ahead, record-breaking heat turns deadly as millions attend a religious pilgrimage. And later, swimmer Lilly King's new ring, the Olympic-sized surprise you've got to see. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Gologryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Well, for days, we have been waiting for several major rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court, and just a short time ago, we got one of them. The court gave a victory to gun control advocates. In an eight-to-one decision, the justices upheld a federal law that bans domestic abusers from owning a gun. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, \"America's tradition of gun laws confirms what common sense suggests. When an individual possesses a clear threat of physical violence to another, the threatening individual may be disarmed.\" Let's bring in CNN's justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider, for more on this decision. It may be common sense, though, Jessica, there's concern that we could see another decision from this court that would expand Second Amendment rights. This is quite the opposite and done nearly unanimously.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you know, it is very surprising, the Supreme Court really giving gun control advocates this wintoday. It was an eight-one opinion, and the justices did uphold this gun regulation that prohibits people who are subject to these domestic violence restraining orders. It bans them from owning guns, and that law will stand under this Supreme Court decision. This was written by the Chief Justice John Roberts. It was just Justice Clarence Thomas who was in the dissent, the lone dissenter. And, of course, it was Justice Thomas who wrote the decision two years ago, giving that broad power to own guns in the decision known as Bruin. But the chief justice today, you quoted him off the top. I'll read one more. He said, \"Our tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others.\" And that was the crux of this case, that if you're prone to violence, you can have your right to possess a gun taken away. There has been considerable confusion in the lower courts for the past two years after that Bruin decision was written by Justice Thomas in 2022, because the Supreme Court at that time said that in order for a gun law to be upheld, there needed to be some similar precedent in place in the late 1700s at the time of the nation's founding. But today, the Chief Justice John Roberts, he stressed that while the Second Amendment, sure, the right to own guns, it is broad but not unlimited. That was in this opinion today. And the chief justice writing the opinion, it makes sense that guns should be prohibited for people who are subject to violence. And that's exactly what this federal law that was upheld does. It keeps guns out of the hands of people that courts have deemed to be a credible threat when it comes to domestic violence. So, Bianna, this decision handing a win to gun control advocates -- but one thing it might not do, it might not completely clear up the confusion for lower courts, because the lower court in this case said, there's not a historical precedent to a law just like this. That's why we're going to strike it down. That's what the lower court did, the Supreme Court obviously reversing that decision today. But there still is a lot of question for the judges in these lower courts about what they should be doing when there are challenges to various gun laws that have been put in place for the past many years and whether or not they comport with historical precedent. So, it's likely that we will see other challenges to gun laws before the Supreme Court, and this isn't the final word despite the fact that this federal law was upheld today. Bianna.",

Look, our Constitution,although it's a piece of paper and one that was created and formulated hundreds of years ago, it gets to evolve by judges interpreting what was meant, and judges do what lawyers do, as well. We focus on words, and we focus on context, and we focus on, in this case, the judges did, what did they mean when they enabled people to have firearms. And way back then, was there the same type of concern and restriction on certain types of people, and that's what the opinion said today. However, every case is different based on the facts. The New York case was different. It dealt with possessing a gun outside of your home. It didn't deal necessarily with a person who had a prior conviction or who was subject to a restraining order in a domestic violence case, so the judges and lawyers focus on the facts of each case. So, depending on the facts of the next case, they may come up with a different opinion, and they may say no precedent doesn't support this the way it did in the recent decision that we just handed down in 2024.",

So, she's going to be hearing hours of arguments over this. Right now, the court is in a lunch break. There are colleagues down there of ours in Florida watching this hearing where there are no phones or electronics in the courtroom. So far, what we understand is that Judge Cannon had many questions but hasn't really shown her hand on where she's leaning on this. Many other judges across the country have already looked at this issue and said, the special counsel does have this authority, let's move along to trial. But Judge Cannon, not only does she want to be hearing the arguments from the prosecutors and the defense team over the special counsel, she also is wanting to hear arguments from people not even involved in this case, third parties, basically law professors that have additional opinions about the law that they want to show to her. So, that's what is going to be happening after lunch. Those people are going to be arguing in this case in Judge Cannon's courtroom. Donald Trump isn't there himself, but his lawyers certainly are, as are the special counsel's office prosecutors. And then all of this is going to continue into Monday, as well, a very unusual hearing where Judge Cannon is taking a lot of time both in court and just letting days and weeks go by before she even gets to rule on these issues.

And so they essentially spend these months indoors, sheltering from the extreme heat. What's happening in Saudi Arabia right now is even hotter than it normally is, as Derek explained right there. The problem, though, is that when the Hajj takes place is determined by the Islamic calendar. And it just so happens that this year, it's in June, one of the hottest months of the year already. It is also an event that is almost entirely outdoors. There is a large physical component to it, walking between sites. And so, there's really no way to escape being out in those elements if you're one of these pilgrims, some of whom have spent their entire life savings trying to attend this throughout the course of their lives, because that is one of the duties. It is the obligation of every Muslim if they have the financial and the physical ability to do it. But we are talking about a situation where, look, the overnight lows even are in the 30 degrees Celsius. So, there's absolutely no escape from this. And you mentioned the numbers already continuing to climb. There are some estimates that suggest that the real number could be over a thousand right now. And the reason why it may continue to climb is because, A, some people are still in the hospital, Bianna. Some people are unaccounted for. And also some countries have only officially counted the official Hajj pilgrims. What do I mean by official? Well, Saudi Arabia, because of overcrowding events in the past, like, say, a few years ago when there was that stampede incident killing more than 2000 people, have tried to limit the number of people coming in for this annual pilgrimage by putting caps on each country's pilgrims that come in or putting caps on the numbers. The difficulty, though, is Saudi Arabia has opened itself up in recent years. And so, you can get there on a tourist visa or a work visa. And it seems like a lot of these sort of unofficial pilgrims are among those who have died, some of whom are staying in substandard accommodation. The official pilgrims are staying in air-conditioned tents. These ones obviously are not. They also may not have the luxury of having some transportation help between some of these sites, Bianna.",

Nine minutes ofpurported drone footage released by Hezbollah showing civilian and military sites, some 30 kilometers into Israeli territory. It reached as far as Haifa port, arguably one of Israel's most important economic lifelines. Now, reaction inside Israel was naturally fierce. The government reminded Hezbollah it would be destroyed in a, quote, \"all-out war\", with the cabinet announcing that it had approved, in principle, plans for an offensive in Lebanon, though putting plans into action is another story. [12:25:02[ Never one to sit back quietly, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah weighed in with his own televised speech, boasting the group's growing capabilities and even taking a dig at the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, making threats that if it aids Israel in a potential conflict, it will be attacked. Now, this is what you need to know. The Center for Strategic and International Studies calls Hezbollah the most heavily armed non-state military in the world. Most estimates put it at having around 45,000 to 100,000 soldiers and upwards of 150,000 short, medium, and long-range rockets. For months, we've been reporting on flare-ups along the Lebanese border and the specter of a wider regional war. While both sides may want to avoid that, the reality is that in these situations, things can break loose from one single miscalculation. The longer this goes back and forth, the more likely that becomes. And this brings us to our Exchange. We want to take a closer look at these specific issues.

And, Bob, speaking to Israeli officials, this may be one of the first times where the majority of the focus in the past eight months does appear in the north as opposed to the ongoing war in Gaza. Right now, we should remind viewers that Hezbollah began launching rockets into Israel on October 8th, so there has been sort of a low simmering back and forth between these two sides that has only escalated. I'm wondering, from your perspective, does Hezbollah see an opening now, as perhaps Hamas did leading into October 7th, in a vulnerability that was internally within Israel over the judicial reforms, this with the United States over aid?",

You saw the President this morning comeout with a statement saying this is part of his decades of work in preventing gun violence, not just the bipartisan gun safety legislation that we saw back in 22 after the Uvalde shootings, but also his work on the Violence Against Women Act when he was a senator, which was first cited to law in 1994. So, this -- on the policy level, they feel this is a validation of what they are doing. But on a political level, they feel it is a boon for them, as well. Actually, just moments ago, we saw a statement via the campaign come in from Vice President Kamala Harris saying, while President Joe Biden and I are standing up to the gun lobby, Donald Trump is bowing down. They feel that on this issue, it is a good political issue for them and creates a certain contrast with Republicans and Donald Trump.",

We spoke with a lot, andrightly so, on reproductive rights issues and democracy as a whole, and the President has said many times that, like this election and previous recent elections, that democracy is on the ballot. Where does gun legislation and gun safety legislation particularly sit with voters and what's top of mind for them?",

But this month particularly, the Biden campaign has been focusing on guns as a political issue, particularly because we just marked, I believe, the eight-year anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shootings in Florida back in 2016. And guns was actually one of the issues that the Biden campaign wanted to focus on in terms of mobilizing their voters ahead of the June 27th debate, his first debate with Donald Trump. In terms of how it ranks among voters, it certainly isn't as high as, say, you know, the economy or even immigration or abortion. But they feel -- you're right. You mentioned the suburban voters, especially suburban moms. This has certainly been an incredibly mobilizing issue for that demographic in the past. And that key group of voters is a block of voters that the Biden campaign is really trying to keep in their fold, you know, come November.",

Police are investigating the alleged rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl. The prosecutor says three boys, aged 12 and 13, have been taken into custody. CNN's Melissa Bell joins us now live from Paris. Just another horrific incident of anti-Semitism which we've noted is spiking in France, really around the world, but France is home to Europe's largest Jewish population and now with these parliamentary elections coming up, there really is a divide over where they feel safer, voting for the far right which would have been unheard of years ago or the left now?",

With the far left really being spoken about a great deal in this context since one of its leaders,Jean-Luc Melenchon, recently referred to anti-Semitism in France as being something that is merely residual which led to an entire controversy of its own. But you're right, this happens in the extremely heated climate of this very divisive parliamentary election, Bianna, and at a time when we've seen the war in Gaza really exacerbate something that was already pretty prevalent in France but has only worsened. To give you an idea of some of the French Interior Ministry's figures, the number of anti-Semitic incidents in 2022 between 2022 and 2023 rose by 283 percent in a single year, Bianna, and that gives you an idea of how difficult the problem was, exacerbated now of course with all that's happened since in Gaza. And, of course, at the heart of this campaign, this particularly horrendous attack that has revived the debate and the issue of anti-Semitism and what it means to be a Jew in France. A 12-year-old girl last Saturday trying to get home, allegedly raped, in a disused building and it is the nature of the anti-Semitic slurs that are also part of this police probe that will try to get to the bottom of whether her religion was a motivation for the attack. But a horrendous attack that has drawn people to the street here in Paris these last few days and we have -- we expect more protests to come in Paris on Sunday, Bianna.",

Yes, you heard that right, $9,000. Reese's Chicago Sky are facing off against Clark's Indiana Fever for the third time this season. There is some tension in history between these two if you'll recall.  According to CBS, last Sunday's match between the two teams was the most watched WNBA game on any U.S. network in 23 years. Clark, Reese, and other high-profile players are credited with helping the league post its highest attended opening month in 26 years. Don't say people don't like to watch women's sports.
