And then, hours later, we saw both sides seeming to try and step off this ladder of escalation in which this region has been steadily climbing up over the course of the last month. Hezbollah yesterday firing hundreds of rockets and drones towards northern Israel. Air raid sirens sounding around 5The Israeli Prime Minister also saying that all of the drones that Hezbollah fired were successfully intercepted, and part of that, the Israeli military says, is because of what they call a preemptive strike that they carried out about an hour and a half before those Hezbollah rockets were fired into northern Israel, those strikes carried out by over 100 fighter jets simultaneously striking dozens of Hezbollah rocket launch sites in southern Lebanon, the Israeli military saying that that preemptive strike minimized and thwarted what would have been a much larger, much more significant attack from Hezbollah. But, for now, both sides seem to be eager to claim victory. We heard that from Hassan Nasrallah, pointing to the success of the attack, although he did leave open the possibility that future assessments could lead to additional attacks against Israel, and the Israeli military and the Israeli government calling their strike and their air defense effort an unmitigated success, with the Israeli Defense Minister saying that he believes Hezbollah has been destabilized by that preemptive strike.",

The question is, how much progress is actually being made? Because the meetings yesterday ended with the senior officials from each delegation leaving Cairo without any kind of deal in place, instead, leaving more work on the details of the implementation of a potential agreement to lower level officials who are continuing those talks in Cairo as we speak. A U.S. official said that there was good progress over the weekend, but we also saw Hamas put out a statement yesterday in which they reiterated what they've been saying over the course of the last couple of weeks, which is that they want to see a deal based off of the previous framework agreement that was reached between the two sides in early July, one that would not include some of the Israeli demands that have subsequently been made, including one of the main sticking points, and that is whether Israeli troops will remain along that Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. That's that strategic strip of land between the Israel-Gaza -- between the Gaza-Egypt border, I should say, and that remains a sticking point. So, it's very hard to see, despite the claims of progress by U.S. officials, how quickly a deal could actually be put together, and whether these talks are actually going to lead to a deal at all.

He claimed that after the initial strikes on a string of Israeli military positions along the border that their either drones or missiles were able to hit the headquarters of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, Unit 8200, which is the signals intelligence unit of the Israeli military, as well as the headquarters for Israel's missile defense. Now, the Israelis are saying none of those projectiles hit their target.So, we did hear Nasrallah say that, as we evaluate the results of our strikes, we will consider the possibility of retaliating further to the assassination on the 30th of July of Fuad Shukr, that senior Hezbollah commander. At the same time, he did send a message. He said, redressing the people of Lebanon after a month of being very much on edge, he said, you can take a breath and now relax. So, it does appear that Hezbollah has stepped back. It's significant that Israel focused its strikes along the border, a knot deep inside Lebanon, where Hezbollah is actually keeping its heavier weapons, its long-range precision missiles, which it did not apparently use in this yesterday morning strikes. Having said all that, what we're seeing is a resumption of the daily back and forth of fire between Israel and Hezbollah, limited largely to the border area. So far today, we've counted five Israeli strikes on Lebanon. One of them appears to be a failed attempt to kill a local Hamas leader in the city of Sidon. In addition, there was a series of artillery barrages on three towns in the western sector. The problems remain. There are still hundreds -- more than 100,000 Lebanese civilians who have left their homes on this side of the border, more than 60,000 Israelis who have left their homes. The fighting continues. Everything hinges on a ceasefire in Gaza. Hezbollah has made it clear that if the war in Gaza stops, Hezbollah will stop firing on Israel. Rahel.",

The incident has marked the country's deadliest day of militant activity so far this year. The Telegram messaging app platform says that its CEO has nothing to hide. Pavel Durov was detained at an airport outside Paris Saturday on a French arrest warrant. CNN's French affiliate reports that the warrants alleges a lack of moderation has let Telegram become a platform for criminal activities by users. Durov is a 39-year-old French and Russian citizen. Authorities in the U.S. state of Alaska report that one person has died and three others were wounded after a landslide. Homes, businesses and roads were also damaged in a coastal city along Alaska's so-called southern passage. Residents are now keeping a close watch because officials warned that another landslide could strike nearby. And to Italy now, the captain of the luxury yacht that sank off the coast of Sicily is now facing manslaughter charges. Six people were killed when the sailing boat capsized during a storm last week.

Alayna, thank you.Let's bring our panel to discuss this further. We have Toluse Olorunnipa. He is the White House Bureau Chief at The Washington Post, and Tia Mitchell, who is the Washington Correspondent for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Good to see you both. Tia, let me start with you, this post from Trump questioning why he would even do a debate on ABC News. We can pull it up for our viewers at home. It seems hard to see the upside of him not debating with the dynamics changing in the race. I mean, what do you think here? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yeah. I think both campaigns need to be at the debate. Kamala Harris, of course, needs to show that she is willing to answer questions and not be so scripted. Donald Trump has to show that he is not scared of Kamala Harris, and that it wasn't just that he was able to have a relatively good debate against the diminished Joe Biden, but that he can have a relatively good night against a strong opponent, the way Kamala Harris is perceived. So, I would think both campaigns want to work it out for their own reasons to show up on September 10.",

They're looking at what would be best in a traditional political campaign, and then they're looking at President -- former President Trump, who often does the opposite of what people would advise you to do in a presidential campaign. And Trump always has had this instinct to want to do things his own way. And one of the things that his advisors want to happen is that he would be more presidential at the debate. He would not be talking over Kamala Harris. He would not be interjecting and saying things when he was not supposed to be speaking, like he did during the first debate against Joe Biden in 2020 which he was widely viewed as losing.And so, his advisors are seen as wanting him to not be having a live mic and be more muted so he could see more presidential, and he is saying he would rather have the mics on so he could do things his own way. And so, there is that dichotomy between himself and his advisors, something that goes back to the very beginning of when he first started running in 2016.",

She has had a pretty seamless rollout of her campaign over the last month and a few days, but most of those public events that she has done have been on message, on script, on teleprompter. She hasn't had a lot of long exchanges with journalists. Every once in a while, she does a gaggle where she takes short questions, but she hasn't had the kind of long, detailed, policy-driven exchange with a journalist, or off script town hall kind of event where she has had to lay out her policies. And she has had a lot of changes over the last five years, between where she was when she ran for President in 2019 and when she is running this time.And so, she is going to be asked a lot of those kinds of questions in an interview space. And so, who she decides to go with, who she decides to speak to, how long the interview will take place, what format it's going to be in, that is going to be a very important decision that she makes. And it's also important prep for her debate, because when she gets to the debate stage in September, she is going to need to be able to think on her feet, and she is not going to have a teleprompter. She is not going to have notes. She is going to need to be able to answer some of those questions.

I'm not sure that's going to happen. There may be some type of compromise where it's Kemp and perhaps a J.D. Vance on the stage in Georgia.

That has shifted with Harris now being at the top of the ticket. But, that being said, we know that black men, comparatively to -- compared to black women, quite frankly, are more likely to vote Republican and are more likely to support Donald Trump specifically.Now, do I think it's going to be a huge fraction of black men? No. But, in a swing state like Georgia, where every vote counts, if Trump is able to increase his support among black men, just marginally, could make a difference. So, what Harris has to do is what she has been doing, a, she has been able to speak to black voters, younger voters, in a way that Biden wasn't. She also is dispatching some black male surrogates. Think about Senator Warnock. Think about Governor Wes Moore. Think about Senator Cory Booker, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens.
