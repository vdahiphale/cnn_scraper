      "sentences": "Thank you very much. Let's do it right now. Let's start the show.Well, first of all, it is May 25. Four years ago today, George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. He was 46 years old. And if I now you've seen the video, then Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his back and neck for more than nine minutes. As Floyd repeated, I can't breathe. Well, that video touched off something in this country and the big cities across the U.S. and around the world tens of thousands of people at a time demanded an end to police violence against black people. Even in small towns where there really aren't many black people, people march with signs that affirm Black Lives Matter. And before I go any further, this narrative that these were rampages destroying American cities, yes, there was some arson, some looting and vandalism at some protests. But by the end of June 2020 96.3% of the 7,305 demonstrations involve no injuries, no property damage. That's according to a group that studies marches and protests. So we've now settled that. But the summer after Floyd's death was branded as a racial reckoning in America. Was it? And we certainly saw a lot of performances. Remember these? This was blackout Tuesday. People posted black squares on social media. This was in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement record companies that they said, we're about to release any new music. Aunt Jemima came off the pancake box. Uncle Ben became Ben's original. Eskimo Pie is now Edy's Pie. All long overdue, but that was not the point. Some Confederate statues they came down though not without a fight. Cities painted black lives matter down the middle of the street. That was not the point either. The point of the movement was to end police violence and disproportionate use of force against black people. But it didn't. Four years since George Floyd's murder, use of lethal force still plagues American cities. According to the ACLU, police killed at least 1,247 people in 2023, more than any previous year on record. And so far this year, there have been only nine days in which police did not kill someone. The movement called for a change in how police officers are trained and how they're held accountable. But the George Floyd justice and policing act is still not a reality. It was reintroduced in the House this week, where it will likely die again. So four years and where are we? Joining me now is George Floyd's brother Terrence Floyd. Terrence, good to see you. I want to start though with your brother, you didn't lose an icon. You didn't lose a catalyst. You lost a loved one. You lost a brother. So on this day, what goes through your mind goes through your heart. TERRENCE FLOYD, GEORGE FLOYD'S YOUNGER BROTHER: Of course, of course, I remember the May 25, 2020. But also I remember my brother as he was, you know, Gentle Giant is where we used to call them, you know, because he was a big guy, but he was loving. He was compassionate. He loved the community that he was in. He loved the community that he was from, which was Houston. I just miss him, you know, and that's basically what I'm feeling right now.",

The AI personas were generated at random and not with the intention of misrepresentation. This AI- randomization was to ensure an unbiased approach. And we're continuously refining our approach to better serve our communities and uphold ethical standards of journalism.I mean, we're all kind of dealing with what AI means for the industry. But I guess if we were on the other side of this, and all of the -- there's no diverse representation, would we be talking about a whitewash of AI and eliminating voices of color from newsrooms without the diverse names? What do you think?",

Once you start diving into them, it doesn't actually seem like a human voice in there. And that's the most important part of journalism. It is just people talking to people at the end of the day, and so when not humanity is eliminated. I think there's a real problem with AI going too far.",

Sahana Ramesh was taken to the hospital in 2020 because she was suffering from recurring seizures. She was 16 years old.But her parents say she had a severe allergic reaction to the anti- seizure medication she was prescribed. They say it caused rashes over her body and impacted her organs. According to their lawsuit, the family tried to get Sahana medical treatment more than a dozen times over three months. The family says that their concerns were downplayed and their daughter died after months of suffering. With me now are Sahana's parents, Nalini and Anapathur Ramesh and their attorney Steve Berman, thank you all for being with me. And of course our condolences on the loss of your daughter. Anapathur, let me start with you. And you detail in this lawsuit just how much pain Sahana was in and you went to the hospital hoping she would be admitted they did not admit her What did they tell you why they wouldn't give her the care you believe she deserved?

Because we can't read that -- we did this too -- looks complicated. So that's when we went to Seattle Children's ER first time, we went separately, and then the ambulance took her from one hospital to another. And in the Seattle Children's, when we went there, they we went there-- the only the only examining her and we thought is going to be like that night that might be going to be staying. Even for the other hospital ER, folks, so then we at the end of that, ER, there's no, it's okay, here's some, you know, there's a skin rash. It's called DRESS, didn't say dress at the time, but they said it's due to allergy and say they gave some cream and medication to apply. And said, I kept asking, is there any life threatening or not, but they didn't -- they should also carry on that Senator Sanders call.",

So we trusted them.And you know, time and again, my mother from India would ask is her life in danger many times. So each time we went almost we said is her likely asked, is her life in danger? They said no. But unbeknownst to us last year, during the deposition, we found out that they -- in their internal notes had written that this is a life threatening situation and she could die and there could be multi-organ impact. Now, we didn't know that. If we had known that we would have requested. We would have asked them. We asked them even at one point if she needed to be admitted. But they said no. Because it wasn't serious. I asked for help many times. We didn't know this was a life threatening situation. Otherwise, we would have either taken her elsewhere, or we would have, you know, pushed for more care. We didn't know at all.",
