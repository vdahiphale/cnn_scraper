Look at this text message that he sent to Donald Trump's top attorney in Wisconsin, Jim Troupis. He said to Jim, \"Jim, can you ascend my December 6th memo to Trump lawyer Justin Clark. Messaging on January 6th being the real date is key.\" Focusing on January 6th. Then Jim Troupis, the Trump attorney, responded, \"I have sent it to the White House this afternoon. They are the real decision-makers.\"We didn't know that they had sent these materials to the White House. Very notable there, although to be totally transparent, they did not say who exactly at the White House got these materials. But it's important, Sara, because just a few weeks later, the Trump campaign carried that plan out. In seven states across the country, the fake electors voted and they hoped that on January 6th Mike Pence would recognize the Republican electors and throw out Joe Biden's real electors. January 6th, who was in the crowd outside of the Capitol, none other than Ken Chesebro himself. We've known this before, but we've never seen these pictures. Selfies that he took that day. There's one of him outside of the Washington Monument, which you're seeing there. And this one here, Chesebro in the red hat. That's Alex Jones behind him, the far right conspiracy theorist. So, he was outside the Capitol that day, breached restricted grounds. He even texted someone saying that he smelt a whiff of the tear gas that day. But even after all that, Sara, he kept pushing to overturn the election. Here's a text message from two days after the insurrection, January 8, 2021, where he texted that Trump lawyer, Jim Troupis, saying that \"the events of the last two days open up legal options in the states for winning rulings favorable to Trump.\" He thought that somehow they could capitalize on what happened to still push to their efforts to overturn the election even after January 6th.

He thought, this is a guy who I'm going to contend with in 2020, but then normalcy will be restored. That was kind of at the core of his thinking about this country. He's come to terms with the fact that actually Trump represents aphase in American life, and it is completely entwined with Joe Biden's life in a way he never could have imagined. After all, he's been in politics 51 years, been in Washington, and it never occurred to him that his legacy, his biggest bet on himself, would be intwined with this man. And I think for that reason, John, it's very personal for him to show that, in fact, his vision of the country is the right vision, the dominant vision, and that Trump's is an aberration. It's a strange detour from who we are as people. He said this line in a speech that I attended not long ago where he said, the question is not, who is Donald Trump. We know who he is.

The one who figures out, how do we take Bidenism as a concept and put it into language. Mike Donilon had been a huge supporter of Joe Biden running for president in 2016. Really believed it was a good idea back when it was the end of the vice presidency. At the end, though, after the death of his son Beau, it was Mike who said, look, I can see it on your face, this is not a good idea. And, of course, Joe Biden did not run that year.There are some people around him who he does -- he really listened to.
