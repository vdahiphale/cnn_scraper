There are legitimate concerns with the classified documents case, because there are procedures that both parties need to go through to deal with the classified materials. These materials, though that are relevant to this case are not so burdensome, as to require months and months of review, but it does take a little bit longer than most cases. So if they were to make an argument that it should stretch into next year before the trial begins, that would be a much more colorable and reasonable argument. This is not a reasonable argument.",

No, of course not. The DOJ regulations stipulate that a sitting president cannot be indicted because of a variety of reasons related to the importance of that job. A candidate for president does not have a job that is any more important than anyone else in America, and he is not above the law as a candidate, nor is any candidate for elected office, and he must sit trial as any other American citizen would.

Contrary to his public statements, he hasn't been charged simply with lying to the federal government. He's been charged with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. He's been charged with acting as an illicit arms broker between countries like China and Iran and other countries. So these are very serious offenses. It's also clear from the statements from the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, they have, in some form, his communications. They have quoted things that he said to people and referring to arms as toys and things like that, which means this is a very complicated, probably long running investigation in which they either had access to his historical communications through court authorized access, or potentially even Title 3 coverage electronic surveillance of his communication. So this is not just a simple case that the government cooked up after they interviewed him and didn't like what they said. This is likely the result of a very long and complicated investigation.",

The police advantages, of course, are pretty obvious. They've got over 200 officers on the hunt. They've got helicopters, they've got DNA technology that they're using. They've got other assets that they're not really telling us much about.So they've got those things to their advantage. But Michael Burham has some serious advantages of his own. Number one, he apparently had a plan, according to police of -- that he wanted to get into the woods. He had a plan to get into the woods even before he escaped. So he was planning this out. Number two, they strongly believe that people are helping him. So possibly at these campsites where they might have found some traces of where he was, people might have left things for him and maybe they're laying out other areas for him to go to. Another advantage that he has is that he's a survivalist. He's trained himself on how to deal with these conditions out in these woods. Another advantage, Anderson, that he's got is that the Allegheny National Forest, just adjacent to where we are, is about 800 square miles. If he knows that area fairly well, and we don't have any reason to believe that he doesn't, that's a serious advantage that he has. And he's already been gone for five days, Anderson. One thing we do have to say is that the police are asking people with information about Michael Burham, if you have seen him or maybe have talked to people who've seen him, to call their command post. Here's the number 717-265-9650. That's the command post near where we are in Warren, Pennsylvania. They are relying on a lot of help from the public.",

So that may lead -- lend some credence to the fact the sheriff saying that they were hot on his trail when he -- shortly after he escaped.
