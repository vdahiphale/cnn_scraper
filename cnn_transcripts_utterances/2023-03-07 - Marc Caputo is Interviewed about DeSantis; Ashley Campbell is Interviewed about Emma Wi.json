      "sentences": "I'm expecting the Florida lawmaking session to look like one giant rubber stamp. And it normally isn't like this for governors. But Ron DeSantis is a governor like no other that we've seen in the state. He is incredibly popular with the Republican base. More so if you look at Republican polling than Donald Trump in Florida. And the Republican legislators, who control the legislature, know this. And in addition to that, they have more than a two-thirds majority. So, Democrats basically don't matter. And if you have more than a two-thirds majority in the legislative body, you can just steamroll the opposition.And lawmakers explicitly and in some cases implicitly admit like, look, this is a session to further Ron DeSantis' ambitions and they're there to make it happen. So, anything he wants, he's probably going to get. And the real question is, what's he really going to want, what's he really going to get, and to what degree, if he runs for president, is it going to help him against Donald Trump again if he does. And then if somehow he wins, to what degree is he going to be overextended in running against Joe Biden, who still has not decided to announce his bid for presidency or re-election but probably will very soon.",

But a lot of them have basically been purged. If you're a Republican lawmaker, if you're a Republican official, say with a Democratic one, part of your job is to get re-elected. Opposing Ron DeSantis has made quite clear is a pathway to irrelevancy, at least in the Florida Republican Party. So, they're there to kind of boost him and to go along with him.And also understand this, this used to be a swing state, Florida did. This is place where Ron DeSantis, when he first ran for governor, pardon me, I almost said president, in 2018 won by less than half a percentage point. In November, he won by nearly 20 percentage points. It is an out-sized margin that we haven't seen in this state. The biggest margin that we saw for re-election of a governor was Jeb Bush in 2002 when he was at the height of his power in the immediate afterglow of 9/11 when his brother, then the president, was riding a high. Ron DeSantis blew that out of the water.",

So, as long as the mainstream news media kind of covers him in a sloppy way, gets its facts wrong, he's going to be all over that like white on rice, so to speak. And what you're going to see from DeSantis, as you've seen in his rise, is an ability to capitalize on that. We saw that with Covid in 2020 when a lot of media coverage of Florida was a little over the top, and a little hysterical, and he took advantage of that. And ever since then you've seen him time and time again go back to that well.And if you just look back at the last legislative session with all of the controversy he was mired in, again, he wound up winning by nearly 20 percentage points. So, to a degree, voters at least in this state are either tuning out the news media, not believing it, and preferring to support Ron DeSantis, at least as a gubernatorial candidate.

Now, one of the marquee bills that could define his agenda could soon go before the Republican led legislature, Florida House Bill 999. If passed, it would limit what people are allowed to study at public universities and colleges. The bill reads in part, general education core courses may not suppress or distort significant historical events or include a curriculum that teaches identity politics, such as critical race theory, or defines American history as contrary to the creation of a new nation based on universal principles stated in the Declaration of Independence.Now, the bill has drawn widespread criticism from educators and Florida Democrats. And it also caught the attention of our next guest, renowned documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. He tweet in part, by trying to dictate what teachers can and cannot teach, Florida House Bill 999 is an assault on the very liberties articulated by the founders and something that all Americans should speak out against. Ken Burns is here now. Also he has a new book out, \"Our America: A Photographic History.\" It is fantastic. We have been thumbing through it. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

This is a complicated world and race is in everything we touch, not because it's -- I'm looking for it, but because we were founded on the idea that all men were created equal. The guy who wrote that owned hundreds of human beings and didn't see the contradiction or the hypocrisy.And so our whole story is based in a discussion in race, along with the meaning of freedom. And that's complicated, too, because freedom, you know, what I want, personal freedom, comes into conflict with what we need, a kind of collective freedom. So, there is that great struggle. Why are you so frightened of telling your children about the struggles? We go to gym class at six years old and have somebody yelling at us that we're not doing something right, but somehow you can't move over to history and find out that something in the past wasn't quite right. This doesn't make any sense. It's a disconnect. And what it's attempt is to narrow, as I'm saying, our view of ourselves into one narrow thing as our country becomes more diverse, which is wonderful, and more complicated and lots of manifestations.
