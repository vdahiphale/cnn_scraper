      "sentences": "Hello. I'm Ana Cabrera in New York. Thank you for being here.All eyes on the Fed and its fight against inflation. Minutes from now, we will hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the last rate hike decision of the year. Wall Street, Main Street, even the Oval Office are on edge. The hope? That Powell pumps the brakes with a smaller rate increase. The fear? That the Fed goes too far and raises the risk of a recession. CNN's Matt Egan is at the Federal Reserve, and economist Diane Swonk is joining us as well. Matt, we have seen four massive rate hikes in a row. Today is expected to be smaller. Why is that? Did yesterday's numbers factor into this decision?",

      "sentences": "Well, Ana, if the Fed does go with a smaller rate hike today, it will be a sign that officials believe that their tough medicine is starting to work.Yesterday's inflation report showed that consumer prices went up in November at the smallest annual rate since late last year. Inflation is still very high at 7 percent. That's more than triple the Fed's target, but it is starting to go in the right direction. So that is why Wall Street is betting the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points today. That would be a significant shift after four straight meetings where they raised interest rates by 75 basis points. To give you some context about where we are, a 50-basis-point rate hike would still lift interest rates to the highest level since 2007. And so that does mean borrowing costs are still going up for everyone. Mortgage rates are near 20-year highs, credit card rates are at record highs. And this would also mean more pressure on the economy. The Fed is essentially still pumping medicine into this economy to try to treat inflation. They're just maybe going to lower the dosage a bit. Two big things to watch for today. One, Fed officials will update their targets for where they think interest rates are going next year. So Wall Street wants to see how many more rate hikes the Fed thinks that are needed for next year. The other big question is whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he drops any hints about when the Fed can pause on these interest rate hikes next year. Because, Ana, the concern remains the same. Can the Fed stop raising interest rates before they accidentally cause a recession?",

At what point can the Fed say, OK, enough is enough?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's -- unfortunately, they don't know the exact number. And they won't know until after the fact.And that's what ups the risks that they go too far. They're really cognizant that they have been humbled more than once by inflation re- accelerating or accelerating much longer than they thought. They don't want to allow the underlying inflation out there to metastasize, much like, as we talked about the medicine, it's like a cancer. Inflation is like cancer. And if you don't catch it early, and really eradicate the economy of it, it can metastasize and become something much more corrosive. And that's what the Fed is trying to avoid. That's a fine line, as we said, trying to meet that line between, how high do they go? They will probably say they're going to go to probably a quarter- percent rates this time, but I think it's important to remember that's -- they have been chasing up their terminal rate for some time. What will be really interesting is to start to see the divide within the Fed on how quickly they think they can cut rates later on, and also how long they feel they have to keep rates higher. And there will be some who exceed that level as well. And you're going to start to see much more dispersion. We have got a very diverse Federal Reserve Board. And for the first time since 2013, we're fully staffed and every president -- and on the board, and that diversity is going to be more debate as we get this nuance of, where do we actually stop? How far do we go? We don't want to risk skating on thin -- we could be skating on thin ice as we move into 2023. How much do we want to chill the economy and risk coping through that ice?",

And that is a big relief, because we know that spike to record highs has really been harmful and was really painful for a lot of families.I think the bad news is that sticker shock is real at the supermarket. We saw a 12 percent year-over-year increase in prices at the grocery store. Look at some of these big jumps. There were big increases in prices for butter, flour, bread, milk, eggs, 49 percent more expensive than a year ago. That's the biggest annual increase since 1984. This is painful, because these are everyday items. You really can't escape it. It's unavoidable. And, Ana, it's another reminder that while overall inflation is cooling off, it remains way too hot in some areas.",

They're looking for a more gradual increase in prices.Now, to give you some context, I went back and looked. And right before COVID hit, if you look at the last two months of 2019, we saw grocery store prices only going up about 1, 1.5 percent year over year. Now, that's probably not realistic to get anything like that anytime soon. But I think Fed officials are hoping that we go from this 12 percent increase for grocery prices to something closer to 2 to 3 percent over time. And, of course, that would be very helpful. But one problem here, Ana, is, this is largely out of the control of the Fed. I mean, the spike in food prices has been driven by a lot of different factors, including extreme weather and the war in Ukraine. And there's really nothing the Fed can do with interest rate policy to impact those specific issues.",

And that's going to take a couple of -- a couple more days to really try to sort, out to write this legislation. I talked to the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Richard Shelby, and he told me that it's probably going to take at least three or four days to write this bill. There's always snags and things that come up in these disagreements between Republicans and Democrats, but he is confident they can get there. In the meantime, they are going to need a couple more days. So they're going to pass the short-term spending bill. The House is going to move on that tonight. We expect the Senate could do that tomorrow. After all of that, they have to get the votes for the larger spending package that's going to go through September 30. That's going to be the big fight ahead. And that's really going to rest with Republican and Democratic leaders. My colleague Manu Raju just saying that Bernie Sanders is saying he will not support that larger bill. That means that Republicans are going to have to come up with another vote. This is always a little bit of a math problem, a little bit of an arithmetic problem, but we do expect that this will pass. It may just be very messy right before Christmas -- Ana.",

      "sentences": "Yes, undoubtedly, Ana.It has been such a devastating and just simply heartbreaking past couple of days for the Deep South, including here in Union Parish, where I'm located. And you said it just right. I have covered a lot of natural disasters, tornadoes, hurricanes, and it never ceases to amaze me the sheer power of what the wind can do. Look at this truck, this flatbed truck that has literally been turned on its side just balancing here, windows completely crashed out. Looks like someone took a can opener and peeled back the top of this roof. There's wood and shrapnel laying over the street. I saw this earlier. This is an iron rod. I mean, you can hear that. Can you imagine if that was flying at you 100 miles per hour? Obviously, extremely dangerous. The all-too-familiar sounds of a natural disaster, you can hear the alarms in the background going off from the various residences within this apartment complex. But what was most astounding to me is what I'm about to show you. And what you're looking at here is about a 70-foot-long iron platform where a mobile home once stood. And this was actually lofted into the sky about 150 feet behind me over my right shoulder. That is where a mobile home park was completely decimated. Only two of the eight homes in that particular mobile home park are left standing. And hoping to bring up these aerial visuals that we shot with our cameramen and their drone earlier today just to give you that perspective. You're probably seeing the foundations that were left on the ground. The actual mobile homes were lofted and tossed about a football field's length into the forest behind the road, just off of the property there, and really very, very scary moments for the residents who rode out this tornado here in Union Parish. But I want to look right into the camera because our severe weather threat is still ongoing across the South. Take this as a lesson. If you are preparing for severe weather today, you need to be ready to take shelter quickly because these storms hit at a moment's notice. And it took the residents off guard here. You need to watch out for this line of storms coming through because it's headed your way, let's say just, to our east -- back to you, Ana.",

We're under a tornado watch for this region. And this is all part of that same system that brought the blizzard conditions across the North, severe weather yesterday, and it is still a very real threat. As this travel -- continues to travel to the east, we will continue to see these pop- up supercell storms, these storms that can produce tornadoes. We have tornado warnings in effect. All of these hot pink boxes, those are active tornado warnings. Those indicate that a tornado could be in progress. So, if you're in these areas, of course, seek shelter, Southeast Louisiana on into Central Mississippi to the east of Jackson onto Meridian. Here are all the tornado reports we had yesterday. A lot of these storms and these tornadoes came down during the overnight hours, when people are sleeping. And so that's why we see the nocturnal tornadoes to be even more deadly. As we go forward in time, very strong storms will continue. We will see these through Alabama, Georgia. Florida Panhandle will also face some of these storms as we get into the overnight hours tonight. Still seeing snowy conditions on the northern end of the snow -- the storm system, rather, where we have visibility down to half-a-mile in Duluth, Bismarck the same.

And that migration only slowed down after the U.S. struck a deal with Mexico, under which Mexico agreed to receive Venezuelans expelled under Title 42. I spoke with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas yesterday in El Paso. He was here for an operational briefing. Not only does he say the federal government is going to be surging resources to border communities like El Paso. He did confirm that the U.S. government is in negotiations right now with Mexico. I think, if we see any new limits on asylum or access to the U.S. border, it's going to require Mexico's cooperation. So, we're watching for that in the coming days.

Governor Abbott's busing program is a little different from the busing program that existed in El Paso, in which El Paso was sending only those who did not have a sponsor. Governor Abbott, as I understand it, was sending anyone who voluntarily would get on a bus. I don't know how much of that is an incentive. Many of the migrants who are arriving now do have sponsors and need only, in terms of what the rescue mission and other nongovernmental organizations are providing here, just a bit of respite and an opportunity to get their tickets to other parts of the country. Border Patrol is processing people, doing criminal background checks before they are released to pursue an asylum claim. But, as Blake said, this is a surge that the El Paso area has never seen before. What happens in the wake of the end of Title 42 is anyone's guess at this point. We have not heard from DHS yet what the plan is going to be, whether they will open the ports of entry to asylum seekers to make their claim in a more orderly fashion.
