      "sentences": "We are now 30 minutes away from what should be the House of Representatives reconvening to try once again to elect a new speaker. Kevin McCarthy failed to win a majority of the votes in three consecutive rounds yesterday. So, what is going to be different today? What has happened behind the scenes in terms of these negotiations and talks?Joining right now is a Republican congressman from Texas Pete Sessions. He's been supporting McCarthy for a speaker. Congressman, thank you for coming on. It's been a -- it's been a minute. I appreciate your time. Do you use the path today for Kevin McCarthy? REP. PETE SESSIONS, (R-TX): Kate, thank you very much. There's a pathway -- there's got to be a pathway for us to -- in what this has turned into. And that is that members of Congress right now are -- or member-elects, we have not confirmed. They've not taken their oath of office. We've not moved forward. We've got meeting earrings. We've got things that need to be done and scheduled with plan. Yes, there's got to be a pathway today to resolve this. And I think it's going to require at least what I would say the 19 people to decide who they're for. And they are for -- they've got to be for someone they can't be just for what might be one person who doesn't want it. And Jim Jordan is the one who sits with that 19 -- or 20 votes right now, and he's a vote for Kevin McCarthy. So, one way or another, this will buckle itself into a direction. The important thing for the American people to know is the Republican Party members of Congress are taking this seriously. The issues that that demand our attention, demand that the majority be sworn in and get to work.",

Because there's still a question, OK?Will -- who's the person that you want to support because Jim Jordan says he's not interested?

That's just not apparent to everybody.And it's going to have to be apparent to everybody in our conference that we need to get the speaker both done. We need to swear in members of Congress.

And so, we are anticipating he will be arriving here in Idaho.When that happens, that probable cause affidavit which basically is a document which says exactly what kind of evidence that the police have in order to arrest him, that can be unsealed. It cannot be unsealed until he hits back here. And that's where we are expecting to learn a lot more details as to why or how this could have possibly happened. Yesterday after court -- well, in court rather, he waived the expedition to get here. And the District Attorney in Monroe County, Pennsylvania said that he believes that Kohberger -- Bryan Kohberger, the suspect, waived extradition to get back to Idaho quickly so that he himself can see exactly what is in those documents and why police believe that he should have been arrested. He, through his public defender, has said that he believes he will be exonerated. When he was in court yesterday, his family was there. They were in tears.

A couple of look tornado warnings on the ground right now.But this is the next storm system we have to watch out for. Coming into California, warm fronts this morning. Later on, this afternoon, cold Front, an awful lot. This is going to be wet, white, and windy. An awful lot of rain could be four inches of rain in some spots on top of places that had four to six just last week. And then, if you get up in the mountains, that's where the white is so be deeper than a yardstick in places in the Sierra. We'll take this so we can get it. 98 percent of California is still in a drought. But we don't need this lens to be 70 miles per hour through the end of this week.
