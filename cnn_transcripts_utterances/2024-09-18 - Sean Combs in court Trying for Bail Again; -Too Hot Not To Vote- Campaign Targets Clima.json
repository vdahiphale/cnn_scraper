Combs is facing a potential life sentence after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering, and other alleged crimes. Let's turn now to defense attorney Misty Marris.Misty, I wonder what you think about this proposal that Diddy's attorney is putting forward to the judge considering the fact that Diddy has shown even while facing legal action he has a propensity to reach out to witnesses or potential witnesses.",

Will he show up for his next appearances? And number two, is he a danger? And that's not just a danger to society. That relates to being a danger in the sense that he might communicate with witnesses, that there could be some obstructionist behavior, as prosecutors have argued. So they're doing their best to put together something more, but under the circumstances, it's unlikely to be successful. I think we're going to see upholding the bail determination from yesterday.",

They outlined that there was a murder there a few months ago, that four people had died by suicide in the last few years.[15:35:00] Generally, that other courts in that district have found it's in rough shape.

The reason that you see the defense raising that as another issue in the case, because they're, of course, asking for house arrest, is because in, with respect to these particular very severe charges, there's what's called a presumption of detention. Meaning the defense has the burden to tell the judge and to overcome a presumption that favors the prosecution and favors holding Combs in jail pending trial.Because of that, anything and everything, including these new conditions that are being proposed to limit who he would have contact with if he were to be on house arrest, in addition to the conditions that have been the subject of criticism in this particular detention center, they're going to use anything and everything they have in order to overcome that presumption.",

We don't know what else was taken from all of those electronics that were taken in the raid and were reviewed as evidence for this case.We heard prosecutors say they interviewed up to 50 witnesses. We know that there's a conspiracy element of this, right? We have racketeering that there might be others who are involved. I think what the defense is really saying is, OK, we're going to take it to trial because any plea deal would be unlikely to be so favorable. We're talking about charges that carry a minimum of 15 years. So the idea that a plea deal is going to be something that will have a not so severe punishment is just really not in the cards for this particular case.",

Here in the United States, Phoenix just ended its historic streak of 113 consecutive days of triple-digit highs.Folks are not just dealing with extreme heat, but people in coastal North Carolina are now cleaning up after floodwaters surged into homes, stranded vehicles, and forced water rescues earlier this week. This was a 1,000-year rain event that was caused by an unnamed storm. We're joined now by Bill Nye, the science guy who is a legendary science educator. Bill, your reaction to this study and what you make of all these extreme weather events, is there any doubt in your mind that this is climate change at play?",

But in general, when there's a lot of rain, that's because the ocean's warmer, the air's warmer, and so you can connect rain events to climate change.But with all that in mind, there's no question the world's getting warmer, and there's no question that humans are to blame or causing it. I mean, as the saying goes, suppose these events were happening, these extreme weather events, extreme rain events, and we didn't know why they were happening. It was just a mystery.

And so everybody, this is a classic example of picking a specific datum and extrapolating, so-called cherry picking. Yes, by burning less coal, we are burning more natural gas.As the pandemic wound down, we started driving cars again countrywide. And these two effects make it so that you can pick the datum that we're burning -- we're producing more oil and gas than we did previously. And that's good. It's noteworthy. But the long-term goal would be to transition from coal and gas to natural gas and then from natural gas to renewable sources of electricity. That would be the long-term goal. Now, people running for president have to move to the center. All good. And I understand that. But first of all, let's vote for a party that's going to do something about climate change.",

But the deal is, ours has been identified, Spinal Cerebellar Ataxia 27B. And so this is a huge first step. In my grandmother's day, there was no way to know what caused it.
