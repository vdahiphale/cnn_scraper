You've been watching our extensive coverage ofan unprecedented moment in American history, the third criminal indictment of a former U.S. president. Donald Trump is set to appear before a federal judge in Washington, D.C., Thursday, charged in connection with trying to overturn the 2020 election. The special counsel leading the investigation called the January 6th Capitol insurrection an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy fueled by lies. Trump's lawyer, meanwhile, made the rounds on TV shortly after the charges were announced and claimed they were an attack on free speech. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LAURO, DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: Donald Trump had every right to advocate for his position. While he was president, he saw irregularities, he saw deficiencies. This is the first time that, in the history of the United States, that the Justice Department has weaponized and politicized political speech. They want to go to trial so that -- so that, instead of debating the issues against Joe Biden, that President Trump is sitting in a courtroom. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Russia is stepping up its campaign to cripple Ukraine's grain exports. Russian drones targeted Ukraine's main port on the Danube River, damaging silos and warehouses with grain that was supposed to be shipped to Africa, China and Israel. The Danube port is one of the only ways Ukraine can export grain, since Russia dropped out of a deal that was allowing grain ships to safely travel through the Black Sea. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke on the phone with Vladimir Putin on Wednesday about restoring that grain deal. Putin told the Turkish leader that Russia will not budge until the West takes steps to allow more Russian grain and fertilizer to be sold. And diplomats seem hopeful that the grain deal can actually be restored.

You know, with ECOWAS threatening the use of military force, you have countrieslike Mali, like Burkina Faso, saying, hey, wait a second. If ECOWAS doesn't respect the sovereignty of Niger, we will side with the Nigerian military junta. What is the right strategy to go about this, do you think?",

The stridencyof the remarks by Mali and Burkina Faso are most troubling. And one wonders where those strident remarks, that rhetoric comes from. Those countries were members of ECOWAS. They self-isolated themselves by the choices they made. So, their opinions have come across as something a bit strange. Other countries in the region, Chad, Nigeria, and others are saying way too many coups. And several times over the past decade, the countries in Iqbal have said, that's enough, no more coups. We will set sanctions. We will close borders. We will limit air traffic. We will cut off utilities. We might raise a peacekeeping force or a force who has reestablished peace. We can't keep having coups. It pulls the entire region down. It cuts foreign direct investment. It cuts trade. It is negative every way when one looks at it. So, I think they're standing up and saying, no more coups, we really do mean it.",

      "sentences": "You know, what's interesting is that if you look across the Sahel, especially in the sort of former French colonies, there's three things thata lot of these countries have in common, obviously the Islamic insurgency that's taking place in a lot of these countries, the fact that a lot of them have been beset by military coups, but also there is this real sort of growing anti-Western sentiment. And it is, I would say, mostly geared towards France because of France's former colonial relationship with these countries and sort of continued security and economic relationship with them to the present day, but a lot of these countries are saying, look, we are tired of Western countries meddling in our affairs, particularly France. I mean, the anti-French sentiment in these countries is very high right now. Based on all of that and how the mood has changed over recent years, how will the U.S. sort of rethink its security relationship and its financial relationship, actually, with some of these countries in the cell?",

We wait for the situation to be resolved, and we hold every hope that a negotiatedsolution may be found, particularly an African solution to an African problem. We have a USAID program that's very large, which reestablished its mission three years ago. We have a Millennium Challenge Corporation compact that's over $437 million agricultural productivity. Yes, we have security assistance designed to help Niger fight terrorism, to fight trafficking in all of its forms, trafficking in persons, arms and ammunition, drugs. We're working in several respects to help Niger to make progress as our like-minded partners, which include the French. Of course, for our former colonial problem, it's always problematic relationship. I know the same from serving in the Philippines, in the Peace Corps, that it was a very strained relationship because it's a former colony of the United States. That relationship will ever be tense due to that past history. But Spain, Italy, Germany, the E.U., the Brits, our other friends, like- minded partners in Europe and others, the U.N. agencies, NGOs, Niger has many friends who are accompanying it as it moves along the democratic path. And it was consolidating its democracy. So, to see this step backwards and to see this disinformation from outside countries, which again is so strident and the sudden appearance of so many Russian flags in a country that doesn't even have a Russian embassy, that gives one pause.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there's two parts to your question. First is the freedom of speech issue. That's what exactly thespecial counsel addressed in the way he drafted the indictment. It really avoids that issue as a legal issue. While they can claim that politically, it's not going to work in court. This indictment is very carefully -- avoids really head on First Amendment issues. So, as to his defense that Nixon, or that Trump actually believed that he had lost the election, I think he's got a very rough road to do. There's enough sprinkled throughout the indictment again, showing that Trump didn't really believe that he had won. That I think that will be obviously a jury question. And I think that Trump's gonna have a tough sell trying to show that he had really serious doubts.",

What do you make of the fact that theco-conspirators were not technically named, although we could sort of glean from the details that who they were. They weren't named and they weren't indicted as of yet. What do you make of that strategy by the special counsel?",

That could be a host of people, so we don't know that when the other ones are pretty clear. And I think that what the special counsel has done here is shot right across their bow to tell them, listen, this is coming. You either cooperate or you're next. You're going to get an indictment because just the sprinkling of evidence that he uses in the Trump indictment is enough to tell them they've got serious problems. So, I think it's an effort to get cooperation. Whether that will work or not is hard to know. Probably not with some of them. Maybe with others they will get some cooperation. So, that's the next issue that will surface in this case is whether or not they're indicted.",

      "sentences": "And whether or not they cooperate, as you point out. Let's go back to August 1974, you know, post-Watergate. Nixon had lost the support of theHouse and the Senate, and he ended up resigning. You know, such a different political climate in America back then, because you had this president who sort of had done and was accused of doing something pretty shameful, and the country and his former allies turned on him, he resigned in shame. This time around, we're on Donald Trump's third criminal indictment, two federal indictments, by the way. And as a result of all of this, his popularity only seems to be growing. In fact, he's raising even more money. There was a recent poll that showed that Donald Trump still has over 50 percent support within the Republican Party. I mean, the second person doesn't come anywhere close to him at this point. I mean, what do you make of how much things have changed compared to 50 years ago?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I think, also part of the -- one of the reasons why Donald Trump is so popular is because he has never sort ofbuilt his brand the same way that former politicians of old built their brands in terms of, you know, being sort of honest and upright, et cetera because he never built his brand around all of that. He seems to be much more likely to get away with what he's getting away with, politically speaking. What are the chances of him actually going to trial for some of these indictments before the 2024 election? I mean, how does the timing work? I mean, obviously we have some of them scheduled already for early in the year, but how does it work with three potential trials happening before the election?",

The case that was filed yesterday, the indictment that we're talking about today, is a big case. It's one of the most important cases of my lifetime. I think that the others will yield and let this case go forward and not try to compete with it. And it will become the principal case that will go forward. And I think the judge that is in-charge of this case in the District of Columbia -- she's very able. She's a former public defender. She'll watch his rights and protect his rights, but she'll also make it a rocket docket, if you will, where they'll get this one through. And I think that's what the special counsel is counting on, and that's what the American public really needs -- is somebody who will push this case forward and get it tried and get a jury verdict one way or the other. And I think there's no doubt in my mind what's going to happen on this one before the election.",
