      "sentences": "Good morning. Thanks for being up early with us. I'm Kasie Hunt.Here's our big story at the bottom of the hour. The Israeli military under pressure to prove its claim of a Hamas command center beneath the Al-Shifa hospital, releasing video from inside an exposed tunnel shaft. This is the camera being lowered into the shaft where the remotely-operated unit then moves along the hallway some distance before encountering a door. The IDF also released video it says shows Hamas fighters bringing two hostages into Al-Shifa hospital on October 7. One man is pushed through the main entrance and down a hall; another brought in on a gurney bleeding from his hand. Note these are videos shot and distributed by the IDF. CNN can't independently verify what they show. In the meantime, sources tell CNN that negotiators are nearing a deal for the release of dozens of hostages. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following the story from London and she joins us live. Clare, what is the latest on the terms for a deal and when might we see it happen?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's closer than it's ever been at any point, though as the Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer speaking to CNN on Sunday -- he said that certain areas of difference have narrowed. Others, in his words, have been closed out.Separately, we also heard from the prime minister of Qatar who is a key broker in these talks who said good progress is being made. He said that in a press conference on Sunday. And he said the sticking points right now are more logistical and practical than related to the core of the deal, which certainly sounds promising. Now, as for the core of the deal, various things have been coming out from various sources about this. We had heard earlier in the month from a U.S. official that it looked like it would concern a large group of hostages, potentially women and children, first in exchange for a dayslong pause. So longer than the sort of several hours at a time that Israel has been doing. So far, Hamas has had various other demands beyond a dayslong pause though, including allowing Palestinians who fled to the south to return home. The release of women and children -- prisoners -- Palestinian prisoners within Israel. More food and fuel aid deliveries into Gaza. Even, we heard last week from several sources in Israel that they want Israel to stop flying surveillance drones over Gaza. So quite a significant number of demands if they have, in fact, come close to a deal. That is, in itself, a significant achievement. But also, I think -- look, these videos that we're getting from the IDF, particularly those CCTV videos that they've put out showing what they say are hostages on October 7 in the Al-Shifa hospital -- one of them, in particular, being fairly roughly treated it looks like from the video -- the uninjured one. You can see in this video here -- separately, the news that we also got from the IDF last week -- that two bodies of hostages they say have been found close to Al-Shifa. And what we heard from Jon Finer, the national security adviser, that they simply don't know at this point how many American hostages are still alive. The situation for the hostages is precarious, it's unclear, and that adds pressure to those negotiations.",

Were they there to get medical treatment, as I'm sure the spinmeisters of Hamas would like the world to believe, or are they being brought there to go through tunnels and brought underground?And so, there are a lot of questions. Clearly, this demonstrates that Hamas is operating from within the hospital at a certain -- at a certain level, perhaps as a military center. Certainly, they have a tight relationship with the administration there. They weren't being told to stay out. They weren't being told that if you come here you're going to attract Israeli retribution, but that's what's happened. And it is very concerning that they are in that hospital and it seems like they have been in there ever since.",

Fifty-one percent of Democratic voters, according to this new NBC poll, say Israel has gone too far. Twenty-seven percent say Israel's actions are justified. Forty-nine percent oppose the U.S. sending military aid to Israel. Now, of course, President Biden has been steadfast in his support for Israel, both in his rhetoric but also the actions of the government. Is there a point at which that might change, in your view, because of these -- the feeling here? I mean, young voters, in particular, seem very opposed to what the administration is doing.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kasie. Without a doubt, this is causing a lot of churn inside the Democratic Party. And as you know, I'm an active member of the Democratic Party and Ithink it's legitimate that we see a lot of anxiety about the war and the desire to have American pressure to end it, but we're not seeing that break. We're not seeing that go over and to demand a broader national level. But we are seeing it at a critical level of the base and the base is going to continue to make its voice heard. But watch -- and this is what I'm looking at. Watch what members of Congress say when they're calling for a ceasefire. Just one came out last night, Judy Chu. And basically, her argument is I want a ceasefire but it needs to be bilateral. It needs to be with Hamas pausing its actions and allowing for the hostages out as opposed to a unilateral ceasefire, which is what's being called for by more aggressive voices. And that matters because it means members of Congress, while hearing and absorbing the large protest voices, which is important -- they are not flipping into the argument that Israel should just stop its war right now. But that is the key measurement to watch. The president has broad support. I signed onto a letter about a week ago of former Biden and Obama officials supporting the president's policy. There's a lot of support for where he's going, including in the Jewish community -- three-quarters support. So it's not just this one snapshot poll. But certainly, watching what these members say -- bilateral ceasefire versus unilateral ceasefire -- that's the critical measurement.",

Of course, I've reported extensively on this. Even though he has these series of legal challenges that he's facing and it's unclear how this is going to play out in the court of law, Donald Trump's campaign and Donald Trump himself wants to have this play out in the court of public opinion. And that is why making sure that he can use social media and say what he wants is so important to him and also to his whole team. They see his legal strategy and his political strategy as one and they plan to use that in his efforts to get reelected in 2024.

The president plans to celebrate tonight with a quiet, low-key family dinner. And Biden advisers continue to try to downplay age as an issue butrecent polling very strongly suggests that the Biden campaign has an issue here, as you can see. Fifty-six percent in the latest CNN-New Hampshire poll said age is their biggest concern about Biden. Let's bring in Bloomberg's White House correspondent, Akayla Gardner. Akayla, good morning. It's always good to see you. The ever-sharp-tongued or sharp-penned Maureen Dowd wrote over the weekend about a spat that the White House is having with David Axelrod. Jonathan Martin at Politico had reported that Axelrod called the president -- the word starts with P and ends with K. We can't say it on TV. Axelrod said this to Maureen about the president -- honestly, kind of escalating this back-and-forth. \"I think he has a 50-50 shot here, but no better than that, maybe a little worse.\" He seems to be talking about when the elect -- winning the election or not. But Axelrod goes on to say \"He [Biden] thinks he can cheat nature here and it's really risky. They've got a real problem if they're counting on Trump to win it for them. I remember Hillary doing that, too.\" How is the White House thinking about this, especially on a day where there's obviously increased focus because it's his birthday? AKAYLA GARDNER, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, BLOOMBERG NEWS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. I do think it is a little bit harder for the campaign to continue to convince voters that Joe Biden is the best person to do the job. That was yesterday. He is now 81 years old. He was already the oldest president to ever hold office. But I think the way that they are confronting this is by not ignoring it. We see the president continue to validate voters' concerns when he's asked about it in interviews. He says it's perfectly normal for people to wonder if he's able to continue to serve in office. But also, he tries to let people know that he's in on the joke. We see him in almost every speech make a reference to his age. We've also seen the White House reference his doctors' notes. Also, these long foreign trips we've seen, including wartime trips to Ukraine and Israel to sort of show that he's able to work these long hours. But you're absolutely right. This is his biggest Achilles heel. We constantly hear it from voters. But he continues to try to address it every chance that he gets.",

I mean, they are of the same generation very squarely.Akayla, let's talk a little bit about one other increasing vulnerability since -- especially since the Israel-Hamas war broke out, and that's among young voters. [05:50:04] Just compare the September numbers to the most recent November numbers. Thirty-one percent of young voters now say that they approve of the job the president is doing. That number was 46 percent in September. That is a very quick -- that's a very short time period for that number to move so far. Is the White House concerned about this?",

She continues to target these groups. She went on a long college tour this summer. She's visited the NAACP. She spoke to UnidosUS. So she continues to speak out, particularly about these groups, while Joe Biden continues to sort of focus on the middle-of-the-road voters. He talks about democracy. He talks about the economy.
