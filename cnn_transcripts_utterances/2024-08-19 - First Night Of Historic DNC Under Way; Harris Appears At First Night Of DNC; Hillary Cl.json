The future of our middle class, the future of reproductive rights, the future of our climate, our security, our schools, the future of our freedom. The future of our very democracy. We will see the vision of our nominee. It is a vision of stability, security and opportunity for everyday Americans, where we continue to grow this economy by growing the middle class and where the safety of our children, our families, and our communities are a fundamental civil right. It is a future where instead of scoffing at allies and fawning over dictators, our president stands up for our friends, faces down our adversaries, and American democracy remains a beacon of hope and inspires the world to take on our biggest challenges together. We'll learn the story of a leader who has dedicated her life to making, doing the work of making good on the promise of America. A leader who understands the middle class because she grew up in the middle class. A leader who has taken on powerful interests at every step of her career and fought for the rights and freedoms of all of us.
