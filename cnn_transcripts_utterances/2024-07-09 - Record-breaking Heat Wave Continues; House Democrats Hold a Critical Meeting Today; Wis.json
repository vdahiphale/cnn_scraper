I'm going to just look at the temperature gauge out here in beautiful Woodland Hills. And right now it says it's 68. It was 69 two seconds ago. But I promise you, we are going to get up into some very high temperatures. And this is not just happening here. We are looking from Seattle, all the way down through Sacramento, coming down here into southern California, Los Vegas, Death Valley. We are seeing record temperatures that are falling day after day. This is all as we are seeing climate change because how humans are warming up the earth. It is affecting many of these big cities and making it very dangerous. Last week the National Weather Service calling it a lethal heat wave that continues here. Vegas, yesterday, hitting 115 degrees. Just to put that in perspective, that's a third day in a row of it breaking its daily record high. It's going to perhaps continue to do that going into Monday. And they have been above 100 degrees, 110 degrees, since July 3rd. Just to put that in perspective. Death Valley also showing very high temperatures, 125 degrees or higher. We did hear of that one motorcyclist who died because of heat and then they couldn't even get the helicopter in to help out because the temperatures were too high for the helicopter to fly. This is what we are seeing around this region and it's going to persist so people really have to stay vigilant.

It certainly looks to us as though it was a lot more than two floors that seem to have gotten blown up. You can see behind me, that is where that - part of that building used to stand. And you can see that it was just absolutely annihilated by that missile. I think on some of the rooms you can still see the tiles, obviously demonstrating that this is indeed the children's hospital. One of the biggest children's hospitals in Europe, not just the biggest in Ukraine, but one of the biggest in Europe. As we stand here right now, John, the death toll here is two, but also dozens injured. One of the lucky things the folks here say is that they heard a rocket alarm and they managed to get at least the children and the staff evacuated out of the building as fast as possible. But I want to show you something else because this is just absolutely remarkable and shows just how big the impact was. You can see, that's what's left of some of the floors that are here. You can see some of those supporting beams. But if we actually pan over there, you can see that there's a car underneath that, that's been absolutely flattened by - when all of that came crushing down after the explosion took place. So you can see, a massive explosion that took place right in the heart of Kyiv. The Russians, of course, for their part have been saying that they believe this could have been a straight Ukrainian surface to air missile that might have hit this building. The Ukrainians having absolutely none of it, saying it was a Russian rocket and also saying that this was a deliberate attack on the health care service here in Ukraine, but also on the children of Ukraine well. And then, of course, John, one of the things that we've been seeing so much of as the war here has been unfolding, you can see the Ukrainians very quick to come in and try and clean all this up. These are volunteers that we've been seeing working here. They obviously have their work cut out for them. One of the things that the Ukrainians have said that they want to do after an attack like this, as horrible as it is, as big as the carnage is, 29 people killed in all of Kyiv. There's other impact sites as well. They say they want to clean as much of this up as fast as possible to try and get back to a fairly normal life. All that, of course, also in defiance of what they say is the Russian onslaught that's been happening. The Ukrainians have said, this is the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that they will respond to this. And they also say they need more surface to air missile systems. John.",

A lot of people know these terms now. But Tirzepatide, these are the drugs that are made by Eli Lilly. There is Zepbound and there is Mounjaro. These are all FDA approved drugs. Semaglutide are the ones that are made by Novo Nordisk, Wegovy and Ozempic. And they are for diabetes. And they are also for weight loss.Now, what's interesting is, first of all, the Semaglutide, the way that these medications work is they're all what are called post- nutrient hormones. You eat and your body releases hormones to make insulin, to tell your brain that you are full, and to allow your food actually make - be digested. With the Tirzepatides, you have two hormones. With the Semaglutides,  you have one hormone known as GLP. So, this study, now after all that, this study was basically trying to figure out which of these drugs work better specifically for weight loss. So, the study was of some 18,000 people. They went back and looked at medical records between May of 2022 and September of 2023. So over a year. And they said, which of these worked better? And here's the findings. First of all, everybody lost at least 5 percent of weight. Almost everybody on any drug. But what the Tirzepatides, again, the Mounjaro, on average people lost about 15 percent of their body weight at one year compared to the Semaglutides, such as Ozempic, 8 percent at one year. So, that was - that was the big headline. You know, we didn't really know. But this was sort of the - the best, I will say, head-to- head comparison of these medications.",

There's different dosing if you're taking it for obesity versus weight loss. So, in some ways, even though I said, you're comparing Tirzepatides and Semaglutides, you weren't really comparing the appropriate dose of each medication if weight loss itself was sort of the end point that you were looking at.So, I think we - we have to wait a little bit longer to see on the weight loss specifically. But also, you know, there are side effects to these medications, and some people are going to have more side effects with one class of drugs versus the other. So, that's a big part of this. You know, in these trials, about half the people actually stopped taking the drug within that first year. For all sorts of different reasons. But I think a big part of that is side effects.",
