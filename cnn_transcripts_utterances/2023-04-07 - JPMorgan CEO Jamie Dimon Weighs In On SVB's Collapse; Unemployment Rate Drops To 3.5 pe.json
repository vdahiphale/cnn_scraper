You know, it's all over the place, we have the high - GDP per person is $70,000, plus, China's is $15,000. They import 10 million barrels of oil a day. They don't have the Atlantic in the Pacific, they have a very complicated neighborhood. They're, you know, they're aiming their neighbors, they're all starting to rearm. We've got a great hand. On the other hand, we haven't done a pretty good job taking care of our lower paid citizens or inner-city schools, immigration, taxation and I think people should pay their taxes, litigation, which you know, it costs 1 percent of GDP. And if it was, if it created more fairness in life, I'd say that was good, but it's capricious, arbitrary, slow, you know. And so I can go on and on about mortgages, affordable, you worry about affordable housing. You know, we all agree with that.

Guys, we're back at that fresh 50-year low for unemployment. We saw people come off the sidelines.So the Fed certainly wants to see that. We want to see more workers entering the workforce, because we still have so many jobs. Let's take a look at wages. So wages increased 0.3 percent - 0.3 percent on a monthly basis, 4.2 percent on an annual basis. Where we saw job gains, some of what we've been seeing, right, a continued trend, leisure and hospitality continuing to add jobs there. Government jobs continuing to add jobs there.

So investors are looking for and I would argue many consumers are looking for the Fed to stop with the rate hikes, right? I mean, it has sent credit card rates higher, it has sent mortgage rates higher. And so we're hoping for a bit of a break in terms of the rate hikes, will this be enough to get the Fed to cool down?
