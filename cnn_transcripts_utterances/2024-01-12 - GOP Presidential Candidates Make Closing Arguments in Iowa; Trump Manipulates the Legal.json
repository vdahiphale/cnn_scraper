The former president, Donald Trump, claiming in a New York courtroom that the civil fraud against him, that case, well, there was a witch hunt at stake and at play. He has repeatedly tried to tie his legal entanglements to what he says is a political persecution.You know, my next guest argues that it's Trump himself who has used the legal system for his own benefit for more than five decades. I want to bring in Politico senior writer -- staff writer, Michael Kruse. Thank you so much for being here. His latest piece is called \"'This to Him Is the Grand Finale': Donald Trump's 50-Year Mission to Discredit the Justice System.'\" Michael, this is a fascinating read. It really takes such a step back and dive in to the psychology at play, to the tactics and strategy. You go through a heap of cases involving Trump all the way back, I should add, to 1973 when the federal government sued him and his father for alleged racist rental practices. Now, most people won't necessarily think of Trump as a legal mastermind. So, big picture, what did Trump learn in those early days that really seems to have shaped how he has been attacking and grinding down the legal system?",

So, what we saw yesterday in the courtroom in New York, a brief version of certainly what we saw in the same courtroom in November in New York, is really an extension of something Donald Trump has been doing and quite effectively really in many ways since 1973.In October of 1973, the federal government, the Department of Justice, sued Donald Trump and his father for racist rental practices. Donald Trump, not Fred Trump, but Donald Trump, specifically went out and hired Roy Cohn, the notorious attorney at the time, most notorious because of his status as the former aide and attorney to Senator Joe McCarthy in the 50s. But by that time, he was sort of known as this legal executioner in New York, and that's what a young 27-year-old Donald Trump wanted in that case. And during that case is really when Roy Cohn became, with the possible exception of his father, Donald Trump's most indispensable mentor, his most lasting influence because of the lessons that Cohn was able to impart throughout the course of that case, which lasted for years, in the mid-70s, attack, deny, most importantly, perhaps, delay. But all of those things that are in the Roy Cohn playbook, Donald Trump learned greedily in the 70s and has, to some extent, been employing them ever since. As I point out in the piece, first, he learned from Roy Cohn, then he searched for another Roy Cohn after Roy Cohn died in 1986 from complications of AIDS. And now, in many ways, he has become his own Roy Cohn.",

He's fighting for his freedom in some sense.But he also is very, very savvy and effective in how he has used and abused the legal system for 50 years. He has used it on defense, he has used it on offense, he has identified in some ways accurately that the very integrity of the system is its vulnerability, the time it takes, the care it takes, the rules that the judges and the prosecutors and attorneys, frankly, have to follow.

I am no longer, but I feel a kinship nonetheless. Consider yourself, you say, the senior stateswoman. Since you are, I guess, the oldest, what kind of learning curve do you expect for the new members? REBECCA NOEKER, ST. PAUL CITY COUNCILMEMBER:  Well, my birthday is on February 1st, so I'm just sneaking in under 40. (LAUGHTER) I should acknowledge that openly on national TV. But I think there's a huge learning curve. I think they're coming into office. Campaigning is one thing. You talk about the things that you hope to do. You come into government and you realize the reality of getting things done and the challenges and the constraints, the tensions that we balance. But I'm looking forward to helping my new colleagues, all of whom are so competent, so talented and so connected to their communities, learn how to get things done quickly.",

PAUL CITY COUNCILMEMBER:  You know, I think that this past election cycle, there were so many folks running for these seats and there were people of all genders and races. But the people of St. Paul chose to elect us. They chose to elect us because of the expertise that we bring, the work that we've done in our community, and the work that we're going to continue to do.",

Councilmember Johnson, what is your message to women across the country who are hoping to also break down their own barriers in their respective states and local communities?CHENIQUA JOHNSON, ST. PAUL CITY COUNCILMEMBER:  You know, I would just say never be satisfied with just one. As we're going to build this coalition and build this movement, it took quite a few of us to work together, not only just in this space, what you see here, but the movements that we carry outside when we go back home to our wards. And so, you know, there's a lot of comfort sometimes and things as the status quo of what they used to be, what they will continue to be, or even predictions about what they could be in the future.",

What is your message to people who are feeling sometimes as though politics is something to opt out of, to throw up their hands and no longer want to engage, because they think maybe it's a fool's errand? What's your message to people to stay engaged in however the outcome in terms of who they vote for and who ends up in office? How do you keep them motivated to participate? NELSIE YANG, ST. PAUL CITY COUNCILMEMBER:  I think that's such a great question. And for me, as I reflect on my lived experiences as a daughter of refugees, that feeling of feeling like our voice is so small or not knowing how to stay engaged or how you even get started or not even being politically-involved, is a story that I know so well, and I feel like so many of us on the council right now know very well. We know that that's something that has to stop because policies and politics is very personal. That is actually what has inspired so many of us to start taking an action and start getting involved. What we are committed to is making sure that we continue bringing people along in this work, doing the best that we can in fighting for justice and equity for all people.",
