      "sentences": "That President Joe Biden has enjoyed spending time with him, so much so that advisors have joked, could we find a way to get the Minnesota governor to spend more time with the president because every time he does that, he seemed to be in a great mood.Just one other final thing that I do want to note, and I'm just going to turn off my phone alarm here that is going off. Sorry about that. One thing I will note is, what an incredible contrast we have now on the Democratic ticket with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz on it at the same time. We have somebody in Kamala Harris who embodies the dynamism, the innovation of big cities, particularly in the coasts of this country, and then in Tim Walz we have somebody who sort of embodies the proud, the resilient, the hard working, patriotic middle of the country. And I do think that we can easily imagine Tim Walz very much embracing and leaning into that contrast. He is somebody who can get up on the campaign stage and say to the American people, look, I might not have gone to law school. I was busy serving in the military. I was busy being a high school teacher. I may not be from a big city on the coast. I was born in a small town in Nebraska. And yet I share all of these fundamental values that Kamala Harris holds dear. And here I am with all of the - you know, with holding all of the same values and views as our vice president, Kamala Harris. So, you could imagine that being sort of a really complimentary ticket that is, again, aimed at speaking to the really wide breadth of voters that the Democrats are hoping to get to going into November as they are hoping to defeat the Donald Trump/J.D. Vance ticket.",

Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee now for president of the United States, has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate.A week-and-a-half ago, two weeks ago, maybe seen as a dark horse. Now he has emerged as the choice. Our MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, John King, Jamie Gangel, all reporting on this. MJ just saying maybe Walz a vibes pick. Seen as a midwestern happy warrior.

      "sentences": "It means, number one, the Democrats have their ticket. They're about to go into their convention. And after Kamala Harris clinched the nomination with the most unorthodox nominating process of our lifetime, the president of the United States steps aside after winning the primaries. She wins a virtual voting among the delegates. And then she wants to make this decision. She wants all this cleaned up before they get to Chicago for the convention so that can all be about prosecuting the case against Donald Trump and J.D. Vance and against the Republicans.So, a very truncated process. A lot of pressure on the vice president. So, if voters out there get to judge, you know, how she's handling this first - first big executive decision. So, why Tim Walz? We're showing pictures of him right there in a jacket and a - and a shirt with no tie on. Earlier we had pictures of him in a t-shirt. I do think the contrast here is going to be striking. This is a small town Midwesterner. This is a man who won a Republican House seat and held it in very difficult years for Democrats, he held onto it. So, he has that small town, rural appeal, which is why Donald Trump picked J.D. Vance. Sort of the same idea. Can you go into small communities and make the case? He's the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. I can tell you, his fellow Democratic governors love him. Love him. They think he's smart. They think he builds consensus. They think he's really funny. And so they like being in his company. And that matters in a campaign in terms of Harris being out, are you confident that you - you know, do you have the loyalty and do you trust your partner out there on the campaign trail? Does that person, at tense moments, and there will be a lot of tense moments in the next 90 days of this campaign, make you laugh and make you smile and maybe take some of the pressure off you? Can you do the small market television? Walz fits that bill. Now, we're going to see how he plays out. And again, I'll be a broken record on this, there is no data in the 37 years I've been doing this that says your vice presidential pick makes the difference in the end. However, it can hurt you. Some - we could have a conversation about has Vance - has Vance hurt Trump or at least stalled Trump's momentum a little bit there. And it - it can help you in the idea that, again, popular with governors, that helps you raise money. Popular with governors, that helps get more people on the team. Popular and small town America, create a little buzz for Democrats in places maybe were they're not always seen. And that is one of the Democratic Party's problems. In the years I've been doing this, you know, Michael Dukakis was my first campaign, 1988. He won ten states.",

      "sentences": "Sara, I'm told not much. They did not have much of a relationship. But another source, just a moment ago, pointed me back to a visit that Vice President Harris took to the twin cities in Minnesota in March. And she visited a Planned Parenthood clinic.Of course, she has been the leading champion on the, at the time, Biden-Harris campaign for abortion rights. And that has been one of the really anthems of her candidacy. And Governor Walz was at this Planned Parenthood clinic. It's the first time a sitting vice president has visited such a clinic. And I'm told that she walked away impressed by his demeanor, how he carried himself, and she liked him, but did not know much about him. And of course at the time this would have been unthinkable. Just 16 days ago she was the running mate. She was its not looking for her own running mate. So, that is what is remarkable about this. But really in the last two weeks, Governor Walz went from a third tier contender in the views of someone who's close to him, to one of the top three. And they believe that was largely because of what he was doing, sort of a very publicly, he was doing every interview he could do trying to make the case to some Democrats and make the case why he is the type and flavor of a - of Democrat that could help win voters back. If you think back to it - and excuse me for that interruption. If you think back to sort of the Democratic Party, how it was not that long ago when Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012, they won a lot of areas that are now red. John was just talking about many of those areas. Governor Walz is someone they believe who can help sort of win back these areas. There, of course, are limitations to this. Vice President Harris is at the top of the ticket. She is the standard bearer. So, we will see in the coming days how much he can sort of give some calm and relief to some voters who are unsure about this. But the contrast is something I'm told the Harris campaign very much liked, and the chemistry is something that she also liked in the final days of this search. Guy. BERMAN: Not a lawyer.",

He wanted a blue collar guy with governing experience who would sort of balance you, that if you were viewed - you were viewed as somehow, you know, more of a city person, right? So, Kamala Harris is San Francisco and Oakland, West Coast. Tim Walz, the Midwest. More of a blue collar appeal.Again, we keep seeing pictures of - well, he's in a suit right here, but I think the pictures you're going to see, you're going to see more of him in a, you know, in a hunter's jacket and in a t-shirt and at state fairs and in small communities and going out there because that's where the Democrats need to reach. If they can improve their stand - you know, what Joe Biden - you know, Joe Biden's strength, and we've seen - Harris has brought back some of the young people. She's brought back some of the African American vote. She's brought back some of the Latino vote that was disaffected from the incumbent president.

A guy who held on to a very tough congressional seat with a lot of headwinds, in years where there were headwinds at him. So, he's proven he can - he can win in tough climates.

But one of the questions has been, when are we going to see her doing more interviews? When are we going to see her out there? Of course she's going to get asked this question. And she's going to have to manage this because you have a Democratic Party - if you ask Democratic voters and Democratic leaning independents, do you want Vice President Harris to continue the policies of the Biden administration or do something new and different and break out, it's almost evenly divided.So, she's trying to manage this Democratic family. She's done a good job so far. Part of it's just with the energy coming forward, the improving poll numbers. That makes people happy. She's going to get asked these questions. You know, there were people campaigning against Shapiro, not because he was the only Jewish candidate in the race per say, but the idea being that you have so many young voters who are angry over the - over the Israeli government's - what they view as excessive killing of civilians in Gaza. Do you want to risk angering those young voters when you're trying to get them back? Is that fair to Governor Shapiro? I would argue not. The policies of all these governors, or even Senator Kelly, the policies of all the finalists on this were pretty similar that we think - they think Netanyahu has crossed some lines. They also think, you know, don't ever forget that Hamas is a terrorist organization that started, you know, that started all this back on October 7th. Is she going to have to answer these questions? When she does interviews, she will have to answer these questions. And how she answers it will show - you know, she's now the CEO of the Democratic Party.

And if you could make the argument that in a state that's 80,000 votes, you know, if Shapiro gets you a point or a half a point or something like that, or if he just camped out in Pennsylvania, does he help the ticket there? Yes.Look, you can see in the ad spending, you can see in Trump's campaign, you know, reprehensible what happened at the rally in Butler, but where was he, he was in Pennsylvania, right? He - Trump understands how important Pennsylvania was to him in 2016, and how just losing Pennsylvania - you have - the three blue wall states have gone together in every presidential election since 2004. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. They tend to go together. And Pennsylvania, you could argue, is the most complicated one because, you know, you have the African American vote in Philadelphia. Then you have the suburban collar around Philadelphia, where I'm heading as soon as I'm done here today to talk to voters. And then you have, you know, you have the middle of the state, which is very rural. This is what - so Josh Shapiro is the Pennsylvanian who, in 2022, won a very impressive victory in Pennsylvania. So you could argue, looking at the resumes today, that he's your best candidate in Pennsylvania. You can also make an argument is, we live in nationalized climate now. We live in a nationalized election climate. It used to be, you know, the issues in one state, fracking. You know, it might not be an issue in another state, immigration, you know, Arizona versus Pennsylvania, or Ohio versus, you know, pick another one. Now we live in this nationalized climate. And if you look at Minnesota and those small, rural counties and where Walz's House district was, you can overlap those communities with Pennsylvania just fine, and with Wisconsin and with Michigan. Is he as well-known as your own governor? Of course not. But can you get into those communities?
