When I say betwixt and between, of course what we're seeing is these -- they haven't gone positive, but the losses have pared and then gone back down again. So it is anybody's guess what will happen in the last hour of trading, but we'll be together while it takes place. Anyway, Richard, talking to myself, it is only 74 points. We don't need to get too excited about that. The markets and the main events that we do need to talk about. Elon Musk warns that AI brings great promise, and with that comes great danger. The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon resigns after wrestling on whether to carry on for herself and for her country. And Martin Wolf is with me tonight to discuss his latest book, \"The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism.\" And also, as we've just heard, it has just been announced, the President of the World Bank, is to step down early. Martin will give us his thoughts on that. We are live in Dubai, Wednesday, February the 15th. I'm Richard Quest, and yes, I mean business. Now, as I just mentioned, it's been announced that the World Bank President David Malpass, has announced he will resign at the end of June. He was picked to run the bank in 2019 by the former President Donald Trump. His term was due to expire in 2024. He was criticized last year when he fumbled a question at a conference on the causes of climate change. At the time, he told CNN's Julia Chatterley the next day that he was not a climate denier. And indeed, David Malpass will be on \"First Move\" with Julia tomorrow. We'll be speaking to \"The Financial Times\" economist Martin Wolf, about the retirement of what might be behind it in just a moment. Here in Dubai, Elon Musk took center stage on the final day of the World Government Summit. Musk told the crowd that artificial intelligence is one of the biggest risks to civilization, and he called for more regulation. Musk also said he wants a new CEO to replace him at the helm of Twitter by the end of the year. Tesla shares popped on the news. Investors have been very concerned about the lack of attention from Musk as he splits his time across multiple ventures. Speaking earlier, he laid out his plans for Twitter for the rest of the year.

Liberal political systems are being tested by rising authoritarianism. Martin Wolf believes these forces are fraying the ties that bind democracy and capitalism. His new book is called \"The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism.\" And it sets out why it's so important to mend this marriage. Martin is with me from London. You start in a recent article, you reminded us, of course, of your own family background that has -- that suffered so strongly as a result of Nazi in the Second World War and the Holocaust. And you fast forward on to today, so the worrying sign of, if you like, the fraying of the bonds between capitalism and democracy, but what can we do about it? MARTIN WOLF, AUTHOR, \"THE CRISIS OF DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM\":  Well, that's a very big question. I think the first thing we now have to do about it is be aware that we are no longer in normal times. We have moved in different ways to different degrees and let me be very clear, I'm not comparing us with the 30s, of course not. But we moved to times in which the basic compact between -- among the players in the democratic realm, their acceptance of the legitimacy of their opponents and the legitimacy of elections is in question. Many regimes not yet in call, Western States, but many regimes are becoming increasingly undemocratic around the world and that, I argue that in many places, and certainly in the West, part of what is fraying this is the failure to deliver the economic compact on which our societies depend, which is the basic acceptance, and the ability to provide rising living standards for the great majority of the population and economic stability. What we can do about that? Well, we need to run our economies much better, we need to be able to promote growth better, we need to deal with some of the risks that people find so difficult to manage, like sudden surges in imports, for example, which we've handled very, very badly in many countries. And we need also to reconsider how our politics work. We need to find ways of bringing back the wide range of popular opinions into politics.",

But if we want to preserve our system, we need to do some pretty serious work, and the sort of people I write for in \"The Financial Times\" are going to be part of that because they have a great deal of influence. I would have to say that despite all these faults and mistakes that some of what Mr. Biden, President Biden has been trying to do  1to actually get things done to give people hope, to give the chance of believing that government can do things, that's a pretty good start.

Many people feel the bank did not rise to the occasion of COVID and dealing with the problems of COVID for developing countries very well.

But I think, particularly at the World Bank, even more than at the IMF, there are problems there, too, the Americans just haven't done that well. They've tended to choose pretty second or third rate people who, very few members of the staff or the Board have confidence, and of course, it doesn't work very well.

After a series of glitches and safety failures, US aviation officials have been called to testify before Congress. The year began with the failure of an important safety system for Air Traffic Control, and it led to a grounding of all flights. Days later, a near miss, a collision -- near- collision of two passenger planes at Kennedy. You can see here how one almost crossed the runway as the other takes off. And earlier this month, the FedEx plane narrowly avoided colliding with a Southwest passenger jet that was preparing for takeoff.

Now, it is not money because every year, we shovel out billions of dollars on runway and airport improvement projects, but it is an issue of having to get all of the software that we've been working on for 30 years, including NOTAMs, which I'm sure we're going to talk about, but it's a problem of computers and workforce, but most of all, it's a problem of a very bad trendline.",

I suspect it was something in the plane that did do that kind of direction, because you would not lose situational awareness on takeoff, you just would not, and you have sterile cockpit and both pilots are zeroed in on their tasks at that time. So my guess is when this all sorts out, it will be a situation where the computer commanded something, and the pilots weren't watching it closely and pulled the circuit breaker or pulled out the last minute, yet another reason why we will always have pilots in our cockpits and we won't have unmanned passenger planes, at least not in my lifetime.",

But trade -- we cannot live without trade. Trade is what moves goods from one part of the world to another. Trade is what helps us to be resilient.

That means that you need to get it from some other parts of the world and that is why we need trade. And in spite of all the talk about the demise of globalization, there is still robust trade among countries, among all of us, once with the co- member countries know what is going on, let's say that globalization has helped to lift more than one billion people out of poverty, we shouldn't forget that. But there's also no doubt that not everyone benefited. There were poor people in rich countries that were left behind when manufacturing or other jobs were taken and there are poorer countries, there are many on our continent who have not yet benefited.

I think they didn't include the most obvious explanation of all, which is that she's been in power for eight years. For the first seven years, there was hardly any criticism that stuck. That's all gone very sour in the last year because not only has she failed to make any progress at all on forcing the British government into another referendum, but we've seen support for independence falling in Scotland. It's now less than it was at the time of the last referendum, when they lost six years ago. But in addition to that, there's been mounting criticism that she is obsessed by independence and (INAUDIBLE) our health service, our education, all the other issues for which she is responsible, and she has not been giving enough attention to. Now although today was a complete surprise, in the sense that nobody was expecting an announcement today, there has been speculation in the Scottish media and in the British media for some months that she might very well jump at some stage. So in that sense, it's not all that much of a surprise.",
