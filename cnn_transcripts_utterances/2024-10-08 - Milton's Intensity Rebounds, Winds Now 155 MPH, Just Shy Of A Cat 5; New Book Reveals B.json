He's actually someone that I grew up watching as a kid.And an advocate for policy change when it comes to climate change. For years, he's been warning that hurricanes are becoming much stronger, much quicker, and far more common. That's his reaction to watching how Hurricane Milton, in the span of hours, went from being a tropical storm to now flirting with category five winds. The latest update from federal officials, having it just two miles an hour shy of sustained winds that are the highest category of hurricane that are on record. This storm is one of the most powerful ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean. And over the weekend, it was essentially just a tropical storm. We want to get some perspective on the science behind what we're watching unfold in the gulf right now. Joining us is Dr. Marshall Shepherd. He's the director of atmospheric sciences at the University of Georgia. he's an international expert on weather and climate. Doctor, thank you so much for being with us. First, I just want to get your reaction because I am certain that you've been tracking the storm throughout its evolution. What stands out to you about the way that this has rapidly intensified?

Particularly on what we call the dirty side of the eye, that region to the right of center. That's where well see the strongest winds and storm surge.",

There are hurricane warnings and watches through the I-4 corridor.So essentially, it is going to T-bone the state of Florida, as one of CNN's meteorologists put it. Dr. Shepherd, I am curious about how this hurricane compares to Hurricane Helene, which came through the Big Bend region of Florida just two weeks ago. It is rare for hurricanes to approach this way, but it seems like it's becoming more common. Is it?",

We still have cities in Georgia recovering from Helene as well.What concerned me from the start and when I saw what was happening with Milton is it was going to traverse the entire Gulf of Mexico. And that Gulf of Mexico is warmer than average. And we know that there are some climate warming that's likely contributing to that. And that's the fuel supply for these storms. So I was increasingly nervous when I saw the model tracks and, candidly and unfortunately, exactly what we expected is playing out with the storm.",

And I approached an elderly woman who was dumping out some branches and large pieces of a tree that was in her yard. And I was asking her what she thought of the fact that there we're two storms within two weeks, both hitting the same area of Florida. Again, one that is not used to seeing storms of this magnitude. And Dr. Shepherd, she suggested to me that these storms -- that this one in particular, Hurricane Milton, was geoengineering. That somehow it was designed by man to hit Florida at this specific point. Doctor, I cannot believe that I'm asking you this on TV because it sounds absurd. But for folks who believe that, listening to an expert might actually dissuade them. Is it even possible for man to produce something like Hurricane Milton?",

And I'm a member of the National Academy of Sciences.I'm not in on that secret. But what I will say is human beings, through greenhouse gas emissions, have affected our climate. That -- there's no argument there. And that is leading to warmer waters and warmer atmospheric conditions. And so we see rapid intensification in the peer-reviewed literature. Our currency in science suggests the intensity would certainly respond to that type of water. So that's all I can say about that.",

But there is a notable call while Trump is president that Woodward reports on for the first time. And this is a verbatim conversation. It is a conversation between Trump and Putin where we find out that Trump secretly sent a shipment of Covid test machines, the avid Covid test machines at the height of the Covid pandemic when these we're very rare. And here is the conversation between the two men. Putin, \"Please don't tell anybody you sent these to me.\" Trump, \"I don't care.

But I think the thing that will get most attention is notably there is a moment where President Biden says he regrets picking Merrick Garland as his attorney general. He says, quote, \"Should never have picked Garland.

Look at this stat: 80 percent of all fries consumed in the United States are eaten at fast-food restaurants. And, you know, as McDonald's largest customer, Lamb Weston is also really exposed to McDonalds. And, look, Brianna, the way that fast-food chains are trying to lure people back into restaurants is through these value deals. McDonalds has the $5-dollar Meal Deal.
