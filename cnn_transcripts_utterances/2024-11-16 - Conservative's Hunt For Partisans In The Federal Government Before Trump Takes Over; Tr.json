Thank you so much, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.And of course, you don't want to miss this report, \"Is Ozempic Right For You?\" It airs tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. Eastern right here on CNN. All right, hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. All right, top of the hour, let's begin with the latest wave of Trump loyalists being picked to join President-elect Donald Trump's administration. He's tapping campaign staff members Steven Cheung, Karoline Leavitt, and Sergio Gor for key White House roles. He's also selected North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as his Interior Secretary. While Trump's cabinet is taking shape, there are still eight major cabinet positions open. And some of his picks are already facing an uphill climb for Capitol Hill confirmation. Sources tell CNN Trump's transition team was caught off guard by allegations involving his choice for Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. Within 48 hours of his selection, they got a complaint about a sexual assault allegation involving the former Fox News host. CNN's Steve Contorno is covering the developments surrounding the Trump transition. Steve, you also have new reporting on how conservatives are searching for partisans in the federal government before Trump is to actually be sworn into office? STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER: That's right, Fred. There are groups that have been anticipating for years the return of a Republican administration and plans to mass purge the federal bureaucracy of workers. And these groups have been creating a roadmap for how Donald Trump could get rid of civil servants that may be disloyal to him. One of these groups has been putting -- called through public records requests. They look through social media posts. They look through the online biographies and work histories as well as campaign contributions of people within the Department of Homeland Security to find 60 individuals who they have put on a, quote, \"target list\" for Donald Trump to potentially get rid of because they don't believe that these people would help him fulfill his promises on immigration and the U.S. southern border. Another group, the Heritage Foundation, has put out about 65,000 requests for information from government agencies through the Freedom of Information Act, asking for all kinds of records from government employees, including their emails and text messages that may include what they believe are evidence of partisanship. They've been searching for words like Elon Musk or climate change or DEI phrases, trying to find partisans and potentially creating a list of people for Donald Trump to remove once he takes office. Now, the Trump campaign and the transition team did not respond as to whether they are aware of this work. But the people involved in these efforts say that they run in the same circles as Trump's advisers and they believe that it will be used by the team when they get into office.",

We have learning that Donald Trump intends to hit the ground running with a host of executive orders from the moment he gets in, trying to make good on his immigration promises. Let me walk you through some of what that would entail.It would include expanding detention facilities using a lot of private prisons, the return of the remain in Mexico policy that requires people to stay on the southern side of the U.S. border until their immigration status is finalized, mandatory detention of people caught crossing the border, and also bringing back the controversial family detention policy. The big question is how does Trump plan to pay for all these policies and this mass deportation? Well, one idea is to declare a national emergency on immigration that would allow him to unlock Pentagon resources. And Trump has already put in place some of the key advisers who will be leading this immigration effort. And that includes Tom Homan, who will serve as border czar, Kristi Noem, who will be the Homeland Security -- the Secretary of Homeland Security, as well as Stephen Miller, his long-time immigration adviser, who will be a deputy chief of staff. Now, Kristi Noem obviously has to go through a confirmation process first. However, the other two will be just advisers to Trump and will not have to go through that process. Fred?",

Now, a lawyer for the underage girl has called for the ethics report to be released, but I've spoken with witnesses who've been interviewed both for the criminal probe and the Hill probe, and I got mixed reaction when asked if this should be released. Some witnesses don't want to live through it again. They dealt with these salacious allegations for several years while the criminal probe was pending. No charges were brought against the congressman, and they'd rather not relive that. So right now, the question is, will this report be released? And when it is released, how much of this evidence will be included? And also, what else did they learn? They've likely looked at issues far beyond those explored by the Justice Department.

A lawyer representing two women who testified in that probe says one of his clients saw Gaetz have sex with a minor.Let's talk more about all this. Here with me now is Justice Department Correspondent for USA Today, Bart Jansen. Bart, good to see you. So the Department of Justice pursued a years-long sex crimes investigation on Gaetz but did not decide to pursue charges. Might that still weigh in on whether the U.S. Senate ultimately puts him through the confirmation process? BART JANSEN, JUSTICE DEPT. CORRESPONDENT, USA TODAY: Well, that's right. I mean, it's raised big flags for a lot of Republican senators. Republicans, of course, control 53 of the hundred votes in the Senate. So that sounds like a majority. But this week when news of Gaetz's choice being picked for -- to head the Justice Department, Susan Collins of Maine called herself shocked. Lisa Murkowski said it was not a serious choice. Others said they wanted to get a look at some of these investigative materials that have been conducted into Gaetz. The House Ethics Committee investigation began in April of '21. It got suspended for a while while the Justice Department investigated criminal charges. They decided in February of '23 not to press charges against Gaetz. So then the House Ethics Committee resumed its investigation, and we thought we might get a look at a report as early as yesterday, on Friday, but then with Gaetz's departure from the House, with his nomination to the Justice Department, the Ethics Committee no longer says that they will release the report. So now the question is, can the Senate obtain it from the House? Some senators are talking about subpoenaing the report.",

What's the importance of him meeting with Xi? METZL: Well, Joe Biden is sadly a very tragic figure, excuse me, at this point of his career. He's like an aging King Lear at the end of the play. And so the message that Biden is trying to deliver, not just to Xi, but also to our allies, is one of continuity. With Xi, it's we're going to stay tough on China. And there's all kinds of things that China is doing that are totally unacceptable to the United States. But there's a continuity in the policies of tough on China from the first Trump administration, the Biden administration, and now the next, excuse me, Trump administration. But for everybody else, America's allies are even more concerned than our adversaries. For China, for Russia, I think in their heart of hearts, the Trump victory is kind of a win for them. But for our allies, there is deep concern about how President Trump is going to position himself. And so President Biden is representing an America that is familiar to many of us. It's the America of FDR, of President Eisenhower, President Truman, of Ronald Reagan, even. And so that is the message. Nobody is going to think that President Biden is carrying the water for anything really relevant for the future of our country. But America is still here.

China is aggressively harming not just the interests of the United States but the interests of the world.It's basically declared war on America's treaty ally in the Philippines and in the South China Sea. It's working to encircle Taiwan. It's doing everything to support the Russians in Ukraine by arming them. It's hacked into America's communication system. So it's not the case that this is some kind of lovey-dovey relationship. President Biden and the Biden administration has been very, very tough on China. But the Biden administration has been careful to try to have some kind of continuity with that relationship. And so now there's just an unknown about what is going to be the next phase of U.S.-China relations. And there are certainly people in the United States who are saying, oh, great, the new incoming Trump administration is going to be even tougher on China than the Biden administration, which was very tough. But from the perspective of most of the world, the conflicts with China, what's happening with Iran, what's happening with Russia and in Ukraine, it's all kind of connected. And so if President Trump negotiates the kind of surrender to Putin as he negotiated as a surrender to the Taliban, as in the name of ending this conflict, everybody around the world, and especially our adversaries, are going to look at that and say, hey, maybe we have freer rein. The Chinese, freer rein with Taiwan, the North Koreans, the Iranians. And so that's why it's really important, not just for President Biden to say, hey, there's continuity with America, but for President Trump and the incoming Trump administration to say we are going to stand with all of our allies and partners. And they're making maybe some strong messages with regard to China and Iran. But the seeming weakness in the face of Russia isn't just about Russia and Ukraine.

But coming, you know, close to any mountain range so the air traffic control has to remind the flight crew, hey, turn right to avoid a disaster is troubling. And I suspect the airline will be looking into that as well as the FAA. That is a troubling development. But of course, again, no loss of life. And it ended, you know, happily and safely.",

Paul and Tyson seemingly getting acclimated with one another. But then we saw the fall off and it happened very quickly. Tyson trying to pick it up in the third round, but he lost significant stamina. And Paul able to muster some well-timed punches against the former champ.
