Everyone ready for some well-deserved cheer though. Wall Street's carolers not yet in the clear, lots of high C's to hit before closing out the year. And to give you a sense the C's on our Christmas crunch list include Central Banks, the Fed the ECB and the Bank of England all expected to deliver fresh rate hikes this week. And from Central Bankers we have heard on high to long awaited CPI. New U.S. consumer price data out tomorrow, that's Tuesday after a rough read on factory gate prices sunk stocks on Friday. Things won't be merry, if Tuesday's prices are a little hairy, and C is also for Crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried is coming to town or at least expected to testify remotely at U.S. congressional hearing on the FTX failure tomorrow. And C is also for consolidation, the biggest healthcare merger of the year just announced with biotech firm Amgen, buying drug developer horizon therapeutics in a whopping $28 billion deal after a heated global bidding war. And finally C for Cloud, Microsoft today buying a 4 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange as part of a 10-year cloud computing services deal Microsoft will provide the exchange with the next generation data analytics and in the meantime, U.S. stocks trying to move higher after let's call it cloudy week with 3 percent plus losses for the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ. Europe a bit softer to following red arrows across the Asia session investors will likely be cautious ahead of those expected rate hikes this week and of course, also keeping a keen eye on the energy complex. A cold snap in Europe focusing attention once again on soaring electricity prices and the potential for power outages the EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warning of substantial gas shortages in the New Year if the Ukraine war drags on we're showing you pictures of the U.K. I believe there, but we do begin today's show in Ukraine. Ukraine's Defense Minister saying the nation's counter offensive will resume when the ground freezes as it will be easier to move heavy military equipment. Meanwhile, President Vladimir Zelenskyy is attending a virtual G7 meeting today to discuss further aid for Ukraine. Will Ripley, joins us now from Kyiv? Will, good to have you with us President Zelenskyy once again pleading. I think for more support as winter deepens, particularly given they're battling the loss, I believe of around half of their energy system infrastructure. I know you spoke to the Defense Ministers too. What did you speak to him about with regards further protection for the skies and of course, this critical infrastructure with it?",

I mean, we were just down in Odessa, the Southern Ukrainian port city that's had its power grid hammered repeatedly. They were out of power for three days last week when Russia lobbed dozens of missiles at this country and their power station took a direct hit. And then over the weekend, these Iranian made kamikaze drones attack the power grid again, there were 15, drones fired. The Ukrainians shot down 10 of them, but 5 of them detonated when they hit their target these explosive drones can cause severe damage. In this case, they knock out power to nearly everyone in the Odessa region. You're talking about 1.5 million people. So when I spoke with the Defense Minister, the first thing I asked about was Ukraine's plan of action in responding and firing back when these attacks happen.

That was approved by the United States some $275 million in financial aid for the war or cluster munitions warheads. These are really controversial. The Russians have been using them quite a bit, but they have great potential of hurting civilians because they essentially can drop these tiny munitions over a very wide area. And if they don't explode when they hit the ground, they're almost like little mines that people could accidentally walk into. But the Ukrainians are asking for those what they are getting and the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had a phone conversation with the U.S. President Joe Biden, where he thanked President Biden for this latest $275 million Assistance Package. It includes ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket systems, 80,155 millimeter artillery rounds, counter unmanned aerial systems, equipment, and counter air defense capability, ambulances, medical equipment, but 150 generators as well as field equipment.

Bill, great to have you on the show I read everything that I could find when I saw this at the weekend and it replicates a process and you could explain better than me, which takes place in the sun.

You contain that maybe with super strong magnets, that kind of magnets that could lift the battleship. In this particular instance, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, they use the biggest laser in the country to fire at this hydrogen plasma and they say the process did create more energy that they put in. That is sort of the Wright Brothers moment, you know, the first flight, but the data is not complete. In fact, that surprised the scientists according to the Financial Times reporting, and it created so much energy, it might have broken some of their equipment.

So the dream of this is there, but you've seen in all sectors, Julia about what happens when there are these breakthroughs, these tipping points and technology. And there's so much money now pouring into with the inflation Reduction Act here. Other places around the world, they've been building this giant machine to try this in the south of France for a while Oxford University has. So there's sort of a race towards these new technologies. Its how soon we get there, you know, depends on so much. But we've seen it so how fast humans can move in the right direction, if properly motivated and so everybody is anxious. I know people in the scientific community have been buzzing about this possible breakthrough. So we can't wait to find out tomorrow more details. Yes, I mean the U.S. Energy Department. We'll hear from them tomorrow, but I have seen billions of dollars flowing into these private startups that are working on sort of nuclear focused energy and technologies of the future. Can I just ask very briefly, because I'm sure people out there asking what energy went into creating this?

So it's not asintensive as mining cobalt on the floor, the ocean, for example, in order to do EVs. That the promise of this is that the raw materials are so cheap and plentiful, that it could be the breakthrough and unlike nuclear fission, which splits those atoms instead of mashing them together. You don't have to go dig for uranium and plutonium and you know, think about what happens to that loose nuclear material in this facility. So the whole thing is very promising, ideally, but to your point before, priority one now is decarbonizing. You know, the renewables are so cheap now, but they're just adding more capacity not really replacing coal and oil at the rate that a lot of scientists say they should, but hugely promising when we have these breakthrough moments.",

The other thing that's caught my attention in the last few days, Paul, I want to get your take on this is the suggestion from certain quarters and high profile quarters that abusive content is rising on the platform.

I mean, I know that there are definitely many Fortune 500 companies that are weary of Twitter now. And they are not advertising there anymore and that has been a problem for Elon Musk.

And so the momentum had been building since 2001. In terms of profitability, they had a very, very successful year and 2022 so far. Deposits are actually growing still in the system, which you would think that they would be a problem because of the energy shock and how's that keeping the average consumer in Greece? Apparently, it hasn't hit the average consumer, or at least the aggregate. So it's for me, it's actually very revealing the fact that the question came up. By the way that answer was very definitive; it was that there was no consideration for windfall tax rollbacks. On the other hand, on the energy side, Greece was, if I recall, well, one of the first countries to impose a windfall tax, and then the rest of Europe actually followed through, but I don't think the message was there was no intention to kind of accentuate there.

The depth of the technological development since the you know the midst of the crisis has been tremendous Greeks have become a lot more entrepreneurial. I think, as a result of the crisis and a lot of them are the young Greeks which have been putting money and effort into technology. As a result, we've had a couple of unicorns already coming up and I think there's some of them are slated to come to the stock exchange. Now if it's a big ticket item, and its technology, you're likely to end up somewhere in the U.S. initially. So we need to be imaginative on how we attract them back here. And I think the way around it and something that's consistent with our plans is that you are listening Greece and Europe has to offer actually insurance to those technology companies which are still in the initial stages. However successful they've so far - you know, have the U.S. audience but at the other hand, have also the Greek and the European audience giving them a completely different source of funds and navigating through a very, I would say, you know, challenging cycle for technology anyway, but technology is a big factor and the other one that we aim for shipping.",

We have similar stories from Faraday Future from arrival here in the UK in terms of cash burn. And we know for instance, that Rivian is burning through cash, we know that a lead off 6 percent of its workforce over the summer. And we also know that they have this year's expected output, citing supply chain disruption. I thought it was really interesting in the statement when they say they're going to pursue the best risk adjusted returns on their capital investments. That is just clearly not in Europe right now. They have their plant in Illinois. They're planning to double down with a new plant in Georgia near Atlanta, Europe right now off the cards.

There have been calls from some members of the EU's parliament to file a complaint with the WTO, particularly over the subsidies. There are also calls of course for the EU to simply try and match what the U.S. is doing. But that will be so difficult because in terms of the tax cuts, well, that's up to individual member states. In terms of the subsidies the EU currently behaves, according to very strict state subsidy rules that could change.
