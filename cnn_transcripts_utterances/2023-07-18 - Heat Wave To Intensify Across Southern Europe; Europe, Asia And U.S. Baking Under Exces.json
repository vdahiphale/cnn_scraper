Spain, Italy and Greece are baking in temperatures well above normal for this time of year. Residents and tourists are looking for any way they can to beat the heat. And forecasters say the day ahead may be the hottest. Madrid is looking at a high of 41 degrees. Rome can expect 40 degrees and Athens could top 37 degrees.The extreme heat is sparking wildfires across Greece and in Spain's Canary Islands, off the west coast of Africa. Reuters reports thousands of people have been evacuated as nearly 5,000 hectares have burned. The heat is not limited to Europe. Death Valley in California hit 55 degrees Celsius or 132 Fahrenheit on Monday. A dome of high pressure has settled over the region, pushing the mercury to record highs. But nothing compares to the flaming mountains in northwest China. Tourists flocked to the region where the thermometer reached a shocking 80 degrees Celsius on Sunday. CNN's Barbie Nadeau is live this hour in Rome at the Trevi Fountain. She joins us now. Good to see you, Barbie. So, record high temperatures are severely impacting the lives of tourists and residents across Italy and of course other parts of Southern Europe. How are people coping with this?",

But across Europe people are battling the extreme heat just to keep cool. Spain, Italy and Greece are just some of the countries that have been battling the blistering sun for days already. In Italy authorities issued extreme health warnings saying that even hotter temperatures are yet to come. And even for locals, it's sweltering. FEDERICO BRATTI, ROME RESIDENT (through translator): This is not normal. I don't remember such intense heat especially at this time of year. NEDEAU (voiceover): But that didn't stop people from trying to catch a glimpse of the Pope. As priests, nuns, locals and tourists filled out St. Peter's Square. Dancing around in the heat.

Obviously, summertime there but some of these temperatures here especially for places like China, 126 degrees Fahrenheit. 52.2. It has never ever been hotter in any city in China than that right there. That's an all-time country record. So yes, it has been hot and it's still hot. Now there will be a little bit of a tropical system that will cool Beijing down with some clouds and maybe even a shower or two.But that's all part of the front that's going to move on by even in parts of Tokyo cool you down just a little bit as the (INAUDIBLE) just gets a little bit farther to the south there. This is where the rainfall is going to be with the last typhoon Talim, just to the north of Hanoi, likely the heaviest rainfall there. Here's what the radar would likely look like for this. The forecast radar watched the circulation there to the west of Hong Kong. Made landfall on Monday. Still going to put down quite a bit of rainfall though, for today and into tomorrow as we start to see that storm kind of wind down in speed intensity but still bringing an awful lot of tropical moisture with it. Here's the rainfall across from Tokyo and Seoul. This is where the area is going to cool down a little bit with that cloud cover. And then we take a look at what South Korea had. Almost the half a meter in many spots and more than a half a meter in just a few. We certainly don't need any more rainfall there across parts of South Korea. The heat is still on in Europe, it's not really going away. Northwestern Europe is an absolutely has been very, very cool. But it's the Mediterranean down here. Italy, Rome all the way into Greece, temperatures are going to be the hottest set. They'll be on Tuesday. Beginning to cool back down just a little bit. But Rome, 41 in the afternoon, that's going to be a very hot day. Then the hottest for the rest of the week as we cooled down back into 30s. But that's still well above normal for Rome. So above normal for Athens as well and not really cooling down there much. Temperatures in the afternoon, right around 40 degrees. The United States still has this heat dome over to the desert southwest, and we call it a desert Southwest because it doesn't rain there very much in the summertime. But when it doesn't rain, an awful lot like when India doesn't get the monsoon on time. It can get very, very hot and there will be showers and there will be a southwest monsoon here in parts of the United States Southwest. That will cool the area down in the afternoon where it won't heat up as much. But it will be muggy and the heat index will go way up. We'll see temperatures and Death Valley, not very many people live there. But people want to go there to visit, to feel what 50 degrees Celsius really feels like. Las Vegas, you'll be in the middle 40s. Even in the afternoon, there will be a couple of showers around to just starting that little bit of monsoon there across parts of the Desert Southwest. So yes, the heat is on. And it seems like worldwide. Very few record low places, if any, across the globe right now. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Kerry also had a message to convey from the U.S. president.He said that Joe Biden values his relationship with Xi Jinping and is very committed to civility in the U.S.-China relationship and to achieve efforts together that makes significant difference to the world. Now yesterday, Kerry met with his counterpart Xie Zhenhua for nearly 12 hours. Wang praised Kerry and Xie for their hard work throughout the talks. And Kerry said in a tweet, Rosemary. And we might bring that up for you that the climate crisis demands the world's two largest economies to work together to limit the Earth's warming and take urgent action on coal and methane pollution. Now climate experts have said that any move to cooperate on methane, a greenhouse gas responsible for roughly 30 percent of global warming could provide a way forward. Now this is Kerry's third visit to China as U.S. climate envoy and really marks the formal resumption of top- level climate diplomacy between the two countries. He of course, is the third top U.S. official to visit Beijing in the past month. There was a U.S. Secretary of State, followed by the Treasury Secretary, now John Kerry. It is hoped, Rosemary, that U.S. and China will be on the same page ahead of the U.N. Climate Conference Cop 28 at the end of November in Dubai. Back to you.",

That is because one, he was or is trying to second highest diplomat after Wang Yi. He's spent his whole career working as a diplomat. He was promoted to the Foreign Minister post last December after working as the Chinese Ambassador of the U.S.He was a well-known voice in Washington speaking on behalf of Beijing's interests. Even in an aggressive tone that made him unpopular with a lot of other diplomats from, certainly from the west. He was a trusted aide though of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. And that's the reason why he was installed into this important position because Xi, when he received that unprecedented presidential term, the third presidential term, he essentially surrounded himself an analysts say with an echo chamber of yes men and Qin Gang was believed to be one of them. He met with Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States Antony Blinken during his visit to Beijing in June. But he was last seen in public on June 25, when he met with Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister. This absence is incredibly noteworthy given the flurry of diplomatic activity that he has missed during the period that he's been disappeared. He missed meetings with Janet Yellen, John Kerry two top U.S. officials. And last week, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs only offered the explanation that this health reasons, were the reason why he has been absent for so long. And then they said that China's diplomatic activities are continuing on as usual. So, that brief health reasons excuse that someone calling it from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has a lot of people in China wondering, what really happened? And there are all these rumors online, rumors that are frankly driven by the real lack of transparency inside the government in Beijing. When you're talking about the Communist Party and particularly Communist Party officials under investigation when people are disappeared and it may be months before the world learns what happened.
