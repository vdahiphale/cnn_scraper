Far outpacing the rates seen in previous years with an average of nearly two mass shootings per day. It's a crisis that is sweeping across the country. It could be described as a uniquely American tragedy with the U.S. drastically leading in gun deaths compared to all other countries on the planet. Today, though, the White House is set to announce new actions it hopes will combat this epidemic of violence. President Biden will unveil the first ever federal Office of Gun Violence Protection, something that advocates have wanted for years. Joining us now Stefanie Feldman. She is the director of the new office. Thanks so much for taking the time.",

He helped enact the first ban on assault weapons in 1994. Even just in this administration, he signed into law the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which is the most significant gun violence legislation in nearly 30 years. And he has taken dozens of executive actions. But his message today is that he hears from survivors across the country when he privately spends hours mourning with them, grieving with them. He hears their message of do something. Today, he is announcing an office, which will help do more.",

It includes $750 million, for instance, to help states implement these crisis intervention programs, sometimes known as Red Flag laws. We have seen, though, in some, sadly, many of these shootings, where those laws have failed, where there have been red flags but they haven't been enough to prevent a gun from getting into the hands of someone who wants to do bad things. So tell us how this new office is going to help guide those resources that are already in the pipeline.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a great point. Because having a Red Flag law is really important but it's only a little piece of the job.We also have to make sure that people, and that's general members of the public, that's law enforcement, that's health care providers, that's educators, we have to make sure that they know these tools exist and how to deploy them in an effective way. So the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, as you said, gives states the option to use money to enhance education about Red Flag laws. With this office and the new capacity and platform we will be able to bring together governors and state officials and health agencies and law enforcement agencies to make sure that we are helping them understand that these laws exist. Why it matters to make sure that the public knows about them ,and really expand our education campaign so these are keeping guns out of the hands of people.",

You go back to Sandy Hook, you go to Parkland, particularly when children are involved. And then you will sometimes see them up on the Hill pushing. And you will hear some lawmakers, even some Republicans say we have to do something and then it doesn't happen. What evidence do you have, does the president have, that we have at a tipping point, not just of frustration, but of action?",

      "sentences": "So I think that the president hears this firsthand when he travels across the country and he talks to young people. He talks to moms. He talks to survivors of gun violence.As I said. He's been to Monterey Park, he's been to Uvalde, he's been to Buffalo. There is a sense that people have just had enough and the president and Kamala Harris hear this loud and clear, which is why they're excited to drive this work forward. And I think our biggest hope is that young people, Generation Z, in particular, is sick and tired of living in a country where they have to live in constant anxiety of gun violence. And they are demanding better from their elected officials. And President Biden is helping lead the way. SCIUTTO: I think about it every day I drop my kids off at school. I'm sure a lot of parents watching do the same, Stefanie Feldman, we appreciate the work you're doing. Thanks so much for joining us today.",

And when I came out, the wave hit me in my back.And I didn't have too much time to put my hands up. It was shallower than I thought, and I hit my head on the bottom. My whole body just went limp and numb. And I knew I couldn't move. After that I woke up in the hospital in this rotating bed. When the doctor told me that I broke the sixth vertebrae in my neck, and that I was paralyzed, I was devastated. I mean, like, I'm 17 years old. I'm in high school. I'm about to be a professional surfer and now I'm paralyzed. All I wanted to do was just be a kid and be with my friends. And it was a difficult time because I didn't know what my life was going to look like. WIRE (voice-over): Growing up for me, sports were my life, just like Jesse Billauer. My dream was to make it to the NFL. I made it. But in my sixth season, I had a really scary moment. I hit this guy and his head came down and slammed right on top of mine and I got this burning sensation down my neck. There was this tingling sensation like pins and needles down my right arm. And I didn't really have any strength in it. So, I needed surgery. They put a plate and four screws keeping my fifth and sixth vertebrae together. Fortunately for me, I was able to come back. But not everyone who gets a spinal cord injury can make it out on the other side the same as they were before. What happened to Jesse, it probably would have completely ruined most of us.
