And as we were mentioning just a few moments ago, before this got started, a few minutes early, we should note, we were talking about how this is very personal day for President Biden as well as son, Beau, died at the age of 46 years old from cancer after serving in Iraq with the Delaware Army National Guard. The President talks about this from time to time, how this personal sacrifice is, obviously left a tremendous mark on his life. Kevin, your thoughts?",

      "sentences": "Yes, very much. So on the ninth anniversary of that death, just coming up later this week. And I think for President Biden, when he's standing there in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, certainly thinking about the decisions that he has made an office, the very responsibility that he holds to men and women in uniform in this country of protecting freedoms at home and abroad. And certainly, that's a responsibility that weighs very heavily on President Biden.And, you know, Jim, I was in driving into work today, I drove past the World War II Memorial. And you'll remember we're coming up now on the 80th anniversary of D Day, in about a week and a half time. President Biden will be there in northern France next week, remembering the thousands of American and allied troops has -- who died as part of the Normandy landings, all in the eye of protecting democracy in Europe. And I think that has been such a consuming focus for President Biden, it's particularly in this election year, talking about the importance of defending and protecting democracy. And I thought it was interesting what he said at West Point over the weekend, telling those cadets that democracy isn't guaranteed that every generation has an obligation to defend it, and to choose it. And certainly that's a very resonant message on Memorial Day, particularly at such a fraught international moment, the President dealing with those grinding wars in Ukraine and Gaza. He has made a commitment not to deploy American troops to those conflicts, but certainly the risks of Americans abroad very real for this President, Jim.",

The President will be there and you know, there are two sites probably on this earth that symbolizes America sacrifice for freedom and democracy around the world. That would be Arlington National Cemetery in Normandy. Kevin Liptak, thank you very much for all of that. Really appreciate it.In the meantime, more than 120 million Americans are in the path of severe weather on this Memorial Day after powerful storms including tornadoes swept through the central U.S. over the weekend, at least 19 people were killed across four states. Oklahoma was one of the hardest hit with homes reduced to rubble. There's still a state of emergency in Arkansas due to extensive damage from the storms. Eight people there were killed. This tornado you're looking at right there tore through Kentucky on Sunday leaving behind a trail of devastation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They'll hear from prosecutors and defense lawyers one last time before deliberating on a verdict. Trump's attorneys are expected to focus heavily on his former fixer Michael Cohen, who prosecutors will try to convince the jury that Trump committed felonies to save his 2016 campaign.Joining me now, CNN senior political commentator, former Trump campaign adviser David Urban, lawyer and jury consultant Linda Moreno and defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. Guys, great to see all of you. Thanks for coming in. Shan, let me start with you first. I mean, what do we think is going to happen tomorrow? We'll see obviously the defense go and then the prosecution. There has been some talk that these closing arguments could take all day. That sounds like a long time.

I'm very interested to see what the defense is going to do. I mean, to me, they've done sort of a poor job because it's too much of a scattergun strategy. It's kind of like a throw everything at the kitchen wall, see what sticks, with Trump's favorite foods being with they're throwing, insults and shame. That hasn't presented a really coherent way of attacking the prosecution.They could do a better job by weaving together some strands of what they didn't cross really focusing on this one issue, which is insufficient evidence perhaps that Trump really directed the way the reimbursements were covered up in the accounting that can help them manage Stormy Daniels thinks she doesn't really know anything about it. And that could give them a smaller target on Michael Cohen instead of just claiming he lies, he lies. For the prosecution, if the defense completely focuses on Michael Cohen lying --",

Zero impact on the on Trump's favorability rating, et cetera. And, you know, we'll see what the outcome of the case is, ultimately, if it's a hung jury, or there's an acquittal or full outright acquittal, which I think is unlikely in this case, because I think the prosecution has failed to meet their burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump, you know, did these events. This isn't a hush money case. This is an accounting case.And I think they failed to carry their burden here by even presenting, you know, Michael Cohen, could have been the star witness, but Allen Weisselberg is going to loom large in these closing arguments, I think, from the from the defense's perspective, saying, no, if there's one person you want to hear from the man who calculated these payments, whose handwriting is on these notes, why didn't the prosecution call him because presumably, he would have rebutted Michael Cohen's testimony. So I think at the end of the day, Jim, this is going to have very little impact on the election overall, and perhaps even a positive impact if there's acquittal or hung jury.",

He's former Assistant Secretary of State for Political Military Affairs. General Kimmitt, always good to talk to you. Really appreciate it. Your reaction to this airstrike on this -- it was sort of a camp of displaced Palestinians. Israel says they're investigating, what's your sense of what took place there? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, I think the right thing to do is investigate this because there are reports that they were going after terrorist leaders, the terrorist Hamas leaders from the West Bank. But it would seem to me that that's pretty close to a populated area, in terms of collateral damage, and what we just seen happen. So I think I'd wait to see the outcome of this investigation. But it does seem like this was pretty close to a civilian area. And there's some very, very clear rules in international law against that type of operation.",
