There's a video of the drone right there.And that's when these two Russians Sukhoi SU-27 fighter jets tried to carry out an interception, an unsafe and unprofessional, even reckless interception, according to the US, fly in front of, repeatedly this drone, and then dumped jet fuel before colliding with the drone, according to the US, damaging the propeller and forcing the US to take down its own drone over the Black Sea and into international waters there. The US putting out some very harsh statements about how this played out and how reckless the Russian fighter jets were throughout the course of this intercept. In fact, not only dumping the jet fuel but also hitting the jet, and that's the drone there, that is, and that's why this is viewed with such severity. The Russians putting out their own version of events, saying that, in fact, there was no collusion and that the Russian jets didn't shoot at the US drone in any way -- Anderson.",

And in fact, the National Security Council coordinator for Strategic Communications has said there have been intercepts over the course of the past recent weeks between Russian aircraft and US drone. So that's not the uncommon part. Of course, the uncommon part, the in fact, incredibly unusual part is this collision here that forced the US to take down its own drone. It is worth noting that John Kirby told us earlier today Jake Tapper that the US has taken steps to protect its own equities. Now, what exactly that means is unclear whether that's some sort of self-destruct or other step to make sure that this couldn't and didn't fall into Russian hands.",

The US has repeatedly carried out missions -- surveillance missions over the Black Sea over the course of the past year. This is an example of that. This is just yesterday, a different kind of drone, an RQ-4 Global Hawk flying repeatedly back and forth over the Black Sea. The thicker that line gets -- the thicker that red line gets, the flight track of this drone, the more times the drone was flying over the Black Sea. So it's not at all uncommon for the US to be operating in international airspace over the Black Sea. Again, what's uncommon here is what the Russians did next, and that is one of those Russian fighter jets colliding with a US drone over the Black Sea, a potentially very escalatory step. The US however, keeping the response in the diplomatic lane, although the National Security Council says they will keep doing what they have every right to do and that is fly US drones in international airspace over the Black Sea in the future as they have done repeatedly in the past -- Anderson.",

So how big a deal is this in your view? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It's a big deal, Anderson. First I'll separate it though a little bit because NATO has something called air policing, the NATO Air Police Mission. They scrambled jets to intercept Russian airplanes coming into NATO airspace, US airspace all the time. In fact, there were over 500 scrambles last year by NATO Air Policing. What's unusual, though, is this closeness to a drone. Yes. The thing that's not mentioned is these drones fly very slowly. They're not something that can be intercepted well by a fast moving Sukhoi fighter aircraft, and to have this kind of experience and to knock it out of the sky is something that escalates things greatly. You know, it goes back to what John Kirby was saying, Anderson, about how Russian aircraft and their patrol crafts are very unsafe, unprofessional, and untrained in the way they do some of these intercepts and it just shows itself in this kind of situation. COOPER: Well, I mean, you said that these kinds of intercepts are common and just the knocking out of the sky part, the actual physical contact is different.

They don't like people to know where their ships are, they don't know people that know what's going on in their area of operation. So this is not a killer drone. This is a drone that collects Intelligence and Communications. So they want it out of the area, even though it's in international waters, and has every right to be there doing the things that it's doing. So it's an Intelligence collection platform, Anderson, either on Russian military operations or merchant operations to make sure that embargo goes as it's supposed to go.",

It doesn't have a pilot that can turn his head both ways or quickly maneuver a slow moving jet or excuse me, a slow moving turbo engine plane out of the area.So to have two jets approach this thing and knock it off course, just again shows the unsafe, unprofessional way the Russians are doing business. You know a drone isn't going to react like an F-16 does, where they can counter the maneuver and those are the kinds of aircraft that are usually intercepted or scrambled when the Russians and other NATO forces get involved in these kinds of intercept missions.",

He may have gotten permission to dump fuel and to get close, but to actually knock that drone out of the sky, that takes it up a notch. You know, I will tell you a quick story, Anderson, when I was Commander in US Army Europe, we used to have conferences with our partners at USAFE, the US Air Force Europe, and I remember a General officer at USAFE, not the Commander once telling me that one of his big concerns and big challenges in the area was how unsafe Russian pilots were when they did these intercept missions.

Again, the Russian Defense Ministry insisting that no weapons were used against the drone and that there was no contact whatsoever. And there, there is a direct contradiction with what The Pentagon has been saying has taken place there. I also found it interesting that the Russian Ambassador specifically said that Russia does not want confrontation with the US. He did use some diplomatic language here, but he added that the fact that this drone was flying towards Russian air space, where Russia has imposed rules in connection to what it calls its special military operation, what the rest of the world calls its invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war here and that was basically a provocation and that the Russian jets responded -- Anderson.",

The GOP lawmakers they lost the case at the State level last year, appealed to the US Supreme Court. They're also having this redo at the North Carolina Supreme Court since they now have a Republican majority on the bench there.Talk a little bit about this case why you're so focused on it, why you think it's so egregious. HOLDER: It's a pretty breathtaking thing what Republicans are trying to do in North Carolina. When they drew the maps, the original maps and tried to redistrict the State both at the State legislative level and with regard to the House of Representatives, they drew maps that the previous iteration of the North Carolina Supreme Court said were unconstitutional gerrymanders. And to give you a sense of that, one of the people who was responsible for the drawing of that gerrymandered mat said that, you know, what we're trying to do was to draw a map that had 11 to three -- 11 Republicans, three Democrats. The North Carolina Supreme Court said no, you can't do that. North Carolina is a pretty much a 50/50 state. President Biden lost the State by about two percent. Governor Cooper is a Democrat and now serves as Governor. After the previous iteration of the Supreme Court looked at the case and decided the maps were unfair gerrymanders and new maps were drawn, guess what? You had a congressional delegation that was seven to seven, seven Democrats, seven Republicans. The North Carolina Supreme Court flips. The only Court that flips from Democrat to Republican control, and now, it appears that this new iteration of the North Carolina Supreme Court is looking at a decision that was only put in place, I guess, three, four or five months ago by the Supreme Court of the same State, and may reverse that case. And you know, what's bothersome about this is that this is a decision that could be based on personnel as opposed to principle and precedent. And it is also something that is disturbing, because it's consistent with what we're seeing in the United States Supreme Court. The overturning of Roe, I think is a function of personnel, not principle and not adherence to precedent.",
