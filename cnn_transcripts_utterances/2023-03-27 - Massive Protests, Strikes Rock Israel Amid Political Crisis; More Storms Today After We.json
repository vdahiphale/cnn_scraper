Now, a huge nationwide strike is grinding Israel to halt. The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is under intense pressure to back down from his controversial plan to overhaul the nation's court system.

That is incredibly worrying because this is something the Israeli president had been warning about now for weeks. He is warning that there could be bloodshed on the streets between Israelis, he is warning about a civil war. And so there is an incredible amount of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu, even hearing from other members of his own government, saying they will support Netanyahu if he announces a freeze. There are some Israeli media reports that he's currently in consultations with members of his right-wing government. These are the people who used to be the fringe politicians in Israeli politics. Now, they are sitting ministers. There are some reports that some of them are still holdouts and want him to push through this legislation, but I honestly cannot see how we could stand.

So, joining us now to untangle all of these lingual legal entanglements, the ones facing Donald Trump, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Mr. Elie Honig. Good morning, Elie.

      "sentences": "Yes, Don, so many different legal issues swirling around Donald Trump. Now the grand jury is back in session 3.1 miles from where we stand right now down at the courthouse in Lower Manhattan looking at this hush money payments scheme. Of course, this focuses on the $130,000 that Donald Trump paid through Michael Cohen, his attorney at the time, to Stormy Daniels in hush money.Really important to understand, paying hush money is not a crime. So, what could the crimes be here that they're potentially looking at? We are in state court here. Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg is in charge of this case. So, under New York State law, there's a potential misdemeanor crime here for falsification of business records. The thought would be if they falsely classified these hush money payments as attorney's fees, that could satisfy the misdemeanor. Also this could become a felony if they falsified those records in order to commit some other second crime. So what could that be, what second crime? It could be a violation of campaign finance laws. Now, to that extent, Donald Trump's team has been saying they may use a defense like the one used by John Edwards. John Edwards was charged federally with a similar offense back related to his 2008 campaign. He was acquitted in the federal courts. The case was then dismissed. He beat the case by arguing the payments were not related to the campaign. They were related to avoiding personal embarrassment. Now, here's what the process is going to be. When Alvin Bragg has done putting his witnesses in the grand jury, he can decide whether to ask the grand jury to vote on an indictment. If they do vote, that will happen quickly. This is not a trial jury where these things take days. If the grand jury votes, it will be quick. If they do vote, yes, we will have an indictment. That's a sample indictment from another case. But that indictment will be under seal, meaning we won't see it in the public until the time of Donald Trump's arraignment in court. That's typically when these things get unsealed. So, there could be a brief period of time here where we know there's an indictment but we can't actually see what's in it.",

He has warned of the increasing threat of nuclear war. And Ukraine believes that these plans show that Russia is not making progress on the battlefield and is instead trying to distract. A top Ukrainian adviser tweeting that Putin is admitting his afraid of losing and all he can do is scared with tactics. Joining us now is former National Security Adviser to former President Trump John Bolton. Good morning, Ambassador, and thank you for being here. Do you think Putin is bluffing when he makes these comments?",

In a sense, he may actually move tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus, which is its own separate problem, something I don't think we're paying enough attention to, which is the potential re-absorption of Belarus into Russia.But, militarily, even if he did that, it really wouldn't make that much difference, in my view, because of what we know our extensive nuclear supplies, missiles, cruise missiles, drones and warheads in Kaliningrad, an exclave, a piece of Russia that separated from Russia itself by Lithuanian Poland. That's a place which has long been basically a Russian military facility going back to Soviet Union days, and it's had missiles there which were actually in violation of the INF treaty, which the U.S. withdrew from some years back. So, the capabilities Russia already has in the Kaliningrad enclave are the ones that that could be most threatening. I don't think the idea of moving some tactical nuclear weapons into Belarus changes that balance.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think this is really an epical clash between the left and the right in Israel. There are huge philosophical differences here. I think it goes beyond judicial reform, it goes beyond Netanyahu himself. The one thing, I must say, I cannot understand is how people believe that Netanyahu's effort to change the judicial nomination process is a threat to democracy.I think the way Israel has its judicial nominations set up now is undemocratic. It's the new judges are picked by a panel of existing judges and lawyers. So, it's a self-perpetuating oligarchy unaccountable to elected representatives. It seems to me to be about as far from a democratic way to pick judges, as you can imagine. Some of the other proposals I think are more controversial, would certainly be controversial in our country, but the idea that the judges select their successors I just think strikes me as fundamentally anti-democratic. Maybe somebody can explain how it's consistent with democratic theory, as we know it in the west as a whole, but I don't see it.",

But do you expect that he's going to have to compromise on this given the outrage you're seeing? I mean, they're shutting down the highways, planes were temporarily halted from taking off, stores are closing, even the justice minister is saying that he would accept whatever decision Netanyahu would make here. That's significant because it could, say, give him some space to back off of what he was pushing ahead with.",
