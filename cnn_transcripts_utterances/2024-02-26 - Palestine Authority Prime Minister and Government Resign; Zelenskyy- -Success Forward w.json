A warning from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Moscow could attempt a new offensive in a matter of months. The U.S. presidential candidates are looking ahead to the Michigan primary on Tuesdays. Nikki Haley vows to stay in the race against Donald Trump. And an improbable wins for Liverpool against Chelsea to take the Carabao Cup. Right we're keeping a close watch on the markets in New York, they'll open in about 30 minutes from now, as you can see, were slightly in the green across the board. It was a record setting week, last week we had very strong results from Nvidia and all of that good news really boosting the markets. We're also expecting a lot of economic data out in the next few days, which will also be market moving. Now moving to news and a new reality in the Gaza Strip with those words, the Palestinian Authority Prime Minister handed in his government's resignation, the move presumably paving the way for a new authority to take on a new role after the war between Israel and Hamas. In December, my colleague Becky Anderson spoke with the Prime Minister at the Doha forum here is what he said about Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RIYAD AL-MALIKI, PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY FOREIGN MINISTER: It's very important if we are want to talk about a you know technocratic government, if we want to talk about the rhetorical unity between West Bank and Gaza, if we want to talk about reconstruction, if we want to talk about ceasefire and the deal to release hostages, we have to talk to everybody, including Hamas. Otherwise, you know, we cannot achieve all these objectives that we intend to achieve. So it's very important to open up and to find, you know, a consensus among opens the benefactors about you know, where we want really to go.

There is a lot of focus here in Washington on what's being called the day after. And that is essentially what Palestinian governance is going to look like, not just in Gaza and in the West Bank. But the U.S. knows that the only way to get to that later stage of the conversation is essentially to crack open the door. And to get a hostage deal in place. A release of hostages would also lead to a pause in the fighting and is during that pause that initially could be at least six weeks long negotiators say, that would open the door to these conversations that are so important about Palestinian governance later on security, rebuilding, getting aid into Gaza and all the rest. There does seem to be progress on those conversations, on those discussions about getting the hostage and truce deal in place. We know that there are meetings taking place today in Doha that comes immediately on the heels from another set of meetings that took place on Friday in Paris. And that is a good sign I'm told. The officials who are meeting today in Doha, these are technical teams who are essentially being sent in to work out the fine details of what an agreement would look like. The meeting in Paris on Friday was a higher level discussion with the CIA Director, his Egyptian and Israeli counterparts as well as the Qatari Prime Minister. So this meeting today in Doha is that as at a lower level, but it's incredibly important because this is where they're going to essentially dot the i's and cross the t's for an agreement. Yesterday, the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, from the White House said that they do have what he called the broad contours of a deal, Eleni.",

His team arenow saying that the when negotiations underway, and they've reached the final stage for him to be released, and the final stages was reached just before he died the day before. That's what the Navalny team was saying. As part of a prisoner swap deal, which would have seen Alexei Navalny be swapped along with two U.S. prisoners most likely Evan Gershkovich to Wall Street Journal has been held in reporter has been holding Russia. And Paul Whelan, a Former U.S. Marine, he's also been held in prison here in exchange for a Russian national being held in Germany. Now there had been -- it's not a secret, these negotiations have been underway. And there have been rumors that Alexei Navalny was part of that negotiation for some months. But this is the first time that Alexei Navalny's team have come out publicly and said yes, this is the case, we were sort of trying to get Alexei Navalny out, as part of that sort of negotiation between the United States, Germany and Russia. I've spoken to the Kremlin over the course of the past few minutes. And they said they've got no knowledge of that agreement at all, and so that they're not corroborating what Alexei Navalny's team is saying and we have no corroboration either from the United States or from the Germans. But as I say, it is an extraordinary twist. This idea that Alexei Navalny was on the cusp of being released in a prisoner swap only to be pronounced dead, the next day, it is Arctic prison colony. Well, as you mentioned, there's been some other developments as well, Navalny's team, announcing that they are intending to hold a memorial service, a farewell service they say by which we assume means the funeral for Alexei Navalny. At the end of this working week, they're not being specific on which day but obviously, that means Friday, possibly the day before work to get more specifics soon. What's interesting is that this is going to be a public farewell for Alexei Navalny. And that's a means it could be an extraordinary focus for possible anti-government protests. I mean, already, there's been an outpouring of thousands of people paying their respects to Alexei Navalny at makeshift memorials across the country. This could be another opportunity for people to gather and voice their opposition to what happens to him.",

Now the loss of Lastochkyne which is about three miles northwest of Avdiivka is not in itself, particularly important. But it is a sign that after Ukraine withdrew under immense Russian pressure from Avdiivka two Saturdays ago the Russian momentum has not stopped. That's something we were warned about by Ukrainian military officials at the time of the loss of Avdiivka and Russia said it would make hay on its gains in Avdiivka too. We've seen attempts at that along the front line, no enormous success in the past 10 days, but it is this departure by Ukraine from Lastochkyne. Some strategists saying, look, this was to some degree likely because the positions that Ukraine has adopted further back are easier to defend. And essentially, this is just them settling in for a potentially a longer defense. Well, still, I think, unfortunately, it is still bad news continuing for Ukraine here. And so Volodymyr Zelenskyy, giving that first casualty number we've heard officially of Ukrainian military losses significantly less than some Western analysis. And he claimed that Russia had lost five or six times as many soldiers during the fighting here as well, as you say we can't independently verify it. But Volodymyr Zelenskyy I think really facing a difficult message yesterday as we enter now into the second day of the third year, we are seeing him trying to desperately reassure Ukrainians that if they don't get American aid, they could still potentially hold on they could still potentially win. Because I think he accepts it's very possible that money is not coming. While at the same time sound that fire alarm to Western allies about how utterly urgent it is. Strikes continuing overnight, relentlessly around the country lives lost over the weekend after relentless strikes around a desert too.

This was a public event, where audience members have the opportunity to ask questions to lawmakers, to leaders in Oklahoma, including Republican State Senator Tom Woods. The woman who asked the questions name is Katie Koch (ph) she's 64-years- old, and she asked about laws in Oklahoma that target people who are LGBTQ plus. In an interview with CNN, she said that she asked what is the legislature in Oklahoma's obsession with people who are LGBTQ. And she also said that she was concerned that those laws embolden possible violence against people who are non-binary. She spoke about a next Nex Benedict 16-year-old student from Oklahoma, who according to body camera video, as well as information that their guardian provided to the \"Independent\", which is another news outlet. But we feel comfortable at this point reporting what they have reported, was that Nex Benedict gotten to a fight at their high school Owasso West High School. And the next day Nex Benedict died. We don't yet know, in what way the fight might have contributed to Nex Benedict's death. The police at this point are saying that Nex Benedict did not die of trauma, so certainly many more questions about that. But that was a huge story. And Oklahoma has many people asking questions. Has many people seeking answers, Katie caught asked about that, mentioned that in her questioning of Republican Senator Tom Woods. And which elicited Republican Senator Tom Woods to say that his heart goes out to Nex Benedict's family, but then followed up with what you heard, which was him saying that they don't want that filth in Oklahoma. So that was the greater context here certainly as the story moves forward, many more questions about Nex Benedict's death. CNN is pressing Republican Senator, Republican State Senator Tom Woods for answers about why he said that and pushing for some accountability there. We have not yet heard back.
