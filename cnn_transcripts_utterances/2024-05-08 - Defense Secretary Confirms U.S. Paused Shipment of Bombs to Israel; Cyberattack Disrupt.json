But certainly Israel has done a great deal in terms of killing or capturing literally hundreds and perhaps even thousands. I don't know the count of Hamas terrorists.So from the standpoint of attempting to eradicate the organization inside of Gaza, I would give them probably very good marks. Unfortunately, they've done it in an area that's very difficult to operate in, as you just said a minute ago, with so many civilians and so much infrastructure. But of course, that's Hamas's strategy, to wrap themselves in the Palestinian civilians in the area, cause damage to them, continue to embarrass the Israeli Defense Forces and the state of Israel, and also to keep the war going as long as they can. Time is on Hamas's side because the world is generating a lot of distaste for this operation, rightfully so, because of the way Israel has conducted it. So these are the strategies of a terrorist organization, and it's been extremely complicated and complex for the Israeli government and especially the IDF to continue this fight.",

Pretty standard procedure when you have something like this that could be a ransomware attack.We don't know if it is, but it kind of has the hallmarks of a ransomware attack where you need to isolate things and say, OK, don't connect to our systems anymore until we can get this under control. It's very much a fluid situation. This is a huge health care network. They run about 140 hospitals in the U.S. and 40 senior living facilities.

And, you know, doctors and researchers say this isn't necessarily incredibly surprising because weight loss can be associated with infertility improvement in folks who may have irregular cycles, for example. Due to a syndrome like PCOS, polycystic ovary syndrome or other reasons for having an abnormal menstrual cycle. So losing five to 10 percent of your body weight or even more, which we've seen with these medicines, can help with infertility.Another thing to be aware of with these medicines is that Tirzepatide based drugs, those are Zepbound and Mounjaro, actually have a warning in their prescribing information that they may make birth control pills less effective. And that's probably because these drugs work by in part by slowing down digestion of food. And that can affect the absorption of medicines taken by mouth. Guys, we did talk with one young mom. She'd been trying for two years to get pregnant. She went on Mounjaro for weight loss. She lost about 40 pounds over five months. That's Katara Bentley you see there. She got unexpectedly pregnant while taking Mounjaro. And she was delighted. But she was also a little nervous about the effects that the drug could have on her baby, guys.",

And so scientists and doctors are relying on sort of real world evidence.And there are few studies available so far in what's happened in humans who have been taking these drugs during pregnancy. We are getting more data from registries, essentially from accidents when people are unexpectedly becoming pregnant. So far, the human data have not turned up any major causes for alarm. There are some causes for alarm in the animal data, though. So the recommendation is stop these drugs two months before trying to conceive or immediately if you do become pregnant.
