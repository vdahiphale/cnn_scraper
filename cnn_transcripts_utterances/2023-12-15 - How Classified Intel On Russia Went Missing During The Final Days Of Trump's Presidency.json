The information relates to Russian election interference, information that was deemed so sensitive, it can only be accessed at the CIA. And the people working with the Intel had to keep their notes locked in a safe at CIA headquarters.Yet in the final weeks of the Trump administration, a binder of this intel was brought to the White House at the request of the president as part of an effort to declassify documents. And in the final chaotic hours of his presidency, that binder disappeared. CNN's Katie Bo Lillis is part of the team that broke this story. Katie Bo, this is remarkable reporting. What can you tell us?",

The disappearance of this binder was so alarming to intelligence officials that according to our sources, they actually briefed Senate Intelligence Committee leadership about the situation last year. Now, we are told by one U.S. official familiar with the matter that this was not among the classified items that were found in last year search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort and it wasn't why the FBI searched Trump's residence. But what is true, Sara, is that for more than two years after it went missing, this intelligence does not appear to have been found.",

This intelligence was part of this massive collection of documents that he ordered brought to the White House and there was this kind of frantic scramble in the final days of the administration to redact the documents, so they could be declassified and released publicly.On his last full day as president, Trump did issue a declassification order for these materials, but they didn't get released before he left office. And there's actually a Trump ally, who has filed suit over this hoping to sort of force the federal government's hand here, although the FBI says that the majority of the contents of the binder have now been posted publicly on its FOIA website. So we, in reporting this story, my colleagues and myself spoke to more than a dozen sources, who described to us how this intelligence was brought to the White House in the final weeks of Trump's presidency, and then how it went missing.",

She told the January 6th Committee that she was, quote, almost positive, it went home with Mr. Meadows. She said, had been kept in a safe in Meadows's office when it wasn't being worked on.She also wrote about this in her new book claiming that on January 19th, which was the final night of the Trump presidency, that she saw Meadows leave the White House with an unredacted binder, quote, tucked under his arm. Now, Mark Meadows's attorney strongly denies this. He said in statement to us, Mr. Meadows was keenly aware of and adhered to requirements for the proper handling of classified material, any such material that he handled or was in his possession has been treated accordingly. And any suggestion that he is responsible for any missing binder or any other classified information is flat wrong. CNN also reached out to officials with the CIA, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department, all of whom declined to comment. The Trump campaign also did not respond to our multiple requests for comment on the binder, which is all to say, Sara, that the mystery of this missing binder remains just that a mystery.",

And they're looking at the numbers exactly how much should they fine Rudy Giuliani for what he was saying about these two women, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, two Georgia election workers, and everything that they had suffered.So that $48 million, at least $48 million, that's what an expert witness, in their case says would take to repair their reputation alone for the defamation that they have suffered, the slanderous things that Rudy Giuliani said and then spread across the country to many people who were listening to him. On top of that, they are also asking for an award of emotional distress. Their attorneys did not put a number on it. So that is entirely up to the jury, it could become quite a significant figure because that emotional distress was on full display in the courtroom when both of these women testified. And then even on top of that, there's a third number that the jury has to come up with, and that is called punitive damages, the amount that Rudy Giuliani should be punished. And whenever we listened to the lawyer for Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss in his closing arguments speak about this, he spoke extensively about how this should be a moment where this jury sends a message. He said, send a message, send it to any other powerful figure with a platform or an audience, people like Rudy Giuliani. Truth is truth. And you will be held accountable. That is the message that they're asking the jury to come back with when they assess a number here.",
