Of course, that is what we hear time and time again in so many of these shootings. The question is, if they knew that he had mental health problems, how was he able to obtain these weapons?We are told that two of the weapons, police say, were owned by a family member. One weapon that he had was an AR-15 that he bought just about a month after his 18th birthday. Now, as you mentioned, I asked the police chief, will other family members, whoever own those guns, part of that arsenal that this suspect had access to, could they be charged? The police chief told me that, at this point, they don't -- they are not planning to charge anyone else but they're continuing to gather information. He says that everything right now is on the table. That is important to know because, again, as we see in so many of these cases, police will obviously go after the gunman, the suspect, but we have seen a greater effort by police and prosecutors to also look at who helped equipped these people. If they knew that they were issues, if they knew that this person could be dangerous and deadly, how could they give them access to weapons? Certainly, a major question in this case.",

He is currently abroad, in Japan, and you already see reporters asking him questions about this. But interestingly, what you also heard was a senior administration official today in a briefing with reporters offer a pretty blunt assessment of the impact that this is having on the United States standing in the world. He said this: Debt ceiling brinksmanship that Republicans are diving -- are driving in Washington, D.C., undermines American leadership, undermines the trustworthiness that America can bring to not just our allies and partners but to the rest of the world. And so, when you think about that, the president has talked previously about the impact that default would have on the U.S.'s standing abroad, but clearly, already, just the threat, just the very logjam in Washington, D.C., is already having, according to the senior administration official, an impact on the U.S.'s ability to lead. Nonetheless, the president does have an opportunity tomorrow or actually a few hours from now in Japan to show that U.S. leadership is still there, and he's going to do that on Ukraine in particular. On that, he has got a series of new sanctions, 300 new sanctions on Russia for its role in Ukraine, export controls. All of these, of course, in coordination with those G7 allies.

And that is where things stand. Look, personal relationships aren't everything, right? I think the two leaders understand the stakes of this for the global economy. But nonetheless, this is Washington and relationships do matter. And also, interestingly, these are two men who both really thrive on the idea that politics is personal. We have seen Kevin McCarthy take that approach in the House. We have seen President Biden take that approach with Congress and also with foreign leaders. And yet here we are at a moment where this is going to come down to these two men who don't know each other all that well. Now, that being said, just this last quick point, the first meeting that they had a week ago over the debt ceiling was pretty frosty.

I know from even talking to some of his advisers that it is something that he is also planning to continue to rail against on the campaign trail.But he did -- a spokesperson for DeSantis released a statement tonight that read, you have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing. Mr. DeSantis- told -- I'm sorry, I think we have the wrong statement here. I have a copy here. The right statement from the spokesperson is that it said Disney announced the possibility of a Lake Nona campus nearly two years ago, nothing ever came of the project, and the state was unsure if it would come to fruition given the company's financial straits, falling market cap, and declining stock price. It is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures. So, that is from DeSantis's team again just leaning into this fight. And really, I mean, where this all stems from? This is going way back now, like, back to 2020, 2021 when DeSantis -- obviously, culture war is a big thing that he leans into. A lot of this has to do with him railing against wokeness, thinking that Disney is promoting things that children should not be learning about, similar to what he talks about learning in the classrooms. And it also goes to Disney having their own little tax island in Florida, something that he is very against and finds to be unfair. And so, it really is coming to a head today. We saw that with Disney deciding that they are going to close this down. One other thing that I will point out, though, just on the Disney side of this, is I was talking with our colleague, Steve Cantona (ph), who has been following this case very closely, and we were saying that we think a lot of this is also Disney kind of scapegoating DeSantis for this.",

He was convicted to three years in a Japanese prison for an incident in which he crashed a car and killed some individuals. His family says that he was suffering from acute altitude sickness.The Japanese government, though, and the court system convicted him of negligent driving and sentenced him to three years in prison. This case has gone all the way up to the president of the United States. His family, his wife, has met with President Biden. We know that President Biden raised his case previously at the White House when the Japanese prime minister visited. So, I'm looking to see whether or not President Biden has or does raise this case with the Japanese prime minister again, and whether after this trip, if there is any movement on that case.",
