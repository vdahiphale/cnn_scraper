I mean, look, one of the things that is certainly being taken into account beyond the international pressure is also the fact that the overwhelming majority of these drones and missiles that are on fire, more than 300 of them, 99 percent of them were intercepted. Only a few of those ballistic missiles actually hit the Nevatim Airbase in southern Israel, causing what the Israeli military has described as minimal damage. And so, that is also being taken into consideration.But, even if the damage was minimal, even if there were no casualties caused directly by those Iranian missiles and drones, although one young girl was seriously injured by one of the interceptors, the shrapnel from that, nonetheless, the Israeli war cabinet believes that this kind of unprecedented attack on its soil, the first of its kind from Iran launched by Iranian forces from Iranian soil, not the kind of proxy attacks that we have seen in the past, they believe that that merits a response, and that without a response, the kind of deterrence factor on Iran will have been lost. So, they certainly feel like they must act. The question now is, how significant that reaction will be.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Max. President Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the weekend that they should view their ability to thwart this Iranian attack against Israel as a success. And he also, in that call, according to a senior administration official, said that the U.S. would not participate in any counter strikes against Iran. The focus right now for President Biden is really trying to de-escalate the situation. Iran's attack that occurred over the weekend really risked stepping into a wider regional conflict, something that Biden has tried to prevent since the start of this war on October 7.Now -- right now, White House administration officials are closely watching Israel to see what their next steps will be. We know that the Israeli war cabinet was meeting this morning to determine the way to respond to Iran. And the White House has been saying through John Kirby this morning that ultimately this is a decision that is up to Israel to make. But, at this time, as had been reported from the President's phone call with Netanyahu, it is not expected that the U.S. would participate in any counter strike against Iran. Now, this is all coming as President Biden today is also set to host the Prime Minister of Iraq, Al Sudani, here at the White House. This will be the first time that we see President Biden since the attack over the weekend. But, it also comes as there are heightened concerns about the safety of U.S. troops in the region, including in Iraq. There are about 2,000 to 2,500 U.S. troops who are currently stationed there to help in the fight against ISIS. We know that the U.S. and Iraq have been in conversations about the future of those troops in the country, whether they are still needed. A senior U.S. official said that while it's not the focus of their meeting today, it is expected to come up as a topic of conversation. And over the weekend, senior defense officials would not say that they thought there were any additional threats to the U.S. forces who are in the region, but did say that the forces remain postured to provide additional defensive support to protect U.S. forces in the region. So, while the President is also trying to prevent any further escalation of this conflict between Israel and Iran, one that can potentially draw in other allies as well, he is also keeping an eye on the safety of the U.S. troops in the region, who also helped participate in the ability to thwart Iran's attack over the weekend.",

Hundreds of potential jurors will be brought into the court and asked dozens of questions to determine if they can be fair and impartial in deciding Trump's guilt or innocence. As for the defendant, he is trying to turn the case into a rallying cry for his supporters.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On Monday in New York City, I will be forced to sit fully gagged.

We've already seen some protests, some supporters show up, Max, and they are actually being pushed into a particular area, even one actually tried to be brought behind our cameras here and immediately they were brought away. But, the security around the building, it's going to be at a frozen when the former President makes his way down here. Court expected to start in about an hour and 10 minutes or so. And as you just mentioned, when it does get started, there is that process of jury selection. 500 people are going to be called to jury duty today, but that's not all for this trial. There is 100 at a time that will actually be called into Judge Juan Merchan's courtroom, and from there, they're going to be vetted. They actually have -- we've been told that the judge is going to dismiss them if there is any sort of conflict in their personal lives, like can't get child care, issues like that. And then after that is when they begin the process of asking 42 questions related specifically to that trial -- this trial. Some of those questions are whether or not they've attended or worked at a rally for Trump? Where do they get their news? Do they listen to Michael Cohen's podcast, as he is a major witness in this case? And from there, then each side, the prosecution and Trump's team, they get 10 strikes. They can tell 10 people without questions whether or not they want them on this jury. But, it's going to be a process to find an impartial jury, of course, when it comes to Donald Trump, as he is very well known, not only for being the former President, but certainly here in New York as well. We expect this process of the trial to last about a week to two weeks, and then of course, opening statements for this historic trial can begin. Max.",

This is a months-long planning situation that will involve many agencies.I'll give you sort of a preview of what we could expect, for starters. The NYPD will be mainly in charge of securing the area around the courthouse, using some of these barricades to create what are called like these frozen zones to secure the area around the facility itself, especially as the former President arrives and then certainly as he leaves. Any potential Trump supporters or protesters, the NYPD will be really getting their presence to this park across the street, essentially creating a safety zone or at least a bubble here between members of the general public and what's going on inside. The Secret Service, their main responsibility will be protecting the former President. They will also be the ones to determine what motorcade route they take here from Trump Tower that's about six miles away. A law enforcement official telling my colleague Mark Morales that they will likely, that route will vary from day to day. And then finally, court officers, their responsibilities will be behind these walls. They'll be mainly in charge of the former President's movements, even dedicating a specific elevator that will be the one to actually take Donald Trump up to the courthouse where the proceedings are going to take place. Look, some good news here. These agencies, they are all used to doing this, and working hand in hand before.

Nearly all of the hundreds of Iranian drones and missiles fired towards Israel were intercepted and destroyed. Mr. Zelenskyy says that's all he wants for his country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): The whole world sees what real defense is. It sees that it is feasible. And the whole world saw that Israel was not alone in this defense. The threat in the sky was also been eliminated by its allies. And when Ukraine tells its allies that unity provides the best defense, they are already well aware of its effectiveness. They are aware of it and ensure it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And as Joey was describing to us, even if he is found guilty of this, he can still carry on and campaign in the presidential election and potentially getting into the White House as well. But, there has been some polling suggesting that a criminal record would put some voters off. So, we will wait to see how that plays out.But, we're going to go to Brian Todd now, who has more on how this really historic case came together. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It wasn't until almost 12 years after the affair allegedly occurred that the world first learned of the allegations of hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. In January 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that, in the weeks before the 2016 election, Donald Trump had arranged a $130,000 payment to the adult film star to keep her from publicly discussing their alleged 2006 encounter. Later, former Trump Attorney, Michael Cohen, testified that Trump directed him to make payments to Daniels, quote \"for the principal purpose of influencing the election, and that Trump later reimbursed him.\" Cohen served jail time for campaign finance violations related to the hush money payments, and gave jarring testimony to Congress. MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY: I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. TODD (voice-over): Donald Trump has always denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels. In April 2018, Trump was asked by reporters about hush money payments.",
