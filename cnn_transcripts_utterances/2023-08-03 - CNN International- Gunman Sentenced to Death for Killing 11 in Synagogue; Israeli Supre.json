You are looking at pictures from inside the courthouse. A little earlier where a panel of three judges is hearing a challenge to a law which makes it more difficult to declare the Prime Minister incapacitated or unfit for office. Journalist Elliott Gotkine is with us now from outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem. You've been reporting a lot about these series of different bills that it's going through. What's the significance of this one?",

      "sentences": "Max, today's hearing has its roots in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's legal troubles. You recall that he's on trial for corruption charges he vehemently denies. Now when those legal troubles began, there were petitions to the Supreme Court here in Jerusalem saying that look, he's on trial for corruption, he shouldn't be able to be Prime Minister or to run for office. The Supreme Court disagreed. They said he can be Prime Minister so long as there's no conflict of interest.Roll onto the formation of this government and it unveiled its controversial judicial overhaul plan. Those plans that have pushed hundreds of thousands of Israelis on to the streets for more than six months and led to concerns about the Israeli economy, the Israeli democracy, et cetera. So it unveiled this judicial overhaul plan. The Attorney General says, well, hang on, Netanyahu, you are on trial for corruption, you can't be involved in these judicial overhaul plans because this could have an impact on your trial. What does the government do? It has a law. It amends an existing basic law, one of these laws that are closest Israel has to a constitution, to say that actually it's much, much harder to remove a Prime Minister from office in the event of a conflict of interest. Therefore after that, there were petitions to the Supreme Court which brings us here today. The petitioners are saying Netanyahu passed that law solely for his own benefit and therefore it's an abuse of power. And if the Supreme Court, the three justices, strike down this amended basic law, that would be the first time that they've ever struck down a basic law. And it could indicate that when all 15 Supreme Court judges meet in September to hear the first of those judicial overhaul bills, that so- called reasonableness bill that we've been talking about for the past couple of weeks, it may have fewer concerns or fewer qualms about striking that basic law down because it had already done so once before for another basic law. And that, Max, I think more or less is why today's hearing is important and the result of this hearing matters.",

The United Nations command says North Korea has responded regarding King but is not releasing any information about what was in it.Chinese officials want to limit the amount of time children and teenagers spend on their phones. A new proposal was released by the country's top internet regulator on Wednesday. The country has become more concerned about so-called internet addiction as well as health issues stemming from prolonged use of smart phones. CNN's Anna Coren joins me from Hong Kong. I mean, a lot of parents around the world might see this as a good idea. ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I was going to say, Max, you know, internet addiction is not just a Chinese problem, it's a global problem. But China certainly doubling down proposing these new restrictions on children and teenagers on the amount of time that they can spend on the internet and mobile devices. The country's cyberspace regulators say that it wants mobile devices, apps and app stores to introduce a so-called minor mode that would cut off users from accessing the Internet on mobile devices from 10:00 p.m. through to 6:00 a.m. The proposal also includes a limit on how much time those kids under the age of 18 will be allowed to go online each day. For those under the age of 8, it's 40 minutes a day. Those age between 8 and 16, it's an hour a day. For those over the age of 16 -- 16 to 18, it's two hours a day. Once it has reached that limit, the mobile devices will be shut down and all the applications will be shut down. Look, there will be a number of exemptions, emergency services, educational products such as online classes, apps for physical and mental development, you know, parents can also choose whether or not they want an app exempt or, you know, whether they can opt out of certain time limits. We spoke to one mother of two children in China this morning. This is what she said. She is in full support. She said: I think it is good. On one hand it can protect their eye vision as many young kids cannot stop themselves while watching something they like. It helps automatically cut it off. On the other hand, it's easier for us parents to control our kids' screen time. Without parents' approval, they only have 40 minutes. Most importantly, the content under the teenage mode is more positive and healthy. Now parents in China might be happy, but internet companies and their investors certainly were not. Shares in Chinese tech firms fell yesterday after the news of this announcement. Bilibili fell almost 7 percent. Kuaishou fell 3.5 percent. While Ten Cent holdings which operates their social network app WeChat closed down 3 percent. Now since trading resumed today, all those stocks have bounced. But one lawyer based in Shanghai, Max, said that these new rules will be an absolute headache for internet companies. There'll be a lot of effort and costs involved to properly implement the new regulatory requirements. Now we understand that the draft proposal is open for public discussion until the beginning of September, but at the end of the day, this is China. Now it's important to remember that minor mode is nothing new. Chinese authorities have grown increasingly concerned about internet addiction among their young people. In 2021, the Chinese government-imposed time limits for online gamers under the age of 18 barring them from playing video games on weekdays and restrict their play to just three hours on weekends. My children would not be happy about that. And then since 2019, Chinese social media Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, have often teenage modes to restrict users' access to content and duration of use. But as you say, Max, there might be some parents outside of China who are thinking this is not such a bad idea.",
