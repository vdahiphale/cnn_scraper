      "sentences": "A warm welcome to FIRST MOVE, as always great to have you with us for an hour of deliberation, as wediscussed the Moscow summit summation. Fresh French pension agitation and Jay Powell rate decision preparation, lots to come. China's President Xi departing Moscow, after three days of high level talks with his Russian counterparts long walks firm handshakes fast friends, it seems but no verbal support for Putin's war in Ukraine, nor outright commitment to provide lethal arms to Russia. A live reporter ahead from Moscow, also, President Emmanuel Macron on TV this past hour trying to calm nerves after sidelining parliament and enacting deeply unpopular pension reforms. Opponents say we won't give up the latest coming up on that and the Fed Chair Jay Powell faces arguably the most challenging test of his tenure later today. The U.S. Central Bank, deciding whether to raise interest rates today as planned, and how much more to say about what's still required the so called dot plots of future interest rate moves will especially be key. Now, Powell has the tools to fight both inflation and tackle banking stress. But of course communicating that with confidence is crucial. Stock markets have studied though in the meantime this week and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says depositors will get more protections if needed. But the banking uncertainty has not yet past. Let's take a look at U.S. futures and European stocks a cautious feel as you would expect, as we await the Fed potential fireworks and fresh U.K. data highlighting that the fire still burns and inflation U-turn there, rising to almost 10.5 percent last month. As Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley told the show yesterday the Fed's big job today is don't make the financial uncertainty worse, do no harm. The Central Bank has pumped billions of dollars back into the system to stop a financial freeze, which would effectively give it cover to hike interest rates. But how much more does the economy really need when you consider the economic blow taken in the last two weeks? Let's get more on all of this, Rahel Solomon has all the answers for us, I know. Rahel, what do we think he does today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Julia, I think there's a question of what we expect and this debate about what they should do. So what theyexpect then you can see here just from CME, that traders are largely pricing in another rate hike of a quarter of 1 percent. 15 percent believing that we may actually see a pause now that is the expectation and I think we can pull it up for you here. But then the question in this debate about what they should do in this really critical moment, and the argument on one side that they should raise rates by another quarter of 1 percent, because in doing so it signals that not only do they remain focused on fighting inflation, but that perhaps what we're seeing with the banks isn't as bad as it seems. On the other hand, you have some who believe that a pause here would be an about face and could really spook markets. Consider for one moment what the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs, Jan Hatzius said in a note earlier this week, saying it doesn't make sense to tighten monetary policy amidst ongoing stress in the banking system that could present substantial downside risk to the economy. And what he's getting at here, Julia, is what you were alluding to there that we are already going to see an economic impact as a result of the banking stress. Goldman Sachs suggesting that the pullback that we see in tightening because of this concern among banks, who now feel like well, maybe we should be a bit more liquid, maybe we should be a bit nimbler and preparation for any potential bank runs that may come that's going to cause a pullback in lending, right? And so that is already going to have an economic impact. Goldman Sachs suggesting that could have an impact of the equivalent of essentially another rate hike of a quarter to half a percent. So it will do some of the job for it. But Julia, as you know, monetary policy is famously a blunt tool. I'm not sure how enthused the Federal Reserve would be about solving this inflation issue through the banks through this stress, because I would argue that could be even messier in terms of not knowing how damaging that impact could be, and the spillover effect of that.",

And you can certainly argue that there is a reason for that at least they believe that there is a reason for that. You know, I would argue now was not the time for ambiguity, right now is not the time for bigness in terms of messaging. I think markets and investors want to hear a clear message in terms of what the Federal Reserve is willing to do in terms of resolving these banks, but also its resolve in terms of inflation. And so we might hear from the Fed a bit more clarity, a bit more pointed messaging than perhaps we've heard in the past, because of this reason, there was already so much uncertainty in the market. We don't need any more uncertainty from Chairman Powell.",

Fire Department on the scene trying to put out the fires at least 2 children injured in this attack that has been condemned by the Ukrainian Authorities as a war crime as they put it committed by vile Russian terrorists. This attack taking place the day after the Russian and Chinese Leaders Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping were embracing each other in Moscow after two days of meetings where they declared to the world that they want to create a more just more democratic multipolar international order. Within hours of those declarations and the deep declarations of friendship between these two leaders the Ukrainian Authorities say the Russian Military fired multiple deadly missiles and drones at different Ukrainian cities and towns. Missiles fired by Russian war planes at the Southern Port City of Odesa, where air defenses succeeded in knocking down at least two of those missiles. But more got through causing damage to a 3 storey building wounding people and then the Ukrainian Air Force say from the north of Ukraine, at least 21 of these Iranian made Shahed drones were fired at Ukraine that some 16 were knocked down by air defenses, but at least 4 people were killed in a city outside of Kyiv in the town of Zhytomyr. In that region, several of those drones were knocked down. The Russian say that there were some kind of drone attacks on the Russian Occupied City of Sevastopol in the Crimean Peninsula. All of this air war, which kills and maims civilians, innocent civilians, is taking place as the two militaries continue bludgeoning each other, killing each other in trench and artillery warfare on the very long front lines.

The economy in the first quarter is look to set to grow maybe 2, 3 percent above its potential and so we need to bring demand down.

What is crucial, particularly to lending in smaller regions are the community banks, the small and medium sized banks that we've seen as sort of the proxy for the broader pressure that we've seen in the banking sector in the United States. Do you have any sense of what happens when you see these deposit outflows in these banks? To what extent that then means that they restrict lending. So if a bank comes out, and we've seen PacWest, which is one particular bank, provide a statement saying they've lost 20 percent of their deposits.

I didn't think the Fed was going to cut rates. And when those disconnects emerge, that can be a scary thing and an accident waiting to happen. So the Fed needs to make it clear.

We'll explore how AI is changing the way we communicate? Plus, how to give subtitles to life itself, we'll meet the startup creating closed captions for every conversation, all that coming up here on \"Marketplace Europe\". (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEWART (voice over): It is one of the biggest events on the tech calendar, Mobile World Congress where more than 88,000 people gather to get their hands on the latest devices? This show is usually all about the handsets and the hardware. But this year, the buzz is about the technology inside whatever the device you're using it's the artificial intelligence within this got people talking. Anything AI related seems to draw a crowd here. And this robot certainly knows how to work the room, as well as take my picture. But you can see everywhere how AI has entered our lives. And the cars we drive the factories where we work. And yes, the smart phones we use every day. For Carmine Di Sibio the Chairman and CEO of Consultancy EY there's no doubt that artificial intelligence is this year's biggest talking points.",

And we're going to have 30 percent unemployment, because it's going to take everyone's jobs. That was the conversation and I was in many meetings on oh my God, five years from now, there will be unemployment will be rampant because machines are going to take over everything. And here we are five years later. That's not the case at all. You know, people will use AI as a tool, and it'll be something that you'll use on your job. It's not going to really replace you.

Aside from the customer service bots, we're all used to AI is being used to make networks more automated. Algorithms can spot problems with coverage and order fixes automatically. Or they can predict spikes in traffic, adjusting bandwidth on the fly. There has been talk of whether AI's impact has been overblown.

So we believe that AI will be everywhere. And we have a program within a range, which we call AI at scale, to make sure that we can benefit from AI on every part of the business, not only for the network, or the customer experience, but only the marketing, that we will be able to leverage all the data to improve at the end of the day, the service that we deliver to our customers. STEWART (voice over): Analysts have been predicting an AI revolution for years. What could make this time different is the other technologies scaling up at the same time, from 5G to the Internet of Things. For the mobile sector it's the chance to change the way we interact.

(END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEWART (voice over): Mobile World Congress showcases new technologies that hope to one day change your life from smart phones all the way up to the hyper loop train. But actually, some of these technologies we already use without even thinking about it. Take this program for example. If you're watching this, perhaps on social media, there's a high chance you're seeing subtitles. Now maybe those were added by a human like these ones you see here, but maybe they were generated by software, which immediately transcribes whatever I'm saying, possibly with the odd mistake. Well, I'm going to meet one British startup which has taken that concept and is applying it to everyday life. This is Dan Scarf, a British Entrepreneur and the Head of X Ray Glass. His goal is simple but profound, to subtitle the world. And like many big ideas, it came to him almost by accident.",

He's lost almost all of his hearing now. And he was surrounded by his family unable to engage in conversation. And I thought well hang on. We've got real time subtitling in Teams and Zoom. We've got these new augmented reality glasses coming out. Why can't we just combine the two together? And that was the kernel of the idea for X Ray Glass. So we set off on our mission to subtitle the world. STEWART (voice over): X Ray software provides real time subtitles to users wearing the glasses.
