And of course, it's the United States, and it's the sort of broader western alliance.This has been the narrative that the Kremlin has tried to put across from the outset since launching its war more than a year ago, what is it, 14, 15 months ago now to conquer Ukraine, that it's doing that too stop Ukraine falling into the hands of the western military alliance, specifically under the sway of the United States. And so through the prism in Moscow, all of this action, these dramatic images we are seeing here again of these apparent drones exploding over the dome of the Senate palace inside the walls of the Kremlin, that was all orchestrated, the material was supplied by the targeting information was given by the United States. That's the Kremlin line. Of course, as you mentioned, the United States is, obviously, distancing itself from this. Ukraine has as well. There are a couple of other options as to what might be responsible for this. In fact, I have spoken to a former Russian M.P. who says he is in contact with militant groups, partisan groups inside Russia who say that they are the ones that carried out this attack, Poppy and Kaitlan.",

President Zelenskyy's the commander-in-chief. He gets to decide where his military operates and when and in what circumstances. So I'll leave it to the Ukrainians to speak to whatever future operations that they might or might not conduct.What I can tell you, though, Kaitlan, is that regardless of when or where and what units he decides to use to conduct offensive operations inside his country, he's got pretty much everything he needs to do that coming in the weeks and months ahead. We have provided, again, another security package yesterday of some $300 million, ammunition, artillery pieces, as well as breaching equipment and logistics and sustainment vehicles. He's got about 98 percent of everything his forces say they need to be able to conduct offensive operations in the -- in the spring, in the weeks and months ahead. And that's not just coming from the United States. That's coming from allied and partnered nations all over the world. So we've really worked hard to get them the materiel that they need so that, we if and when they step off, they can do so ready. The other thing, Kaitlan, that often gets lost in this is the training we have done. We have trained multiple brigades of Ukrainian soldiers outside the country over the last few months to get them schooled up on something we call combined arms maneuver, which is the kind of integrated war-fighting they're going to need, again, when the weather improves and when they're ready to move out. So there's been a lot of training, a lot of materiel deliveries, a lot of contributions to their efforts, that they are -- they are ready, and of course it will be up to them to decide how and when to execute.",

Now, the ceasefires have gone through -- through a couple of extensions here, and that has resulted in a decrease in the violence, Poppy, but it certainly hasn't eliminated it. It needs to stop so that the humanitarian assistance can get in. It's not just the United States that wants to do this. The U.N. does; allied and partner countries want to get humanitarian assistance in, food, water, medicine. All these are in critical short supply. It's important for these two generals, if they really do care about the future of Sudan and the Sudanese people, to put their arms down and let this aid and assistance get in. Certainly the United States will be right there with the people of Sudan, trying to make sure that they have that -- those necessary supplies.Now, as for departures, we have, I think, as you know, conducted three ground convoys, gotten out, according to the State Department's estimate, more than a thousand Americans. We continue to stay in touch with Americans to provide any kind of information that they might need, any guidance that they might need, should they still want to get out. I want to tell you that a population of Americans that we were in touch with, that wanted to get out, much, much smaller, a fraction of that number that's been floating out there of 16,000, which are largely dual nationals who -- who want to stay in the country -- they were born there; they live there; they work there; their families are there; and they want to stay.

What's unclear this morning is how much the bill was, but ProPublica does say that Crow picked up the full tab according to a school administrator, former school administrator. It could have exceeded $150,000 based on these public records. ProPublica says Thomas did not disclose the payments from Harlan Crow with the payments for the tuition.

Crow's office responded to this report with a statement saying, \"Harlan Crow has long been passionate about the importance of quality education and giving back to those less fortunate, especially at-risk youth.
