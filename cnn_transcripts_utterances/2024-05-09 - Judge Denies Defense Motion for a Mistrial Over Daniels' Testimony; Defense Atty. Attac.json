Welcome to our continuing special primetime coverage of the Trump New York hush money trial.Day 14 saw prosecutors focus through a current bookkeeper and a former White House staffer on how closely their boss watched every dollar, including far smaller sums than his checks to Michael Cohen. Also, day two of cross examination for Stormy Daniels, perhaps at the defendant's behest, whether or not it helped his case. And after the jury left, two defense motions, one to modify the gag order that Mr. Trump is under to allow him to talk about Stormy Daniels, the other asking for a mistrial for the second time this week. Judge Juan Merchan denying the gag order motion saying, and I quote, \"Your client's track record speaks for itself.\" He also denied the mistrial motion, which the defense had based on what it claimed was prejudicial testimony by Stormy Daniels about sex with Mr. Trump. The judge said the defense brought it on themselves by denying a sexual encounter had taken place, meaning he said that the jury needed to be able to determine whether to believe her or the defense. He also scolded the defense for not objecting to items they were now citing as grounds for a mistrial. Prosecutors meantime said they will not be calling the other woman who is alleging an affair with the former president, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, whose silence he also secured prior to the 2016 election. Afterwards, he had this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The second time this week that they've done that and saying that this was unfair testimony, it was prejudicial. They're saying Stormy Daniels changed her story because some of her testimony intimated that there was a power dynamic at play, and a height differential, and she wasn't sure she could leave. But they said that that was unfair to the jury because at the time in 2016, she was saying that this was consensual, and that is what Trump was trying to stop, if you believe the prosecution, and not these additional details.But the judge said that this was of their own making. He said the other day he was surprised that Trump's attorneys didn't object more, and that he sustained the first objection. He objected himself. But today he went even further, and he said, \"Why on,\" he's talking about Trump's attorney, \"Why on earth she wouldn't object to the mention of a condom, I don't understand.\" So he was saying that they let far too much detail come in themselves before they objected, and he was saying that, in fact, because they denied that this affair ever happened, that the jury was - it was fair for the jury to hear the detail, to draw their own conclusion about whether they believed her or not.",

Do they come in like slobs, like they don't care or are they dressing like they're going somewhere that matters? I'm not saying you have to dress like you're going to a wedding, but, and they look like a professional jury, and yes, what Kara said was, like, they're just Susan Stormy, Susan, Stormy. They were going back and forth.Let me just put my cards on the table. I went there for one reason today. I went there as a student. Susan Necheles has a reputation in the legal community of being a spectacular lawyer, and I went there to learn from her, and I did. And what I learned was it just solidified what I knew. There is no substitute for preparation. So all of Stormy's quick answers back, Susan had a retort right back at you. Oh, really? Well, let's go - let's talk about what you said to Anderson Cooper. Oh, really? Let's look - let's talk about what you wrote in your own book. So she had it off the top of her head, and then she's able - there's so much technology, then she's able to call up on the big screens exactly what the - she wanted to see, the whole thing with the saint candle, the saint of indictments. And she called up a picture, and she made it very clear that this was, number one, about money. You wanted to make money and I - and she said, I didn't get paid for the Anderson Cooper interview. And then Susan calmly says, but how much money did you make after the Anderson Cooper interview? You made $800,000 on a book advance. You made $200,000 on a television show. You got the $130,000, so you made millions. No, I didn't make millions. That's only a million. A little bit more than a million, so I didn't make millions. So it was obvious the whole thing about money was off base. But overall, Anderson, she kind of held her own, I mean, pardon the pun, but she weathered the storm. Susan Necheles brought a storm, and I'd even say, like, her body language, like, towards the end, she was kind of firm. I thought, Kara, her jokes kind of felt flat, she tried to make, like, three or four jokes, no one really laughed. The biggest part that I was like, uh-huh, was Susan said - Susan Necheles, the defense attorney said, so you've written the scripts for - is it 150 pornography movies? And she gets all proud, Stormy, she's like, yes. And I think she said, I directed in them and she's like, so, you know how to write imaginary sexual encounters, don't you, and isn't that what happened here? No, this was real, and if I was writing about it, I would have written a better story than this one. But it just goes to her credibility, but overall, like, we've been saying, she's not a material witness, she doesn't - at the end Susan says, do you know something, like, do you know how he keeps his checks, do you know how he keeps his checkbooks, do you know how the books and records are kept? No, no, no, no, no.",

There's also what jurors heard when things seem to take a strange turn. Necheles asking Daniels quote, you have made a show and podcast claiming that you can speak to dead people right to which Daniels eventually replied, yes.She then asked, you also claimed that you lived in a house in New Orleans that was haunted to which Daniels answered, yes, so the house was has some very unexplained activity. And then went on to say, quote, a lot of the activity was completely debunked, as you know, a giant opossum that was under the tape -- under the house.
