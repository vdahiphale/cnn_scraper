Meantime, just moments ago, right here in the heart of Tel Aviv, we witnessed Iron Dome intercepting rockets that are just coming over right near where we are in Tel Aviv. Jeremy Diamond is standing by Ashkelon, Israel. Before that, I want to show our viewers the pictures. There you see them, Jeremy. We were standing here on the roof. All of a sudden, we heard the sirens going off. We saw the rockets coming in, and then we saw the Iron Dome interceptors going up and blowing up those rockets. It's a very, very tense situation. It happens fairly regularly. And it underscores, Jeremy, what we all know, that Hamas still has capabilities, presumably, of firing these rockets, these missiles, from Gaza right into Tel Aviv, right towards the heart of Tel Aviv. Fortunately for the Israelis, they have this Iron Dome system that can go up there and destroy these rockets in the skies. There are still problems, because once these rockets that are coming in are destroyed, the debris falls down, and you have to be really careful. You have to go into shelters, because the metal from those debris could harm you, even kill you, if they hit you where they're coming down to the ground. So it's just an awful situation that is still unfolding here in Tel Aviv. But, Jeremy, I want to get your latest, what we're learning about this explosion at that major refugee camp in Gaza.",

Jabalia refugee camp is one of the largest refugee camps in Gaza. It houses the refugees of the 1948 war and its descendants, who then moved -- who were displaced and moved into that refugee camp in Jabalia. These enormous explosions, Wolf, are not the first that we have seen in Gaza. And, of course, we know that, as this war has stretched on, the toll of casualties in Gaza has skyrocketed. More than 8,000 people have been killed inside the Gaza Strip in these three weeks of war. And, of course, we know that civilians have been too often the results of those casualties, more than 3,000 children killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And, of course, we are still waiting to see how many people may be under the rubble in this explosion. But if you just look at those images, Wolf, it is just really hard to fathom what that explosion would have been like for the people on the ground.",

Several people were injured in that strike. When we were in Sderot earlier today, we also had rockets fired over. Of course, what we are seeing in Gaza right now in terms of the numbers of casualties from Israeli bombing and airstrikes, as well as other explosions, we have seen instances, of course, where Hamas has been firing rockets from residential areas, and those have misfired. According to the Israel Defense Forces, some of those have caused casualties inside of Gaza as well. But what is clear, Wolf, is that, right now, the toll of casualties inside of Gaza is continuing to mount in a way that really eclipses anything else that we have seen in any past conflicts between Israel and Hamas, and, of course, Israel making clear that it will continue to carry out this offensive inside of Gaza until it can eradicate Hamas and remove it from power inside the Gaza Strip.",

But, additionally, a through line of this hearing, Wolf, has been the need to protect civilians inside Gaza. That is something that Blinken and Austin said repeatedly they have emphasized with their counterparts in Israel, that, as they conduct this ground offensive, they need to still try to get aid into Gaza and they need to do everything they can to protect civilians, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "So, Boris, when you look at that arc over five months, and then you compare it to at least the studies that we know about that say, what are the pre-attack behavioral signs of an active shooter, you really have to ask, how did all this go wrong?Now, let's take a look at some of those pre-attack behaviors. According to an FBI study that looked at pre-attack behaviors by active shooters, mental health issues. He obviously had a mental health crisis that occurred in July, when they had him hospitalized for two weeks. Interpersonal reactions, that is the fighting that went on between him, Card, and two of his soldier colleagues talking about hearing voices, being accused of being a pedophile. Leakage. Leakage is when you're hinting at violence. He was actually talking out loud about shooting up a Army National Guard base. Threats, confrontations, angers, the firearm behavior, gathering up 15 weapons, and then going to gun stores and buying more weapons, and then trying to purchase a silencer from another local store in Maine. When you look at all of those signs and then you say, OK, if you go by the offender characteristics, he ticks the boxes. But then you look at the things that he was saying and the things that law enforcement were being told by others -- and I think we can go to some of those comments, where he had been reported for gathering up those weapons. He had the angry rants. He answered the door with a gun when relatives came to see him. He was also making threats to shoot up the National Guard base in Saco. That means that it wasn't just signs he was showing that they could have picked up on, but people, family members, members of the military, colleagues were warning them of those signs. So, then they engaged. They tried to find him. They tried to talk to him. They couldn't locate him. But they had family members talking to him. They had the Army Reserve colleagues talking to him. But then what's the next phase? And, again, if you go back to the FBI reports on, what are the final things that happen before an active shooter, you get to the stressors. And if you look at his life and those stressors, there was the mental health intervention that came up. There was the breakup of his marriage, which is a common stressor, relationship. There was the fact that he got fired from his job at the recycling center, the fact that he was having conflicts and paranoid delusions about friends that were causing people to shun him. And then, of course, the shooting happened. So, Boris, where were the signs not?",
