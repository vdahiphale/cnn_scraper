      "sentences": "A very good morning to you. I'm Jessica Dean here in Washington. Jim Acosta has the day off and you're in the CNN Newsroom.And we begin new this morning with disturbing new allegations in yesterday's deadly plane crash in Kazakhstan. Reuters is now reporting that multiple unnamed sources in Azerbaijan with knowledge of the investigation say Russia's air defense system is to blame. It is worth noting the official stance from Azerbaijan right now is that the cause is unknown. Russia is denying these allegations. The Azerbaijan Airlines flight was headed to Russia when it crashed on Christmas morning and burst into flames. Russia initially claimed a bird strike forced an emergency landing, but holes seen in the wreckage are raising some suspicions. CNN's Nada Bashir is in London with the latest on this. Nada, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "That's right. There's been a lot of speculation, a lot of questions around what may have led to this fatal plane crash. And we'd heard earlier in the day from one Ukrainian official who had alleged that the plane was downed by Russian air defense systems. Of course, there had been questions around drone activity in the area. It's understood that the plane crashed shortly after drone strikes took place in parts of Southern Russia.Now, we are learning, according to reporting by Reuters, citing multiple unnamed sources that it is understood that the pain may well have been downed by Russian air defense systems. Again, this is being reported by Reuters, citing those unnamed sources. There isn't an official line yet from the investigators examining the evidence of what led to this crash. We know that the Kazakh government has set up an established a commission, especially focused on investigating the evidence that is currently presented to them at this stage. It is a joint international investigation. We are still waiting to hear more clarification from the officials on that front, certainly a concerning development, troubling development, if indeed this is the case. We had heard earlier in the day, of course, from CNN's own aviation safety experts but with regards to the images and videos that we have been seeing of the wreckage and the aftermath of that crash, which appeared to show holes and perforations in the fuselage, some analysis suggests that the entry and exit points of these holes would not suggest that this was shrapnel caused by the aftermath of the impact of the crash, but rather potentially surface-to-air missiles. But, again, this is speculation at this stage analysis at this stage. No clear line of confirmation from the investigators or Kazakh authorities. But, again, those questions will continue to mountain in Kazakhstan. This is, of course, a day of mourning, 38 people killed. Remarkably, 29 people were able to survive that crash. We saw that dramatic video of some of those survivors emerging from the wreckage. Among them, two children. They, of course, were quickly taken to hospitals for immediate medical attention. It is understood that a number of those survivors are still in critical conditions. So, we will be waiting and monitoring to hear updates on their status as well. But, again, lots of questions continuing to mount as we wait for the full results of the investigation that is still ongoing. Jessica?",

Let's take a look at some other top stories we're tracking this morning, including a family dispute on Christmas evening turning horrific at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Police say three people were shot in an airport restaurant outside the security perimeter. One victim, a woman, is now in critical condition. We know police later detained a girl and a man in the parking garage. That man had been stabbed. He and the other shooting victim are in stable condition. 20 big cats at a wild animal sanctuary in the state of Washington have died of bird flu in a devastating blow to conservation efforts. The sanctuary says more than half of its big cats have been infected with the virus as cases are on the rise across that state. The sanctuary is now under quarantine to help protect the remaining animals. And let's now get a check of the weather. Meteorologist Elisa Raffa joining us now.

We have an atmospheric river unloading a series of storms. You can see some delays likely today from Seattle to Portland and even down towards San Francisco.We have rain and snow coming on shore along the West Coast. We've got winter alerts in effect where we could find another foot of snow possible in some of the highest elevations. And this could come with winds of words of 60 miles per hour. That would create blowing snow, poor visibility, could take down some tree limbs and power lines. So, we continue with that rain and snow today. And then, like I mentioned, maybe brief lulls, but it continues, a series of storms as we go through the weekend. Just through Friday alone, we're looking at two to four inches of rain along the coast. In the mountains, we could be looking at another foot of snow. That's just through Friday. Again, we tack on even more to that as we go into the weekend. Then here's another storm that we're watching in the south, showers and storms starting to ignite around Dallas. Some of these looking like discreet thunderstorms. We'll need to watch for the ingredients in the atmosphere today where some severe weather is possible. We're talking damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes. Jessica?",

That's right, Beyonce rocking her hometown of Houston, the 32-time Grammy winner bringing down the house with her halftime performance as part of Netflix's first ever NFL doubleheader. The back-to-back games marked the streaming giant's first foray into live football, and it came with a $150 million price tag. The question is, did it pay off? Joining me now to discuss CNN's Coy Wire and TechRadar Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff. Good to have both of you here. Lance, first to you, Netflix had a whole lot riding on this, $150 million to be exact. How'd they do? LANCE ULANOFF, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, TECHRADAR:  Well, surprisingly, there were no issues, no tech issues that I could see or find or reports. You know, I think back to what happened with the Tyson-Paul bout, where 110 million people tried to sign in and stream at the same time and Netflix crumbled under the pressure. So, it was really going to be a big test for them. We don't know the numbers, like we really don't know how many people are actually streaming. But a live sports event with one of the biggest stars in the world is generally going to draw a lot of eyeballs. And there was really -- I don't know if there was a single report of the spinning red wheel.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Talk about risk taking. You know, the NFL is popular sports across the spectrum of media, but there are very few things that draw big viewing crowds anymore. You know, people watch stuff when they want to watch. It's an on-demand world, but there are a few things like live sports and sometimes awards events that draw people in.And then you add this massive star. You know, people want to see, you know, Cowboy Carter, huge record, you know, the first live performance for people of these songs. So, you add all of that together. But, here's the thing. This is where this industry is going. If you look at all of Netflix's competitors, you know, we've got Apple TV+, we've got Amazon, you know, all of these guys, what they are doing is adding live sports. And it's tough because on the cable and broadcast side, that's really the last area where they know they can draw big audiences. So, this is going to be a big area of contention throughout 2025, as we see more and more live sports now that Netflix has said, look, we just proved we can do it. We can do it with big games, and the biggest star in the world. Stay tuned for more.",

Patrick Holmes through three touchdown passes. This one here to Travis Kelce, made him the Chiefs all-time leader in touchdown reception, 77 for his career now surpassing the Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez.And then in the other game, Lamar Jackson for the Ravens, he was like Rudolph leading the way for those Ravens who slayed all day, 31-2. They trounced the Texans. He threw for two touchdown passes, and then he ran for 87 yards and another score. He passed Michael Vick for the NFL's all-time leading rusher as a quarterback. It was an incredible performance for those Ravens. They're now one game ahead of the Steelers atop the AFC North. So, on the field action and all the fun, entertainment outside of the game went very well for the doubleheader on Christmas Day for Netflix.",

      "sentences": "Yes, really protect yourself. At least we get harder for these people to steal your information.I also want to ask you about retirement accounts. According to Fidelity, hardship withdrawals on these retirement accounts have been on the rise for the past five years. In 2023, 6.9 percent of people with a retirement plan withdrew money for a financial hardship. So, how do you recommend people maybe proactively maintain that account and help themselves avoid dipping into it? Obviously, there are emergencies that happen in life. SINGLETARY:  Yes. You know, we've had a tough time these last couple years with inflation and people feel they have no other choice, and I get that. But some people, you may not need to do that if you haven't handled on the rest of your money, setting up an emergency fund, setting up what I call a life happens fund, which is separate from the emergency fund. That's when life happens. You know, your dishwasher breaks, your dog does something it shouldn't do, chews up a cord that you need to replace, those kinds of things. I know. And if you've got kids, you know, they're going to break something. So, you want to have a different account so that you don't touch it. I think of emergency fund is that dire fund, like you lose your job, so you get sick and you've got to pull from that. And so one of the ways to do that is that look at how you're saving for your retirement and think of that as no touch protected money. Because we know that you're going to need that money in retirement. So, you know, I really try to encourage people not to touch that money when you change jobs. Don't cash out that money. And the other thing is take this year to look back to see how your retirement accounts have done. You know, we always tell people, don't look at it every month or every day because it'll freak you out. And lots of people think, oh, you know, I've lost money because they're looking at the most recent time that the stock market went down. But look at it over the year. I looked at the numbers. You know, the S&amp;P is up almost like 27 percent. The Dow Jones is up 14 percent. So, don't just sort of react to the last market numbers that you saw. Look at how it's been for the last year. And if you're not happy with that contribution level, spend the next couple of days looking at that and take it up a little bit, even if it's just 1 percent, so that you can make sure that you're saving enough for the time when you don't want to work full-time.",
