      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett.OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news and it is historic. Former President Donald J. Trump has been indicted by a New York grand jury investigating hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. It is the first time in American history that a current or former president is facing criminal charges. And CNN is now learning that Trump is expected to be arraigned early next week. Now, the grand jury has been hearing evidence and witness testimony related to $130,000 that Trump's former fixer, Michael Cohen, paid Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. That money was paid in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair she had with Trump. Now, a source telling CNN -- and this is really important information we're just getting -- that Trump was completely caught off guard, that right now, he's in Florida at a Mar-a-Lago that he had been caught off guard, and that he thought that this was sort of maybe -- maybe over, maybe Bragg had gotten cold feet. So he suddenly released a statement after this news broke, saying, quote: This is -- this is in part. It's a longer statement. But he says: This is political persecution and election interference at the highest level in history, and accusing Democrats of now doing the, quote, unthinkable -- indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant election interference. Now, we are following all these developments. We have reporters breaking this story here on so many angles as we are learning what is in this indictment about this arrangement. And on that, I want to go first to Paula Reid in Washington. Of course, Paula, our viewers know you've been breaking this throughout. And you are learning more tonight about the timing of former President Trump's arraignment.",

Now, notably, the former president's attorneys have been informed that there is an indictment. They were certainly caught off guard by this.But they were not informed of the specific charges, and that's in keeping with what we were told by a source close to the district attorney's office. That's how they intended to handle this. There would be an indictment will be filed under seal, attorneys will be notified, but not informed of the specific charges. Those would not be revealed until an arraignment. They said that's because they want to treat this exactly like any other case. But, Erin, of course, this is not like any other case. But what will happen between now and an arrangement, they will have to negotiate the terms of a self surrender, and we know the former president certainly intends to cooperate. He wants to appear in person like any other person would in this kind of process because he believes that leaning into this could be politically advantageous. But to take a step back, Erin, there are some political questions here. The former president's legal team argues that this is politically motivated. This is something that happened seven years ago. This investigation has been going on for five years. It's unclear why this is suddenly heated up again. Though, in the past few days, the district attorney's office has been amplifying the argument that even though this appears to just be a paperwork, crime hush money that they do believe that this hush money may have impacted the outcome of the 2016 election. And that is what elevates this case. But, of course, we're still waiting to see the exact charges.",

They had -- they had many meetings with prosecutors, with the NYPD last week. In anticipation as something could happen, and then everybody thought perhaps it wasn't going to happen so soon. And so, now, we're told that they're still waiting for the officialnotification of exactly what day of something that as Paula just hinted at. The lawyers have to work this out with the prosecutors. When is it the best time for him to continue to Manhattan and present himself? The -- from the security standpoint, from the Secret Service standpoint, they need to make sure that they can find -- a secure way for him to go down to Manhattan and get in and out with the most minimum, danger to the former president. And so that's one of the things that they certainly we are working on right now, as we speak. One of the things that I heard today was, you know, talking to officials. You know, they said that they had heard from the NYPD that there were increasing security for the next few days of the grand jury, and that seems strange to secret service officials because they had anticipated perhaps that there was going to be some kind of break. And so, now, we know why that that's -- that that position has certainly changed from the NYPD. And now, they're anticipating as Paula just reported that he will be presenting himself in Manhattan in the next couple of days in early part of next week.",

Instead, whatever evidence they were able to present was likely so overwhelming and the probable cause center to say this warrants this extraordinary moment in history. And, Erin, let's not undercut how extraordinary it is. We've never had a president sitting or former ever be charged with a crime. And here we have one, and it might be one of many.
