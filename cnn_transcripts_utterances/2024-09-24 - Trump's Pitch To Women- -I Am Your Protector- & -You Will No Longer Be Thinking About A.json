There's no clear leader, in this race. And the results of this nationwide survey of likely voters is well within the margin of error. Look at these numbers. Harris, 48. Trump, 47. Voters are telling us that far and away, the most important issue to them is the economy. 41 percent say that -- say that as their number one issue, while 21 percent believe it's protecting democracy. And then immigration and reproductive rights. As for who voters trust more to handle their biggest concern. Right now, Trump is leading Harris by a 11 points at 50 percent to 39 percent.

And joining me now is Kentucky's Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, who is a surrogate for the Harris campaign. It's great to have you here. Governor, we heard from Donald Trump, today, talking about his economic policies that he would implement, if he wins a second term. Vice President Harris is set to lay out her agenda, tomorrow. And this comes, as these new CNN numbers that are out today, show likely voters trust him more than they do her, on the economy, 50 percent to 39 percent. Why do you think that is? GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D-KY): Well, people don't always remember the recent past. Donald Trump left the American economy in shambles. Yes, it was during a pandemic. But it grew very, very difficult, especially near the end. His economic policy, which includes tariffs, he started to implement. And what we saw were other countries putting their own tariffs on products, including Kentucky Bourbon. The policies of Donald Trump in the economy certainly hurt my state, and would hurt them again if implemented again. But I think you see his policy being all about how he feels, on a certain day, and what country he's going to put a tariff on. Her policies are about us. They're about a middle-class tax cut. They're about affordable housing. They're about the families in Kentucky and across the United States of America.",

The issue he has is, this is the 11th, Kaitlan, a 11th lawsuit, and people are alleging things that are very similar in nature. Couple of things have come up about this. The first is why it's federal. I'll tell you. There's no federal claims. They're based on New York City claims. Not to get inside baseball. But what New York City did, very progressively, is they said, Look, if you were sexually assaulted or abused, that we're going to extend the statute of limitations for a two-year period, OK, and started in 2023, ends in 2025 in March. And so, that's why she's included, even though these are in 2001. The other issue, obviously, that comes up with this in terms of proof in the merits, is well, how is it sustainable? Well, she's alleging that there's this videotape that is out there that resurfaced in November of 2023, and that videotape would memorialize or otherwise show exactly what occurred.

A Harris spokeswoman said, I did not know this fact about her. It turns out she had shared it before. She had mentioned it before, while running in 2020 and then as Vice President. But I think, for many Americans, myself included, it was a new piece of information, and a very relatable one. Did you have a first job in high school or college? My first job was swirling ice cream cones, across the street from McDonald's, and the McDonald's was the only place was open after work. Everyone has that kind of relatable first-job experience.",
