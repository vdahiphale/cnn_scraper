And an energy struggle with Saudi Arabia. What in the world is going on? And China's leaders, more than 2,000 of them, are gathering this week to make major decisions about the country's direction for the next five years and beyond. On the agenda, an unprecedented third term in office for Xi Jinping. What else will be decided? I will talk to the former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd. Then, \"Stop the Steal\" maybe headed south of the border, as Latin America's largest democracy seems to be taking cues from its neighbor up north. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: You don't concede when there's theft involved.",

And gas and oil prices around the world will be extremely high. And I think that's basically Putin's \"Hail Mary,\" Fareed, where he's going to throw as many troops into Ukraine to hold the ground, hope that oil prices spike as high as possible in the winter, force people around the world to choose between heating and eating, and create pressure, he hopes, for the Iranians to cut a dirty deal with him.",

I mean, after 9/11, after the brutal murder of Khashoggi, the relations between us and Saudi Arabia were already really shallow, really frail, basically. And we asked Saudi Arabia to use its influence not to raise OPEC oil prices, not to side with Putin who wants prices to go high so he can get more money for pumping less oil. And the Saudis made a calculation based entirely on what they thought were their interests, their budgetary needs, and told basically Biden to take a hike.And I get it. They've got that power. I don't think we're going to break relations with them in the short run. But lord, how long are we going to have an energy policy that leaves us exposed, Fareed, to forcing our president to go to Saudi Arabia or anywhere else on bended knee to ask for more oil. We have to have a realistic policy. We have the ability to generate these resources on our own. We have to do it with a climate policy. But we have waited too long. There has to be a coherent, strategic approach to this, and get over the whole progressive thing that we can't talk to oil companies. If the Biden administration doesn't get a coherent policy together, if the energy secretary, who's been completely missing in action, doesn't get the group together, we need to have a coherent policy that maximizes energy security, economic security, and climate security, we're going to go begging for, you know, every six months for somebody else to fill in the gap.",

The Communist Party's 20th National Congress is expected to hand a historic third term as general secretary to Xi Jinping, cementing his position as one of modern China's most powerful leaders after Mao and Deng Xiaoping.What agenda will China set for the next five years and beyond? Joining me to talk about all this is Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia. He's now the president and CEO of the Asia Society, and this year released an important new book called \"The Avoidable War: The Dangers of a Catastrophic Conflict Between the United States and Xi Jinping's China.\" Kevin, welcome. I want to ask you about this party congress. We look at China right now and we see a lot of problems. We see a COVID policy that isn't working. We see an economy that's stalled. We see a lot of distrust among China's neighbors, from India to Australia. Will any of this matter as Xi Jinping solidifies his power base, or has he got such an internal lock on power, that this party congress will just be a rubber stamp of his third term?",

You'll see him remarkably reappointed by about 2,300 votes to zero.I think on top of that, you'll likely to see personnel appointments which are largely if not exclusively his own closest supporters, and a continuation of the Xi Jinping policy line, probably, on the economy and foreign security policy as well.

And the reason I say that is it outlines the ideological articulation of Xi Jinping's political, economic, and international policy line. So I think that is where the real substance of this congress lies.What I've seen in the last several years now, Fareed, are three big changes. Xi Jinping has moved the center of gravity of the politics of China to the Leninist left, more party control over everything. He's moved also recently the center of gravity on economic policy towards the Marxist left, greater role for the state over the private sector, and at the same time, moved the dial towards the nationalist right in a more assertive in foreign security policy. I see those trends on balance as likely to be continued and in some areas strengthened.",

Cheap capital mostly from the U.S. Cheap labor mostly from Asia and in particular China. And cheap energy, in particular Russia coming into Europe. All those things are going away now.So we're seeing a real pendulum shift. This is happening for a lot of reasons. There are geopolitical shifts, you know, COVID, war in Ukraine. It kind of pulled up a scrim and made us realize that it matters where we get our energy. It matters where our supply chains are. But even if we didn't have such a fractious politics globally at the moment I would argue that we're moving to a more regionalized, localized sort of economy for all kinds of reasons. The environment. You know, you look at the emissions cost in transporting cheap goods all around the world, and this is something that's changing as we move to a price on carbon at some point.
