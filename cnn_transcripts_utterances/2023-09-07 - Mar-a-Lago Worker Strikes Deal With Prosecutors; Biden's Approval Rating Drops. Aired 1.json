Now, the campaign is not officially commenting on this individual poll, but they have been amplifying some voices, some Democratic voices, who have said that this poll should be taken with a little bit of a grain of salt. But one Biden aide that I spoke to said that right now their focus is not just on -- is not on this individual poll, but instead looking ahead to what the general election and battleground state polls will ultimately show really heading into next fall, once there is a Republican nominee selected. Of course, so much of what the Biden campaign has done in these early stages of the campaign is trying to paint this as a race between President Biden and MAGA extremism, drawing on former President Donald Trump. But some of the issues that David touched on right there are issues really worth focusing on, including when it comes to the president's handling of the economy. Of course, they have been making a big push over the course of the summer to try to sell this Bidenomics vision, trying to convince American voters that the president's policies are paying off for them. But that polling found that 58 percent of American voters believe that the president's policies have worsened economic conditions, showing that the White House and the campaign still have some room, some movement that they need to make when it comes to the public perception. One person I spoke with here at the White House earlier said that it will take time for people to feel this economic impact. Of course, they will have the next year to really make that case to voters. Of course, another issue that is of top concern to the general election, to the American voters, but also within the Democratic Party, are these questions about President Biden's age. And so far the campaign hasn't made headway in improving those numbers. And you saw just the prevalence of the age question. As Vice President Kamala Harris traveled in Indonesia. She did a pair of interviews where she was asked to address the president's age. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're voting on grievance and personality around Trump. And the other time for choosing that another Republican president gave, not Ronald Reagan, but at the Ronald Reagan Library, Liz Cheney last year, indicated the time for choosing is actually between Trump and the Constitution.

Number one, typically pleading guilty tends to give individuals or defendants lower sentences. That's just how our system works. Some -- many people call it the trial penalty, that you get a penalty for going to trial because you get a higher sentence if you're convicted then. So it's -- and also providing testimony that helps prosecutors, truthful testimony, also can work toward someone's favor.

All right, I want to move on to the case in Georgia, where the DA is saying, look, I think the trial will be about four months -- this is what she submitted to the court -- and include over 150 witnesses with, potentially, maybe not, but potentially 19 different defendants.

When you talk about 150 witnesses, you're not just talking about each of them taking the stand. You're talking about possibly the lawyers to all 18 or 19 defendants cross-examining those witnesses. So, each person might face multiple rounds of questioning alone. Then you get to the question of whether some of these defendants might get removed to federal court, might have different reasons to sever out their cases and so on. So there are just complicated legal questions. Four months is very, very ambitious under even the best of circumstances. And there are any number of questions that are going to complicate this case.
