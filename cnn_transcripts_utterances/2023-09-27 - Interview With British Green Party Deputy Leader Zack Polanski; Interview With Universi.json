He speaks toMichel Martin about his new book, \"Losing Our Religion.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Is a global green agenda in trouble as leaders around the world are rolling back climate policies and pledges, they say to boost their economies? Here in Britain, the government has just approved a huge new oil and gas field in the North Sea. Just a week after the Prime Minister Rishi Sunak slow rolled carbon neutral targets. But to be clear, the International Energy Agency says that limiting global warming to that 1.5 degrees Celsius would require no new drilling and the green potentially huge. A new Oxford University reports finds that Britain's energy needs could be met entirely by wind and solar power by 2050. We're going to explore this in depth tonight. And my first guess is the deputy leader of Britain's Green Party, Zack Polanski. Welcome to the program.",

The superrich are doing better than they ever have before. Meanwhile, people are living in mass poverty. This is an opportunity to make sure we have good green jobs for people as we renew those industries and transition.

Betsey Stevenson, welcome. You just heard one of the leaders of the Green Party here talk about, you know, the vandalism, the environmental vandalism, and also talk about the costs.

The problem is actually holding back change. And I think that's going to be really difficult. I think the biggest threat to the U.S. would be if the U.S. doesn't manufacture electric vehicles and other countries do, and our auto industry does. You know, one of the reasons the U.S. had such a strong auto culture and auto industry was because we were first movers early on when it came to ICE, you know, the internal combustible engine. So, we want to be able to do the same thing on electric vehicles. I understand why there's a lot of skepticism. You know, if you look at the kinds of subsidies that were put in place by the Obama administration for electric vehicles, Tesla was a big company that was a big capture of those subsidies. Tesla's a non-unionized company. They're actually a company with known for a lot of violations of workplace safety rules. They're not where American auto workers want to envision themselves working. And so, what they want to make sure is that the policies that are getting put in place are going to allow electrification in a way that protects union jobs. That's the case Joe Biden has to make. Donald Trump's going to be out there saying, I'm going to promise you no change. People shouldn't believe no change, because that's not possible.

Well, my case is -- I'm a privileged refugee, because I got out of my country after the military coup in 1973and I went to Venezuela, which at the time was a rich, generous, open country full of immigrants from all over the world that came to work. So, there were chances, opportunities, hospitality, and I was able to reunite with my family there. So, my case was particularly good in that sense. I haven't gone through all the horrible tragedies that people experience in the humanitarian crisis at the border of the United States with Mexico, and in other places as well. But there's another factor here when we talk about the -- about immigrants and about refugees and asylum seekers, there is a racist component. When people from Ukraine leave their country, they are welcome, not only because the country is at war, but because they are not black. And in the south of the United States, people who come are people of color, and that is a factor here in the United States, and people don't talk about it at all, but it is. I have been, all my life, a displaced person because, as a child, I moved from one country to another following my stepfather who was a diplomat. Then I became a political refugee, and then an immigrant in the United States. And the experience of refugees is completely different from that of immigrants.",

I mean, if you look at kind of the rates of connection to Christian faith in Europe, for example, or western Europe in particular, it's very low. And then, there are a lot of people who would say that this is exhibit A of why this is kind of a toxic force and really, we all would be better off if more people walked away from it. I mean, obviously, you're not in the business of trying to persuade people who believe that firmly. That's not kind of who the book is for. But for those who do feel that way, who might be listening to our conversation, do you have a message for them?",

But secondly, I would say, it's important even for people who are outside the church what happens within the church. They are going to be religious Americans forever, and that has a lot to do with the help of the rest of the nation. So, even if you were somebody far distant from Evangelical Christianity, you ought to be hoping for a healthier Evangelical Christianity. It affects everyone. What's happening -- and that's especially true when we look around and we see institution after institution after institution in crisis. You can't -- the rest of the country can't come in and replicate what churches have brought to communities and to persons. And so, when that becomes unhealthy, that's dangerous for everybody else. It's also dangerous when people use religion for authoritarian or demagogic ends. That's always been the case, because if you can use religion, you can give one -- you can give yourself an extra kind of authority that says, if you disagree with me, you disagree with God.
