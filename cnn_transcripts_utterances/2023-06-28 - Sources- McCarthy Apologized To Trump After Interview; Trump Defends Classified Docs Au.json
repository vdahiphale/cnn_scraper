Kevin McCarthy himself, after winning the speakership on the 15th ballot, came out and thanked former President Trump for winning him the gavel. So there's a belief there that he needs to stay in Donald Trump's good graces. But things changed in the aftermath of McCarthy's comments yesterday, that Trump may not be the strongest candidate.

And even giving an interview to the conservative publication, \"Breitbart,\" saying, \"Just look at the numbers this morning, Trump is stronger today than he was in 2016.\" That was -- that came as he sent out those fundraising solicitations also calling Donald Trump the strongest possible candidate here. Really reminiscent, Brianna, of the aftermath of January 6th when Kevin McCarthy said the former president, or then president, bore responsibility for the attack on the capitol. But just soon after went down to Mar-a-Lago, made peace with the former president. And has since contended that many people are to blame for January 6th, not just the former president.",

And it's over the Justice Department's handling of the Hunter Biden investigation. Among some other key issues that are important to the hard-right faction of the House Republican conference that is aligned with Donald Trump. The belief is, if they can get him on their side, they can pursue their agenda that is important to that element of the conference.

And then fell to peer pressure and turned back to supporting as loudly and publicly as he could Donald Trump. I think it's a mistake. And it's really what's put us in this juxtapose right now. We've got Donald Trump leading the polls in the primary against what is quite honestly the least most popular president ever. Seven out of 10 Americans still don't want Joe Biden to be president again. But yet, we're going to probably miss another layup because we can't put the right candidate against Joe Biden.",

Today, we're talking about Brad Raffensperger on the January 6th side of the Department of Justice investigation. This is the fourth investigation slash potential indictment that's out there. I don't know any human that can deal with multiple state and federal indictments and then run for president around the country all at the same time. It just feels like we're taking our time making the right decision. But this should be a golden opportunity for a Republican candidate to step up and to put real leadership on display. Don't try to be Donald Trump light. Don't try to beat him at his game. Just put good leadership on display.

If you're the special counsel, you've just called Rudy Giuliani as part of your investigation into Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election, you've also called back in -- or called in for the first time Brad Raffensperger, of course, highly involved in that phone call.

Even in light of that audio. What you have is somebody talking about -- a candidate for office who might have been zealously advocating for himself and has a plausible defense versus there were documents in your house that you acknowledge that you had that you obstructed the investigation into.
