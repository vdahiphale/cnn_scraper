Authorities in Virginia releasing details of a note found on the Walmart killer's phone. This as investigators work to piece together a motive.At a World Cup showdown for the ages. The U.S. and England set to go toe to toe in cutter. That's what we're watching at this hour. Thanks for being here on this Friday. I'm Erica Hill in for Kate Bolduan. Holiday shoppers hitting the stores on this Black Friday. Inflation, though, is along for the ride this year. So, yes, there are plenty of holiday deals out there, but with the starting prices a little bit higher than they were last year. Are you actually saving? Walmart and Target, you may have noticed, kept their stores closed this Thanksgiving, opting instead to begin discounting items ahead of the holiday. CNN's Alison Kosik is live at Macy's here in New York City. So give us a sense, fairly busy? How busy is it? What are shoppers telling you this year?",

And I think it's deals and discounts that may bring out a record number of shoppers this shopping season, at least from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. That's considered the first real holiday shopping weekend of the season.166 million people are expected to come out and shop across the country. 115 million of those just today on Black Friday. And more than half of those, 67 percent, are expected to shop inside stores, which is something new because we all think that people only shop online. One thing heavy on everybody's mind is what you mentioned, Erica, inflation. It really is the elephant in the room. And while it is taking away a lot of spending power for consumers, they're getting kind of crafty on how they, you know, find a work around. Listen to one shopper I spoke with, (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Nice to see you this morning, Jean. So Alison just noted some of those numbers, expectations from the National Retail Federation. They also predict that instore shopping this season is going to increase about 3 percent over those 2021 numbers. I have to say one thing I've noticed recently, being out there in stores again physically, is -- there's not a lot of merchandise. They may have something in one size. So I'm wondering, have you noticed, are retailers upping that inventory in anticipation of more in person shopping this holiday season? JEAN CHATZKY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, HERMONEY.COM: Yes. Nice to see you too, Erica. Happy Thanksgiving. And we are seeing more inventory, a lot of inventory that they haven't been able to clear from earlier in the pandemic, from the supply chain problems that hit. And so the big question is whether consumers are actually going to want the merchandise that the retailers have in store. But this could be the first Black Friday in a long time that looks fairly normal because there were a lot of stores that decided they were not going to open for Thanksgiving, that they were not going to do the really traditional doorbusters where people line up at 3:00 in the morning and you get crowds of people hustling over each other. Instead, what you're seeing is, as you saw in the piece, shoppers trickling in all day and looking for deals. And if you're careful, there are good ways to get them.",

Slight delay out of Miami, but really nothing to speak of.But here's what's next. The next storm that's developing in parts of west Texas, snowing in parts of New Mexico and west Texas, I-10, 20 and 40 could get in there. And also some very heavy rainfall in Houston. That could slow some things down as we work our way into Saturday. And then finally, we move this, guess where, by Sunday right, over the northeast airports. So if you're sick of your relatives already, maybe you want to reschedule that Sunday flight. Or if you still like them, you could move that up to about Wednesday, because things are really actually looking pretty slow for your Sunday.

That's why they suffered the same fate as me.\" Here is another quote, \"I wish I could have saved everyone from myself. My God, forgive me for what I'm going to do.\" Now, the note also discusses how the author wished that his parents had paid closer attention to what he called his social deficits and said that he felt like he was, quote, led by Satan. The note says the attack was not planned, but the fact that there even was a note discussing what he was going to do suggests that maybe there was at least some planning. And city officials say the shooter, Andre Bing, used a 9-millimeter handgun and that it was purchased locally on the morning of the attack.
