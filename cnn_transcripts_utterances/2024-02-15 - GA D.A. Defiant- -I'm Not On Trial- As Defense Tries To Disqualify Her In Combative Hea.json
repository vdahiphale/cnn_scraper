At issue, her relationship with lead prosecutor Nathan Wade the timing of it and whether that and how they paid for trips they took together created conflicts of interest.

That was an uphill battle to begin with even when you consider in they only had one witness testifying about a relationship that predated the time in which finding Willis and Nathan Wade admitted to having one.

Had you heard stories? Had you seen text messages? What did you know to substantiate what you are presenting to the court?You didn't have those follow-up questions.

They had to go to a backup witness who again, in my viewing of the hearing, did not provide sufficient detail, may have an interest or again is it - as been labeled as a disgruntled employee and all of that goes to credibility.So when you look at those weakening credible points with the level of detail that was provided the surety of the DA and providing that level of detail again, I think if you were looking at credibility, I don't see where the defense has met their burden nor do I see where the judge could disqualify her.",

But if, Anderson, they are disqualified, I do mean they, it's not just Fani Willis, it's her entire office. It would mean that you have a prosecuting counsel in Georgia that then has to choose to either appoint and assign or get somebody else to now be the prosecutor. That successive team doesn't have to actually follow the recommendations of the indictment, they could add defendants, they could take away defense, they could actually dismiss the case and they could try to go to a private practice litigator that is a hard battle as well. We're talking about a very nominal fee compared to what the stakes are, security issues, political implications. There is a huge spotlight over this case if they are disqualified, this could be slow rolled in a way that we would not have a trial before the actual election in November and dare I say not for the many months to come.

Today, he was quiet he was leaning back in his chair for most of the time. And really paying attention to the attorneys who were speaking, what I also thought was interesting. We talked a lot about how the attorneys perform for an audience of one and I have seen in the cases I've been covering that the lawyers do tend to enhance their dramatic speaking before the judge when Trump is in the room. And after Todd Blanche had made his pitch to try to push back the trial date and loss, they moved on to talk about jury selection and to talk about the trial schedule, the judge said is there anything else you want to bring up. And at that point Blanche looked over at Trump who nodded at him and then Blanche began saying he objects to everything that's happening in this courtroom, Trump shouldn't be here, this shouldn't happen in America. And then when Trump was leaving the courtroom, someone in the back row started clapping and the court officer said quiet in the courtroom.
