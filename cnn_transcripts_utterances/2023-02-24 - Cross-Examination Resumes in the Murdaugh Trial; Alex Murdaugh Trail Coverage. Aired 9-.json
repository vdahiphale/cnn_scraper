Essentially, when he got up on that stand, he basically admitted to years, decades of deceit. And he told the jury, yes, I stole millions of dollars from my clients, people who were often disadvantaged and venerable. Yes, I lied to investigators. I lied to my friends. I lied to my family about where I was the night that my wife, Maggie, and my son, Paul, were killed.But, Alex Murdaugh said, I didn't shoot them. I did not murder my family. And this time you should believe me. And the question is going to be on whether or not that's a convincing argument to the jury for a defendant to get on the stand, it's risky no matter what, it's perhaps even riskier for Alex Murdaugh because he opened himself up to questions about the 90 plus charges that are still pending against him, dealing with those financial crimes against him. And, look, the prosecutor went in on that yesterday. The line of questioning almost exclusively about those charges, as the - Creighton Waters attempts to sort of put together this picture of Alex Murdaugh as a man of privilege, a man who has abused the prominence that his family has established over a century in this county, and saying he's basically a known liar. We're going to see that continue today. We do anticipate for the next couple of hours this to go on, Jim, Kristin, for him to get to the murders and cross examine him on that as well.",

He could go out and find pieces of property that were really cheap, get them and sell them and make money.Well, we got in some of these deals, and we got in as Barrett and it was some other people. Well, when the recession hit, one of the reasons these land deals caused me trouble is because the people that I was in these deals with no longer could pay whereas I might have gone in and I was a 20 percent person. I'm now, all of a sudden, either I have to default at the bank and affect credit, affect the ability to borrow, or I have to pay 100 percent. And so that's what I did, I paid 100 percent. And so there were year where I was paying instead of a fifth or a half, I'm paying the whole thing. And it equated to hundreds of thousands - it equated to millions of dollars, which is one of the ways why I ended up with the Moselle property, because I had paid more than $1 million in monies for Barrett and that was part of the deal and the trade in me purchasing Moselle.",

And I continue here today.But one of the justifications at the time when I was taking pills and doing the things I was doing was, I may ask a partner, OK, how much is this case worth. And if - if one of my partners - and I may not even give them all the real facts, OK? So, if they said this case is worth $100,000, OK, and I go out and I get them $300,000, you know, that's one of the stupid little things, OK, well, this isn't the same.
