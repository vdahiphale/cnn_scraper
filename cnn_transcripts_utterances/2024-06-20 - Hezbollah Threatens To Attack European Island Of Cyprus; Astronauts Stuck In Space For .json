      "sentences": "Well, we're in this very difficult predicament that Hezbollah says it won't agree to a ceasefire, less Hamas agrees to a ceasefire. And Hamas has rejected all the offers for a ceasefire. So, one way to end this would be, say to let Israel continue putting pressure on Hamas. And hopefully, Mr. Sinwar, the head of Hamas will agree to a ceasefire deal in exchange for hostages and some release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. That would open the possibility of a ceasefire in the North.America and France are trying to negotiate some type of diplomatic solution there. I can't tell you what the -- what the chances for that. I was in Washington for the last few days. And I didn't hear a tremendous amount of optimism about that, what leverage the United States could bring to bear on Hezbollah to get it to withdraw under Israeli fire back to the Lithuania River. It's about 13 miles from the northern border. And according to a U.N. resolution back in 2006, Hezbollah was supposed to have withdrawn. But of course, it never did. A very explosive situation, indeed. And it's important that people in the United States understand that this is a -- this is a conflict, which is much, much bigger than the conflict in Gaza. Hamas -- it has about -- have about 15,000 rockets, about 30,000 terrorists. Hezbollah has 150,000 to 170,000 rockets. They're bigger. They're longer range. They're heavier rockets. They're very accurate. And Hezbollah, military forces at least 100,000 strong, and they've been massacring Syrians for the last decade. So, they're very adept at committing these atrocities. So, it is an extremely explosive situation with regional complications -- implications because Iran could get involved. And pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, Syria, and even the Houthi rebels could get involved. Israel can be hit by rockets from Yemen -- on all sides. So, it's a much, much bigger conflict.",

And I'd hoped that that would work. The other venue is to fly increasing pressure on Hamas to accept that ceasefire because that seems to be the key. This is the sort of de- escalating the entire situation.That won't solve all the problems. Many -- (INAUDIBLE) won't go back to their homes in the north, knowing that his butler remains on the other side of the fence because they saw what happened in the south, with Hamas on the other side of the fence. So there has to be a fundamental change in that status quo ante. But certainly, the first step would get Hamas to agree to the ceasefire. And then Hezbollah maybe, maybe would agree to a ceasefire as well.",

Miles, you know, I saw this and I was a little concerned that maybe we're not covering this enough. What's going on here? Does this jump out at you as being something pretty significant? Should we be worried about these two astronauts? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST (on the phone): Well, there's no reason to worry in the short term, Jim. They're fine.

If they -- if they decided to fix it, it would have severely delayed the launch because they would have had to roll it -- to roll it back off the launch pad and into the hangar. And that takes a lot of -- a lot of time. They're still saying there's enough helium to get them home, or at least that was the last word we had. But as these leaks persist, they want to be doubly sure of that. Because if there's a failure of those thrusters on the way down, that could put the crew in great jeopardy.",

Is this in any way related or connected, or maybe I'm just off base there?O'BRIEN: Well, I -- you know, I think, Jim, these are questions that are reasonable. This is a separate division of Boeing. The space people have their own operations separate from the commercial airliner business. But ultimately, you know, the buck stops at the guy we saw in front of Congress the other day getting grilled. And you have to ask the question about Boeing, whether that push to maximize profits across the board has somehow manifested itself and cutting corners in the space division. I can't say that for certain. I can't connect the dots myself. But it's something that we should take a long, hard look at.

So according to the Miami Beach Police Department, Scott was on a charter yacht last night when he was involved in some sort of dispute with the crew. Now, when the charter yacht gets back to the marina, we're told that police were called out and that Scott is asked by officers to leave.Now the arrest report does note that officers said it was pretty clear that Scott had been drinking. The rapper, we're told, at some point gets into a car and he leaves only to return a second time. And then he makes his way toward the yacht again. It's at that point, that police stopped them and said, look, if you don't leave, we're going to arrest you. Scott, he refuses to go. And so he is taken into custody. Now, according to the arrest form, and we're counting what happened, police wrote that the defendant \"later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, it's Miami.\" A source close to the rapper noted about this entire ordeal that there was no physical altercation, but there was no additional comment from his team. Scott, he scored his Tenth Grammy nomination last year with the release of UTOPIA. And if you recall back in 2021, he was in the news as well when 10 people were killed at his Astroworld Festival when the crowd surged toward a stage there. Scott himself wasn't charged with wrongdoing, but he and several other organizers have faced a number of wrongful death lawsuits and settled all of them. Again, Jim, the 33-year-old spent the night in jail. He has since been released on a $650 bond. Another incident involving a celebrity and alcohol. This time though, it was on board a chartered yacht.",

Just Stop Oil wants the UK Government to phase out fossil fuels by 2030.

COY WIRE, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes. and, Jim, every day of these U.S. swimming trials, a record has been broken. And every day we seem to have another great story like Simone Manuel's punching their ticket to Paris. Simone touching the wall in fourth place in an absolutely stacked women's 100-meter freestyle final last night. But it was good enough to clinch a spot on the four-by-one relay team. For her third trip to the Olympics, Manuel described Wednesday as a healing night. Her performance capped off this incredible comeback that you mentioned. She was diagnosed with that overtraining syndrome in 2021. That condition came with overwhelming exhaustion, anxiety, and depression.
