And that storm surge right now shows impacts all along the western coast. And so I encourage people -- and I really appreciate your help in getting that message out that it's not just the path of the storm and it will continue to change. But look at all of the risks that are associated with this storm, storm surge being the most life-threatening, not just where the path is going to go or where the eye of the storm is going to make landfall.",

When Hurricane Ian hit, you had many communities of color, you also had poor communities complaining that they were not prioritized during this time.So they didn't get necessary relief that they wanted and they felt like they were kind of put on the back burner. Many of these areas are in places that are more physically vulnerable. What is your message to those who have that concern that there may be a repeat in their community?",

And we had teams of personnel that went out into communities across the state.And as we heard stories of maybe pockets of people that we may have missed, we immediately sent our teams out in those areas to make sure they were getting registered for assistance and we were bringing all the resources that were available. What I would say is, if you hear about groups of individuals in parts of the state that, after the storm passes, are of need and they aren't getting that, let me know. I will send my teams out to those areas to make sure that they're getting all of the assistance that they're eligible for and that they need.",

We also have a very layered approach. We can also reach out into all members of the Department of Homeland Security through what we call the Surge Capacity Force for individuals that have volunteered to support during the disaster. So I'm confident right now that with these two storms we're currently dealing with in Maui and this one or even another one to come, that we have enough personnel to go in and support these immediate life-saving efforts.",

We started withatmospheric rivers in California in January, extreme tornadoes in the spring, to the wildfires. And now we are in peak hurricane season. And we have had an unprecedented number of disaster requests from governors because of the extreme weather that they're experiencing. This is our new normal. This is the operational tempo that we find ourselves in. And we have to continue to invest in mitigation, in resilience to help these communities reduce the impact from these storms so we don't have such complicated recoveries afterward.",

Mark Meadows, his former White House chief of staff, testifying for more than three hours yesterday.And he did not shy away from his role as Trump's point person in the weeks after the 2020 election. Instead, he sought to convince the judge that coordinating Trump's strategy to upend the election was actually part of his official government duties. Meadows' lawyers say that's why his Georgia case should be moved to federal court. But whatever the outcome of that hearing, the testimony could have huge consequences for both election cases that Trump is facing. Let's talk about this now with CNN justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider. First off, Jessica, we should talk about the timeline here because the judge did not give a firm timeline on when there would be a ruling on this. And we are expecting on September 6th for there to be this arraignment process for all the Georgia defendants. Could we see Meadows actually get arraigned before this decision comes down?",

It's quite likely that this judge will rule before September 6th.Because the judge did acknowledge in this hearing that he was well aware that Mark Meadows and, of course, the 18 other defendants, including the former president, are scheduled to appear in court on September 6th. But I will note it's likely that most, if not all, of these defendants actually won't be physically in court on that day. We've already seen one of the defendants, Ray Smith, who was a campaign attorney for the 2020 election for Trump, he's already waived his appearance saying, I'm going to submit my not guilty plea, I'm waiving actually being in court. So it's likely the former president will waive. Meadows will waive if he needs to. Other defendants will either waive or appear virtually. It's likely we won't see anything in the courtroom itself.",

But the prosecution had exactly the point that Marc Short was making yesterday on our air, saying that this really went way outside the bounds of his role as chief of staff. And because of that, Fani Willis and her team, they called one of these Trump campaign lawyers to the stand to talk about, well, you were a campaign lawyer, so obviously this was along the lines of a campaign, this wasn't official business. That was the point they were trying to hammer home. But I will say Meadows made a forceful argument being on the stand for three and a half hours really trying to say, everything that I did was within my realm as chief of staff just because it's such an expansive job in his view.",

So that is why Governor Christie thinks he can be competitive here. But still an uphill battle because we know that Trump's base of support among -- continues to be strong.
