We learned a short time ago that authorities recovered a cell phone and also a note that were believed to be written by and belonging to Card.It's been 38 hours since 18 people were murdered here in Lewiston, Maine, and new details about the suspect are emerging. As I said, that cell phone, that note, no details in the note describing a motive. Still, it could be important to the investigation. The manhunt spanning a couple counties, many towns. Shelter in place orders for 700 square miles. A huge area now with thousands and thousands of people told to safeguard their homes and safeguard their cars. We are learning more about the victims. New this morning, we just learned the identities of two more, Bill Young and his 14-year-old son, Aaron. They were killed. Let's get the latest on the shelter in place orders, and the manhunt. Let's go to Omar Jiminez. By the way, Omar outside the bowling alley where the shootings began. I'm outside the bar where the shooter then moved and killed more people ten minutes later. Omar, what are you learning this morning?",

Also at the restaurant was 39-year-old Peyton Brewer-Ross. His brother tells CNN that Peyton loved being a dad more than anything else. His daughter, Elle, we've learned, has just turned two years old. Thirty-four-year-old Tommy Conrad was a manager at the bowling alley. He is also a father.

And, you know, the person decides to take their own life. And then sometimes they are taking alive. But the more that time passes, the more likely this person is not going to be taken alive.

So, there's a lot of mystery going on here.I think we're just going to have to wait until we have some clues. But I guarantee you, all of the law enforcement, they're taking this beyond seriously. They are - they are pursuing every possible lead. I personally don't think he's anywhere in the area at this point. I do think that he's escaped. I think Canada's a very good possibility.
