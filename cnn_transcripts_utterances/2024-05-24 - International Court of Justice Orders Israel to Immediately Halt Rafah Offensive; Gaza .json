      "sentences": "Well, we've just been told that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said to hold a phoneconsultation with key ministers regarding this ruling by the International Court of Justice. He's going to be speaking with the foreign minister, the minister of strategic affairs, the minister of justice, minister of defense, the head of the National Security Council, and the attorney general to discuss this latest ruling by the International Court of Justice, which we should note is very, very significant. The first time in this nearly eight-month-long war that the International Court of Justice has actually ordered the Israeli government to halt a part of its military offensive in Gaza, ordering the Israeli government to halt this military offensive in Rafah, describing the events of the last three weeks since the Israeli military began that offensive in Rafah as exceptionally grave, resulting in the displacement of already extremely vulnerable people, saying that this results in a material change in the situation that then empowered this court to issue this latest provisional ruling. We should also note that in this order, the ICJ is also calling on the Israeli government to immediately open the Rafah Border Crossing, which has been closed since the start of that Israeli military offensive in the early hours of May 7th. But the question will ultimately be, what will this result in? We don't expect the Israeli government to comply with this order by the ICJ. We're already hearing from several ministers in Netanyahu's government saying that this order should be ignored, calling it irrelevant, saying that Israel should ramp up the military pressure in Rafah rather than bring it down. But then the question will be, what will the resulting actions be from other countries around the world? We have been watching over the course of this week beginning with the International Criminal Court seeking arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister and the Israeli defense minister, then three European countries unilaterally recognizing a Palestinian state. What we have been watching through all of that is not only growing condemnation for Israel's actions in Gaza over the course of the last nearly eight months, but we're also watching Israel's growing isolation on the world stage. And there is certainly a possibility that should Israel, as we expected to, choose to ignore this ruling by the ICJ, that it could face not only further isolation, but sanctions from other countries who want to uphold the authority of the International Court of Justice, which we should note does not have any enforcement mechanism on its own -- Becky.",

And when you point out the facts that the court says that they believe Israel hasn't sufficiently addressed concerns aboutthe impact of its military offensive in Rafah on the civilian population there, it's also important to note that the presiding judge also brought up the months of warnings from humanitarian aid officials on the ground who have said that a military offensive in Rafah, which was previously viewed as somewhat of a last refuge for more than a million Palestinians, that that would have tremendous impacts on the flow of humanitarian aid, on the ability to distribute that aid. And also the concerns about where that population that we have now been watching be displaced over the course of the last several weeks, where they would go and the conditions that they would find. And indeed many of those warnings from humanitarian aid officials have indeed come true because the conditions that they have found at the Al-Mawasi Humanitarian Zone as the Israeli military describes it are totally insufficient for human beings to actually be able to live in for that number of human beings to be able to live in. And in particular, when we're talking about no sewage infrastructure, no water infrastructure, insufficient tents for people to actually live in, the combination of all of that is the picture that the ICJ was painting here, one that they view as something that could potentially be -- have irreversible effects. And therefore they believe empowered them to issue this ruling today.",

Well, after days of delays, aid groups have finally begun distributing humanitarian assistance from the U.S. pier in Gaza.

And this hour the head of Hezbollah is speaking at a ceremony to honor Iran's late President Ebrahim Raisi. He was killed, of course, when his helicopter slammed into a mountain on Sunday. Investigators are still looking at evidence, but they say so far there is no sign of foul play. Raisi was laid to rest yesterday in his hometown of Mashhad. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen was there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): The streets of Mashhad jampacked with people mourning the late president, Ebrahim Raisi, as a truck with his casket made its way to the Imam Reza shrine, one of the most important holy sites in Iran. Hundreds of thousands of people have come out here on the streets of Mashhad. This is really very much the political and the spiritual homeland of Ebrahim Raisi. And the people here say while they're in great sorrow, they hope that Iran continues down that conservative trajectory that was common for Ebrahim Raisi's administration. (Voice-over): In power for three years, Ebrahim Raisi was a conservative hardliner. Overseeing a crackdown on protests against Iran's strict hijab laws in 2022 but also the first ever strikes against Israel from Iranian soil in retaliation for the bombing of Iran's embassy compound in Syria. Crowds at the funeral screaming death to Israel and death to America vowing to remain loyal to Raisi's hardline agenda. 100 percent, 100 percent, this man says, these are all Raisi's and they will continue. And this woman says, we have come here to say if they took Raisi from us, we still have our supreme leader and we back him and we'll never leave him alone. We have always expressed our position towards the U.S., this man says. Just like the policy of the president and the martyr Qasem Soleimani to struggle against arrogance. we won't allow the arm of arrogance to go around the world. We'll cut it down. After Raisi, Iran's foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and several others were killed in a chopper crash in northern Iran on Sunday, Tehran says a new president will be elected in late June. But this week has been one of mourning, culminating in the funeral prayers for Raisi inside the Imam Reza shrine. As the body of Ebrahim Raisi was brought to its final resting place, Iran is looking ahead. One of the U.S.'s toughest adversaries soon to decide its political future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He does have a lot of support here even though of course in other parts of the country, he might be more controversial than he is here. And there still are a lot of people who are coming to his grave. There's a lot of people who are taking pictures of the grave. There's still a lot of people also bursting out into tears. One of the interesting things about Ebrahim Raisi's grave in that shrine, which of course you know also from being here so many times, this shrine is one of the most important holy places in this region. Certainly the most important one in Iran. Ebrahim Raisi's grave is actually very, very close to the tomb of the Imam Reza, which in itself is certainly remarkable here for this country. So the mood here of course still one very much of mourning, certainly in the city of Mashhad. But at the same time, a lot of people already looking ahead and waiting for that political machine to start kicking into action. Of course, the big questions that now await Iran is first of all the presidential election, which is said to be held on June 28th. Who are the candidates going to be? Are more moderate candidates going to be allowed to actually run in that election than for instance when Ebrahim Raisi was elected and the turnout was quite low? And of course, who those candidates are going to be shaping the political future of Iran? Because of course, while the supreme leader of Iran certainly is the final authority on everything here in this country, the president also does have significant powers to shape policies.",

So a lot of fire there in the region because of that. But at the same time, you did have especially the foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian, who of course was also killed in that chopper crash going around the region and trying to mend some of those relations with some of these countries in the region. For instance, tried to better relations with Iraq. You look at the relations with Pakistan, for instance, the United Arab Emirates but also several other countries in the region like, for instance, Saudi Arabia, where for the first time in a longtime diplomatic relations had been restored. So I think that that was very important for the Iranians. It was certainly a different tone than you've seen before. And I think it is absolutely right that all these countries or a lot of these countries sending some pretty high-level delegations does show that there was a bit of detente going on in that regard. At the same time, of course, you do have all of these organizations like for instance, Hamas, like for instance, Hezbollah, where it's absolutely clear that they are very close to Iran. And of course, those are also organizations that right now are involved in a lot of the big issue here in this regions and also very adverse to any sort of American presence in the Middle East as well -- Becky.",

It's false and that not only is this the sort of standard language the FBI uses to make sure that searches are executed in a safe way, it is also the standard protocol that was in place when the FBI did a consensual search of Joe Biden's home in Delaware for classified records in a separate investigation that has now ended.

On Monday, the International Criminal Court sought arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister over the war in Gaza. On Wednesday, Ireland, Norway, and Spain say they would formally recognize the state of Palestine. Also on Wednesday, the families of several female soldiers released graphic video of their abduction, hoping to pressure the government into getting them back.

Just how many years this -- Heydrich rather is going to serve for these firearm offenses. Now the sentencing is taking place as the back-and-forth between officials in Turks and Caicos and the U.S. really was heating up. And yesterday, the country's premier went after the allegations that were made by some U.S. lawmakers that the country there was targeting Americans rather. The premier noted that in the past six years 195 people have been convicted of firearm offenses in Turks and Caicos, but that only seven of them, just seven of those 195 people have been Americans. And so the premier said, look, let's allow this judicial process to play out. Judges in Turks and Caicos have discretion when it comes to handing down sentences for these type of offenses and so it's possible that none of these Americans that have been arrested will receive the mandatory minimum of 12 years in prison. In fact, rather, the premier said that no American that has ever been convicted on these types of charges has ever received that kind of sentence. Heydrich, who is from Pennsylvania, was arrested back in February. He is one of these five Americans that have been picked up on these charges of possessing ammunition in the Caribbean Island. Heydrich said that he forgot that he had these hunting ammunitions in his luggage. And he told a CNN affiliate that since he's been on the island, unable to come back to the U.S. he has missed several important family events including the graduation of his daughter from kindergarten. Now, Becky, U.S. lawmakers said that just how these court cases end up playing out could determine their next possible steps. Some congressmen here in the U.S. said that they may call for a do not travel advisory to the Turks and Caicos Island, which you can imagine would be a direct hit on the tourism there. As for the four other Americans, they're expected back in court, one of them next week, where he will be sentenced, and then the remaining will be in court in June and July.",

Now the airline will reportedly not serve hot drinks or meals when the seatbelt sign is on. It is also altering at least one flight routes over the part of Myanmar where the sudden extreme turbulence occurred on Tuesday. Now the plane was diverted to Bangkok after the incident. Hospital officials there say 22 passengers are still being treated for spinal injuries, six with skull and brain injuries. CNN's Pete Muntean joins me now live from Annapolis, in Maryland. Pete, I've just detailed sort of the kind of broad brush of these Singapore Airlines changes. What do you make of them and what more might we expect?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, this is something that all airlines deal with all the time and turbulence is insidious andinvisible. And so many airlines are investing into trying to predict turbulence, in some cases using machine learning to try and get around it. The old school way is typically the best method. Pilot reports or wide reports where pilots radio ahead to say what the turbulence is like in front of them to the airplane behind them, that is only as good as the information that pilots put into it. So now Singapore Airlines is saying it's taking these extra steps to try and mitigate the problem of turbulence. The three steps it has laid out, trying to make it so that flight crew take their seats when the seatbelt sign is on, stopping service on board the plane when the seatbelt sign is on, that includes meal service, and securing more things in the airplane when bad weather is expected. That includes things in the galley. It is a top cause of injuries on board commercial flights. The top cause of injuries on board commercial flights. And airlines are really trying to tackle this turbulence issue as more and more of these severe incidents come to light, like the Singapore Airlines incident. So few end in a fatality like this one did.",

And look, you know, this isn't -- although it's frightening to hear reports of incidents like this, this is not stoppingpeople in the States at least traveling for Memorial Day weekend. Millions are on the move. Some of the numbers here, Pete, 44 million people expected to travel over the four days from Thursday, according to AAA, with the vast majority going by car. But you can also expect the nation's airports to be packed. The TSA expects to screen more than 18 million passengers over the weekend.
