Moments ago, the State Department announced 15 U.S. citizens were evacuated from the Caribbean nation via helicopter. A spokesperson estimating that more than 30 Americans will be able to leave each day on chartered flights.In the meantime, officials in Florida are awaiting the arrival of a plane set to bring a number of Americans to the state, and nonprofit groups are getting involved, too, including my next guest, Bryan Stern, who is the founder and CEO of Project Dynamo, which is a Florida- based organization actively helping U.S. citizens get out of Haiti. And, Bryan, I mean, we meet again here. I saw you last in Ukraine as you united an American couple with their baby who had been born by surrogate there. You also assisted Afghans during the U.S. withdrawal in 2021. Tell us what you're trying to do in Haiti.",

So there's -- there's lots of lots and lots and lots of Americanssaying, help me, help me. Our efforts have been -- it's been very frustrating here, to be frank. The -- lots of governments, lots of different equities, lots of different politics, lots of different issues. And of course, funding. We're donor funded. So we're limited on our resources, too.

So, you know, the idea that they're doing things is excellent. That's what they that's what they should do. Once that capacity kind of increases and that throughput kind of increases, we'll be able to fold up our tents and get out of here, which is which is what we hope.

So this is a this is our first, you know, quote unquote, war zone deployment, where the U.S. embassy, it's not open for services.

Daniel Opdyke on the right was sentenced to 17 and a half years in prison earlier today. The testimony so far has been graphic. We do want to warn you, some of what you're about to hear is disturbing. Let's go to CNN senior national correspondent Ryan Young, who's been following this story very closely.

We ran down here while court still ongoing, and I can tell you, even the folks who guard this building are concerned about the emotion getting out of hand and this proceeding with Dedmon.The courtroom is full of extra marshals. They have extra security in place. There's two large groups of family members. But what we've been hearing in court is quite graphic. And to tell our viewers what they described is the deputies found a sex toy inside the home, and they took that sex toy and they placed it in the mouths of both men. And then at one point, they tried to place the sex toy in Michael Jenkins. And the only reason why it did not go in Michael Jenkins is because he started to defecate. Then they forced both men to take a shower together so they could try to clean up the evidence. Look, there's been a lot of talk about the corruption in Rankin County. There's been talk about maybe trying to make sure the sheriff is no longer the sheriff. I want to show you Daniel Opdyke's lawyer after court today because he spoke about the corruption and how far it possibly goes. Take a listen.

The Princess of Wales has been recovering from surgery, off work for weeks at this stage, and all this has been perhaps exacerbated by that Photoshopping incident.But this report, if true, takes it to a whole different level. This was a report from the \"Daily Mirror\" today and it investigated a potential data breach at the London clinic, the private hospital where the Princess of Wales was seen back in January. Now it alleges that at least one member of staff tried to access the private medical records of the Princess of Wales. Not only is that wrong, not only is that serious, it's potentially criminal and it's certainly illegal. So this is something that authorities are taking very, very seriously. The ICO, which is the data regulator here in the U.K., have launched an investigation. The London clinic, which is the hospital, the CEO came out. He was a bit ambiguous, actually, about the report itself, but he did say there is no place at the hospital for anyone who intentionally breaches the trust of patients or colleagues. What is clear is if this breach really did happen, then a line has been crossed -- Brianna.",

They were very clear right from the get-go that the princess was undergoing surgery. We weren't going to be told a great amount of detail about that.
