The U.S. says they believe -- they're very confident in fact -- that it's from China. A balloon that drifted in or came in over Canada and has been oversensitive sites, the Pentagon admits, over Montana.Now they haven't specified what those sites are, but Montana is home to several ballistic missile fields, ballistic missile silos, and perhaps that's what this surveillance balloon was going after. The Pentagon says when this first came over and they started watching it, they did launch F-22 fighter jets. In the end, the decision was made not to shoot this down. President Joe Biden asked for military options for the possibility of what it would take to shoot this down. In the end, senior military leaders, including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, the top U.S. officer, recommended against shooting it down for a number of reasons. First, there is a risk to what's on the ground. Facilities and people there on the ground, even if it is Montana and isn't densely populated. More importantly, though, the Pentagon says they don't believe this has intelligence gathering capabilities, what, satellite communications above what Chinese spy satellites already have. In the end, the decision was made not to shoot it down. But the Pentagon emphasized that should they determine this is a high risk, they do retain that option of carrying out a military option against this, of essentially shooting this surveillance balloon down. The Pentagon will keep watching this. It's important to note that the Pentagon did bring this up through diplomatic channels both in Washington and in Beijing. And it comes at a time of incredibly high tensions with China. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.",

There's a heck of a lot in there, but not precisely what the Ukrainians have been asking for as of late, which is fighter jets and long-range missiles. Part of the concern on behalf of the U.S. and the west is that these kinds of weapons could be used to strike targets inside of Russia itself, escalating this conflict.Yesterday, the Ukrainian Defense Minister, Oleksii Reznikov, tried to tamp down these concerns in his argument to the European Commission, saying, \"If we had the opportunity to strike at a range of 200 miles, the Russian army would not be able to maintain defenses and would be forced to lose. Ukraine is ready to provide any guarantees that your weapons will not be involved in attacks on Russian territory.\" So what the U.S. is offering instead seems like somewhat of a compromise. Inside this package is something called ground launched small diameter bombs. These are guided missiles. They have little engines inside of them, little wings that come out after they are fired, and conveniently, they can be used with the HIMARS system that the U.S. has already provided to Ukraine. This doubles the range of the HIMARS system, but it's still only about half of what the Ukrainians are actually looking for because this package does not include long-range missiles. It does not include fighter jets either. Though the Ukrainians did get a boost on the fighter jet argument yesterday from the Polish Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, who said that if he were deciding on behalf of NATO, that the Ukrainians would get those jets. And this is significant because, remember, it was just last month that the polls became the first country to say that they would provide tanks for Ukraine, and very quickly, 11 other countries followed suit.
