Zach Cohen, terrific reporting as always.The Senate is inching closer to passing that foreign aid bill that provides assistance to Ukraine and Israel. A final vote is expected this week. We'll be discussing with Arizona Senator Mark Kelly. That's coming up next. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:41:38] KEILAR: The Senate is one step closer to passing a $95 billion foreign aid bill, which includes funding for Israel and Ukraine. Lawmakers were able to move the package forward with the support of 18 Republicans, despite opposition from former President Donald Trump. But can they get the bill passed this week? Let's talk about this now with Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona. He sits on the Armed Services Committee. Sir, as you know, Trump is pressuring Republicans to kill this legislation. He says the U.S. should stop providing foreign aid unless it's structured as a loan. What is your reaction to that reasoning? SEN. MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Well, it's a mistake. The former president doesn't seem to know what's in the best interests of our own national security. We need to make sure Putin loses here. If we don't, this could wind up in a wider conflict. So I don't understand his logic. The good news is we have bipartisan support here in the Senate to do this, to get this Ukrainian aid. They're running out of ammunition. They need our help. But Brianna, you know what we also had bipartisan support on? And that was border security last week. We've got this crisis at our border. And Senate Republicans, unfortunately, decided to walk away from this. They decided they wanted to keep the problem instead of coming up with a solution.",

We can't get an agreement, so Senate process gets in the way of this. And politics is getting in the way of this. And this is what the American people really hate about Washington.And back to the border security thing, we worked on that for months. This has been a problem for decades. We were going to provide more border patrol agents, asylum officers, judges, the technology to stop fentanyl at our border and have better policies to get control over our border. And because of the former president, that part of the deal is now dead. Now, we've got to get this Ukraine security package done. If we don't, they're going to run out of ammunition. We can't allow that to happen. So in the Senate here, you know, I'm confident we're going to get this done. It's not likely to fall apart right now. The other issue is, then, how do we get this through the House?",

And the Israelis are taking some steps that I've got to say are unprecedented.Before they conduct an airstrike, they reach out to the community, text messages, flyers. Sometimes they even knock on doors and they monitor the number of people who leave the area. And if they don't, they adjust the rules of engagement up or down based on, you know, those results. Having said that, 20,000, 30,000 innocent civilians, it's a huge number. And they've got to do a better job. We're pressing them to do a better job on this. I was over in Israel right after October 7th, again, a few weeks ago. I brought this up with Yoav Golan, who's the defense minister, also directly with Netanyahu, that they have to do better on this issue. And, you know, conflict in Rafah, it's going to be a challenging -- it's going to be challenging for the IDF. So hopefully the IDF comes up with some, you know, rules of engagement that protects innocent life there.",

This clearly wasn't the original plan when Austin first went to Walter Reed yesterday and when the Pentagon issued a public statement saying that he was on his way back to the hospital. They said that Hicks was on standby, but that Austin was taking both his unclassified and his classified systems with him to the hospital so that he could continue to perform his duties. Obviously, once they got him there, they realized he was going to require more intensive care than perhaps initially anticipated. And now of course we see Hicks taking over at least until tomorrow. There are a few other things that Austin is going to miss as a result of this. We know also that he was expected to travel to Brussels to attend a NATO Defense Ministerial and in particular a meeting related to the provision of aid for Ukraine.

We are getting near real-time public updates on his condition and what is anticipated in terms of who will be carrying out the duties of the defense secretary. Because again, of course, the secretary received an extreme amount of criticism from Capitol Hill about his failure to notify not just the White House, but also other senior administration officials, Congress, even the press at the time of his hospitalization in January.He's expected to testify before the House Armed Services Committee later this month to address some of those concerns and he has publicly acknowledged that his handling of that episode was a mistake. Somewhat ironically, the Pentagon also carried out a 30-day review of the notification procedures for when the duties are transferred from one official to another. That review was completed last week and in fact is currently sitting on Secretary Austin's desk for his review.",
