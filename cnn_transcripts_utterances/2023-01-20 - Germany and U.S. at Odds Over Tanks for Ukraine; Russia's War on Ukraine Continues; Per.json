In any attacks on military infrastructure, you know there is tighter communication that weren't there in terms of how the information ultimately comes out whether or not the attacks are successful or not. So, it is something that we have to keep in mind as we measure these statistics is successful attacks against the military are less likely to be widely reported and visible than attacks on civilian infrastructure.",

But now in Ukraine, we have an active conflict in multiple parties essentially trying out military doctrine that has been thought through and testing it in real-time.And so now, it is an active battlefield relative to cyber, less only a kind of espionage intelligence gathering front, much more actively on the disruptive operations and destruction of equipment and information. And we are seeing that action which we have never seen before at this scale and for such a sustained period of time. It's truly a historically incredible time in terms of being able to write and then adapt military doctrine as it comes to cyber warfare.",

But then also on the other side, the United States, NATO allies, and then as you highlighted, Microsoft and other private companies who have committed resources, information-sharing, and other tools to the fight.And so, on both sides, we are seeing something that we've really never seen at scale for such a sustained period of time before in the cyber domain of warfare. So again, on both sides, we have organized governments, militaries, nations states, and then also private corporations committing resources.

So, just because Russia's capabilities have now - you hear some talking about the maybe downplaying of Russia's capabilities. And I don't think that's the case at all.So, the learning, we should not take away from this one particular episode even though it has been sustained over the last few. We should not think that Russia is any less of a threat on the cyber front at all. Again, remember, just a year ago, the attacks against Viasat and the effectiveness of that. So, I think we have to be very careful about it. There's a lot of learning to be done but I think that some of it need to be done in hindsight in quieter times.",
