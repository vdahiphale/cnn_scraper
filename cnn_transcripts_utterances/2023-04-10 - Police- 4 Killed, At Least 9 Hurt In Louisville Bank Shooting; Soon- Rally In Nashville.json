But what we have learned is law enforcement sources say he was either terminated or was aware that he was about to be terminated from his employment at that bank. This certainly rose anxiety and he -- we are told by those sources -- wrote a note addressed to his parents and a friend, indicating he was going to conduct a shooting at the bank.Here is what's not clear whether that note was something on paper that was left somewhere and found later or whether it was an email. We don't know if that note was read before the shooting or after the fact. We are aware that sources tell us that his parents hearing about it on the news rushed to the scene, believing it possibly could have been him. We also have learned from law enforcement during the press conference that it was live streamed by the shooter on a social media platform, a well-known social media platform and that they were able to find that video and take it down. It's not clear at this point how many other people found that video or if it's out there, but as you would note, it's similar to what we saw in the Buffalo mass shooting at the supermarket. So, on the gun, an AR-15 type rifle, that's being traced to determine its point of purchase and whether it was owned by the shooter or someone else. A lot of things going on in the background, search warrants being conducted at the resident legal process of being served on multiple social media platforms to see what they can glean about his communications and thinking before this.",

And no one from his family had heard from him.And so to see someone who I thought had been killed alive, and this is what we talked about exactly what you asked about, Jake, and my advice to him from, unfortunately, firsthand experience of being a survivor of a workplace shooting is to -- is to be with loved ones, is to embrace yourself with that love, to talk to a therapist. I actually started using a meditation app. I still meditate to this day as a result of following -- that I started that practice after the shooting. It is very difficult times to those who are victims, even if they weren't physically hurt, and today's shooting, they are definitely still victims.

Mifepristone in a regiment with another drug called misoprostol, is FDA approved for abortion, up until 10 weeks after the last period, and they've been used safely for more than 20 years.Data analyzed by CNN shows mifepristone is even safer than some common, low risk prescription drugs, including penicillin and Viagra. Misoprostol can be used on its own in a medication abortion, but it's not FDA approved that way. Studies show it's not as effective and some doctors say it can make a woman feel much worse. DR. ERIKA WERNER, TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER:  We're more likely to see failures and therefore more likely to need surgical intervention after misoprostol alone. Dr. Erica Werner is chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts Medical Center in Massachusetts. We trained to try to keep people healthy. Give them the most evidence based care and this ruling really jeopardizes that. We're feeling demoralized. We're feeling scared for our patients.",
