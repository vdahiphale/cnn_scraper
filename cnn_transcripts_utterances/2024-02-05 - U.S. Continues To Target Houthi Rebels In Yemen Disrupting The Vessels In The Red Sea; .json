Live from New York, I'm Paula Newton. Zain and Bianna are off today. You are watching \"One World\". The United States is vowing to take further action against Iranian-backed militias in the Middle East as the ripple effects of the Israel-Hamas war continue to spill right across the region. The U.S. has hit dozens of targets now in Iraq and Syria over the past few days in retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers in Friday's drone attack in Jordan. U.S. officials say 84 of 85 targets were destroyed or damaged. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Among his key objectives, progress on a hostage deal, coordinating the day after for Gaza, and trying to ensure the region that the U.S. does not want to escalate the situation any further. CNN's Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson is following all of these developments and is standing by for us in Tel Aviv. But we begin now with CNN's National Security Reporter, Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. And Natasha, I want to go right to Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor. And he was blunt on the weekend, right? He said there are more strikes to come. And this is interesting. He underscored that it's Iran that has, in his words, a significant and pernicious responsibility for this instability. So, I'm wondering, are you getting a sense of what further action may look like in the hours or days to come?",

I'm interested to get your take. You've, of course, heard from all sides here, and you know what the argument is, right? It's either the U.S. isn't hitting back strongly enough or the strikes are further destabilizing an already combustible situation. So, that brings us to a possible deal, right? Between Israel and Hamas. Most say, look, you're not going to solve any of this unless things settle down. Are you getting a sense of where we are with perhaps a truce to come in the coming days or weeks? The State Department at the moment believes that the ball is in Hamas' court. Egyptian intelligence chief along with the chief of the CIA, the Qatari Prime Minister and the Israeli head of Mossad had a meeting in Paris. They hammered out a proposal for Hamas. Hamas has got that. Indications are from Hamas. They're not going to budge on their demands, but everyone's still waiting for an answer and there's daylight between what Hamas is saying they want and what Israel is saying it wants. Indeed, we've just heard from the Israeli Prime Minister sort of doubling down saying that absolute victory includes killing the Hamas leadership and we cannot stop the military operation in Gaza until then. So, that's a pretty -- sounds like an immovable position. I think, you know, when you take the language that's being used in the region by Iran's proxies and by Iran, which is in essence, that if you can just get a deal in Gaza, then all this other trouble, like the hitting of ships in the Red Sea by the Houthis and the uptick --significant uptick and killing of U.S. forces in the region by their proxies, all that will melt away. But I think the reality that's understood here is that what they're talking about is a deal in Gaza that favors Hamas, weakens Israel, therefore weakens the U.S. interest in the region which is the long game of what Iran is doing, and it's using its proxies to do that. So, we are at that position. At the moment, it appears, waiting for Hamas's answer. So, the risk, therefore, of a miscalculation and escalation is as big as it ever was and will continue as such. It does not seem, at the moment, as if that deal over Gaza is close. Who knows? It could be around the corner, but it doesn't sound that way.",

      "sentences": "It's not. This is definitely one of the slower moving storms, which has been one of the problems with this isthat it's not moving out very quickly, allowing some of these areas to just have storms that train over the same areas over and over again. It's still raining right now across portions of Northern California, especially up around Eureka, Crescent City, even Central California, still looking at some heavy bands from time to time. But really the bulk of the heavy moisture is still focused across Southern California, specifically in and around the Los Angeles area. That's where we still have the most recent of the flood watches, still in effect for a lot of these areas. We had a flash flood warning in this area that has now since come down. That does not mean it's done raining. It just means that what's coming down a little bit lighter at this point in time, but we could still get more of those as we go throughout the rest of the day. This behind me is Mission Creek. You can see that creek is completely swollen, that water level all the way up to this bridge right here, flowing over onto the roadway there, and it's one of many roads that we've seen that water piling up on. There have been swift water rescues in some of these communities, as well. Looking at some of these numbers, it's no surprise. Look at this. Several areas picking up well over 200 millimeters of rain just in the last few days and they're likely going to pick up as much as 100 millimeters more on top of what they've already had. And that's why you still have that widespread threat for many of these areas for flooding today. Now, the target point is still going to be down to the south. Areas that does include Los Angeles, portions of Long Beach where you see this pink color here, that is a level four out of four, the highest risk possible for flooding. To emphasize how rare this actually is, high risks are issued fewer than four percent of the days per year on average, but they account for more than 80 percent of flood damage and nearly 40 percent of fatalities. Again, the other concern is also power outages still looking at over half a million people without power in the state of California. And Paula, no surprise again, take a look at some of these numbers. Wind gusts exceeding 200 kilometers per hour. Some areas could still see them exceeding 100 kilometers per hour through the day today.",

We are expecting more rain this afternoon, but we're not expecting the intensity or the volume that we had yesterday. Most of the energy seems to have moved south into the L.A. basin.

What was unprecedented was the amount and the duration of the rain that's why Mission Creek and Luguna Channel and Sycamore Creek, all of our drainages were at or over capacity.

We had great public service. All that's been great. We have had no loss of life, no serious injuries that I'm aware of, some downed power outage, downed power areas, but Edison has been here to work with us.

And we've only had one major water rescue, so far, the vehicles which -- the last time we did this, we rescued about 110 vehicles. So, we were much more proactive about blocking off streets and the community has been great as far as response.

We haven't heard anything from them, and now a question. So, what has happened is that the attorneys have assembled in the courtroom. They are looking at photocopies of the question. And you have so many prosecutors, and they are all together standing, reading this question, conferring with each other. The defense attorney, she's all alone. She does not have a co-counsel. She is sitting at her desk, really not studying the question too much. But you try to discern what's the question. Now, we're going to hear it. We should hear it in open court, waiting for the judge to take the stand. The defendant, I didn't see in the courtroom. But the question can be anything.

You can't always read the tea leaves but possibly, you can. Now, the morning started with jury instructions being read by the judge --the judge really focusing in on that there can be more than one cause of death. That even though Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old son of Jennifer Crumbley was the one that had the gun that pulled the trigger horrifically, killing four students for them not to have their lives anymore, this took this community to its knees. The emotion that was involved and this jury is from this community. But the defense has said that Jennifer Crumbley did not have warning signs. She had no idea her son had any type of mental issues. He was sad, he lost his grandmother, his dog, and his best friend recently, but she didn't think he needed mental help. The family had a hobby of guns. They had gotten a gun for Ethan purchased by the father.

However, I will say, I was struck by that, and I think many people were.

Such a big surprise, especially after she has been so open about her health recently. While when Taylor Swift came up on stage, she did not acknowledge Celine. She took the award from her, but she didn't hug her. She didn't say hi to her. So, social media is up in arms over this today and last night, but the pair did have a moment backstage. We saw some photos of them, so it seems that all is well. But you know, Taylor always has people talking, doesn't she?",

Iwatched the show, and go on social media, guys, and repeat it, I mean, starting with Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs, but then also Joni Mitchell. So many emotional moments. In terms of you being there, I mean, what was the vibe? Especially, you showed some controversial moments, as well, with Jay-Z.",

It was not previously confirmed that heand Beyonce would be there, but when he did take aim directly at the recording academy on the Grammy stage, the room was shocked. You actually heard an audible gasp, and we saw, you know, Beyonce even looked surprised by what he was saying, but of course, you know, he's standing up for his wife. But Beyonce is the all-time Grammy winner. She has more Grammy Awards than anyone, but what Jay Z was saying is while she does have all those Grammy Awards, she doesn't have an Album of the Year Award. So, you know, he meant to have a positive message, but it did shock the room probably even more than it shocked people at home. But as you said, so many great performances, a huge night for women, a really amazing night of reuniting the old and the new. You had all of these legendary stars from Joni Mitchell to Billy Joel and then younger stars like SZA and even Miley Cyrus who has been in front of our eyes since she was a little girl. But to see her win her first Grammy, which, it's hard to believe that's her first Grammy was a great moment. And on that Miley note, I loved when Miley was up there with Mariah Carey. You could really feel her excitement and that kicked off the night and being there in the room, everybody was on their feet cheering for Mariah when she came out.",
