The confirmation process that could take months and a process that typically includes FBI background checks. But the Trump team has yet to file necessary paperwork to get the FBIto conduct those standard reviews. Trump's transition team has so far bypassed that step, instead using private companies to conduct vetting before announcing some candidates, something one Democratic senator on the Judiciary Committee says is a major problem.

I was -- I remember being with her backstage during the Democratic debates. And now she has embraced MAGA, and concerns about whether or not she's been compromised as we heard Senator Duckworth tell Dana Bash yesterday on CNN. Then, of course, you've got someone like Lori Chavez-DeRemer. She's considered to be a pro-labor Republican. She has co-sponsored very favorable labor legislation. And then, of course, at the end is Pete Hegseth, you know, drip, drip, drip, that we keep hearing about this incident from 2017, this alleged sexual assault. This is the reason why it's so diverse. It's diverse because these are folks who to the point haven't been vetted by the FBI, but they haven't taken traditional paths in politics necessarily.
