You can see the Airbus A- 350 burning there. But what is really poignant to me is the video from NHK where you see this Japan airlines Flight 516 flight come in to land on runway 34-left at Haneda Airport.This is very telling here, because you can see the immediate aftermath of the nose gear on fire of this plane as its it's decelerating down the runway. What we do not see what is just out of frame on the right. We don't see the moment of collision with that Japanese Coast Guard Dash 8, that's a twin turboprop airplane. We know that six people were onboard that plane. Five of them are dead. The captain in critical condition. Haneda Airport, this happened around 5:47 p.m. local time, about 3:47 a.m. here on the east coast. As four runways, there are two parallel runways that go north and south. This was on runway 34-right, and then there are other parallel runways that buttress that on the north edge and the south edge of the airport. The real question here is who was in the wrong place at the wrong time? And the question that investigators will really look at is whether or not it was this Japan Airlines flight or whether it was the Japanese Coast Guard flight. This is something known as a runway incursion, and that is immediately apparent to me. And this is an issue that has been happening over and over again in the U.S. In 2023, we saw about seven of these incidents very serious, serious enough to get kicked to the National Transportation Safety Board. It was an issue from coast to coast, JFK, Austin, Boston, Burbank. In the Austin incident, a FedEx flight almost landed on a departing Southwest Airlines flight. To me, these incidents sound somewhat similar, and of course the aviation community around the world will be looking at this incident to see if that was this, if this was indeed a runway incursion. And that will really change things potentially. The Federal Aviation Administration here, of course, has to watch this closely, and we will see if there will be any international help from the National Transportation Safety Board here in the U.S. when it comes to this investigation. Of course, the first thing they will want to listen to is whether or not there was much confusion on the radio, whether or not the pilots were getting the proper instruction from air traffic control or whether or not the pilots were confused about where they were on this very complicated airport with four different runways.",

You're landing, whether you're transiting on home or whether Tokyo is home. And then all of a sudden this crash, and you look out the window, the engine is on fire. All of a sudden black smoke fills the cabin. And in probably what feels like either an eternity or just a heartbeat, you're safely outside the plane and you're standing and you're looking at this looking at this from a distance, thinking how did I survive this? How did this happen?That is what around 400 people, although some of them are so young they are probably not going to remember it, because there were eight people, eight children under the age of two on the plane, that's what they went through. And as I said they are starting to now tell their stories. Listen to this passenger and what they said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is something that everybody who flies a lot or flies at allthinks about, has thought about. What happens if your plane is in an emergency situation? What happens if the plane is involved in an incident? And a lot of people wouldn't expect that after something so dramatic that they would be able to be standing and talking about it. And it's got to be just a mix of emotions that one could only understand, really, if they have been through it themselves. And more stories from the passengers I am sure we will be hearing about in the coming hours and days. But just truly extraordinary. And also truly heartbreaking to think about the five families of those Coast Guard crew members who are now grieving along with the dozens of families across Japan that are mourning after just what's been a really horrible start to 2024. Just hours after ringing in the new year, a massive 7.5 magnitude earthquake, homes just devastated, entire roads washed away by some of those tsunami waves. Even though they weren't as big as back in 2011, they still were big enough to cause serious damage. And then this plane, with Coast Guard crew members who were supposed to help deliver relief is involved in this incident, and now these families are here during what was a time of celebration, now joining the people here in Japan who are grieving and who have lost.",

But, you know, the Supreme Court has to choose whether or not it wants to take up this case, but at least this appeal will at least set the stage for that possibility to happen. Now, we also expect Trump to appeal a similar decision in Maine where the Secretary of State there also ruled that he should be removed from the ballot. That appeal will go through state level courts, and that both decisions are on hold until the courts weigh in and this gets worked out through the legal system. But listen to what Colorado's Secretary of State said yesterday, when asked about the urgency of this situation, and the need for the courts to weigh in and weigh in quickly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENA GRISWOLD (D), COLORADO SECRETARY OF STATE:  I certify the names onto the ballot for the presidential primary this Friday, and so we do hope that the court understands that presidential primaries are rapidly approaching and gives us a definitive answer whether or not the former president is disqualified from the ballot.

They passed the statute, 18 USC 2383, which is -- they actually expanded the reach of the insurrectionist band beyond just the previously elected officials to basically anybody that would be barred from holding office, but that has to be done through a judicial proceeding in the federal court. And Congress has also acted through impeaching. They impeached Donald Trump for insurrection, and he was acquitted there.

A source telling us his name is Michael Avery, actually from the Syracuse, New York area, but staying in Rochester. And as you just heard Audie talk about, a source saying that they found a suicide note and a journal in a hotel room where he was actually staying. So those items coupled with the fact that there were gas cans at the scene of this crash along with the fact that this car was plowing through a crowd of people outside a busy area, and also the fact that a source says that investigators have already spoken to Avery's family members, put that all together and that's why authorities can definitively say this is an investigation involving domestic terrorism. Now, whether or not it is domestic terrorism, again, still early in the investigation, but this is the questions that they are asking as they sort of comb through the profile of this person. Let's back up just a little bit and explain exactly what happened though. This was really only an hour into the New Year's Day in Rochester right outside the Kodak Center, a facility that was having a New Year's Eve event. About a thousand people attended this event, and as they were leaving, even one witness said they could smell gasoline in the air. Authorities or actually police rather on the scene were trying to get people across a crosswalk when this Ford Expedition with those gas cans plowed into a Mitsubishi Outlander that was leaving the venue, in that car is where two people were killed. Several other people were injured in the crosswalk and the person driving that Ford Expedition, Michael Avery as identified by a source, he is still in the hospital we're hearing with life-threatening injuries, but we're continuing to get an update on that. So a lot here to digest that we've learned within the last couple of hours, but domestic terrorism is a question, something that's being investigated in this incident. And again, as we've talked about, Audie, this -- you know, authorities have been on the lookout for sort of these incidents, have been keeping really, you know, head on a swivel because of this sort of heightened threat environment that we're in right now. So this is an example of how the FBI gets involved very quickly, Joint Terrorism Taskforce gets involved very quickly with this investigation and we will continue to look for more answers, but two people killed.",
