We begin this hour with our breaking news coverage, as we are monitoring what is likely the largest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the Cold War. You are looking, of course, here at live pictures from Ankara, Turkey. That is where the swap is expected to take place. Turkey, for its part, says 26 people, two of them children, and seven countries are involved here. And this moment, we should know, comes after months of complicated negotiations between Moscow and Washington. Turkey also saying now that Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan are actually part of this swap. And that deal, of course, would end a nightmare that has lasted for more than five years, really more than a year for Gershkovich. CNN has a team of reporters across all of this, as we cover this breaking news this hour. I want to begin with our State Department Reporter Jennifer Hansler. Jennifer, you have followed this so closely for years, specifically the case of Paul Whelan, who you've spoken with a number of times. Bring us up to speed on what we know at this moment.",

      "sentences": "Well, Erica, this is indeed a massive undertaking that is happening right now in Turkey. We have heard from the Turkish government that there were seven planes involved with this swap for those 26 people, 24 detainees being swapped between a number of countries to bring home these Americans, Paul and Evan, we know for sure were on those planes, according to Turkish officials. And as you noted, this has been months, if not years, in the making. The U.S., since Paul was not included in swaps that brought home Brittney Griner and Trevor Reed, has been working to get him home, and then once Evan was arrested last year, they also upped their efforts to get both of these men home. Both of them have been declared wrongfully detained. So, they have been working around the clock and scouring the globe forpeople who they could offer up to Russia in a trade. We know that Russia often looks for parody in these cases. So, because they had accused both Evan and Paul of being spies, they wanted spies back in a trade. The U.S. did not have any Russian spies in their custody. So, they were going to allies to see who they might be able to offer. And according to the Turks, they were able to get Vadim Krasikov, who is a convicted Russian assassin who was in German custody as part of this deal. So, this is a massive, massive undertaking. Now, we're watching those scenes from the tarmac, Erica. We may see some images like we've seen in past swaps, almost like a Bridge of Spies, where we see the detainees crossing each other on the tarmac as they are returned to their countries of origin. Now, you noted that I've spoken to Paul a number of times. I think it's about -- been about a dozen times in his five years of detention. And he has gone through spurts of feeling very pessimistic about the efforts, but in recent months, he has had a lot of optimism about the work that was underway on behalf of him and Evan by the United States. I spoke to him the day that Evan was convicted, and he thought this might have greased the wheels for things to move forward. He also said he was able to very much identify with what Evan was going through in that courtroom. Take a listen to what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "It absolutely did. It raised eyebrows because typically this sort of trail for espionage could last months, even a year. So, this clearly indicated something was different about this case. But, it also illuminates the deeply manipulative process by which Russia has not only imprisoned people like Paul Whelan, but actually used them by allowing them, by allowing Paul to make calls from jail, notably the day after Alexei Navalny was killed. To Jen Hansler, remarkable journalistic work on her part that she got the call.But, from the Russian perspective, remembering that Vladimir Putin controls anything, deeply manipulative, because he will be fully aware that allowing Paul Whelan to speak on the phone to CNN really continues to broadcast the narrative of people left behind, prisoners in Russian jails, American prisoners in Russian jails, unfairly, unjustly convicted. But -- and in that particular phone conversation, Paul Whelan expressed his concerns that the fate of Alexei Navalny could be his fate. So, that was manipulative. It puts pressure on these delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations. We are getting a few more details from Turkish authorities about some of the other people being released. They're speaking about a German national Rico Krieger who was being held in Belarus, we understood was a humanitarian worker, and also another critic of the Kremlin, Ilya Yashin, who was arrested in June, I believe, 2022, and he was sentenced to eight and a half years in jail. His crime, if there was one, which there wasn't, was being a critic of the Kremlin. So, these are some of the indications we're getting from the Turkish authorities. And the Turkish also saying that this whole process has been done, this process of negotiation has happened, and they said, this is their words here, the dialogue channels have been run by the Turkish intelligence, MIT, Turkish intelligence, from the very beginning until the end, they say, when the -- when they were handed over, went the last moment of the processes. The Turkish are indicating, not only that their intelligence services helped facilitate this, but actually this process of exchange may have been completed.",

And that's as is appropriate, frankly, I mean, there is a sitting President, and this was a multilateral deal involving lots of countries, and they were the ones that were engaged in negotiations, and they weren't leaking that, and that's as it should be.So, this campaign narrative that's going on, and Trump was certainly trying to make something of that for himself, but in reality, this is a matter of utmost national security among countries that are fighting a proxy war against each other. So, it's not like there is any trust. This is a really challenging thing to make happen. And it got done. And I think it was going to get done as soon as was possible.

And what the Russians do is they use this as leverage in order to have freed spies and assassins and cyber criminals that are clearly people that actually belong in jail. Russia is a pariah state. It is led by a war criminal. They do not have functional diplomatic relations with the U.S. or virtually any of its allies. And you're working with this country. That's a real problem. And it should be a strong message.I mean, I am delighted to see Evan and Paul and others released today. I'm delighted for them. I'm delighted for their families. I'm happy for the countries that are involved. But, they should not have been in Russia, right? I mean, this is the point, is we have to make a very, very strong message to American citizens and citizens of our allies that you are in danger if you are sitting there. You're a potential hostage.

That priority being securing the release of Americans wrongfully detained in Russia. And that is something that has included multiple intense diplomatic negotiations by this administration. And what we now are learning is that that will include Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan.It's important to note too that in December of 2022 when the U.S. secured the release of Brittney Griner, the President at the time acknowledge that Paul Whelan was not part of that deal. They had worked to and U.S. officials had hoped that he would be, but he said at the time that he understood the Whelan family to have mixed emotions that day when Brittney Griner was released. Well, now, he is going to be part of this massive prisoner swap and a historic one at that. Now, of course, part of what we also expect to hear from the White House is the importance of alliances and the President's relationships with world leaders. That is something that he has often talked about and was -- or appears to be particularly critical in securing this release again because it involved so many countries. But, it's also an election year, and this inevitably will have a political backdrop. If you will call, former President Donald Trump, the President's and Vice President's Republican rival, had said that if he were elected, he would be the one to secure Gershkovich's release. Well, that is not the case. But, all the same, the President may come under scrutiny over who was involved in this swap, who was released back to the Russians. But, it is still historic in nature and a day of relief at the White House, should it all go as planned, when they get these two high-profile Americans back, including many others who were wrongfully detained and Russia.

But, all the other things that you mentioned in terms of domestic politics here in the United States, other political trends throughout the world, yeah, I think that does play a role.I think there is a couple of things. If you're talking about doing something that's logistically and administratively difficult, you need competency on the other side of it, or at least the Russians feel that way, which they may feel that the Biden administration, regardless of what the policy differences are between the two countries, the Biden administration is at the very least administratively competent and can pull this off. I don't think it's a mistake to say that Vladimir Putin must have noticed when Donald Trump said not too long ago, I will be the one who does this.

And the Russians really hate that because they like to break international law.So, it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out domestically. That would be my guess. In this country, it's going to be interesting too, because remember, we could do none of this if we didn't have our NATO allies. Turkey is very heavily involved as the exchange point.

There is -- that's just not done for obvious reasons. And so, it's -- he is -- he was taken hostage, as was Paul Whelan. I mean, he was charged with espionage, which I think was one of the things that probably the Russians use that as well. This is much more serious because of the charges, which is, of course, ridiculous, because they make up the charges out of whole cloth.So, at the end of the day, when you're talking about finally some sort of justice being served, and I don't mean at all on the Russian side, but at least in the big scheme of things, these people being released from horrific conditions is really nothing but good news.

But, this bomb was actually planted about two months ago before it was detonated remotely in the early hours of yesterday morning. Only once it was confirmed that Haniyeh was inside his room in that guest house. That bomb, once it exploded, killed Haniyeh as well as his bodyguard.Hamas and Iran have said that Israel was behind this assassination. Israeli officials have neither confirmed nor denied this. But, I have been told by this source that U.S. officials were briefed by Israeli officials only yesterday after this operation happened on Haniyeh's assassination. This has, of course, put this entire region on a knife's edge, as the possibility, the likelihood even, we should say, of retaliation, not only from Hamas and Hezbollah, which also saw one of its senior military commanders killed just hours before this, but also Iran vowing to retaliate, vowing to strike directly against Israel, according to multiple reports. This obviously suggests a major, major security failure inside of Iran. But, not only just Iran's overall military and intelligence apparatus, but it's Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, which was actually running and protecting -- charged with protecting this very guesthouse where Haniyeh was staying, indicating a massive, massive security failure by the IRGC, something very embarrassing for them, and obviously something that will lead to a lot of questions inside Iran about how such a massive security failure could have occurred. So, again, a bomb planted inside this home where Haniyeh was known to stay when he was in Tehran detonated in the early hours of yesterday morning, and not only killing him, but potentially engulfing this entire region into a broader conflict that we do not yet know the consequences of.

You can expect we're going to hear more of that today, perhaps from the President himself, and how he had to use those relationships, particularly with Germany, to try to secure a deal here, because again, part of this was also trying to find someone they could exchange or someone that they could exchange to Russia to get these Americans released.",
