This was the call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find votes there.

What is exactly going on? And I think you said it, which is, I'm not sure even if the economy does improve, which it is doing, right? We've seen inflation drop over the last few months over the last year. That would necessarily improve Biden's numbers and it hasn't. I think his real issue is his age.

But I can tell you, one of the reasons that they're saying things like the meeting happened and they're saying the type of things that they're sending is because they're worried about him. They're very worried about him. And there's two distinct groups of people who are concerned that they're worried about. It is the Russian population and it's these elites that surround Putin. The Russian population is why you're seeing things like oh, yes, they met, everything is fine. You know, you hear good things about it. There is a plan. They're worried that Prigozhin might actually have a grip on some of -- you know, how Russians feel about the war. That concerns them.

Sometimes, they'll come out and do protest but actually overthrow a government which, by the way, Putin himself mentioned in response to Prigozhin's activities. He mentioned the 1970 revolution.So, they're worried about that. They've got to be concerned about that. How long is this going to go on? I think what they're going to do is if they had just killed him outright or it comes to light that he has been killed, I think what would happen is that they don't want to risk that upsurge of popular support for him. I think they're going to slowly move in. You've already seen that they raided his apartment. They found all of these millions of dollars, rubles and stuff. They're going to try to paint him as corrupt. I think he is going to end up in a prison someplace or worse for the long haul.

Who's he making those collect calls from the jail? Do we have those on tape? Let us go back over the tapes and listen to them twice. Wants to see, here's the escape plan. But then once more likely to see, is there coded language that now that we see he is out of institution, we can decode to say, what does that suggest.

Now, one of the big questions is, how much influence will the Saudis have when this merger is complete? They are playing out what is likely the last season of LIV Golf now. In truth, nobody really cares about the outcome of LIV Golf tournaments. They care about it from a political standpoint. They have to figure out how those who defected, Phil Mickelson and others, come back. There has to be some penalty involved. They can't just come back because those who remain loyal like Tiger Woods and Rory Mcllroy and others are going to be ticked off by that. Those guys pocketed the money. Now, they come back. So, they got to work all that stuff out. So, perhaps it will be less obviously a connection to the Saudis once that has all been arranged. And this deal still has many particulars that are yet to be put in place. But the idea is that this is, as Richard Blumenthal, who is one of the heads of the committees along with Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Blumenthal, the Democrat from Connecticut, puts it, this is a beloved American institution. And the players and fans don't want to feel, at least many of them, against their will complicit in something that elevates a regime which many people find objectionable. So, that is going to be one of the questions. Monahan, the PGA Tour says that there will be a supermajority of PGA representatives on the policy board so that the Saudis will not be the ones who control the sensibility and the direction of it. It will be something that's completely recognizable in a traditional sense to American golf fans. There's another question, which is an antitrust question, and the PGA Tour enjoys tax exempt status. They'll be looking into that as well beginning tomorrow.",
