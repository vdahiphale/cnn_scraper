That means bringing them down to Mar-a-Lago, letting them fly on the plane with the former president, trying to get them to give the former president their backing. And we're likely going to see that network at play today.Now, we are being told by advisers they're going to hit DeSantis on a number of different policy topics. That is going to include his reforming entitlement programs, his past views on trade policy, on China, his COVID-19 response when he was the governor of Florida. Now, in addition to this social media blitz, we're also told it's going to include a rollout of videos, including one of Trump directly addressing the camera and DeSantis' candidacy. Even with those polls, Poppy, that Kaitlan just mentioned, even though the fact that Trump is leading, there is not a single adviser that I have spoken to who believes this is over or isn't concerned about it.

DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's Donald Trump's old turf, right? I mean, he used Twitter so effectively. Look, I mean, I think Musk tried to position this platform as a bastion of free speech, unless, of course, you're people in Turkey tweeting things that the government doesn't like up to the election or a journalist who is tweeting about Elon Musk's jet, but all that to one side, bastion of free speech. So, I think he's very much DeSantis who we know, loves engaging in the culture wars. He's going to the home of it today. I got to say, though. I cannot see Trump resisting coming back on the platform today. The last time he tweeted was January 28, 2021. I can't see Donald Trump giving up that space.",

So, it's really notable.You had Tucker Carlson saying that he is moving the Fox primetime show to Twitter. Yesterday, I reported that the Daily Wire, which is a huge conservative entertainment media company, is moving its podcast over to Twitter. You're going to start to see a lot more momentum flock there from conservatives, and that used to be Fox's territory. If you're Rupert Murdoch, this is a scary time. BEN SMITH, CO-FOUNDER AND EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SEMAFOR:  Yes, it's absolutely right. Sara and I have exactly the same take, which could mean -- either means we're both diluted. I think it's a moment when all media is splintering and Fox had this monopoly on the conservative space that's going to Twitter. I do think the question in this moment when things are just so polarized is can Twitter can hold out if Twitter becomes the central conservative media space, which is an okay business. It's not a business like being a social platform. can they hold on to anything else? Can they remain as sort of central convening space for journalists, entertainers, athletes?

Donald Trump attacks the media, and as you know better than any other single person on the planet, does it on our platforms in a way that is intended to reach the audience of this media.DeSantis looks at Trump and says he hates the media. He doesn't deal with the media. Nobody deals with the media more than Donald Trump. Donald Trump is centrally a media character whose entire style is to create engagement with us. That's -- and DeSantis is doing this other thing, which is almost like listening too closely to Trump and taking it totally literally and not talking to the media. I think that is sort of a strange move, and particularly if you look at the demographics of the Iowa caucuses where they're going to -- where this is actually going to happen. You have -- I was just looking at the entrance polls in '16. I think there are more people, about the same number of people over 65 as there are under 45. So, I'm not sure it's the sort of -- I'm not sure it's this social Twitter audience. O'SULLIVAN:  But within the Republican conservative right wing online space, this isn't necessarily just mainstream media, quote/unquote, versus Twitter and social media. Internally, within that space, you know, Twitter is now competing with the websites like Rumble. We normally think of like it's Twitter versus Facebook versus YouTube. Now, Twitter and Rumble, which is a new video platform -- COLLINS:  That Donald Trump Jr. is on. O'SULLIVAN:  Exactly, has signed exclusive partnerships with a lot of influential figures on the right. Twitter is now competing for those people as well.",

The typhoon has basically left the entire island in the dark and only about 1,000 out of 52,000 people and customers have power.

James, this video that we're showing right now that you took is remarkable. We can see obviously how strong the winds are. What you are seeing at the moment as the eye of the storm is hitting the island? JAMES REYNOLDS, STORM CHASER (voice over):  Well, it's been a rough day. Just since this morning, you really got a sense that there was a typhoon bearing down on the island. And, literally from this morning, the wind has been picking up solidly all along. Until, you know, about two, three hours ago where it was, you know, just sheets of rain, strong winds flying, throwing things through the air.

Now, this bill said that every classroom in the state of Texas shall have a copy, a poster, a frame of the Ten Commandments displayed and that it had to be legible from every area of the classroom. Now, this is a state of Texas. So, if there was a big, big classroom in the state to follow this law, it would have to be legible from every corner of that classroom. Now, the minimum size, according to this bill, would be 16x20 inch poster or frame of the Ten Commandments. Now if a classroom didn't have a Ten Commandments displayed and someone donated a copy, that classroom, quote, must accept that copy of the Ten Commandments. Further, if a classroom still didn't have a copy of the Ten Commandments, then the school could use public funds to purchase a copy of the Ten Commandments. Now, if your head is spinning because of all of the complexities of this bill, which include questions about constitutionality and religious freedom and the separation of church and state, you're not alone. A lot of groups, Poppy, were very concerned about this bill for all of those reasons, including Christian religious groups that were raising questions about religious freedom and the state imposing religion on to students and teachers, of course, in classrooms, in public schools in the state of Texas.

And that is why these negotiations seem to be stuck in neutral right now because both sides are really dug in. They met yesterday morning for several hours into the early afternoon. The expectation was perhaps the White House negotiators would come back to Capitol Hill. That never actually happened. Is that a sign, potentially that things are breaking down, potentially? It could also be a sign that this is the normal course of a negotiation. Look, the time is starting to really run short.

Here are some more of them.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  I don't believe that the first of the month is a real deadline. I don't understand why we're not making Janet Yellen show her work. REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC):  She'll extend it. But right now, she's using June 1st. Everybody knows that's false. REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX):  The fact is we passed a bill that will raise the debt ceiling. The fact is we're going to have cash in June. The fact is we're not going to default on our debt. That's just completely false. We've got the money to do it. So, everybody just needs to be patient. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It could take days. It could take weeks. And as an investor, I'm wondering, well, should I be buying a bond that's issued during that period? How's the Supreme Court going to rule on that? If they rule against the president, then what's that bond worth? So, it will create chaos.But I'd say this. I think that's a break glass kind of solution. Suppose we go into a breach, meaning the treasury is not paying everybody, chaos ensuing, lawmakers still can't get it together and the economy is evaporating at that point, then it's a Hobson's choice which is the worst bad choice and the 14th Amendment may be the best bad choice to take.",
