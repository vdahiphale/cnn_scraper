His comments come after China abruptly abandoned its zero Covid policy this month following nearly three years of lockdowns, quarantines and mass testing. A sudden change that has resulted in a huge wave of infections leaving hospitals badly strained, pharmacy shelves empty. And starting on January 8th, international travelers flying to China will only need a negative PCR test. They will no longer be required to apply for digital codes used to track people's health or quarantine. A lot of changes. Let's talk about that is happening in China right now with Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group and the author of \"The Power Crisis.\" Ian, thanks. Good morning.",

If you have no idea what's happening in the country, it makes it - you're a lot more compelled to feel like that's a safe investment for you going forward. If you're thinking about -- if you're Japan and you're talking about doubling, you know, your arms spending, the fact that Xi Jinping is a leader that seems so volatile makes you more scared about your own national security.

In other words, we were prepared to decouple from the Chinese government in really serious ways. In ways that would really hurt our economy if they behaved in ways that we didn't like. And, of course, that sends a message to U.S. corporations as well. The decoupling that's actually happening right now is principally in high tech what we call dual use areas that are both economic and directly for military and national security. And principally we're talking semiconductors, for example. Big issue about TikTok. They'd be forced to sell off their U.S. branch.

But to put that in perspective, we're tracking this year to end the year at about $3.99. So that is still about 50 cents savings per gallon. That should mean about $270 for the average American family. That said, this sort of caveat is, there is a high level of volatility and uncertainty. So, that is the hope and we should say that Gas Buddy was pretty much right on the dot this year round. So, you know, here's hoping. And the government forecast is the same, about $3.49 a gallon. Heading into the summer, though, we're probably going to see that move back closer to $4, which we see every season, right, as demand starts to pick up, prices also go up.
