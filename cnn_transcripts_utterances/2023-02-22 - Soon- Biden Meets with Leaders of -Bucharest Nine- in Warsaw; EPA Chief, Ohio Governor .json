Tough rules just announced to keep most migrants from seeking asylum at the border. And winter weather from coast to coast, 65 million people now under alert for ice, wind, snow, with blizzard conditions in some places. Here we go. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Christine Romans. President Biden is just a few hours away from a key meeting with members of NATO's eastern flank in Warsaw. A show of support after Russia's Vladimir Putin suspended a nuclear arms treaty with U.S., and Biden pledged unwavering support for Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly, these countries, many of whom share a border with Russia are watching the invasion of Ukraine very well. They are very anxious about where president Putin may have his sights on next, so President Biden will certainly want to reinforce his support for NATO.But I think you will also want to steal these allies for what has to come in Ukraine. You heard him start to the south last night in his speech about better days ahead, and help these countries brace for what these officials say is going to be a much more uncertain complicated phase of this war as Russia begins its spring offensive, as Ukraine looks to regain territory, President Biden really making clear that the end does not really incite in this war. So, as President Biden returns to Washington later today, after what has been quite a momentous visit to Europe over the last three days, that is the question that is still looming over everything here. How does this war and? What is the end game? President Biden did not really offer any new perspective on that over the course of his visit. So, that is something, a big question, he will likely leave behind when he returns to Washington later today -- Christine.",

The only real sort of comment, we had this one from that deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, and said do not believe everything you read in the media, and accused CNN of having discredited itself in various ways over the past few years.What we know though from two U.S. officials speaking to our colleagues in Washington, is that the U.S. believes that Russia did carry out a test of its Sarmat missile. This is a new strategic weapon that Russia has that is capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads. It carried out a test earlier this week, around the time, or possibly even before president Biden's a visit to Ukraine. That test, they, believe failed, because since then, we heard nothing about it. President Putin did not mention in his speech yesterday, and based on the president if it had succeeded. You can bet he would have made a lot of that. This is in course of terms of timing, a moment where Russia does want to project strength. We have seen the visit by Biden to Ukraine reaffirming that support in the war zone. It was coming up to the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine. We have heard nuclear rattling with the suspension of its participation, in a recent speech yesterday to the new START treaty, the last run minute of the post cold war nuclear arms reduction architecture.

That is still the forecast all the way across into Wisconsin as well. Notice where the ice is just to the south of here, this is the problem. Chicago, Milwaukee, all the way across, three quarters of an inch -- that is going to bring down greater in some spots for sure. To the east of there, 135 record highs for the next couple of days.

How significant was Buster Murdaugh's testimony for this jury to hear?",

The defense really coming forth, poking holes in the prosecution's case with the defense case, was there when asked testimony is going to be something that the jury is going to latch onto.He testifies and paints a different picture of his father Alex Murdaugh, and of course the defense putting on Buster Murdaugh to sort of pick apart, some of the parts and the prosecution was trying to hit home on an evidentiary basis during their case. That includes the cell phone, the statement that I did them so bad, and Buster Murdaugh testifying they did him so bad, along with the evidence about Alec Murdaugh, about the day of the murders, I think this may be a key point in the case where the jury are looking at this case, and, saying can we convict, is there reasonable doubt? And of course, Christine, the defense wants to drum up as many points a reasonable doubt as they can, so that jury does not convict.",

So the prosecution of course called their own force and witnesses to testify about the shooting, and here we have this expert for the defense say, at six foot four, Alex Murdaugh, there is no way he was able to shoot and the forensic data, or analysis, that is not a, and it was a much shorter person who has taken the shot.That is also going to be another point of reasonable doubt. So I think this expert witness, this testimony could be something again that the jury is going to be looking at. Of course when the cases are wrapped up, and there is a jury, you know that Dick Harpootlian, the defense attorney for Alex Murdaugh, is going to argue, you can't convict my client because there's so many points of reasonable doubt.",

So the prosecution put on their case, the introduced evidence before this jury, now it is their job at the end of this trial to connect the dots, and of course, as the defense present their witnesses, cross examine effectively, so that they can go and make that argument, at the end of the day, although this is circumstantial case, there are still be unreasonable doubt that he did those murders.Of course in your circumstantial case, the prosecution does have all the more of a tough job, but it is going to be interesting to see now that the prosecution has rested and the defense expects the case to wrap, up possibly by early next week, or even in the end of this week, how this all plays out before the jury in summations.",
