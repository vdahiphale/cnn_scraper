A special prosecutor to try to create some distance between this prosecution and Biden as well as Merrick Garland. And that was the purpose of that.The reality is, is that, look, the evidence is there, Jack Smith followed the evidence.

Now based on that indictment, we see exactly what the evidence is and that is not all the evidence in this case.

With Donald Trump since he was arraigned, next steps are going to be motions. And they're going to be a series of motions. And these motions are motions to dismiss. And the defense is going to seek to dismiss this case as possible for prosecutorial misconduct, for the role it played, that the attorney-client privilege was actually pierced. Or for the lack of sufficiency during the search warrant that was executed at Mar-a-Lago. So remember, the bulk of the evidence, at least 21 of those documents, came from that search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. And if they can get rid of that search warrant, and the results of the search warrants, then it makes a stronger case for Donald Trump. But this case can be drawn out I think even past the election. It's all going to depend on, number one, what schedule the judge decides to place on the defense. And two, Donald Trump and his team whether they are going to answer ready to proceed. Because also you've got to remember, that they have the New York state criminal case and that New York state criminal case is scheduled for March aside from also the New York civil case with New York Attorney General Letitia James. And also, whatever may come out of Georgia and that investigation. But it's all going to ride on, one, the judge and two, Donald Trump's defense team.
