These videos, the ones you're watching now, showing hundreds of workers clashing with law enforcement officers, many of them in white hazmat suits on the Foxconn campus in Central China.Apple, who has been facing significant supply chain constraints at the assembly facility, they expect the iPhone 14 shipments to be hit just as, of course, key holiday shopping season begins. CNN's Selina Wang is live for us in China. Selina, I know a lot of this has to do with the compensation, what these workers thought they were getting and what they're actually getting.",

So, these workers, they've got to sleep, eat, live on that campus. And they're saying that their living conditions just aren't good enough. They're even claiming that COVID-positive workers are not being moved to a separate facility. People are also fearful about getting COVID. Now, some of these clashes they are turning violent. You can see them jostling, pushing with the law enforcement. Many of them are in the hazmat suits. And Kaitlin, this chaos, it's actually been going on for weeks. A few weeks ago, videos had gone viral of Foxconn workers actually fleeing, escaping the factor, walking miles across highways to try and get away from these COVID restrictions. All of this is a reminder of the risks that Apple faces by relying so much on China for its production. They've been caught in these snap walkdowns before. It's having an impact on its sales, on its output. China used to be a point of pride for Apple, for why it was able to have efficient, low-cost manufacturing. Now, it's a risk factor.",

CNN's Betsy Klein was reporting on this yesterday. But when it comes to this push people want to know how long this protection is going to last for these new boosters. What can you tell them?DR. ASHISH JHA, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR:  Yes, so good morning. And first of all, thanks for having me back. Here's what we know. We know that these new updated vaccines are far superior to the prior vaccine that we had. And it makes a lot of sense, right? Because these new vaccines target the version of Omicron that's out there. So, that's sort of fact number one. Fact number two, that we know, is that if people are up to date on their vaccines, they don't end up in the hospital, they don't end up dying, especially if they get treated if they have a breakthrough infection. So, we're now at a point where we can protect people from serious illness. And, you know, how long are these things going to last? Well, the benefit, certainly for a majority of people, from serious illness should probably last a close to a whole year. For some high-risk people it might last a little bit less time. We may need to do a - something else for the highest risk people, maybe later in the spring or summer.

That's what we're expecting with these vaccines. So we're seeing sort of strong, steady uptake of the vaccine, but we need to wrap that up and get a lot more Americans protected especially as get into the holidays.",

There's just an increase of spreading any sort of disease even if everyone's boosted - which I hope they are - for COVID.RSV and what's happening in kids, the Head of Minnesota Children's Hospital was on the program with us this week. They've like merely hit capcity for ICU beds. There are children in America getting turned away from ICU beds with RSV and really scared parents. What is your best advice to parents right now both on that coupled with increase in flu, couple with COVID? JHA:  Yes. There are three viruses we're dealing with at same time. As you said them all: COVID, flu, and RSV. So first and foremost, the good news is we've got fantastic vaccines against two them: COVID and flu. And my recommendation to American families, I'll tell you what we've done in our family with our children is make sure that they have gotten vaccinated against those two, COVID and flu. On RSV, certainly a problem. We have seen it now. It looks like it has peaked nationally, starting to turn down. In terms of hospital capacity, we have been in touch with every jurisdiction around the country. We have been very clear if you need extra help, the federal government is ready to help, ready to send in support staff, ready to support - send in additional supplies.

The key here is to try to avoid these things.If you're going to get infected, if you - look, these vaccines are terrific. They're not 100 percent at preventing infection, but they are going to prevent you from getting seriously ill.
