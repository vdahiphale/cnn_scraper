Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Russian soldiers revolt, speaking out in new videos tonight. Here are two different soldiers from different battalions speaking out. You'll see not just them, they are surrounded by their peers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  We are not prepared for assaults. Our battalion already has losses. Our command is far away from us. Communication is practically nonexistent. The command never comes to us. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  The local leadership does not care about us. They consider us expendable material. Their motto is, we'll fight until the last soldier. And then they'll send us more. (END VIDEO CLIPS)",

But Sovalnev and several convicts CNN has spoken to said they were hired from jail directly by the Russian ministry of defense. It's a remarkable use of convicts directly by Moscow and Ukrainian intelligence said it has captured them on the front line. ANDRIY YUSOV, REPRESENTATIVE OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE OF UKRAINE (through translator):  Even among Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine, there are now those recruited into the private companies of the defense ministry of the Russian Federation. They emphasized to us that they are not Wagner, but officially invited by the defense ministry. Here, we hear echoes of internal squabbles and Russian military leadership.

Now, meanwhile, state media also reported on Sunday that they've spotted their own UFO above waters near an eastern port city and were preparing to shoot it down. Now they gave no further details about the object, and it's still unclear if it's been taken down. But this incident has gone viral on China's tightly controlled social media. On Monday morning, this was the top trending topic on Weibo, with two related hashtags, racking up more than 900 million views. The top comment on that story is essentially mocking the U.S. for overreacting. It says, quote, thanks to the demonstration made by the U.S., we must report it in a high-profile manner when we shoot down the object. Now, I spoke to a Singapore-based defense expert Drew Thompson who said, look, China's messaging lacks credibility, and it is contradictory, but it's largely really directed to the domestic audience, Erin.",

The death toll now surpassing 36,000 killed, and of course, it will go higher. Humanitarian aid is just starting to make its way into Syria where CNN is one of only a few networks to witness the unimaginable devastation on a country so short on medical supplies, of hospitals ravaged by civil war.

No mom, no dad to hold his tiny hand. His parents didn't survive the earthquake. The 3-month-old was rescued by neighbor who's brought him to this ICU. In the room next door, we find the Talia (ph), the 26-year-old who will never walk again. The earthquake brought down her family's home and crushed her back. Her step mom tells us she and her three children were under the rubble for 18 hours. The children survived but they don't know where they are. In every room of this Syrian hospital, a sweet tale of survival. Many more should've been alive today to tell their stories. Doctors say they tried to save them but didn't have enough supplies to save everyone. The few medical facilities in rebel-held Syria are barely still standing after years of Russian and Syrian regime bombardment, that left them ill-equipped to deal with the disaster at this magnitude.
