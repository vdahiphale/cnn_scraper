Here in Jerusalem, which hasn't had, you know, that many -- as many rocket attacks as other areas or haven't been major impacts here, the hospitals have essentially stopped things like elective surgeries. This is not only to prepare, I think, for injuries to come in, but also to allow staff members to go and to be called up for reserve duty because of the number of reservists who are going to be called up. Now, a ground invasion -- a ground incursion into Gaza will be very difficult to do because this is one of the most densely populated places on the planet. The Hamas network has multiple tunnels that go underneath most of the Gaza Strip. And they often hold their weapons and hold their senior officials in sensitive places like mosques, like schools and like hospitals. And so, when the Israeli military is striking locations there, they're not only going to have to be careful, of course, for civilians, who in Gaza, unfortunately, always get caught up in the crossfire, but they're also going to have to be incredibly aware of their own hostages, because Hamas has already said that they have distributed these hostages across locations, across Gaza. Kaitlan, they're essentially using them as human shields.",

But they are much, much more likely the more violence is unleashed by Israel in pursuit of not only revenge, but of the rescue of, as you rightly point out, not just the 100 or plus hostages that Hamas claims to have, but the 30 plus that the Palestinian Islamic jihad have, both of the movements, of course, backed by Iran. And then the critical issue is what will the Iranians do or rather perhaps, what will Israel do if they see the fingerprints of Tehran all over the planning for this atrocity -- these ongoing atrocities, according to Hamas, that are still being unleashed on the state there.",

But at the same time, the Hezbollah, which has hundreds of thousands of rockets that could be very, very catastrophic for Israel, knows that Israel's response would be absolutely devastating to the whole country.So, Lebanon is in no fit state to weather any kind of storm, let alone a massive storm of ordinance that the Israelis would unleash. And they've made that very, very clear. So, that is the worst-case scenario from both party's perspective. But there's a long way to go before getting to that position because, of course, you've got to get troops in there. I think probably -- and Hadas was suggesting, perhaps that this is part of their planning, potentially a very large number of troops. The more troops you send in, perhaps the less amount of casualties you risk ironically because you actually simply swarm the place and overflood it with Israeli troops But then, of course, you've got to get out, and you cannot kill the idea of resistance against what is Hamas calls the Jewish entity.",

Ambassador, appreciate you being with us tonight. I want to talk big picture in a moment. But just first, for families whose loved ones have been taken hostage, what has Israel learned in the past through hostage situations about what may happen now with these hostages?MICHAEL OREN, FORMER ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: Hi, Anderson. Good morning to you. Well, we've learned that Hamas will hold onto these hostages. Some will be killed. Many will be tortured. But generally, Hamas wants to hold on to these hostages and use them as bargaining chips. Chips to get terrorists out of Israeli jails, also to use them as human shields. And I think they would be very effective as human shields There's tremendous pressure on the government from the public to mount a ground operation against Gaza. Virtually, every round of fighting we have with Hamas and Gaz there is a type of growing pressure by the public that we don't go back to the status quo ante of just, you know, waiting on the border, waiting for more rockets to come over, and then there's a cease fire. No, the Israeli public wants a change now, but it will be a major, I think, impairment, a major hitch on Israeli decision-making. How do you send an army into Gaza when Hamas and Islamic jihad are holding as many as 130 Israeli hostages?",

And if you're firing thousands of rockets at the same time, no antiballistic system can completely defend any skies, certainly not Israel's skies from that type of onslaught.But I think, tactically there's been a great improvement by Hamas, and I think you have to describe that improvement to Iranian backing. We know that, for example, 90, 95 percent of the rockets that are fired from Gaza are actually made in Iran, and the remainder are made by Iranian-trained Palestinian engineers. So, Iran is very deeply involved in Gaza. Islamic jihad is wholly owned and operated by Iran, and Hamas is deeply financed and supported by Iran. So, I think it's very reasonable to assume that Iran was intimately involved with this, perhaps the Al Quds Force, perhaps the Revolutionary Guards have been involved in this.

And when you look at the broad view of this, and other intelligence failures, how bad is this one, and what did Israeli intelligence miss here?JULIETTE KAYYEM, FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HOMELAND SECURITY: Yes. So, I wrote that it was not just an intelligence failure, it was an everything failure. This is a tragedy for Israel. So, my focus on their faults and what they miss is only because they need to learn what happened. Here you have a terrorist organization on your border that Israeli counterterrorism is extensive. They infiltrate Hamas. They pay people to give them information. They have signal intelligence. They have human intelligence. They are watching. It is hard to train -- it's hard for terrorists to train, to get in large groups. So, what's remarkable about what happened is that hundreds of men were able to train. We don't know if they had help from another nation, used parachutes, which you really can't train for in Gaza. You would be seen by Israelis, and infiltrate Israel, and that's part one of the bad story for Israel. Part two is that their response was, at best, flat-footed. There were just too many images on TV. The Israelis are talking about it. People asking for help, begging for help, and it's just taking hours for that to occur. Israel lives by its strength, by its military strength because it knows it has enemies around it.

I have been witnessed to some incredibly moving stories by Israelis, both Jewish Israelis and Palestinian citizens of Israel who lost loved ones. I met them at the hospital in Soroka Medical Center, that's the main hospital in Israel South, next to these events.We met some people who -- first of all, a Palestinian citizen of Israel whose sister was picking vegetables along the border when Hamas gunmen came up and she said, I'm Arab, and she was shot at point-blank range. I ran into an old professor of mine from Brandeis University where I did my undergraduate degree, near Boston, Ilan Troen. He is a professor of Israel studies, and he was standing at foot of his grandson's bed, and his daughter and his son-in-law had been killed this their safe room, in their reinforced room in their home at Kibbutz, in an area right next to the Gaza border. He said that his daughter and son-in-law were shot. They had flung themselves over their son to protect him, and the bullet went through them, and hit his stomach. And I mean, these are -- and then, of course, Ilan Troen, the professor told me that for hours they were on the phone with their grandson as he was hiding where gunmen were coming back into the home. I mean, these are just excruciating, excruciating stories. And we are -- what's astonishing is that Israel usually is providing so much information, numbers of deaths, what's going on. The bulk of the information we have been getting actually is from the Hamas videos that they have been publishing of captives inside Gaza. It's really extraordinary.",
