(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Let's go, Inter Miami.Anyway, the U.S. women's soccer team, the national team, today, they begin their quest to make history and to become the first team ever to win a World Cup three-peat. CNN's Patrick Snell joins us now to preview the game. So, Patrick, there is a lot of pressure on this U.S. team. PATRICK SNELL, CNN \"WORLD SPORT\" ANCHOR: Yes, no pressure, Boris, you said it there. They're trying to become the first team in history, men's or women's, to win a third straight World Cup. Incredible stuff. So much focus, so much pressure -- I think that's the right word here -- on the U.S. women's national team, trying to do, as I say, what no other nation has done before. Incredible if they can do that. It would be an amazing achievement. They're still favorites to win the whole tournament again, in my book. That's where the pressure comes. I will say keep an eye on other nations, like England and the Lionesses, Japan, former champions, as well, France, the list goes on. The Netherlands, too. Now America going for a fifth World Cup overall. They got this massively talented squalid squad. The young stars, like Trinity Rodman and Smith, sure to make a big impact. But you know, we all know, so much of the focus will be on the most high-profile player, namely Meghan Rapinoe. The 38-year-old, the truly iconic figure when it comes to making a huge impact on and off the field over the years. In the build-up to the tournament, she would announce she's retiring from football at the end of this season. Of course, big, big talking point ahead of this game. Will she get her landmark and 200th international cap later on? Let's hear from Meghan herself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEGHAN RAPINOE, U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER PLAYER: That feeling doesn't change. It's so difficult to make it to a World Cup. It's so difficult to make our team, much less make it to the World Cup. So always feels like something that's so hard-earned, which I think makes you appreciate it so much. I mean, I think obviously from a zoomed-out perspective, you know, I'm feeling all the feels and knowing this will be my last World Cup and, you know, my final season, just in general, feeling really grateful to be here.
