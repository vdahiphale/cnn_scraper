Sources tell CNN that Mr. Biden's personal attorney was amongst those interviewed. He made the initial discovery of documents found in Mr. Biden's former office and Delaware home. CNN's Evan Perez has those details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: That's right. This is a long-time attorney for President Biden, political campaign attorney. His name is Pat Moore and he's based out of Boston. And he was among the people who was at the Penn Biden Center, the private office that President Biden was using during the Trump years and this is where the first set of documents were found back in November. And you know, as part of that initial review that was done by the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, John Lausch. The FBI, you know, was doing an assessment. They interviewed Pat Moore as well as a number of other people who were involved in the moving of the documents. And in the case of Pat Moore, he was there when they found these initial documents. Now among the things that we've learned is that, you know, they immediately obviously returned those documents that they found, the classified documents, to the National Archives. And our Jamie Gangel also reports, said, you know, they basically out of an abundance of caution took a bunch of boxes, even if they didn't have classified information, decided to return it, give it to the National Archives, saying, here, take a look at these. And then as a last measure Pat Moore had had some documents including personal speeches and some reference materials taken to his office back in Boston. He had the National Archives come and retrieve those documents. You know, what you're getting a picture of there is, you know, a Biden team that is, you know, I think trying to draw a contrast with the way Trump has handled his own documents issues, right.

So, that came ahead of the speech. We heard there from Antony Blinken, the Secretary of State. He said they're going to make sure Ukraine has what it needs and we could have more announcements in the coming days. So, there is a lot of pressure from Scholz today to make some sort of announcement. Now, it might be a diplomatic speech. It might just be the importance of the Western alliance, the need for unity, the need for coordinated action. But we know from the call last night, from Scholtz's spokesperson that the leaders have agreed there must be effective, sustained and closely coordinated action. In addition to that, I think what we will be looking out for today is comment on Germany's economy, the European economy which has been in the grips of an energy crisis and that is a by-product of this war in Ukraine. I think you'll hear some bullish comments from the Chancellor saying they have met that challenge head on. That they have introduced new gas infrastructure and that they will weather this storm.
