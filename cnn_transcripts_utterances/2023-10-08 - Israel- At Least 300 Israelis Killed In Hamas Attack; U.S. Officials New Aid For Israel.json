Dawn just starting to break behind the skyline there.It is widely expected that a massive Israeli military operation will soon engulf this Palestinian enclave. Israel confirming a significant number of Israelis, including at least one soldier have been captured by Hamas militants. You see one of them here being bundled into a car, a young woman. Their locations and fates are currently unknown. It is a shocking and unprecedented escalation in the region's long history of conflict. Israeli forces have been pounding Hamas targets in Gaza for much of the past 24 hours or so. Earlier on Saturday, the prime minister stating unequivocally that the country was at war. And since dawn on Saturday, thousands of rockets have been fired from Gaza in rapid salvos and in numbers never before seen in such a short period of time. In many cases, too many for the Iron Dome air defense system to intercept. In retaliation, the Israeli leader vowing to turn Gaza into, quote, an island of ruin. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): What happened today has never been seen in Israel. And I will make sure that it does not happen again. The entire government is behind this decision. The IDF will immediately use all its strength to destroy Hamas' capabilities. And we will take mighty vengeance for this black day that they have forced on the state of Israel and its citizens. All of the places which Hamas is deployed, hiding, and operating in, that wicked city, we will turn it into an island of ruins. I am telling Gaza's people to leave those places now because we will take action everywhere. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But on the other hand, the Israelis have to respond to what happened here. So in essence, they're caught between Iraq and a hard place because they really don't have any military means to change the things that brought them to this point. So what we'll see is, unfortunately, a continuation of this conflict but at a much higher level until and unless cooler heads prevail.

And I think what they're looking at is keeping those hostages so that a ground incursion by the Israelis would have only limited success and may be a very difficult thing for the Israelis to achieve. So the Israelis are going to have to be very meticulous if they do plan something like this. And it's going to be very hard for them to find where the hostages are and to extricate them forcibly.

There are more trucks transporting them coming around the corner. The night has been very active. Beyond that checkpoint there, that is the area where the Israeli Defense Forces have been contesting with Hamas militants who are still inside Israel. Where we are, this is the area that Israel controls proper. Beyond that, it is still an active military zone. These tanks are being moved into that zone. We've heard helicopter gunships attacking positions on the ground. We've seen Special Forces moving in and out of the area around here. And we've seen a lot of missiles fired coming out of Gaza by Hamas militants and others potentially fired out of Gaza and intercepted by Iron Dome defensive missile systems. The Iron Dome has been firing up from over here. The intercept is literally happening overhead. And that has happened on multiple occasions. We've been hearing as well Israeli jets flying towards Gaza. And then we've heard explosions, heavy explosions at times, flashes on the horizon through the night.

They've been canceled. We've seen all reservists show up for duty. And in that sense, the domestic unrest is put to the side for now. But this kind of day, what Israel saw, the debacle in many ways, is not going to be forgotten by anyone in Israel and Netanyahu is in charge. And politically speaking, he's in very dire straits if he has a reprieve now to conduct this war which is widely supported in Israel obviously. So, we're seeing a reprieve in the politics. We've seen both Netanyahu and leaders of the opposition talk about possibly an emergency national unity government, but we're also seeing an Israeli public that is extremely angry at its leadership. The main goal for Netanyahu, in recent months, is to -- has been to try and achieve normalization with Saudi Arabia. That's something that here in Washington, the Biden administration has been very active exploring. It's, of course, put on hold right now. I'm not sure it's off the table completely. Many people have said it is. I'm not completely sure. We'll have to see after this war ends whether or not it has changed fundamentals in the Saudi-Israeli relationship. That was never based on the love of the Arab world or the Saudi population for Israel, it was based on the interests of the leadership in Saudi Arabia and the desire in Israel to reach this kind of deal.
