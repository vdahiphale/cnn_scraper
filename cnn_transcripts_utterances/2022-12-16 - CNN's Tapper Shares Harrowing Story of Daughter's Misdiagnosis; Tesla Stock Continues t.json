There's hundreds of pages.Even aside from Jake finally making the call to the administrator, they did all the right things. They were very clear about what they thought was going on with Alice. I think one of the things that jumped out at me is that parents are going to know their kids better than anyone. Kids may describe their symptoms differently to the doctors. Parents know what's going on with their children. What Jake and Jennifer were doing were making it clear to the doctors that this is unusual. Because the kid may be more stoic in the hospital. The Tapper parents, in this case, need to make sure the doctors understand how serious this is. And they did that. There's also this thing called \"diagnostic momentum\" and it something to be aware of. Think of this as the group think that happens in hospitals. Someone puts down the diagnosis, somebody else affirms it, it becomes affirmed, affirmed, affirmed. It becomes a snowball. That's the diagnosis. Interrupting diagnostic momentum is an important thing. Understand that people are going down this hill and you have to interrupt that. Jennifer said something to me as well during the interview, which is that, look, you can be a kind person and a nice person, but it's not the time to be polite in terms of actually talking about what's going on with their child. You have to make it very clear that -- you don't want to outsource the thinking to other people and say, if you just take care of this. You need to be in there and got involved, which, again, the Tappers did. And in this case, as happens at least 5 percent of the time, this diagnosis still occurred.

You guys don't know what's going. I don't know if it's because you don't want to pay for the x-ray or what it is. We'll pay for it out of pocket. Our insurance will pay for it. Get her an x-ray.

First off, there are overall market problems. The market is down altogether. There's more competition in the election care space. Production problems and the zero-COVID policy in China. And we can't ignore this. Musk buying Twitter. Tesla is down 30 percent since then. Let's look at Musk individually. He is obviously the man who runs Tesla. And we can see here, take a look at the worth of the two richest men in the world right now. Bernard Arnault, Louis Vuitton, now at $172 billion. Elon Musk down to $161 billion. Look at where they were 13 months ago. Bernard Arnault basically at the same level, $170 billion. Look at Elon Musk's worth, though. It was at $340 billion. It is now down to $161 billion. Obviously, I'd like $161 billion. But we're talking about a nearly $200-billion loss in his net worth because Tesla has been down considerably.

That moment the connection of humans with food is in the DNA forever. A French philosopher said tell me what you eat, I will tell you who you are. This is very much ingrained in who we are.

We need to start having global food institute that we can start talking about real policy in America and around the world that makes sure that food is not a problem, but we're actually -- food is the solution. We're seeing it right now in Ukraine. We have a lot of countries in Africa that cannot find themselves. That's a conundrum. That's a problem. It's not only the war. It's why those countries cannot feed themselves. You see, food is not given the importance it deserves. We need to start really thinking about food at a higher level. Food is national security.
