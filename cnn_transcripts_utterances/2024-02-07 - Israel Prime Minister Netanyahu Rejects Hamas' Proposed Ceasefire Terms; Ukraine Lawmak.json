Tonight, Israel's PrimeMinister hasn't committed to Hamas' proposed ceasefire terms, saying he wants total victory in Gaza. We hear from the U.S. Secretary of State this hour on the ongoing negotiations. Also ahead, as Ukraine's war grinds on, Kyiv tries to push through new laws to draft more soldiers. Many families just want their loved ones home. And troubling signs for Republican candidate Nikki Haley as she loses to none of the above in a meaningless vote in Nevada. Confused? Well, many American voters are. We're going to explain that coming up. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue operations inside Gaza until they achieve, quote, \"complete victory\". He says it would take a matter of months and then went on to say that Israel must be able to act inside Gaza at anytime in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): We are on the way to complete victory. The victory is achievable. It's not a matter of years or decades, it's a matter of months. The IDF is doing amazing things, methodically, progressing and achieving the aims that we have established. Shattering the -- Hamas, destroying them, getting the hostages, and promise that Gaza will not be a threat on Israel. I have established that this complete victory is our aim. This is the decision I brought to the government at the beginning of the war and we will not do less than that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Mr. Netanyahu's comments come just one day after news that Hamas was presenting a three-phase plan in response to a proposed hostagedeal. It includes the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, as well as freedom of movement for people inside the enclave. And Mr. Netanyahu earlier was quite clear, saying Israel hasn't committed to any of Hamas' quote, \"crazy demands\". The prime minister was speaking following his meetings with the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been carrying out a day of crucial diplomatic talks in Israel and the West Bank. Well, we do expect to hear more from Mr. Blinken later this hour, and we will bring you those remarks live when they happen. International pressure for a truce has intensified amid an Israeli assault on Rafah. More than a million Palestinians are now squeezed into the southernmost town in Gaza, pinned near the Egyptian border with virtually nowhere else to go. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is sounding the alarm, saying if Israeli forces press into Rafah, it will quote, \"exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare with untold regional consequences\". Well, these satellite images of makeshift tent cities give you an idea of how many lives may be at risk. A top Israeli commander says there is no place -- no plan in place yet for how the IDF would minimize civilian deaths. And while there's no ground offensive yet in Rafah, Israel is repeatedly striking buildings from the air after previously encouraging Palestinians to flee to that spot. Well, the situation has gotten so dire that some families are pitching their tents in cemeteries. One father says he fears safer living among the dead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): People were forced to come here to the safe place, the cemetery among the dead, which is better than living in the residential areas where the houses could collapse over our heads. We came to live among the dead because of fear and horror. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, the Secretary of State has been meeting with Israeli officials throughout the day. In fact, wejust heard his motorcade drive right by our position. And what he's been doing is reviewing Hamas' latest counter proposal with Israeli officials to see what the next steps of this negotiation will entail. But as he was doing that, the Israeli Prime Minister coming out very strongly in a news conference with all of the kind of fire and brimstone that he is known for, rejecting Hamas' counter-proposal, making clear that Israel will not commit to what he described as Hamas' crazy demands as it relates to the number and the types of terrorists that should be released. And of course, as it relates to the broader idea of a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, which Hamas is very much still pushing for. Instead, the Israeli Prime Minister pushing for absolute and total victory, vowing that military pressure should continue on Hamas, and that surrendering he said to Hamas' demands would be only asking for another massacre akin to October 7th. Now, that is the Israeli Prime Minister's public posturing, and we have to keep that in mind because this is Bibi Netanyahu after all. When you look at what they're doing behind the scenes, it may be something else altogether. It's clear that the Israeli government is not going to accept Hamas' counter-proposal, but it doesn't mean that they won't continue negotiating. In fact, they very likely will continue to negotiate -- where they end up is another question, but what we do know is that the phase one proposal that Hamas put on the table as opposed to the broad framework phase one proposal that Israel had offered just over a week ago,  they're actually quite similar. So, there are certainly some differences, but there is also real possibility, real opportunity for these two sides to begin to move forward towards at least perhaps an agreement on that first phase. But again, the larger question is, do they need an agreement on all of these phases? Will they accept an agreement on one of these phases in order to move forward with a temporary ceasefire with the release of hostages. Those are the questions to be answered, and those are the questions that the Secretary of State is probing today as well.",

We did hear today from Saudi Arabia about long-term options.They put out a statement saying they won't resume ties or have ties with Israel without the recognition of a Palestinian state. This is the statement, he said \"the kingdom has communicated its firm position to the U.S. administration that there will be no diplomatic relations with Israel unless an independent Palestinian state is recognized as per the 1967 borders with east Jerusalem as its capital.\" So, take us through the various positions because we know for a long time now, the U.S. and U.K. have said that a two-state solution should happen.

      "sentences": "Well, it really seems to be a question of timing, certainly, as it relates to the U.S.' position versus the Saudi position. I mean, SaudiArabia here is making very clear that there needs to be international recognition of a Palestinian state before they will agree to normalize relations with Israel. The United States in contrast has perhaps talked about finding some kind of way to get commitments, to get a kind of a clear timetable, a clear process for the establishment of a Palestinian state. And that perhaps, that would be enough for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel. Now, as it relates to the Israeli position, it is completely far away from both of those. And that's because Bibi Netanyahu; the current Israeli Prime Minister has repeatedly not only taken credit for the fact that a Palestinian state does not exist today, but he has also vowed that Israel must retain security control, that  effectively a sovereign Palestinian state will not be established on his watch. And so, that is certainly a big part of the discussions that the Secretary of State has been having today, not only here in Tel Aviv, but also in Ramallah where he met with the Palestinian Authority President. And the U.S. is also pushing for major reforms to the Palestinian Authority in order to make that body more capable of governing, not -- governing, not only in the West Bank, but also in Gaza and more palatable to Palestinians who viewed that Palestinian Authority as corrupt, as lacking credibility. And of course, reforms that will be necessary for the Israeli government to also accept what they view as necessary reforms to that body going forward. Lynda?",

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is unconvinced, and sources tell CNN he has informed Zaluzhnyi he'll be fired with differences over troop numbers, a key reason why. Mobilization is unpopular and in front of Ukraine's parliament, some are protesting for their spouses to be de-mobilize. Antonina says her husband is too old to be serving this long. \"My husband is 43 years old\", she says. \"It is difficult for him to endure all this time on the ground, jumping from shells and performing all those tasks at the front line. And there are many people like him.\" \"I'm here for my dad to come back.\" Her son says. But on the frontlines, like in this rocket-launching unit, some say they need more people to give those who have been in combat nearly nonstop, a breather. The commander of this launcher is 59. In Ukraine, people can only be drafted until they're 60. \"All of Ukraine is at war, and each and every man who thinks he lives in Ukraine must go through it\", he says, \"it's irreversible. People here are tired\". Ukraine's parliament is working on a law to make mobilization more appealing and possibly allow soldiers to exit the military after three years. But back at the drone unit, they don't believe the talk. \"There should be no illusions\" he says, \"also among soldiers whom politicians have given hope that there will be demobilization. There will not be any.\" Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They knew that there was going to be three Republican defections heading into the vote, but they thought it was going to be enough for them to prevail.

Netanyahu was trying to articulate why Israelcould not agree to this proposal by Hamas, which I think many in Israel agree to. But he's also under a lot of pressure, both from the families of the hostages, and they are many, and from the very substantial support that they have throughout the Israeli population, and also members of the mini war cabinet, the ones running the war, which is Netanyahu, Gallant, and Benny Gantz who joined from the opposition. Israel has been trying to get there. Netanyahu certainly has a strong impetus -- political impetus even to try to reach a deal. But he's also pulled from the right. Pulled against a deal that would seem as too high a price. And this stems from the original two goals that Israel had for this operation, this very bloody operation. The first, as I said, was to remove Hamas from control in the Gaza Strip so that it could not stage another attack like the horrific attack of October 7th. And the second was to bring back the hostages, or as many of them as possible, alive. And the two, of course, have tension. There's a tension between these two goals. Hamas is holding these hostages as human shields. And it's no coincidence that the Hamas leaders are trying to use this as the final bargaining chip to bring about their survival as in power in the Gaza Strip. And Israel is confronted with the same dilemma, essentially the same dilemma it faced on October 8th. The day after the massacre, it's still the same one today, even as it's brought Hamas down in much of the Gaza Strip, along with the devastation that we've seen.",

For them, October 7th was a truly historic moment, and one thatbrought home an imperative that's shared very widely in Israel, which is that that kind of attack can never be allowed to happen under any circumstance. The attack has enormous devastation in the Gaza Strip, as you mentioned. I should say it also has a -- it has a very different phase. The first phase was an aerial one and the second, of course, a ground operation, especially in the Northern Gaza Strip. It's been quite different in the southern Gaza Strip, still extremely damaging and we have already a humanitarian crisis, but a very different mode of operation. Much higher casualties for the Israelis as opposed to the first stage of the war, and also a much more methodical approach to the tunnels in particular. Whereas in the north, it was a lot of an aerial campaign followed by the ground troops entering. Here we have the ground troops going from tunnel to tunnel, trying to root out the Hamas leadership, and at the same time to weigh the fate of the hostages. And this is part of what Secretary Blinken is facing. He's now in the region, of course, as you said, trying to bring about this kind of ceasefire and trying to restart these talks. Even now with the failure of the first effort to achieve a ceasefire now, we hear that the negotiations may continue in Cairo very soon. And that's, of course, what Blinken will likely be addressing very shortly.",
