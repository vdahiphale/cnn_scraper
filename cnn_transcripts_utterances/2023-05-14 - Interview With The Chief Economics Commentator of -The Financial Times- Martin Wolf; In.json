It has 18 times the rate of gun violence as the average rich country. Does that mean it has 18 times the rate of mental disorders?Texas has almost tripled the rate of gun deaths as New York state. Yet Texas doesn't have three times as many mentally ill people as New York. All of these statistics can have the effect of deadening our sensibilities to what is going on in America. But let me try one last set to try to jolt us all into awareness. Every day in America more than 200 people are wounded by guns. 120 are killed by them. Of those 120, 11 are children and teens. The leading cause of mortality for children in America is now death by a gun. The same number of deaths, 120, will happen tomorrow, and the day after that, and then the day after that. Every day until we come to our senses and do something about it. Go to CNN.com/Fareed for a link to my \"Washington Post\" column this week. And let's get started. I want to focus first on the U.S.-Mexico border where an already chaotic situation is at risk of being exacerbated. On Thursday night at 11:59, U.S. officials lost the power to swiftly expel migrants from the border after it was granted in March of 2020. Authorities had used the power almost three million times to return migrants to their home countries or to Mexico. So what happens now? Joining me is former secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson. Pleasure to have you on, sir. JEH JOHNSON, FORMER U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: Thank you.",

Families are making the basic choice to flee a burning building, the most or one of the most violent regions on earth, the poverty, the violence, the corruption is immense.And now, the problem is much bigger because there are a larger number of countries, a longer list of countries contributing to the problem. When I was there, it was Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. Add to the list, Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and some of these countries are countries with whom we have no diplomatic relations. So you can't repatriate people to a country with whom you have no relationship with. Add to that the smugglers, their bigger operations. So the push factors have to be addressed. We started to address that in the Biden years -- I'm sorry, in the Obama administration, the last year. Congress appropriated $750 million. The Biden administration wants to continue that. It's a good idea. I know President Biden believes in it because we used to have these conversations when he was vice president and I was secretary. You have to address the underlying factors.

In Britain, the problem has been in terms of the boat crossings, exacerbated by the fact that from about 2018 onwards Britain introduced very strict security controls at tunnel and ferry crossings, which meant that people started to cross the channel to get to Britain.In fact one of the problems of Britain's system is there are very few safe routes into Britain. And so the number of people crossing this way has increased every year. Last year, it reached a huge record number of 46,000 people.

But it seems very unlikely to work. It's not clear that it would act as a deterrent. And even if it did, it's not clear how long it would take for that deterrent to kick in. So what you will have is Britain detaining large numbers of migrants, possibly large numbers of migrants, and where would it house them? You know, hotels?

It could, I presume, stop paying for things that are legislated like social security or health care or defense. They could do that rather than default. I don't know which they will choose. But I'm assuming from this question that they might actually choose not to service the debt. As soon as that happens U.S. treasuries will have to be downgraded.

Everyone is normalizing relations, everyone, while Israel is using brute force to suppress the Palestinians. And the United States knows this. And the United States -- the Biden administration is unwilling to do anything about it.But my take on Israel and Iran, Israel will never take a major military action against Iran without the consent or a yellow line from the United States. This is historically true. Iran is not Iraq. So, my take on it, at the end of the day, when we talk about Israel and Iran we have to talk about the United States, Israel and Iran. And it seems to me that the Biden administration policy towards Iran is really detached as opposed to military confrontation.",
