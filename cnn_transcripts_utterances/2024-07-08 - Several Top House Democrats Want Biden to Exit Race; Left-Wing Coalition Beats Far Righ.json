Lawmakers will be returning to Capitol Hill in the coming hours after they likely heard from constituents over the holiday weekend about whether the president should stay in the race. There's deep concern over having Joe Biden at the top of the ticket this November and what it could mean for the Democrats' chances of retaking the House.

Also, Senator John Fetterman and Governor Josh Shapiro.Now, the day started in a predominantly black church in northwest Philadelphia, where he really tried to tout the accomplishments of the administration when it comes to African American people in this country.

Four years ago, there was about 40 percent of voters thought that Biden was too old to be president, but that would have been overwhelmingly driven by Republican supporters. Now the polls are showing something like three-quarters of voters think Biden is too old to be president, and that therefore is including a very substantial proportion of Democratic voters.I think these calls from House members, while themselves not decisive, if they are part of a trajectory of more House members, and then we have senators, governors, and crucially, I think, congressional leadership, the speaker, majority leader, that pressure, if that all came to pass, then I think there is a tipping point where Biden has to think about stepping aside. But ultimately, it is mostly his decision. I mean, he has 99 percent of the delegates at the Democratic convention in August, and if he still wants to stay on, it's going to be pretty difficult for him to be removed involuntarily.",

Do you agree with that assessment, for the most part? And what more do you think he needs to be doing right now to turn his fortunes around? JOHNSONThe polls do show that alternative Democratic candidates are not polling dramatically better than him. Kamala Harris, in a CNN poll last week, did seem to look a bit stronger than Biden, but not overwhelmingly so. But at the same time, these candidates, the alternatives, have not had an opportunity to put out their stall in the way that Joe Biden has. I'm increasingly of the view that, especially now that people have come out in the Democratic Party and said that they don't have confidence in him to carry on for the next four and a half years, I don't think you can have a nominee in the Democratic Party that has that kind of doubt lingering over them. This is not just a question about can Joe Biden make it to November. It's also can Joe Biden make it until January of 2029? And if you ask Democrats, honestly, I don't think many really feel that that that is the case.",

But now that there is significant doubt within the Democratic electorate over Biden's fitness to be president, I could certainly see why the Trump campaign would want him to stay on.This is what I call an all hands on deck election. In order to defeat Donald Trump, Joe Biden is going to need the whole anti-Trump coalition to back him, not to splinter, not to vote for third party candidates and also to turn out. And there's a real risk, I think, if this saga continues and Joe Biden remains the nominee, the Democratic enthusiasm for him will be depressed. And if it's depressed in those crucial swing states, which are decided by, in some cases, tens of thousands, in some cases a few thousand votes, then then the election could be lost for the Democrats. And if this is an election where democracy is on the ballot and the stakes are as high as Joe Biden indeed says, then I think that Joe Biden needs to think very carefully about his responsibilities, not just to his party, but also to his country.",

And it's worth noting National Rally will be the largest individual party in the new parliament.  So it will be the official opposition after the first round of voting. The far right's run to power was undone by tactical deal making between centrist and leftist opponents. More than 200 candidates withdrew from the second round to avoid splitting the anti-National Rally vote. Now the National Rally's Marine Le Pen says the party's victory has only been delayed.

Anyway, they're going to come through those blue-gray doors back there. They've got a sign out front that says, this way for the deputies. And then they're going to come through here. They're starting to prepare things to sort of get the security check and to get the I.D. check that goes with getting access to the National Assembly. They've got a little coat rack room back here that they can put their coats in or they can put their luggage. Because some of these people will be coming in from all over the country and some places outside the main country of France in the territories, the overseas territories.

And, of course, as you mentioned, Max, one of the things that we're all going to be watching for is this left-wing group, this alliance, very rough alliance, that took the most seats. 182 of the 577 seats belong to the New Popular Front, as it's called. But it's made up of five individual parties. And one of the most extreme parties is headed by a guy named Jean-Luc Melenchon. He wasted no time yesterday claiming the prime minister-ship. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEAN-LUC MELENCHON, FRANCE UNBOWED LEADER (through translator): Now the will of the people must be strictly respected. From now on, no tricks, backroom deals, nor combinations would be acceptable. The lesson to be taken from the vote is definitive.
