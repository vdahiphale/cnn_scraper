I've been thinking about my faith. I've been thinking about the future of our country. And I've been thinking about the left's plan to ruin America.\" Joining us now is CNN senior political commentator and former special assistant to President George W. Bush, Scott Jennings. Scott, obviously, this is not a huge surprise to people, but this would be the next formal step for Senator Scott to take. Is there room for him in this 2024 race? What does -- what does that look like for him, you think?",

      "sentences": "Well, I certainly think there's room for Tim Scott. He's one of the most well-liked and beloved Republicans in the country. I mean, everywhere he speaks, everywhere he goes, people love what Tim Scott has to stay and what he represents.He'll be probably the most optimistic person in the race. You know, he always presents the Republican Party, the GOP, as the grand opportunity party. He talks about America in optimistic terms, which, of course, as you know, is a big departure from how Donald Trump and others describe America. So he's a -- he's going to have a different kind of marketing style, which is relentlessly optimistic. Now, just to be fair, on the technical side, he starts very low, probably at 1 percent, just like a lot of the other people who are looking to challenge Donald Trump. So he's got a long way to go. But if you look at people who have just raw political and communication skills, he's going to have one of the highest and most developed skill sets in the race. So it does give him a chance to break out, you know, say in a state like Iowa, New Hampshire, where it was kind of retail skills are going to be very useful for him.",

      "sentences": "One of the things I think is so striking -- you just sort of mentioned it -- is that you've called him relentlessly positive and optimistic. Obviously a huge contrast to Trump who will be running against in the primary.But his family story, the line he often repeats, from cotton to Congress in one generation, is positive and optimistic. Is a family story like that what you think Republican primary voters are looking for? JENNINGS: I think they will really like the story. I think they have liked that story about Tim Scott. And I think he's -- he's gone a long way on it. I do think in the current Republican Party emotional frame, you also have to show a little bit of fighting spirit. And so he has to marry that optimism with the ability to say, and I will fight to protect, you know, what I see as, you know, a better future for America. I mean, Republicans are looking for fighters. They're looking for confrontation. They're looking for people who want to fight the left right now. I mean, that's why you see so many of the other campaigns really sort of on the same messages almost every day. So I think as long as he can also show that, this story is going to sell. Look, I think you put this guy in front of a crowd in Iowa or New Hampshire, obviously in South Carolina, where he's been elected, he's going to be electric. I mean, he is a -- he is one of the best, if not the best communicator in the Republican Party today. So putting the optimism together with the fighting spirit could be a combination for him to make some hay.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's pretty simple. You've got Trump, who occupies a fairly large space. And you have everyone else. And the -- in the everyone else bucket, Ron DeSantis right now is, by far and away, the most powerful candidate in that group.And so all that non-Trump group, the people who are looking to consolidate the \"I want someone else\" crowd, they're going to be fighting each other over the next several months to see who can emerge. A prolonged fragmentation helps Trump. In fact, they would almost guarantee his nomination. If someone could break out of the non-Trump group, like DeSantis, like Tim Scott, whoever it happens to be, what they want to try to do is get to a place where it's essentially a one- on-one contest. That gives them the best chance to take out Trump in a non-fragmented field. So this is where Tim Scott is -- starts pretty low, but with a lot of skills. And I think Republicans are going to love him out there. And I'm glad he's in the race, because I think we need more optimists in politics. He is one of the most optimistic people. His life story is terrific, and I think it's inspiring to a lot of folks. Whether he wins or loses, he's an inspiring guy. We need people like Tim Scott in politics.",
