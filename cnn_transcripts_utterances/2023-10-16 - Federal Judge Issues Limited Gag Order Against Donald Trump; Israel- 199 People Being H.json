      "sentences": "Well, Dana, just moments ago, a federal judge ruled that former President Trump will be subject to additional restrictions ahead of his federal trial here in Washington, D.C. related to his alleged role in efforts to subvert the 2020 election and January 6.Now, like many defendants, he already has some restrictions on what he can and cannot say as a criminal defendant. He is already barred from harassing or threatening witnesses and his limitations on the extent to which he can discuss the case with anyone who is not one of his attorneys. But in recent weeks, special counsel prosecutors argued that there should be more restrictions on him in light of public statements that he has made about witnesses, about staff members and here. The judge had a really difficult task, Dana. I was in court, as she listened to arguments from his defense attorneys and from prosecutors about this need to balance, his First Amendment right. The fact that he is a candidate for office, but also the fact that this court needs to be able to conduct this trial without interference. They need to select a jury that is not afraid that it is going to be threatened or intimidated. They also need people to be able to do their job as witnesses. And it was really interesting to watch this back and forth. The hearing lasted for over two hours. Then Judge Tanya Chutkan, she's the judge who will oversee this through what is expected to be a trial, she left the bench for a short time and came back. And she ruled that she was going to add additional restrictions on Trump. He is now barred from targeting members of the special counsel, staff, members of the court, staff, and also any witnesses. Now, the government had asked her to go a little bit further, asked her to restrict any comments he made, would make about Washington, D.C., or the jury pool, and also some of his comments about the Justice Department and the Biden administration. Judge didn't go quite that far, but she has expanded the restrictions, and she said, look, if you -- if he violates this, there will be sanctions, but it's unclear exactly what will happen. Now, we're still waiting for the formal order to lay out all of these details, but she just ruled from the bench. And I would describe this as a partial win for prosecutors who wanted to see these additional restrictions. And Dana, look, Judge Chutkan, she has made clear that she understands that former President Trump has a First Amendment right, but that must yield to the orderly administration of justice in this courthouse.",

I now want to bring in Evan Perez to the conversation for your reporting as well. Before you guys weigh in, I just want to give our viewers a sense of some of the comments that the former president has made that precipitated this partial gag order just yesterday on his social media platform. \"Crooked and deranged Prosecutor, Jack Smith, who has a terrible record of failure, is asking a highly partisan Obama appointed Judge, Tanya Chutkan, who should recuse herself based on the horrible things she has said to silence me.\" He went on to say, \"These political hacks and thugs are destroying our country. Let's see what happens Monday\", meaning what just happened. \"Will America survive or not?\" That's just one example of the kinds of things that the judge is saying. You have a First Amendment right --",

      "sentences": "Right, I mean, and look, the thing that the Trump lawyer, John Lauro, kept going back to in this hearing was that because the former president is running for office, that it would be inappropriate for any kind of curbs to be put on the former president because he should be able to criticize, for instance, Mike Pence, who he's running against for the Republican nomination.He should be able to criticize Bill Barr, who is likely to be one of the witnesses who's going to be testifying in his trial. So the judge really did struggle with this, but the bottom line is that she believes that she needs to give him some kind of rail. And she also pointed out that if he violates the restrictions and she's going to have to elaborate this in an order that we're going to see written down for the former president that he can look at. But she points out that she's not going to wait for anyone to ask for any sanctions. She is going to sanction the former president or anyone else who violates the order. So we'll see how that looks like, but it's going to be a struggle. BASH: OK, so that was going to be my next question. How is this enforceable when you say sanction the former president? What is that look like?",

So, but this will be the first test. He's trying his case or defending his case a couple different places in the court of public opinion and on the campaign trail where he thinks this benefits him.

It was a similar thing where he was lashing out at the judge on social media. Even, you know, retweeting a picture of her with some crosshairs in the tweet. And she came down pretty hard on him and limited his social media activities. But, in the end, you know, he has the right as a defendant to speak. And judges are also concerned that they will create things that will be appealed if he gets convicted. Things that will be, you know, room for a defendant to toss out their convictions.

That's how many people they say are being held hostage by Hamas, about 50 more than they originally believed.

Shira joins me now from Brussels, where she is trying to get information from officials about her missing family members. Thank you so much for joining me. I can't imagine the pain that you are in, the anguish that you and your family are experiencing.

And then suddenly this violence erupted in the Middle East and something significant shifted in this man.He was just in court, and minutes ago, our producer Virginia Langmaid sent some information about what prosecutors said in court. Prosecutors read a few statements from the mother who is recovering from her stab wounds, and she said she could hear her son being stabbed while he was hiding in the bathroom and she was trying to call 911. Prosecutor said in court that according to the victim, the mother in this case, Azubah, listened to conservative talk radio. He has been following the conflict and recently asked the family to move out once this conflict started. Dana, this all happened Saturday morning. Again, the mother calling 911 because this man, as she said, according to care, came to the door, tried to choke her, tried to attack her, and according to care, again said to her, you Muslims must die. When police arrived on scene, they found that woman in a back bedroom, as well as her son, who again, had been stabbed 26 times. Dana, that number bears repeating because it is just so horrific. In a few minutes, we expect to hear from more members of this community who is collectively heartbroken and shocked by this tragedy. And this funeral was set to take place in about an hour. Dana?",
