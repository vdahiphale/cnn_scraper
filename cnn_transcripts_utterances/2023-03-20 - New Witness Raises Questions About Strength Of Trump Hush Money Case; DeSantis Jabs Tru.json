      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next, will a last-minute witness stop a D.A., from charging the former President? A famed defense attorney, on why Robert Costello's testimony, today, could be a game-changer.Plus, China and Russia cozy up, meeting after Putin makes a surprise trip, inside Ukraine. Why some are questioning whether the entire thing was staged. And the surviving son, of double murderer, Alex Murdaugh, speaking out, denying today that he had anything to do with the mysterious death, of a former classmate, as this formerly cold case is busting open tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I am Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, if Donald Trump's very public prediction comes true, this would be the eve of his impending arrest. But CNN is learning tonight from sources that any arrest would not happen, until next week, if Trump should be indicted, this week, over a hush money scheme, involving a porn star, when he first ran for president. Now, this is a live look, outside, the New York City courthouse. We do know there was a last-ditch attempt, today, by Trump's legal team, to keep the former President, from being criminally charged. If that charge happens, of course, it would be an historic first. Now, the last-ditch attempt though has a name, because it's a person, and that person is Robert Costello, an attorney, who's previously represented Trump allies, including Steve Bannon, and Rudy Giuliani. He also happens to be a former legal adviser, to Michael Cohen, who admitted to paying out the $130,000, to Stormy Daniels. Now, Costello and Cohen both appeared, today, at the Manhattan criminal courthouse, where a grand jury is investigating that scheme. Only Costello testified today though. And he appeared at the request, of Trump's team, to counter Cohen's testimony. He was there, for nearly three hours. Now, Cohen was available for rebuttal, but ended up not being needed, according to his lawyer. The big question, of course is did Costello say anything, today that would prevent Trump from being charged in the scheme? He says, he told the grand jury that Cohen once told him specifically that Trump flat- out did not know about the payment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, an indictment could come, and would be filed under seal. But the plan, for law enforcement, for him to be brought, to New York, for him to be brought in, and fingerprinted, and for the first appearance, before a judge, would not come till at least next week. And that's partly because of the careful choreography that is being orchestrated, to try to keep the former President, safe, as he comes to New York. Because, obviously, you can see, just from the preparations there that you just showed pictures of, in New York, there's a lot of concern, about some of the people that are -- that might be brought to New York, who might act upon, his call for protests. And, of course, that might bring people, who are going to be counter- protesting, his appearance, there in New York.

I don't know why the prosecutor doesn't just let it all come out, before the grand jury, and let them decide. A target of investigation, such as Mr. Trump, has the right, to have the grand jury, here, exculpatory evidence, and then let them be an independent body, weight it all, and vote, and apply the law, equally to him, the way they would to anybody else. But let me say, Erin that, if you're going to compare the credibility, of Michael Cohen, and Bob Costello? I mean, that's not even worth a discussion. But Michael Cohen is a defense lawyer's dream as a witness. I mean, a first year law student could destroy him, on cross examination. And there's not a camera he doesn't love.

But then, what is there, to corroborate, what he has to say? Prosecutors often have to include accomplices, to the crime, or some bad actors, especially when they're prosecuting, for example, organized crime. So, you're going to have some prosecutors' witnesses, like that, who have flipped, and are cooperating. They're not the most appealing characters, and have done things, like lie, in the past, and commit past crimes. But you need to then go through and corroborate everything. So, there is corroboration, in the case, in the form of checks that are written by Donald Trump, an audio recording with Donald Trump, and Michael Cohen, and other witnesses that can testify as well. Because, part of this involved the National Enquirer is part of the hush money payments scheme. And they have even a public document with the federal prosecutors that, explains their role, in the scheme, and that it was done to influence the election. So, there's a lot of corroboration.

You said, if he doesn't indict, people will say he wasn't up to the task. What task? What's the task? Is the task to get Donald Trump at all costs? Or is the task to do what's right, or to just to execute the laws? And I think that's where Republicans have legitimate questions, about this prosecutor. Is he thinking about his political constituency, who would say what you just said, \"If you don't get him, you weren't up to the task?\" Or is he actually thinking about the law? As prosecutor, he has downgraded something like 52 percent, of felonies, down to misdemeanors. In this case, he's taken a seven-year old paperwork misdemeanor, and inflating it to a convoluted novel, felony. And I think a lot of Republicans are looking at him, thinking, \"Is he more political than justice-minded, here, because of where he represents, and the voters that he has?\"",
