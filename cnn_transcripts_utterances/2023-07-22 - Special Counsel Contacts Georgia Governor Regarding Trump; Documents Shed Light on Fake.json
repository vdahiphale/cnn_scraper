A spokesperson for Georgia governor, Brian Kemp confirms that Jack Smith's office has contacted Kemp, but declined to release any further details. You'll recall, Trump pushed Kemp to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election results after he narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden. CNN's Marshall Cohen joins us now. Marshall, the target letter has already gone out to the former president. That means an indictment could come at any time. We thought there is a possibility it could happen late this past week, like yesterday, for example. So maybe in the coming days here very shortly. Is it a surprise? Should it be a surprise that the special counsel is still talking to people like the governor of Georgia as part of this case?",

So those conversations between Kemp and Trump, I can imagine that's what the prosecutors are going to be asking once they eventually get him, maybe in front of the grand jury, perhaps an FBI interview, we're not quite sure at this time, but as you mentioned, with that target letter going out to former President Trump, an indictment really could come at any minute.

And I think a lot of the investigation at the federal level should focus not just, and needs to focus not just on the effort to undo the election results, but on the violence that followed and the threats that came towards our election officials, because that was the precursor for the tragedy that unfolded at our Capitol on January 6.",

And, you know, it's important that we see consequences for what happened in Michigan in 2020 at the state and federal level, because right now, as we prepare for another presidential election next year, we need to assure voters and be assured ourselves that this isn't going to happen again.

All of the court cases had by and large, been resolved. There had been -- the election results had been certified. We had begun the process of transmitting the Electoral College votes and we had asked and answered all of the questions. There was zero evidence of any widespread fraud, all of the evidence suggested and indicated the results of the election, were and indeed are an accurate reflection of the will of the people. So there was really no ground to stand on to somehow say that you thought something was going to happen to somehow change the results at a later date. The election was done. The will of the voters was unequivocally clear. And you know, a lot of Republicans, including Republican leadership in the state legislature recognized this and affirmed the results as well. And so when you look at mayors and the former co-chair, the party who chose instead of accepting the results to sign these electors papers, you have to see and I think the evidence shows a willful, intentional effort to lie about the results simply because they didn't agree with them.",

Is there anything really stopping party officials getting together in basements and saying, well, we're going to be the alternate electors in case Our efforts overturn the election work out, they pan out, hey, here we are. We are ready to go. There are signatures on the page.Could this happen all over again if they wanted to? [18:10:09] BENSON: Yes, because the only thing that ensure democracy prevailed in 2020, at this point, were people of integrity on both sides of the aisle, secretaries of state, elected officials of both parties who said, no, that's not who we are, we're going to follow the law. That's what ensure democracy prevailed. And when we look at some of the personnel changes that have happened since 2020, we see not just more people stepping up who are pro- democracy, but you know, for example, someone who was my former opponent in '22, is now the head of the Republican Party in Michigan in 2024, and that person still has not accepted the results of past elections and tried to intervene with them in 2020 and in '22. So we have to be wide-eyed and clear-eyed about the opportunities that may exist for bad actors to try to overturn election results they don't like again in the future, and that is why legal consequences and political consequences, frankly, for the actions that occurred in past cycles are so important to see play out now.",

Who knows when it'll be?

We need to allow facts and evidence and the law to guide those prosecutors at every level forward, even if it takes longer than perhaps your eye or others might like. But at the same time, as that process unfolds, the American people, voters everywhere need to pay attention to it and the evidence that it unfolds alongside it, because they are going to be making decisions in the next few -- the next 18 months about who is going to oversee our country and protect our democracy into the future.

JONG-FAST: Well, at the time, everyone agreed that this was not true that Trump - what Trump was saying wasn't true. Later on, you've seen other Republicans try to cover for Trump. But we know the truth, which is that the 2020 election was free and fair and has been litigated to the hilt and no one has found anything. So ultimately, I'm not surprised and I think you would find - you probably will see more of these kinds of texts. I mean, this was Trump trying to stay in office. Trump's scared. Trump is worried that he might be prosecuted. And now he's trying to get back in office because he's worried about these indictments. Again, yes, I think they - I think most of them knew and we're now seeing that it really is clear they knew. STEWART: And Molly's right at 100 percent that the election was free and fair and Joe Biden won and Donald Trump lost. And what we're going to see more and more as we hear more information, the public and private face of people in this administration and even some in the news media, people with rational brains understand that there was no widespread voter fraud. And publicly, people in his administration were saying something differently. So I think one of the interesting things will be how many people knew darn good and well that the election was free and fair and there was not widespread voter fraud, but went along with it anyway just to stay in Trump's good graces.",

And then we still have Georgia coming down, yes. I mean, these are - this is major, unprecedented, no historical - no, there's no historical precedents for this. It is just completely, totally new and a big historic deal. I do think that ultimately we'll see if he can run out the clock before the 2024 election, which is his strategy.",

We'll break down the latest from the battlefield with Colonel Cedric Leighton. That's coming up next. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:43:54] Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, says the slow start to the country's counteroffensive will soon pick up steam. Deploying new weapons like U.S.-supplied clustered munitions could help support that optimism. Ukrainian forces are looking to push back an increasingly aggressive and entrenched Russian presence along the eastern front. Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton, joins us now. Col. Leighton, great to see you. Your sense of it. Has this been a slow counteroffensive? Can Ukraine pick up the slack? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The answer is yes to both, Jim. And I think the reason for that is the - Zelenskyy was right with the way he talked about this at the Aspen Security Conference, because what he was saying was this took a while to get things there, the weapons systems, the munitions, the resupply of everything, the training, all of that really played a major role in the timing of the counteroffensive. And plus, the other thing is, we all have to be honest, we did a lot of talking about the counteroffensive and there was more talk than action. And I think that they lost the element of surprise in this particular case on the Ukrainian side.",

In other words, make Ukraine a landlocked country.They tried to do that at the very beginning, they failed. They're trying to do it again. They will probably fail again. But it does show that there's a weakness in the Ukrainian air defense systems. They need to ramp up the supply of Patriots, other systems, IRIS-T from the Germans and other air defense systems that would really be a very beneficial thing. One positive note, the Ukrainians are reporting that they're being able to shoot down 100 percent of the Shahed drones. That is a major impact, not in Odesa, but in other areas. And if they can replicate that success in the Odesa area, that will make a big difference for that port city.",

And that kind of thing is really important because I've always had the suspicion that the Chinese are going to do some kind of tacit support to the Russians and I think that's probably what's happening.And because of that, the Russians are gaining a bit of an advantage. They have a supply line to the Chinese. That supply line can't really be cut by Western military actions or even economic actions and that's going to help the Russians for some time.
