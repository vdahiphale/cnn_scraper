And tonight, we take you inside of the hospital to see firsthand where Israel says it found weapons and evidence, it says, that hostages will also being held there.Plus, breaking news, Trump lawyers on tape tonight telling prosecutors in Georgia that Trump said he was, quote, not going to leave the White House, even after he lost. And an OUTFRONT investigation this hour, the Chinese government is now going after people on American soil just for being critical of China. This investigation is coming just before Biden meets with the Chinese President Xi Jinping, you will see it here first. And let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a war to the end. That is the defiant message tonight from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he insists Israel will not let up on his assault on Gaza until Hamas has been eliminated. As the fighting continues, though, the civilian casualties continue to climb. And tonight, Gaza's largest hospital, Al Shifa, is still caught in the middle, the hospital complex is massive, but as you can see spinning, many blocks, more than ten acres, thousands of people are seeking refuge there. You can see the camps and courtyards in parking lots, this is a satellite image so you can see how even the spaces between the buildings are being used as a refuge. U.S. officials telling CNN that Hamas has a command center underneath the roughly 12-acre complex. And that, of course, is what the IDF has been saying. The head of the hospital, though, tonight, denies it. Here's what he told reporter Shlomi Eldar, the Israeli journalist who we've spoken to a number of times on this program. Shlomi asked him whether there are Hamas tunnels underneath the hospital. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) SHLOMI ELDAR, ISRAELI JOURNALIST (through translator): They are saying that the hospital is besieged because of the tunnels under it. DR. MUHAMMAD ABU SALIMA, DIRECTOR OF AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL (through translator): This is untrue and inaccurate. I am the manager of Al- Shifa hospital. I call any institution in the world to come now and investigate this issue. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

But the IDF today did take reporters to see the basement of the Rantisi Children's Hospital, north of Al-Shifa. The IDF showing reporters evidence of Hamas command center there. They say they also found a number of weapons in that basements as well as evidence that that hostages has been held there.You're looking at footage of our Nic Robertson who is able to take going into what the IDF says was where those weapons were being held. It's pretty incredible to see this footage. Again, what goes on with the IDF so we can show you what he's saying now, obviously they're saying that hostages were also kept there at some point, and then they had evidence of that. So, that's what you're looking at right now in these images underneath that Al Rantisi Children's Hospital where Nic was today, along with other members of the press taken in by the IDF. What you see there below ground is obviously description, and deeply disturbing. It's a mosque command center underneath a children's hospital. We don't know what's underground all these hospitals. We do know that what's above ground inside the hospital walls are horrible situations. OUTFRONT obtained this voice memo from Dr. Marwan Abusada, he's the head of surgery at the Shifa Hospital. Here's what he had to say. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) DR. MARWAN ABUSADA, HEAD OF SURGERY AT AL SHIFA HOSPITAL IN GAZA CITY: We don't have electricity. We don't have water. We don't have even the food. And we are afraid that in the middle of the night, we lose the electricity to the main ICU and to the neonatal ICU. So this is the issue now in Gaza, and we have a lot of killed people, and we would like to bury their bodies, but it is sad to say that that is very dangerous. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

I mean, for weeks now, the Israeli military has been laying the groundwork to go after some of these hospitals, claiming that Hamas is operating from within and underground as well as around a number of these hospital complexes. They have shown what they claim to be evidence of rocket launchers and tunnels in the vicinity of several hospitals. They have claimed that one of Hamas's largest command and control centers is underneath Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa hospital.And today, they are now showing what they say is weapons that they found in the basement of Al Rantisi Children's Hospital. They show in a video, and they showed our Nic Robertson as well, weapons including AK-47s, RPGs, what they say are explosive vests improvised explosive devices, et cetera. They also say that they found a room that they believe may -- may possibly have been used to hold some of those Israeli hostages. They found women's clothes. They found ropes and a room with curtains, perhaps designated to -- for videos that Hamas has filmed to some of these hostages. They also say that they found near the hospital, about 200 yards away, near a school, the entrance to a tunnel which they claim was used by Hamas militants. Of course, it's hard for us to independently verify a lot of this, but they did bring in our Nic Robertson into this hospital to show him what they found.",

We have watched as they wrapped premature infants taken out of incubators because a nearby strike took out a generator, wrapped those babies in foil, in blankets to try to keep them warm, putting them next to warm water.This is absolutely a dire situation at these hospitals, and we are watching the same thing play out at several other hospitals, including Al-Quds hospital which says that it is no longer fully operational, effectively. And today, earlier today, my colleague Karen Hatter (ph) spoke with the director general of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza who said that, you know, the doctors at the hospital don't want to evacuate, because what are they going to do with the hundreds of patients, he said some of them are intensive care, some of them are amputees.

He's the senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. And, Seth, I want to ask -- let's get to those strikes against U.S. forces in a moment, but first, this command center first. The U.S. now, the U.S. -- so, this is not the IDF, although the U.S. is getting information, but they're putting their name on it. They're imprimatur. And they're saying that Hamas has a command center under the largest hospital in Gaza, the Al-Shifa Hospital. You heard the hospital's director denied that. What have you learned about Hamas's connection to that hospital? SETH JONES, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL SECURITY PROGRAM: Well, Erin, my conversations with U.S. government folks today indicates that the U.S. does believe that there is a -- at least a Hamas command center and possibly the storage of some material underneath the hospital. It's not necessarily large amounts, but there is -- there is some Hamas infrastructure underneath the hospital. So, that is what the Israelis look like they are targeting.

Then, that brings us to that children's hospital, right, where the IDF says it found weapons in a basement, RPGs is we're looking at footage of right now.

It's almost begging the Israelis to conduct these kinds of attacks in and around civilian centers like hospitals, so they can use that for its propaganda purposes.So, this has been a pretty deliberate significant and consistent practice from groups like Hamas.",

Alex mentioned this a little bit, is the amount of standoff weapons that Hezbollah has, Iranian- linked group have in Syria and in Iraq as well. It's significant, well over 100,000.

Bush ran on crime, Dukakis ran on abortion in those days, not just in Pennsylvania, in Michigan as well. The crime issue trumped the abortion issue, perhaps because remember, George H.W. Bush, he supported abortion rights. He switched and was antiabortion to get onto the ticket with Ronald Reagan. Roe was still on the books, a lot of voters think he didn't mean it. It didn't work for Dukakis back then. Now, I want to fast forward. I just want to fast forward to 2004, another Massachusetts Democrat, John Kerry. At this point, Erin, you're beginning to see the suburbs shift. Look at Pennsylvania. I just showed you, George H.W. Bush winning the suburban collar around Philadelphia.
