It is -- we've been worried about it for a while that the FBI and Department of Homeland security have been issuing reports.Part of this, ironically, is because ISIS strength abroad is more limited. They don't have the kind of power they once did, so they want to show their relevance by inspiring or launching or supporting these kinds of attacks to show that they're still relevant and strong. The second is just the easy use of vehicles. They're everywhere. And this is where, you know, obviously cities become relevant is we live in cities. We go to cities because were out in the street. They're vibrant. We love the activity, the socialness, the culture, the parties, as we saw on New Year's Eve. It is very hard to make a city completely safe from this kind of technique. And so that is what cities are looking at, in particular at high profile events or dense street areas. What can be put up to better protect them, whether its layered security, sanitation trucks, and protections for pedestrians.",
