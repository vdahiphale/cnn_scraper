Dana, that the other side, the Democrats are evil. He doesn't say that metaphorically. He truly believes that you have to defeat the Democrats or the Liberals by any means necessary. And they're close to giving him the speaker's gavel. This is a very worrisome thing for our country. And look, it only takes four or five Republican members of the House of Representatives to be heroes and literally change the future of this country and this world. When you look at Ukraine and you look at Israel, he would be terrible on both. And why somebody, Dana, like Mike Rogers, who was very clearly, I will never vote for Jim Jordan and collapse just 12 hours later in a heap of Jim Jordan support, why he didn't at least get Jim Jordan to agree to bring Ukraine aid to the floor? It's like these guys have all the leverage in the world. And the idea that Fox News' Hannity -- Sean Hannity's booker reached out to them, now they're all scared to death. But I think there are enough to deny Jordan on the first round. My personal hope is they stick it out.",

And they are worried about a primary and losing a primary, never mind the long term general election, particularly swing district Republicans like you were. So what's your message to them?",

Like you get -- you know, everybody goes into Congress saying, I'm going to go in and do the right thing. I am going to stand alone if I need to.And then all of a sudden that fear of a primary is enough to frighten them away. This is as almost big in my mind of a moment, as standing up against January 6 was for these members. Listen, the job of Congress pays $174,000 a year. It's not a terrible salary. You've got to travel all the time. It's actually really hard. The idea that it's the best job in the world and you have to actually sell out what you believe to keep it, it's just fear. It's fear paralyzing members of Congress. And if you're somebody that gets paralyzed by fear, fear of a frigging (ph) primary, then you probably should find a different line of work because we need brave people in the House of Representatives.

Those members were expected to vote against Jim Jordan and have them vote present on the floor, not for a candidate, but vote present.And why will that help? Because that could lower the threshold that Jordan ultimately will need to become speaker. The way that votes go down right now is that they consider a majority -- the victor of this election will be who a majority of those who are voting for a specific candidate. Now, if someone votes present, that lowers the threshold. So, if there's the right balance of members who vote present, perhaps that can help Jordan ultimately become elected here. And this is one reason why this vote has been held open for so long. This simple call of the House being held open. REP. PATRICK MCHENRY (R), SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: On this roll call --",

The world is watching, Mr. Speaker Pro Tem. Our allies in Ukraine, in Israel are watching and waiting. So let's have this vote, but let's be clear, a vote for the gentleman from Ohio is a vote to turn your back on national security. It's a vote to turn your back on a bipartisan path to fund the government and avoid shutdowns. Something we can only do if we reject his nomination. House Democrats are in the minority, we realize that. If House Republicans wanted to elect a speaker without us, then they could have. There is still a path forward for both Democrats and Republicans to come together to elect a speaker who can unite us behind a common purpose. Keeping the government open on a bipartisan compromise that won more than 300 votes just four months ago in this chamber. Taking up an up or down vote on help so Israel can defeat Hamas and Ukraine can defeat Putin. And reassuring the American people that their legislators have their backs. It's that simple, Mr. Speaker, and we can do it today. Let's work together, let's elect a speaker who will reach out a hand of bipartisanship, and deliver for the American people. That is why, once again, Mr. Speaker Pro Tem, I'm proud to nominate Hakeem Jeffries for speaker. And yield back.",

We will dip into the voting pretty quickly with Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, who is a no vote on Jordan, he has said, and represents a district that President Biden won, a swing district in Omaha, Nebraska. And he has said he doesn't want to reward the hardliners who have created this mess to begin with. He has said he's going to vote for former Speaker McCarthy on the first one at a time, but that can be a no vote. That will come fairly early. John King, what are you going to be looking for?",

Two very different men. Bacon has to run in a very competitive district, as you said, carried by Biden. He's a conservative, but he's more of a centrist conservative. Ken Buck came to Congress as a Tea Party guy. And yet, what are they both? They're both principled men. Who know that Joe Biden won the last election and who are governing Conservatives. They're governing Conservatives who want to do stuff. They want to argue, they want to debate, but they want to do stuff. And they're tired of what they consider the clown car show in their caucus. The question is, you know, can Jim Jordan -- his colleagues keep using the term bully. Can he tell people that we need to have a speaker by the end of today, so give it up.
