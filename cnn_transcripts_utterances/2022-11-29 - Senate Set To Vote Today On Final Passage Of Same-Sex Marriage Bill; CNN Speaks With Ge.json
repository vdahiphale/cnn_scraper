More than 300,000 voters turned out to cast their ballots early. It was the most in a single day in the state's history and it comes after more than 180,000 Georgians voted when the polls opened over the weekend. There was that early voting that happened on Saturday.So I took a trip yesterday after the show to Georgia to speak with the Republican governor there, Brian Kemp. He is not on the ballot after he just won reelection a few weeks ago but he is at the center of the race and could be pivotal to Herschel Walker's campaign, who he is now campaigning with. That's a change of pace after Brian Kemp distanced himself from Walker in the midterms ahead of that. It could make all the difference as Walker is appealing to 200,000 voters who voted for Kemp just a few weeks ago but did not vote for Walker. Here's what Brian Kemp told us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
