I also think of your tweet where you wrote, \"if thousands of civilians die in Gaza, terrorist groups will grow stronger and not disappear.\" Thousands of civilians have already been killed in Gaza. Is it too late? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): It's - it's not too late. It is important that Hamas be held accountable. And I think Israel is trying to figure out how to bring to justice the perpetrators, the organizers of this attack, without a ground invasion. The world is safer if Hamas doesn't get away with this. The United States is less likely to be attacked by terrorists in future if the organizers of this plot are brought to justice. But a ground invasion of Gaza has the potential to be unending. What we found in Afghanistan is that for every terrorist that we killed, we created two more because of the number of civilian casualties and the way that that provided bulletin board recruiting material to the Taliban. The same could happen inside Gaza. The second problem Israel has is that there's no great solution for who runs Gaza after Hamas. But until you have settled those two questions, how to conduct a ground invasion without causing Hamas to grow stronger and what do in Gaza after Hamas is displaced from power, then I don't think your war planning is done.

It would give them a chance to essentially move equipment and individuals away from harm, give them a chance to rearm.I do think that what Secretary Blinken suggested yesterday is probably key, which is, you know, temporary pauses in operations and airstrikes in order to allow humanitarian assistance in and perhaps to allow the hostages to get out.
