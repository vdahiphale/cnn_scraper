This time, they were found by FBI agents who were searching President Biden`s home with the president`s permission, the permission of his legal team. And with the supervision of a personal attorney to the president as well as a representative of the White House counsel`s office. Now, all of this was revealed on Saturday night by Bob Bauer, the president`s personal attorney who confirms that the FBI carried out a nearly 13-hour search of the president`s Wilmington residence on Friday from 9:45 in the morning until around 10:30 at night. And those six documents being found of following an exhaustive search of the president`s residence, the entire residence, we`re told, they were given access to. Instead, this was done with the permission and the cooperation of President Biden`s legal team. But nonetheless, this is the fifth time in the last two weeks that we have learned of classified documents being found initially, it was, of course, at the president`s former office in Washington for the Penn Biden Center. And then, of course, there was the discovery of documents at the President`s Wilmington residence, and additional documents have since been discovered at that home or revealed since then. And that drip, drip, drip has certainly been problematic for a White House that has been insisting as the president did just days before this revelation, that there is no there there, insisting that he was surprised by the revelation of these documents and certainly a president who`s trying to get past all this who hopes that the special counsel can do its work quietly, and ultimately exonerate him.
