I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.It may be a tense 24 hours of Nashville coming up where a key vote is likely tomorrow on one of the lawmakers expelled from the Tennessee legislature. The Nashville City Council could vote on whether to send Justin Jones right back to his seat. He was one of the three state lawmakers, all Democrats, targeted by the GOP supermajority for their loud but peaceful protest on the House floor there in Nashville. They were demanding gun reform after the Nashville school shooting that left six people dead, three adults and three 9-year-old children. Two expelled lawmakers Jones and Justin Pearson are black. Gloria Johnson who is white kept her seat by a single vote. Jones and Pearson have called for protesters to return to the capitol tomorrow when the House is back in session. So let's go to Nashville right now, and CNN's Isabel Rosales. Isabel, I guess, first of all, if you can tell us, do we expect those protests to materialize? Might they be as big as we were seeing at the end of last week as they were huge, and the Nashville City Council, does it appear they have the votes to get Jones back in the statehouse?",

We are expecting a day of action is what has been organized on social media with folks organizing right here in front of Metro Council an hour before that city council meeting and then afterwards are going to march over to the statehouse.Now in terms of the votes tomorrow, there's actually three votes that are going to happen tomorrow here at Metro Council. One vote to nominate the ousted lawmaker, former representative Justin Jones. Then there's going to be a vote to suspend a council rule that prohibits both nominating and then appointing someone within the same meeting. That's going to be a critical point right there because if there's any objections, two, it will take two. If they object to suspending that rule, well, this is going to push the appointment of Jones for another four weeks. Now if they successfully suspend the rule then they can go ahead and appoint him. And that will take a supermajority that will take 27 council members out of the 40. I did speak with a council member, Jeff Syracuse, who says that on that note they do think that they have the support there, the numbers, but with the suspension of the rules, he doesn't know one way or the other how tomorrow is going to pan out. We have seen political tensions rising. The chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Party, says that Memphis and Shelby County, there have been threats made to them against reelecting Justin Pearson at the risk of losing state funding to key projects happening within Memphis and Shelby County. We have reached out, CNN has reached out to Shelby County, the Shelby County Commission, for a comment on that. Now this Easter Sunday, we did hear from that ousted lawmaker Justin Pearson as he delivered a powerful sermon at his father's church. Listen.

We still don't know, we don't know the extent of what the DA in New York has on Trump. We will see.

This is an effort to mobilize a voting base, very similar to what we saw in the early 2000s with bans on marriage equality for same sex couples, although it is not working for the GOP in terms of trying to turn out voters by targeting trans people. And then the other reason why we're seeing this is that we are seeing an increase in attacks, particularly on trans people, because of a concern over the freedom and the expansiveness that trans people represent. People are unfamiliar with transness, and there is an unbelievable amount of targeting as a result of that.

Now, these bunnies often have pretty prime spots and cameos over the years at these Easter Egg Rolls. They are often seen with the President and the First Lady on one of the balconies at the White House, staffers will wear those bunny mascot outfits including former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, he was actually a bunny back during the George W. Bush administration when he was a staffer. And I was texting with a former bunny because apparently some of these bunnies have phones, and they told me they were happy to see that they're getting a bit more of a modern refresh for this Easter Egg Roll. Now the White House is expecting to welcome about 30,000 people over the course of the day tomorrow here at the White House, many of them military and veteran families. The theme for this Easter Egg Roll once again is Egg-ucation which just falls in line with First Lady Dr. Jill Biden's passion for teaching. Now, there will be about 30,000 hard-boiled eggs for these families and the kids will partake in that tradition of rolling these hard boiled eggs with wooden spoons across the South Lawn.

The start of the day, by the way, wasn't the start of the fourth round, they all had to come back and finish their third round, because of the just awful, brutal weather conditions that we experienced here on Saturday. But on the very first green, the very first action of the day, Rohm was able to pull two of those strokes back and in the end, he finished four clear at the top of the leaderboard. It's a wonderful story. He's a young man with a real passion for the game, a love of the history of the game. He was inspired by the great Seve Ballesteros and Jose Maria Olazabal. This just so happens to be or what would have been the birthday of Seve Ballesteros, who previously won two Masters titles. So Jon Rahm now joins a very, very special group of Spanish golfers and athletes and I met him a few weeks ago and I was asking him, where did he get this will to win because he has been on a crazy run since October. This is now the sixth title he has won globally. And he said, you know, some people learn to win, some people are born with it, I was born with all of it. This is a guy who just exude so much confidence out on the golf course. He's got such a calm demeanor, and he is going to be a very, very popular champion.
