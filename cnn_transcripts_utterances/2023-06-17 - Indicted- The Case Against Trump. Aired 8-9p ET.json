      "sentences": "Welcome to \"The Whole Story\". I'm Anderson Cooper. The indictment of former President Donald Trump marks the first time in history that a former President has faced federal charges. It is now the second indictment for the former President who was criminally charged by a Manhattan grand jury in March on more than 30 counts of business fraud. Now, he is facing 37 federal charges relating to classified documents from his time in office that were uncovered by federal agents. The special counsel has been investigating this case since November of last year. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him.What makes this situation, though, even more extraordinary is that Mr. Trump is also the current frontrunner in the Republican Party for the 2024 election, which means he could be taking on President Joe Biden, while a special counsel appointed by the Attorney General is working to convict him. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Over the next hour, our Pamela Brown lays out everything we know about this case, and takes us through the twists and turns that brought us to this moment.
