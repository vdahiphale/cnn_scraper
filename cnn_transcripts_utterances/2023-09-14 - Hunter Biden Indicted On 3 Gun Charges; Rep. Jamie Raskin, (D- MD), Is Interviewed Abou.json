As Matt Gaetz said to me, it's like charging Jeffrey Dahmer with littering. That's his argument. They believe that the Justice Department has mishandled this from the start.Of course, when that plea deal first came together, Republicans, including the speaker of the House, were furiously critical of that deal. They believed that they should not have gone forward there. And they said that they wanted to investigate everything that led up to it, including bringing in the special counsel for an interview, bringing in everybody who was part of that investigation, asking for records and testimony. They have not gotten those records and testimony even as the Justice Department has offered special counsel Weiss to come to Capitol Hill because Jordan, Jim Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, wants other people to talk to first. Now, there is an expectation in the House GOP circles that perhaps now that Hunter Biden has been charged, it will be much harder to get Hunter Biden to come to Capitol Hill as part of the impeachment inquiry. Remember, this has been a drumbeat on the right to push for a subpoena for Hunter Biden. They have not issued a subpoena yet. But now that he has been charged, there is a belief that could scramble their calculus in this investigation to try to tie all of Hunter Biden's business dealings to the president of the United States. Proof that they have not been able to corroborate yet, but one that they believe would be central to getting Hunter Biden to testify about. But can they get that now? That is still an open question. And, Jake, Democrats reacting much differently here. They're saying that if Hunter Biden broke the law, then he should be charged. But in the words of people like Congressman Adam Schiff and Jamie Raskin, they're saying that Democrats are different in their view than Republicans. They say if Hunter Biden broke the law, he deserves to be prosecuted, unlike how Republicans deal with Donald Trump, if he broke the law and then said they defend Donald Trump. Jake.",

And the problem I have with my colleagues is they pick and choose when they stand by the rule of law and when they don't. Obviously, you know, Donald Trump has diagnosed it pretty much correctly when he says he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and he would not lose any support among his right wing following. Fortunately, that might relate to the Republican Party today, but that's not how the rule of law works, and that's not how the Justice Department works.And on our side of the aisle, we say if people commit crimes, they're entitled to presumption of innocence and due process. But the grand juries meet and they hand down indictment then you move forward to trial, and again, due process and the presumption of innocence operate, but we want to see that our laws are enforced.

So there are at least 20 who are trying to look for the evidence.But one of the questions I have about the impeachment inquiry is, is there any chance this doesn't end in an impeachment vote?

So I think that the MAGA right, which of course, is driving the train here, will say, we want votes on impeachment, we think we will be able to bring enough coercive pressure on members like Ken Buck, who right now are, of course, saying that there's simply not a shred of evidence linking President Biden to any form of criminal wrongdoing or high crime and misdemeanor. But we've been through that on the floor with them and I think they're willing to drag the whole country through such a process.I mean, we came back to work this week and they've basically had three outrageous demands. One, shut down the government of the United States, two, impeach the President of the United States for no reason at all, and three, they want to overthrow Kevin McCarthy himself.
