      "sentences": "Textbook, Fredricka. As the official NASA broadcast said when this spacecraft splashed down into the Pacific Ocean.You know Fred, this caps off a nearly 26-day mission. And what you're seeing now is the Orion spacecraft bobbing in the Pacific Ocean and pretty soon you're going to start to see a team of essentially navy divers swarming this spacecraft. There's about four navy boats, two inflatable just off to the side of that screen from what you can see there, those of course, the four big parachutes that helped slow this spacecraft down on re-entry. And so these divers are actually going to get up really close to the spacecraft, take a look at it, check for any damage, perform some additional tests, make sure that that all-important heat shield performed as it was supposed to. And then Fredricka, what we're going to see is a big navy ship called the USS Portland, it's the prime recovery ship for this operation, and it's going to get quite close to the spacecraft. They're literally going to hook some cables onto the spacecraft and then pull it onto this navy ship. And from there, they're going to bring it to U.S. Naval Base San Diego and then finally they'll take it back to the Kennedy Space Center down in Florida. So Fred, all things considered, a tremendously successful mission so far from NASA. We saw this spacecraft lift off back on November 16 on top of the SLS space launch system or Artemis rocket from the Kennedy Space Center. It beamed back these incredible images from just 80 miles off the surface of the moon. It traveled further than any spacecraft designed to carry humans has ever flown. And along the way all systems performed just beautifully. And now, Fred, today we got to see the final big test for this spacecraft, the heat shield. Did this heat shield hold? That's what these divers are going to be assessing, you know, just an initial glance of the spacecraft within the next few minutes before being brought back for some more specialized checkouts once it's back on land. But Fred, big picture here, if this goes well, this paves the way for Artemis 2. The first crewed mission of the Artemis program around the moon. And then Artemis 3, hopefully sometime in 2025, when American astronauts will return to the surface of the moon for the first time since the Apollo program.",

And it's -- I mean it's just so crisp. We had a window view where you could just see it doing the roll so it could control its lift vector. It was gorgeous. I was with the last moon walker last night, Harrison Schmitt, Jack Schmitt, who walked on the moon 50 years ago today.

He was so charged two years ago. His name Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al Marimi (ph), I think better known -- shortened somewhat to Abu Agila Masud. He is alleged to have made the bomb more than 34 years ago. The 21st of December when that bomb exploded aboard Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. A 747 aircraft, it scattered debris over a massive area in Scotland that killed 11 people on the ground included that number of children, 70 killed overall. And what the prosecutors will be doing now is to put him in court, the district court of the District of Columbia is where he is expected to begin to face the charges against him. It's not quite clear yet when he will be in that courtroom. The very fact he is now in U.S. custody where he can be brought to justice for his alleged role here is undoubtedly a step forward. I met the other convicted bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi back in 2011. He was on his deathbed. Even at the point he was still proclaiming his innocence, still his family talking about the way that the evidence had been presented, about that he hadn't been involved. So it maybe we get a rerun of some of that from Abu Agila Masud. However he has already told investigators we understand he was involved in making that bomb.",

Watch the storm as it ejects into the central Rockies down to the south from parts of Texas tomorrow up to Kansas, severe weather day.

But really things have been out of hand for quite a while when it comes to this councilmember and others, really dating back to a recording that was released all over the Internet back in October when the councilmember, Kevin de Leon and some of the other councilmembers of Latino origin, were having a conversation about redistricting and making racist negative comments about another councilmember's adopted black son and about the indigenous community.At that time back in October there were calls for all of them to resign. The councilmember at the time did resign but de Leon, here as you can see in the Santa hat, did not resign. He took a moment back out of the public spotlight and said he wanted to give people time to heal from that recording that he was a part of. And now he's back in the public eye and this is one of our first images of seeing him back. Now in an altercation. And this is a councilmember of our country's second largest city, some 4 million people in the city of Los Angeles, that he represents. And this is the representation that we're seeing. Let's take a look at some statements here, first from the councilmember himself, saying that listen, I acted in self-defense. He says \"I was pushing open a door, I was trying to get out. Reedy, the guy in the green jacket, launched a pelvic thrust followed by a head butt to my forehead, saying that all of this that he did, that you see in the video was simply self-defense. Now, An attorney for activist Jason Reedy said, no, that Jason Reedy was not the aggressor. You can see in the statement he says, in fact, it was de Leon and his supporters. They initiated physical contact by shoving him. He had his hands up. He didn't initiate physical contact. That this was just another example of why this council person should resign. This is a conversation that has been had in Los Angeles about certain members of the Latino community who are in positions of power and there've been allegations that they're trying to weaken the power of L.A.'s black community. And so this councilmember, along with the rest of the council, they have a lot of power whether it's redistricting or different legislation that's pushed through or ordinances that are pushed through. And people are saying this is not the person who should be representing us, who responds when things get confrontational or was a part of racist comments and recordings that he shouldn't be in office any longer. We've reached out to the L.A. Police Department, Fred. We'll see how this all ends up playing out, if anyone at all faces any criminal charges.",

A lot of people campaigning against Russian attempts to illegally annex the territory into the main body of the rest of Russia.And now we're seeing these missile strikes. We're not sure what kind of missile strikes they are but combined with the attacks in Donetsk and reportedly also some attacks in Crimea, they rather indicate some level of support for the suggestion coming out of the United States diplomats among others, that the Ukrainians may have developed longer range drones or missiles capable of reaching deeper and more accurately into territory held by Russia. And on top of that Fred, there's also been an expectation that the Ukrainians might soon try to launch an offensive in the south. And in that context these strikes against military targets in Melitopol, notably areas of barracks we understand could be seen as part of a softening up process ahead of that potential opening up of another front there, Fred.",
