Controversy and arrests at pro-Palestinian protests unfolding on college campuses across the United States. And as lawmakers in the U.S. prepare to vote on a bill to ban TikTok, the social media company vows to fight it in court. We begin with damning new allegations of war crimes in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken shared the details of the U.S. State Department's annual human rights report on Monday. It cites extensive and well-publicized cases of killings, abductions and sexual violence by Hamas and other groups during the October 7th attacks on Israel. But it also details systemic torture and inhumane treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel as well as the forced disappearance of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza. Well, Blinken points out the report does not represent the U.S. government's conclusions that relies on a wide variety of sources including government officials, abuse victims, international organizations and the media. And he says the U.S. applies the same standard for all. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, prosecutors accused Trump of scheming to corrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election through a criminal conspiracy and cover-up by falsifying business records about payments to a porn star. But the former U.S. president's defense attorney said the story isn't that simple and began laying the groundwork to discredit key witnesses.CNN's Paula Reid explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What's going on right here should never be happening. It's a very, very sad in America. PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Former President Donald Trump's criminal trial kicked off with jurors hearing competing accounts of why a Hush Money payment was made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels just weeks before the 2016 election. Matthew Colangelo laid out the prosecutor's theory of the case, which he said is about election fraud, pure and simple. He says it all started with a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump, his former attorney Michael Cohen and the former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker. The government alleges Pecker agreed to use the enquirer to help Trump's campaign by buying and suppressing negative stories about him and by amplifying stories that were favorable to him. Prosecutors allege the salacious Access Hollywood tape unearthed just before the 2016 election was significant because it turned the rest of the presidential campaign entirely upside down.",

But these business records really as something of a pretext, a pretext really covering up hush money payments. And I think the prosecution also made this about the larger issue, not the salacious issue about Stormy Daniels, but the issue about election interference, the issue about the nature of why these payments were made, right, and the payments being made to influence the election. And that's important because it's not just about the falsification of business records, it's about why they were falsified. And so, I just think as a general matter, in opening up the case, the prosecution was very clear on the nature of the fraud, the purpose of the fraud, and the illegality of the fraud relating to the president's cover-up in this case.",

He's protecting his family. And as to matters of business records and fraud, my client doesn't know anything about that, right, as we look there at just the entirety of the jury who's there to hear the case.But the reality is that I think that the fence is using what they have, certainly attacking Michael Cohen as a person who can't be trusted, a person who's guilty of perjury, that is lying under oath, Stormy Daniels, the unsavory life that many will think she had. And so they, that is a defense, went after that and went after the issue of reasonable doubt and how so much of it exists, suggesting that Trump is completely innocent.
