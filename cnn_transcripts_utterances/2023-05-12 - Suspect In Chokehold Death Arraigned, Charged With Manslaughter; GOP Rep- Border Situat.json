The prosecutor telling the court witnesses observed Neely making threats and scaring passengers, adding Penny approached Neely from behind and placed him in the chokehold, taking him down to the ground.

Whenever you're looking at a homicide case, meaning someone is dead and they're dead for an unlawful purpose, prosecutors evaluate a number of things around intentions. If you want to charge murder as a prosecutor, you have to establish that, it was the specific intent of the actual person who was accused to kill someone. In the event you charge manslaughter in the second degree, what you have to establish is that you may not have intended to kill the person, but as we look at him, there the suspect, the Marine, the issue is that you did so recklessly.What does recklessly mean under the law? It means you consciously disregarded the risk that your behavior could result in the death. And the argument here and I think the prosecution's evaluations of the facts rely upon the issue of the prolonged holding of the neck. The prosecutors will argue that you cannot tell me that if you hold someone's neck in such a prolonged way, in such a prolonged lock, that that's not reckless, that you should not have known that it could cause the result of death. And so that's why, under these circumstances, I think the prosecutors chose to pursue that charge as opposed to saying he intended to kill him under those facts and under those circumstances.",

That's something that we all should have been able to call for and say, there has to be charges against this person. Because I believe if it was reversed, Jordan would not have been able to get off of Rikers from the bail that was set for him, whereas Mr. Penny has raised over $400,000 and has posted $100,000 in bail.This is about fairness.

And now it's spreading, of course, to Oklahoma, where the governor there is taking aim at PBS.I'll read you a statement that PBS sent us last night when we asked them for comment. The company says the threat to funding puts Oklahoma families at risk of losing access to the local free content they trust to help kids reach their full potential. The fundamental goal of PBS KIDS remains supporting children as they learn and grow through programming they have come to know and love. Now is not the time to take that away from any child. And Jake, I should also say that the local PBS station is stressing that they play a key role in civil politics. They have a news program that reaches all counties in Oklahoma and also the state uses them for emergency alerts. This is in Oklahoma, where it's known as Tornado Alley, and they use the emergency alert system quite a bit. And the PBS station plays a crucial role in that.
