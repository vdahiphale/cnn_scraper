Plus, El Paso, Texas declares a state of emergency over the migrant crisis, much more on that ahead. And intense turbulence in the air putting dozens of passengers in the hospital. This is what we're watching At This Hour.Thanks, everybody. I'm Kate Bolduan. The focus at this hour is on Capitol Hill where the January 6th Committee is about to hold its final public meeting. This marks the culmination of the Committee's nearly 18-month long investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Committee is expected to recommend that the Justice Department charged Donald Trump with at least three crimes, insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding, and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. But there is much more to this. AT THIS HOUR After today's meeting, the Committee will also be releasing a summary of its investigation with its full report to be unveiled on Wednesday. So let's get started with Paula Reid, she's live on Capitol Hill for us at this hour. Paula, what are we expected to see today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, this is a historic day on Capitol Hill. This is going to be a little bit different than those blockbuster hearings we saw over the summer with high profile witnesses. Today, this is a business meeting with two key items on the agenda. The first is to announce these criminal referrals. These are the recommendations that these investigators have made based on what they've uncovered for who they believe should be held criminally responsible for what happened on January 6th.And we know from our reporting that at the top of that list is expected to be former President Trump. He is expected to be recommended and referred for three different crimes, insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the federal government. Now we know they're also considering criminal referrals for at least four other associates. It's unclear if those referrals will be made today or at all, but these are largely symbolic, Kate. The Justice Department is of course already investigating the former president and his associates related to January 6th, that specific investigation has been handed off to Special Counsel Jack Smith. So a referral does not mean that there will be an indictment. The other key item on the agenda today is to vote to approve their final report. That's the big summary of everything they've uncovered. We'll get an abridged version, an executive summary of that after the meeting. But the final report, the full report will be released on Wednesday. And Kate these lawmakers, they are under a tight deadline here. Republicans of course expected to take over the chamber next year. And they're expected to dissolve this Committee when they do so.",

So what will Attorney General Merrick Garland and the DOJ do with the Committee's referrals?Katelyn Polantz is looking into this, digging deeper and deeper into this with her new reporting.

So that would be this disinformation campaign, getting these rioters to want to obstruct Congress.That's a charge that the Justice Department has already used against a lot of people on Capitol Hill on January 6th, conspiracy to defraud that is more of the pressure campaign, or sorry, that's the disinformation campaign. The other obstruction would be the pressure on Mike Pence, the pressure on Congress. So there's a lot that the Justice Department is already looking at and take these or leave them. The Justice Department can do either with congressional referrals. We already know that they are investigating both of these things, if not regarding Donald Trump himself, but top allies around him. Previously, there was a federal judge that was quite clear in saying that he believed this should be investigated could be looked at as possible engagement in a crime or the planning of a crime. And we also know from some court filings that have been out there that this is something both of these potential charges the Justice Department is already looking in circles around Donald Trump.",

That'll be interesting.But thinking about this, from a prosecutor's point of view, that evidence is really valuable, because most of the time prosecutors have way more evidence than Congress would ever have, it's almost unthinkable to be in a scenario as a prosecutor, where you want to know what Congress has. But that's where we are now. And it's really sort of a tribute to the work that Committee has done. We know the committee has gotten to all sorts of witnesses and evidence before prosecutor.

They have brought in Cabinet members from the Trump administration. We know that they've been interviewing them about what they were saying to the President around January 6th, also whether they wanted to talk about the 25th amendment.We don't know the extent of what was shared there. We also know that the Committee was looking into the Secret Service further. We know that they were trying to obtain and did obtain many, many text messages of the protective details around Donald Trump what the discussion was there, especially after that Cassidy Hutchinson testimony. And then, they have worked pursuing phone records of different people. We know that they got some after a case won to the Supreme Court related to the GOP ahead in Arizona. There are other interviews they did with top aides around Trump, Hope Hicks, people that hadn't been into the Committee before. And so we're looking not to see any witnesses testify today. But we're looking to see how the Committee puts it all together. And we shouldn't be sleeping on the details. This committee has been especially good at drawing out in detail.

And they're based on Republicans have said, there's going to be some efforts to muddy the waters.

And we saw voters speak out this last election against election denialism, against some of the things that he's very members of the Republican conference that were listed here have been promoting.So there have been political consequences, maybe not for these particular members.

There's just no way around that.They subpoenaed Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan, and three others all of whom had really important information. McCarthy and Jim Jordan spoke with Donald Trump on January 6th, what happened to other people who defied subpoenas. Steve Bannon is going to go to prison for four months. Not that we should feel bad for Steve Bannon but there's real consequences there. These five, oh, Ethics Committee, I mean, that's a slap on the wrist. So we need to say playing here.

The City Council is holding a hearing right now focused on what to do about this growing crisis. Polo Sandoval is watching it for us. He joins us now. Polo, what's the city going to do? POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENTHowever, the expectation here, especially with the anticipated removal of Title 42 restrictions is that there will be many more of these asylum seekers who will consider New York City as a place where they will go through their asylum proceedings. So the concern right now as we are months into this, and just days before, the expected removal of Title 42 is that that number will greatly increase. So far, city officials have been told to expect at least 1,000 more asylum seekers a week arriving here in New York City, just this morning, as you mentioned, saw about 100 people stepping off of buses. And there's still a couple more buses expected to arrive later today. But one of the biggest questions that city officials are trying to answer is who will pay for this? They spent a billion dollars so far and a latest financial report, Kate, as we wrap things up here shows that for the next three to four years, the city is expected to spend roughly a billion more per year. So it certainly speaks to the great expense of housing, and even educating and feeding so many migrants with many more potentially on their way, later this week. Back to you.",

And this really speaks to the magnitude and what the city is bracing for here in the days ahead. The mayor over the weekend said that they're now expecting when Title 42 is lifted. Here just in the El Paso area alone, some 4 to 6,000 people crossing into the area per day, clearly overwhelming.
