One of the men had been arrested over the summer in a Brooklyn neighborhood where Alinejad she lives. Police found a load assault rifle in the back seat of his car. The suspect allegedly plotted to lure Alinejad out of her home and then kill her. The charges were announced at a press conference on Friday where the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LISA MONACO, DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL: This case began with our investigation of Iran's efforts to project power and to extend its he tentacles of oppression to American shores through the targeting of an Iranian American journalist who has stood up to the brutal regime, shining a light on Iran's abuse of human rights and women's rights. The charges unsealed today show how organized crime, in pursuit of profits, and operating from a rogue nation can pose a grave threat to our national security and to the freedoms we hold dear.

We were even able to whittle down a list of possible candidates who may be going.CNN's Kristin Fisher joins us now.

There's no truly objective, transparent and equitable way to do it when you're dealing with 41 active astronauts who have already become the best of the best. They've already beaten out thousands of other applicants. Most of them they already flown in space. These are people at the prime of their careers, the top of their game. And they're all competing for just six seats on the Artemis II and Artemis III crew. Now, Artemis II, we believe that crew is going to be announcedsometime this spring. And, you know, one of the big decisions for a program this important, a program that, you know, has so many close ties to Washington and abroad is how much is Washington's leadership, NASA's leadership, going to have in this process? And NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told CNN that, quote, we stay out of the selection of the crew. That is done by the people at JSC, the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. They will make the decision. I do not know if they have decided who the crew is, nor should I. So, this decision is going to come down to three key people at the Johnson Space Center. And, Kaitlan, I interviewed more than a dozen current and former NASA astronauts and officials. And based on their list of best guesses and top contenders, here is who we believe is really sitting and has the best stand to chance -- the best chance of getting assigned to that Artemis II crew. Randy Bresnik, Victor Glover, Jeremy Hansen, Christina Koch, Anne McClain, Jessica Mere, Stephanie Wilson and Reid Wiseman. Reid Wiseman, I'll point out to you, Kaitlan, because he was the former chief astronaut, stepped down just a day before that first test flight, Kaitlan. And so a lot of people believe he's at the top of the list to be assigned to that Artemis II crew.",
