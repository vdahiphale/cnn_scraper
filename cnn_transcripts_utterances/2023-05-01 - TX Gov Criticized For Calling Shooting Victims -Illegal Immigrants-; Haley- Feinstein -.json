Tonight, the FBI releasing a new picture, of the suspect, who allegedly gunned down four adults, and a 9-year-old boy, after he was asked to stop shooting, in his yard. And also, a new \"Wanted\" poster. In the last 24 hours, the Feds say they have absolutely zero leads, after that rampage, 40 miles northeast of Houston. The boy's grieving father, speaking out now, about the loss of his son, and also his wife. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WILSON GARCIA, WIFE &amp; SON KILLED IN SHOOTING (through translator): That was my 9-year-old son and my wife too. And two people who died, protecting my 2.5-year-old daughter. My 1.5-month-old son was protected with a lot of clothes, so the killer wouldn't kill him too. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And how was he able to obtain an AR-15-style rifle that the authorities found at his home? So, we turn now to former Attorney General of the United States, Eric Holder. He served in the Obama administration. Former Attorney General Holder, thank you for joining us. This really tragic case is not just about enforcement.

There is still the gun show loophole, I don't know -- he could have gotten it there. There are gaps in our gun control safety statutes and regulations that have to be patched. And again, this is something that we've been talking about, for years that the American people, overwhelmingly, are in favor of. It is time, for our Congress, to do the right thing, protect people, in this country, from the gun violence that has become almost a pandemic, in this nation.

And that should have been the focus. The fact that they were here, perhaps, without authorization, and now we're finding out that in fact, at least some of them probably had the right to be in this country? That was essentially irrelevant. But Greg Abbott, Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, decided that he wanted to make an issue of the fact that at least that he thought that these were illegal immigrants, as if somehow, someway, that made their deaths, less reprehensible, that made their lives, somehow less valuable.

His involvement, in the January 6 obstruction, and insurrection, is obviously something of great concern. That was an insurrection designed to stop the transfer of power. His attempt to influence the count, the vote, in Georgia, asking for 11,780 votes, was clearly something that was inappropriate. All of these things, I think, are serious violations, and especially given the fact that the subject of these investigations, the potential target of these investigations, is a former President of the United States. I think all of these things are extremely serious. I also think that the case, in New York that has already been indicted, is a lot more serious than people have come to understand. I mean, that was a close election that he won, against Hillary Clinton. Had this information come out that he had paid off, a former porn star, to hide the fact of an affair that he had with her might have influenced people, in the three or four or five states that were critical, to his election victory.

It's not based on precedent. It is simply based on personnel, or change in the personnel, on the Supreme Court. And the result of the new decision is to allow, essentially allow, partisan gerrymandering, to take effect, in North Carolina, a place that before a lawsuit that we brought at a -- it's a 50-50 State that had 10 Republican congressmen, four Democratic congressmen. After we won our lawsuit, it had fair districts redrawn. The Congressional balance went to seven to seven. And this notion that somehow some way, the courts are a function of who serves on them, as opposed to the facts, and the law, that they are supposed to consider, is extremely dangerous. It's the same thing we see, in the United States Supreme Court, where a change in personnel was the thing that resulted in the overturning of Roe versus Wade. Again, facts hadn't necessarily changed. Law had not necessarily changed. But people on the court had changed, and a 50-year precedent was overturned. So, what happened in the Federal Supreme Court was wrong.
