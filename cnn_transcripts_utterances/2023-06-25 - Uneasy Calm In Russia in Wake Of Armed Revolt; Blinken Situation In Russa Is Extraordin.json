Wolf will talk in a moment. An uneasy calm however in Russia right now after an extraordinary 36 hours that saw an armed insurrection, led by the head of the mercenary Wagner group, Yevgeny Prigozhin. His whereabouts aren't known right now after the Kremlin said he struck a deal to stand down. The agreement allows Prigozhin to be exiled to nearby Belarus and have all criminal charges in Russia against him dropped. Prigozhin's news service tells CNN that he will answer questions when he has proper communication. And in a dramatic announcement late yesterday, the combative head of the Wagner group said his troops would turn around after coming within just 120 miles from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, HEAD, WAGNER GROUP (through translator): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps according to the plan.

But that's not what the Kremlin wants to hear. Vladimir Putin hasn't appeared in public since making his angry pledge on Saturday, filmed behind the scenes by state television, to punish those responsible for what he called an armed mutiny. The biggest challenge to his authority in 23 years of power. But now that challenge has been made.

How it ended quite quietly and how it ended quickly with this deal. And how it ended without violence.I'm told that there was a U.S. assessment, that there was going to be a lot more resistance by the Russian military, by the Russian security forces, by the FSB and others, to stop Wagner's march towards the capital. There was an expectation that there was going to be a lot more violence, a lot more fighting and a lot more bloodshed. That of course, Wolf did not happen. So it was surprising that there was not more resistance. And this deal that was supposedly brokered by Belarus, was also a surprise for the United States and the Biden administration. As this broke out on Friday, there was surprise across Washington -- in Congress, in the military, in the Biden administration that Prigozhin had the audacity to undertake this and to really challenge Putin's leadership and military leadership. But I am told that U.S. Intelligence was closely tracking this. That there was a sense that Prigozhin was going to try to do something like this. Intelligence analysts had seen a buildup of Wagner men, of equipment, of weaponry to the point where they did think that this was fairly imminent. And so intelligence officials I'm told earlier in the week, middle of last week, briefed the so-called Gang of Eight. The leaders of Congress, the leaders of both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. So there was an expectation that this would happen, Wolf. In the context of everything we've seen from Prigozhin over the course of the past few months in the past few months, his railing against the military leadership, of course, you could expect that something like this might have been tried. But of course, that makes it no less stunning that he actually went through with it, Wolf.",

The president has also been working the phones with allies, including a critical call with the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom. The White House said that they discussed the situation in Russia but also talked about their long-standing support for Ukraine. One of the reasons that the White House has been careful not to weigh in, really in depth relating to this insurrection in Russia, is because they don't want to give any credence or any suggestion that they are trying to interfere in the matter.

Nothing to see here. Moving on. Let's focus on the war in Ukraine. There's an important job to be there. Our enemies are actually in the West. They're the ones that are trying to divide us. So I think that will likely be his -- continue to be his narrative. The caveat to that, of course, is we don't know the contours of the deal that Prigozhin negotiated. And he likely had some leverage. How else was he able to walk away? And that leaves the question about the structure of the defense ministry because that's what Prigozhin was criticizing Putin about, criticizing the military about for prosecution of the war. Will there be changes there? If there are, then that makes it much harder for Putin to keep walking forward, speak about the West, and deny there are issues at home.

But not those who were involved in this march to Moscow. But apparently before that, the deal was that they had immunity. And they are able to drive away -- they are driving away from Moscow now back to their bases. That's not clear. I'm not -- it's not clear what happens to those troops when they get back to the bases. Will they be arrested? Will they be questioned? Or will they try to even follow Prigozhin to Belarus? And will that be possible? And I think for the leadership, for those on the base in Rostov-on- Don, for the military officials there who essentially allowed Prigozhin to walk in, what are the repercussions for them? We don't know about that. And again this comes back to that core issue of what is happening in the defense ministry? Is that going to be restructured? Does it change?

Prigozhin had said no. But it looks like that's the way that the deal shakes out here. And it looks like this legislation that's going through the Duma will rubber stamp that. And let's be clear here. When there's legislation going through the Duma, that's because that's what Putin wants. So it looks like Prigozhin's military fighters are going to have to sign up to Russia's military. So it looks like the defense ministry came out on top. But again that caveat, we don't know what else is involved in the deal or even if that was part of the deal. But I think that's where it's going. It tries to join up and unify and perhaps throttle back the growth of private military contractors within Russia who of course, have become a major and powerful and rich -- if you have an oligarch leader of them -- rich elements of fighting the war in Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "So, there's still a lot that's unclear about what's going to be in a store in the future for the Wagner private military company. One of the things, of course, that we've heard from the Kremlin, is that they say the fighters for Wagner, because of their military achievements on the battlefield, will be able to apply to join the Russian military.That's something that's been in the cards for a while. There was a decrease by the Russian defense minister a couple of weeks ago where he said that all of the private military companies needed to have contracts with the Russian army if they wanted to operate in the future. Now, Yevgeny Prigozhin or the Wagner private military company had always said that they weren't going to do that, and that was, of course, also one of the things that escalated the feud between Prigozhin and the Russian military leadership. But all of this is about a lot more than that. The private military company Wagner is one thing, but Yevgeny Prigozhin owns a lot more than that. He has media holdings like, for instance, the media holdings like for instance, the Internet Research Agency, which the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election. Prigozhin was indicted for that, what happens to his media empire? Then, of course, there's all his dealings in the Middle East. Oil fields in Syria, in Africa, exploiting things like gold and diamonds, also training local forces there. So, there are definitely still a lot of questions about whether or not, Yevgeny Prigozhin, when he goes to exile, in Belarus, will retain any sort of control over that, or if other solutions will be found by the Russian leadership.

But Alexander Lukashenko, dubbed Europe's last dictator, has come to be defined by his fealty to Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, transforming Belarus into a near vassal state. President Putin used Belarus to help launch his 2022 invasion of Ukraine, driving Russian tanks over the Belarus border toward Kyiv, and using Belarusian skies to bomb their neighbors. ALEXANDER LUKASENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We will never be enemies of Russia, and we will never looked disapprovingly of Russia. This is the country closest to us, the people closest to us. I think that we are in power, and we will stick to this tendency. If it were otherwise, it would be like in Ukraine.",

And Putin tightened his hold, pledging to station nuclear weapons in Belarus.It hasn't always been the post-Soviet paradise Lukashenko bragged about. After claiming more than 80 percent of the vote in 2020's election, described by Western governments as fraudulent, Lukashenko faced nationwide protests. \"Get out\", they shouted. He responded with force. The woman who ran against him, whose husband Lukashenko had already jailed, was forced to flee. SVIATLANA TSIKHANOUSKAYA, BELARUSIAN POLITICAL ACTIVIST: Thousands of people are in prison for politically motivated cases. Hundreds of thousands had to flee Belarus because of repression.
