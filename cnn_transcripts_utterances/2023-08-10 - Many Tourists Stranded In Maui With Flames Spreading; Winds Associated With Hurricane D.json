Footage from the tourist hotspots shows a decimated community that looks more like a warzone than a tropical haven. Many people don't have power or cell phone service, and 1000s are in shelters as emergency crews carry out search and rescue operations. The National Weather Service says the heavy winds fanning the flames should weaken later this week. But very little rain is expected.

And they have weaponized that issue against Democrats. On the Democratic side, they are very leery. They seem to be very recalcitrant to move forward on advancing immigration reform or taking a firmer stance. The Biden administration seems reluctant to take a firmer stance with asylum seekers who refuge at the border, because they are aware that Republicans so easily use this against them. And we see that in Biden's low approval ratings on immigration, 31 percent. We see that in the pictures that we see at the border, whether the crossings are up or down, we tend to see pictures of people in crisis, of our border patrol, our law enforcement overwhelmed. And just as a fact check, this summer after the new asylum restrictions went into effect, unauthorized crossings at the border did drop to a two-year level.

It'll target three sectors, semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and certain artificial intelligence systems. This means that U.S. private equity, venture capital, joint ventures and greenfield investments will not be allowed to invest and help China develop technologies that could support its military modernization and undermine U.S. national security. The treasury department released this statement, let me read to you. It said the Biden administration is committed to keeping America safe and defending America's national security through appropriately protecting technologies that are critical to the next generation of military innovation. A U.S. official, Rosemary, said that this was a national security action, not an economic one. But China is not buying it. Beijing strongly believes that the U.S. is trying to contain its rise. The Chinese commerce ministry said it was gravely concerned by the order while the foreign ministry released the following statement, let me read that to you. It is a blatant act of economic coercion, and scientific and technological bullying. The real purpose is to deprive China of its right to development and safeguard its own hegemonic interest. Well this comes as tensions between the U.S. and China are at their most strained in decades. We've seen this parade of top U.S. administration officials visit Beijing.
