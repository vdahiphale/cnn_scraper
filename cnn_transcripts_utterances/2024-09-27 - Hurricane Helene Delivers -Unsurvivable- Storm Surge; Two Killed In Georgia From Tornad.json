Hurricane Helene turning deadly after making landfall overnight, the storm hitting as a category four, the strongest on record to ever strike Florida's Big Bend. An unsurvivable storm surge pounding the Gulf Coast. Just look at those waves crashing over the Howard Franklin Bridge in Tampa, forcing it to close. Storm winds of 150 miles an hour or more. Officials warning that catastrophic wind damage could cause power outages that will likely last days, if not weeks. Take a look at this devastating flooding from Fort Myers Beach, parts of homes and debris floating down streets. The region is still recovering from Hurricane Ian in 2022. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FLORIDA:  The state is ready as soon as this storm passes and it's safe to do so to commence a search and rescue operations. We have 3,500 National Guardsmen standing by. We have our state guard standing by. We have state troopers standing by, and they will be active if need be. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Atlanta is known as the city built basically within a force, very large tree cover here. When we do get rainstorms, they're usually not this consistent and going as long as this one could go. It's been very dry over the last 60 days they days here in the Atlanta area and all the rain that we got from our earlier cold front made people concerned because with the ground saturated now they're worried about big trees falling. You add in this extra rain over the last 24 hours, more than five inches of rain have come into the city of Atlanta. You're worried about flooding and we've heard from some of our local news partners here but they've already had to have rescues this morning at several low lining apartment complexes. There are creeks that they're concerned about overflowing their banks at this point, they've shut down bridges because of that. And then when you put in that massive infrastructure in terms of the roads in this area, they fled sometimes during heavy rains, but you add the constant rain of maybe five to ten inches of rain, plus the heavy one that were expecting the next few hours. That is the major concern right now. I can tell you just my driving in this area. We haven't seen a lot of cars on the road. That's a good thing. The world's largest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, we know they've had more than 100 cancellations of flights so far. But the constant concern right now, the big story line, of course, is the constant rainfall and how it's going to apply to infrastructure. All the way through Georgia, we seen power outages. People are concerned about what will happen over the next few hours -- Kasie.",

The manager says the Four Season. The staffer writes back, well, it's too expensive. The manager says, why does he care? He's not going to pay. His name will not be on anything either.

There is also mounting pressure within the state itself from various political factions. However, we've not seen some of the key leaders, for example, Hakeem Jeffries, Chuck Schumer come out and say it's time for him to go. They call it serious, but also say it's essentially time for the legal process to play itself out.One kind of foil to keep an eye on here is what Governor Kathy Hochul is going to do. Her polling is not great. She's trying to basically, rally her support within the state and she has this interesting power within New York government that she could, it's not really been tested but she could remove him from office. She is definitely leaving that option open based on the statement that she released last night.
