The vote came this morning after 16 hours of heated public comment.This is a project that's faced strong opposition from protesters over environmental and social justice concerns. In January, a 26-year-old activist was shot and killed by Atlanta police during a protest at the site of this planning training facility. State investigators saying the protester fired a gun but his family disputes that. And an autopsy shows he sustained at least 57 gunshot wounds. CNN's Ryan Young is joining us now on this story.

The trees were cleared out several weeks ago. The city says they plan to add about 85 acres of trees to replace those that were cut down. Before this vote, city services at city hall was temporarily stopped because they were worried about safety. They even banned aerosol cans from the building to make sure those safety concerns were taken care of. But hundreds of people showed up for public comment. Public comment didn't stop until around 3:00 a.m. Many of the leaders in Atlanta believe this facility is needed to train fire, EMS and the police. They're trying to consolidate all of these services together. But you talked about the shooting of Manuel. It was actually done by state troopers. They say he shot first and they returned fire. But since then, dozens of protesters have been arrested. This hasn't stopped. Take a listen to both sides. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was all that talk in 2020 about changing how police interact with the community. Atlanta feels this will be that first step. But let's not forget, there's been a lot of focus just on the police portion of this. There's also the EMS and fire training. But I can tell you, in terms of passion involved in this, with people staying until well after 3:00 in the morning, this won't go away for some time. And $31 million of public money.

But this small state agency, known as the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, which many probably didn't know existed 24 hours ago, is sending shock waves through the education community across the country.This is the board that approved the application by the archdiocese of Oklahoma City and Tulsa to open up the St. Isadore of Seville Virtual Catholic Charter School. This happened during a three-hour debate yesterday. The board voted 3- 2 to grant the application for the school to open up in the fall of 2024 with an initial enrollment of about 500 students. This approval has sent shock waves, as I mentioned, through the education community across the country. It does have to support of the Republican governor and the superintendent of the Oklahoma Education Board. The governor called it a win for religious liberty and education extreme. But the Republican attorney general in Oklahoma very critical of this, saying that \"the approval of any publicly funded religious school is contrary to Oklahoma law and not in the best interest of taxpayers.\" The A.G. went on to say he's extremely disappointed that board members violated their oath in approving this application and went on to say it would eventually cost taxpayers a great deal of money as well. Another group called The Americans United for Separation of Church and State described this as a sea change for American democracy and added that public schools must never be allowed to become Sunday Schools. So clearly, this headed for legal challenges, Brianna. And the reality of all of this is that the fate of this school, and whether or not it even opens in the fall of 2024, will end up in the courts. And a judge or perhaps even the Supreme Court, as some people seem to believe, this is a case will reach that level, might decide the fate of the school -- Brianna?",

The challenges are tying symptoms to the effects from these chemicals. So far, official tests have not found concerning levels of chemicals in the soil, air, or in drinking water. Another thing that residents are reporting is high levels of anxiety. One resident told the team, along with our reporter, Brenda Goodman, who was there with them, that this is worse for them than the Covid pandemic.

A source tells CNN the pilot was observed slumped over in his seat. And according to the FAA, the agency lost contact with the airplane 15 minutes after it took off. Investigators think hypoxia could be a possible cause of the crash. Hypoxia, of course, a shortage of oxygen to the blood, that can render a person unconscious and is brought on by a sudden loss of cabin pressure. Also a lawyer for Joran van der Sloot has filed a petition to block his temporary transfer from Peru to the U.S., arguing he was not officially notified. Van der Sloot is the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Natalie Holloway. Authorities in Peru said they would transfer him to the U.S. on Thursday. He is facing charges for allegedly extorting Holloway's family after she went missing in Aruba in 2005. And the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Coin Base, the country's largest crypto exchange. The suit alleges the platform violated security laws as an unregistered broker one day after the SEC sued the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance.

Now it could be in the 2030s. This is new science out of South Korea that basically said the old models were too conservative. And we have some -- looks like it is going down about 12.6 percent per decade. We have some stunning animation from NASA over the decades from the satellites. And you can just see the top of the earth, that snow cone, melting away over time. The biggest effect is the sunlight it reflects. That white surface is so important to deflecting the sun's powerful rays. And open, dark water absorbs it much faster. We know the Arctic is heating up four times faster than the rest of the planet. In 2021, it rained at the highest point in Greenland for the first time ever. Last year, a hurricane managed to push warm air all the way that far up north and create a September melt that has never been seen before. Now the latest now, analysts giving this new modeling, it looks like 10 years sooner than we thought. It will open up shipping lanes. Some will see profits in this.
