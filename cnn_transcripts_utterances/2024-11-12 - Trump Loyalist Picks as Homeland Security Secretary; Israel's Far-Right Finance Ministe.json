The South Dakota governor, a long-time loyalist, will be in charge of a sprawling agency that controls customs and border protection, immigration enforcement and emergency management, as well as the Secret Service.Noem has been on Trump's shortlist for Vice President, but there was backlash to her recent book. In it, she admitted killing her 14-month- old dog for not showing signs of being an ideal hunting dog. A word came a few hours ago that Trump is likely to choose Marco Rubio for Secretary of State. But it's not clear if the Florida senator has been formally offered the position. These are some of the other expected staff selections, which include EPA Administrator and U.N. ambassador, many other cabinet positions like Attorney General and the Secretaries of Energy, Interior, Labor and Treasury have yet to be announced. For a closer look at the likely layout of Trump's inner circle so far, here's CNN's Alayna Treene. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, President-elect Donald Trump on Monday, we're told, offered the role of national security adviser to Florida Republican Mike Waltz. Waltz is a former Green Beret. He had served in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. And his military experience could help him as he navigates some of the wars abroad, including in the Middle East and in Ukraine.Now, Waltz's pick really is keeping in what Donald Trump is valuing most for some of these top positions, and that is loyalty. We saw him name Susie Wiles as his chief of staff. CNN reported that Stephen Miller is going to be named deputy chief of staff for policy. There's been a number of other people, Tom Homan, to serve as his border czar, Elise Stefanik as his U.N. ambassador. All of these people have one thing in common, and that is that they are loyal to him, particularly so they are loyalty stretching back to the time that he had departed the White House in 2021, when many people had tried to distance themselves from Donald Trump following the January 6 attack. All of these people stood by him, and I'm told that is his version of rewarding them. Now, I also want to note that Waltz, like some of these other picks, has been seen at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. He's also been a strong defender of the former president on television, particularly when it relates to some of these military matters. Now, another influential voice that we are continuing to see him move sway with is Elon Musk. He has been at Mar-a-Lago virtually every single day since Donald Trump won the election. And I'm also told that he's been not only calling up Trump allies and lawmakers, but they are calling him as they seek to exert as much influence as they can in this process, really hoping that Musk will help them paint a bigger, a better picture of them to the president- elect.

      "sentences": "Certainly the administration views that one of the big problems of the last time they appointed members was that they were not chosen with any sense what their loyalty was to the president. I mean, people were showing up at Trump Tower with their C.V.'s.It reminded me a little bit of when, before the age of the Civil Service Reform Act, the Pendleton Act of 1881, presidents used to be able to appoint everyone down to the postmaster or postmistress at Presidents like Abraham Lincoln used to throw in the White House for a few hours a day, people would come with their C.V.'s to make their case to the president, and he would decide whether or not they would be the local customs agent or whatever in their community. They had an air of that kind of chaos about it. I think this time, partly because Trump has really transformed the Republican Party much more so now in his image than was the case eight years ago, he is able to have this much stronger sense of who's demonstrated loyalty not just in words but in actions over the past few years. So I do think that of course it's not just loyalty to him, although that's really important. But I think it's also a sense that there's loyalty to his agenda and his mission. And that's become clearer, I think, for himself as well over time. So I think we should be expecting much greater alignment, both in terms of personal loyalty and what we might call programmatic commitment.",

You know, he has transformed the composition of the Republican caucuses in the House and the Senate. In 2017 there were plenty of senators, people like Jeff Flake or JohnMcCain, who were effectively never-Trumpers. The Republican caucus now has basically cleared those people out. And this is also true in the House, that House is much more MAGA now than it was in 2017. And we also have to think, as you mentioned, Max, that the court has shifted really profoundly. When Donald Trump first became president in 2017, you had people like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy, a kind of Republican moderate, a centrist on the court. Both of those individuals have now been replaced by full-throated, more conservative members of the court. And so Trump enters into an ecosystem where Congress is very quiet, the court is much more deferential, I think it will be much more deferential to his executive action than it had been eight years ago. And really, I mean, probably one of the biggest signs of this is when Trump said that he would like the new Senate majority leader, whoever that may be, maybe Rick Scott, to, as soon as the Republican Senate comes into session, to then go into recess. Why? So that Trump can appoint his cabinet without them having to go through confirmation hearings. Now, it's not that the Republican Senate would block those confirmation hearings. No, it's not that the Republican Senate would block those confirmation hearings, but he does want Democrats on the committees to be able to ask them tough questions. I mean, this really, if they did that, that really is an extraordinary sign of Senate deference to the president, which would be hard to find a historical parallel to.",

What he is essentially illustrating or wants to illustrate on those front lines is Ukraine can't win. It's not going to have a battlefield victory.And after pouring billions of dollars into it, you, the West, you have to come up with a different solution. That's President Putin's message in Kursk. It's beyond what's happening on the ground. It is bigger than that. It is pointing out the flaws of President Zelenskyy, the failures of NATO and the lack of success they've seen on the ground more than two years into this war.",

Their numbers over there have been above 1,000 every other day for at least the past couple of weeks. Multan and other city in the province of Punjab went up to 2,000. People are incredulous, they are exhausted, they are concerned. This is an economic, educational and health emergency. Hospitals are being overwhelmed. The UNICEF has come out and said that 11 million children under the age of five are at peril because of this dirty air. Millions of children are now at home because schools have been closed. A lot of them don't have access to online schooling, which is what has been recommended. At the same time, offices are running at 50 percent capacity. There's a lockdown that's being considered. At the same time, critics are saying that the government has just simply not done enough. A lockdown is not enough to deal with this crisis. They're saying that brick kilts, farmers, the toxic emissions that are coming out of different industries need to be tackled. But at the same time, at a more macro level, there hasn't been enough rain. This is autumn. Autumn is supposed to be beautiful in this part of the country. It's still very hot. And the rains that come at this time of the year have simply not arrived. And this is a global problem. It's a climate change issue and something that Pakistan is being affected by. It only puts out less than 1 percent of global emissions. So it is something that will potentially go away with the annual rains if and when they come. And till then, people are just going to look up to the sky and continue to feel suffocated in the province of Punjab and beyond. Max?",

Visitors will also have to buy personalized tickets with their names on them in an effort to stop travel groups from buying up tickets to sell at higher prices. The changes are part of an effort to make important tourist destinations like Pompeii sustainable by focusing on the quality of the experience for the visitor rather than on the quantity of tickets sold. Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D. and is an ongoing archaeological dig with just two-thirds of the site excavated. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Rome. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
