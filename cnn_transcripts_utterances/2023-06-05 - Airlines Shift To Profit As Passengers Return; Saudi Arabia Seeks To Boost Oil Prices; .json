Everybody is watching and waiting but the afternoon has seen somewhat of a sharp fall in the market. We're watching closely over the course of the hour to see how that progresses. The main events of the day that we are following for you tonight. It is a special aviation program. The chief executive of Korean Airways tells me he'll fight to the end get his merger past EU and US regulators. Apple shares hit a record high. You're also going to have how the market has been reacting to its first major product in years. Live from Istanbul on Monday. It's June the 5th. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening tonight from Istanbul where the world's aviation community is gathered. IATA, the International Association of Airlines is having its annual meeting here. It is one of those events where just about every CEO, every airline CEO in the world comes here and attends. There is a celebratory mood in Istanbul, as 2023 is shaping up as a banner year for aviation. So tonight, we have an embarrassment of aviation riches. The chief executives of United, Qantas, Air France-KLM, Qatar, Air New Zealand, Pegasus and the new Riyadh Air will all be joining us along with of course, you'll hear from the IATA director-general, Willie Walsh. Now airlines have turned into a profit. Don't get too excited. It's about $10 billion, which makes just 1.2 percent on the margin. It's better than nothing, and it is a new forecast from IATA, double what they were seeing in December. The reason of course, cheaper fuel and China reopening. There are also strong passenger numbers. IATA is forecasting four billion passengers this year, marginally down four percent from 2019, but that shows you just how the recovery has taken place. There are still headwinds. All the airlines here have reported serious difficulties with things like supply chain. They've employed more staff, so there won't be the fiasco of last year, but there are still pressures in the system, which will make summer 2023 a difficult time. I asked Willie Walsh, the director-general of IATA, why and how can the industry handle the recovery? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILLIE WALSH, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AIRLINES: Well, I certainly told last year with the disruption that we saw in many of the European hubs. I think in in a lot of cases, we should avoid that this year. But some of the problems that we didn't face last year we will face this year, principally Air Traffic Control. So you know, there are concerns about the US and we've already seen capacity reductions, because they know they don't have sufficient resources. We're seeing already in Europe delays, three, four times what we were expecting. So, I think ATC is going to be a big factor this year and the other thing that's playing on the industry, which didn't have as big an impact last year are the problems with suppliers.",

But it's the idea that they can shut Europe down that is causing problems because once France goes on strike, you can't overfly the country, and then it's putting pressure on Air Traffic Control systems around France and that is causing delays and cancellations in other areas, so it is chaos.",

And I think this is another, you know, misunderstanding about our interest rate. I've heard politicians talk about, you know, airlines are making billions of dollars. When you look at it in a margin terms, our margins are tiny, 1.2 percent net margin, and we're celebrating it. Well, we should celebrate it because the losses we had in the past few years were just eye-watering, and the fact that the industry could survive that demonstrates the resilience and the determination and the actions that have been taken.

Now, it's small volumes of 300 million liters in 2022. The industry, the airlines that purchase that fuel spent about $350 million more buying SAF than they would have spent if they were buying conventional fuel.
