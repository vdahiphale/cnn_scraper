And I think what it means is that the U.S. is considering not just one potential response but multiple in a layered approach that could potentially, they hope, degrade these Iran-backed militias for good.Now, what we are told is that the U.S. could engage in strikes against these Iran-backed militias in Iraq or Syria or even both. They could engage in cyberattacks against Iranian and Iran-backed infrastructure to try to degrade those capabilities. They could also impose new sanctions and financial penalties on these groups. And in addition to that, of course, there are the Iranian and Iran- backed naval assets that are operating in the Red Sea that could be fair game for the U.S. to target. There are just a range of options here that the U.S. is capable of doing and is weighing. But the one that is least likely at this point we are told is that the Biden administration is going to actually take that dramatic step of striking inside Iran itself. The U.S. has said repeatedly that they do not want to go to war with Iran. But here's what Secretary of State Antony Blinken said yesterday about the U.S. options. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it could give him an opportunity to speak with reporters to offer some type of insight into his thinking about how and when the U.S. will respond.It all comes as President Biden is really trying to strike this delicate balancing act, trying to come up with a forceful response that would deter future attacks like this while also preventing a broader regional conflict. One thing that the White House has really been trying to stress over the course of the past day is that the U.S. is not seeking direct confrontation with Iran. Those were statements that were made with -- by National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby yesterday, saying that the U.S. simply does not want a war with Iran at this time. So, the president has been working with his advisers, his national security team, trying to come up with how and when the U.S. will respond. Officials have said that they anticipate this will be a more powerful response than some of the other retaliatory strikes that the U.S. has taken against Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria. The - of  course, the previous strikes the U.S. has been taking have not deterred them from taking action against U.S. and coalition forces more than 160 times since the October 7th conflict began. But President Biden is really facing a very tough test in this moment as he's trying to prevent a regional war from spreading even further, especially in the middle of an election year. We've already heard Republican lawmakers up on Capitol Hill saying they want the president to take a more forceful response against Iran, potentially striking within the country itself. And then out on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump has already tried to use this moment to portray Biden as weak and accusing him of dragging the U.S. into a broader Middle East conflict. So, these are all issues President Biden is balancing at this moment. But, of course, trying to keep those families of those three soldiers who lost their lives in the attack front and center in his mind as he is going through these decisions. That is what makes this situation so much different from the other attacks that have faced U.S. and coalition forces is the fact that three U.S. service members have died. We are still waiting to hear whether President Biden plans to speak with any of the families. We know one of those families, the mother of Keri (ph) Sanders, said that they were anticipating a call with the Biden administration in the coming days. We're still waiting to hear whether President Biden himself has placed those phone calls. Today he will be down in the state of Florida for a pair of political fundraisers. Those fundraisers are often venues where the president speaks a bit more freely and candidly about what he is thinking. So, we will see whether he offers any further insight as he is trying to craft this response that officials hope will defer future action -- future attacks like the one that was carried out on Sunday.",

We did that a couple of weeks ago when they attacked (INAUDIBLE), but there are higher levels leadership targets that could be attacked. Again, the risk there is somewhat unique to Iraq as we are trying to hammer out a new, strategic alignment from the coalition with (ph) perhaps a bilateral response. Certainly let's - certainly less risk than if we made an attack on Iran proper, but we've got to think about the relationship with Iraq.But, candidly, at this point, the government of Iraq, if informed, really has no reason to stop this attack if, in fact, that attack, which killed American soldiers, came from Iraq, by Iraqi (INAUDIBLE) mobilization forces and Iranian-backed forces as well.",

Breach of trust is that you've used the government properties, the government resources for your own personal benefits. Americans understand that. And violation of the law is like you robbed a bank.
