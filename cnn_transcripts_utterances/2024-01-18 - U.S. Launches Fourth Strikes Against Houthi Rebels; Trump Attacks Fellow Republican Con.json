Pakistan claims a number of militants were killed, but Iran says the victims were actually women and children. This comes a day after Iran fired on Sunni militants inside Pakistan. Authorities say two children were killed in the quote, \"unprovoked attack.\" Meanwhile, American forces recently carried out their fourth round of strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen in less than a week and the U.S announced its re-designating the Houthis as a global terrorist organization.

Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has released a statement that these were retaliatory attacks just targeting militant outposts within Iran that Pakistan had been sharing information with Iran for many, many months. This is not an attack on the Iranian state, according to the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. But Pakistan's security is sacred to the Pakistanis. They have called Iran a brotherly, friendly nation. However, there is a lot of anger within Pakistan, a lot of disappointment really to a country that is normally a friendly neighbor of Pakistan. Pakistan has a hostile border on its east with India. It's got issues with the Afghan Taliban, also on the western border. China, another neighbor of Pakistan, has stepped up and spoken out last night, calling for both sides to exercise restraint, to respect each other's territory. Pakistan has withdrawn its ambassador from Iran, suspended all high-level talks, asked Iran's ambassador not to return to the country to Pakistan. He was visiting Iran on some visit. So we're just going to have to wait and see whether this was a tit- for-tat situation, whether this now ends the entire scenario, or whether it's something that's going to escalate and bleed further from the Middle East now into South Asia.

Europe is trying to step into the void, but there are real questions over whether it has the industrial capacity, not to mention, of course, the political will to do that. As you see, and as you said, Ukraine is having to ration artillery ammunition on the front lines. This is something that we've been hearing now for several months.And while they are showing significant ingenuity and bravery, that is having an impact secondly of course we continue to see at these overnight aerial attacks not obviously regularly on the scale of what we saw on December 29th and January 2nd with those massive combined drone and missile attacks but they do continue the Ukrainian Air Force say that they managed to shoot down or avert 22 out of 33 attack drones that were launched towards Ukraine last night. There are also two S300 missiles fired towards how key if they say that's a pretty blunt instrument. These are actually designed as air defense missiles. So these aerial attacks continue and they are dwindling the air defense capabilities that Ukraine has. So the situation is urgent. That's why you see those calls in Davos from both Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign ministry from President Zelenskyy himself urging the West that this is not just about the quantity of weapons provided but the timing as well. Timing is of the essence as Ukraine tries to repel these attacks. But as you also noted, Ukraine is making it very clear that they're not taking these attacks lying down. Russia claiming to have averted a drone attack over the Leningrad region where St. Petersburg is, of course, this is the first time we've seen that region targeted. So they are also, it seems, continuing with that strategy of hitting behind enemy lines. Rosemary?",

Endless tragedies on the ground, obscured by the longest communications blackout imposed on the strip thus far. What little video is still able to reach the world paints a troubling picture. At the Al-Nasser hospital in Gaza's south, not only one of the last still functioning here, but also where the World Health Organization says some 7,000 people were sheltering.

We've been trying to share a video of what is happening from the highest point at the hospital. But as you can see, the bombardment is severe.

Tiny bodies wrapped in shrouds, buried in the arms of the wrapped parents. Now amongst the more than 10,000 children said to have been killed in a war they had no part in. Those figures provided by the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza grew more shocking with each passing day. More than 24,000 people killed in just over three months. Israel says that some 9,000 Hamas fighters were among the dead. Though CNN is unable to independently verify this claim.
