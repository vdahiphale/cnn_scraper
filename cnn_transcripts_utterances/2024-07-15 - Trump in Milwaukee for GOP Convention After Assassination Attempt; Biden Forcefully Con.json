      "sentences": "Hello from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I'm Kate Bolduan and the Republican National Convention is kicking off today. And right now, Donald Trump is here in Milwaukee, and this is less than 48 hours after surviving an assassination attempt. We're standing by right now to find out when you may see him today and who you may see him with.He could be announcing and introducing his running mate as soon as this morning. And there's also a lot of developments in the investigation into that tragic shooting Saturday at his rally in Pennsylvania. Trump is talking in detail about what happened, and the impact, and the FBI is still searching for a motive behind this shooting. In a new interview, here is some of Trump's first reaction to what he lived through. I'm not supposed to be here. I'm supposed to be dead. Trump also saying that in light of this, he's making changes to his much anticipated convention speech slated for Thursday, saying this, I had all prepared an extremely tough speech, really good, all about the corrupt, horrible administration, but I threw it away. I want to try to unite our country, but I don't know if that's possible. People are very divided. What a different day today is. And President Biden is also appealing for unity and condemning the attack on his political rival, speaking to the nation with an Oval Office address last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  A former president was shot, an American citizen killed, all simply exercising his freedom to support the candidate of his choosing. We cannot, we must not go down this road in America. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And in the backdrop, this investigation into the shooting is really at full tilt, as is the scrutiny that the Secret Service is facing right now. We have team coverage of it all from here in Milwaukee and far beyond. John Berman and Sarah Sidner are standing by in New York. Let's start with CNN's Steve Contorno for the latest on Donald Trump.

He also said that usually you have to die to have an iconic photo talking about that image of him holding his fist in the air, blood on his face with American flag behind him.In another interview, he previewed his convention speech, saying that he had tossed out what he had planned to say, calling the speech he was going to give, quote, a real humdinger. Had this not happened, this would have been one of the most incredible speeches. Honestly, it's going to be a whole different speech now, and really we expect this entire week to be different, given what's happened in the past 48 hours. And if you think back to recent weeks, four weeks ago when we thought this convention was going to be a rallying cry around Trump's sentencing, which was scheduled to take place four days before today. Then we have this debate and we expected the convention to be changed once again around a victory lap over President Biden's debate performance and Trump's momentum coming off of that. Now, this entire event and the tone of it has changed once again and that's what we'll be watching for over the next few days, Kate.",

The president this morning, along with Vice President Kamala Harris, will receive an updated briefing from law enforcement officials about this shooting. The president has said he is marshalling all of the resources of the federal government to ensure there is a thorough and swift investigation into this shooting as well as calling for an independent review of the security that was in place at that rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Now, President Biden so far has spoken three times since that assassination attempt, and he is really trying to use this moment to this is a very rare Americans to urge Americans to unite and move past the anger and division that has consumed so much of this country. The president last night, speaking in a very rare Oval Office address where he had this message for voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's unclear exactly when that will resume, but the president and Democrats are expected to turn back to political and campaigning activity in the coming days.President Biden, this afternoon, will be sitting down for an interview with NBC News Lester Holt, something that initially was expected to address some of the concerns around Biden's candidacy after the debate performance, but now will take on a different kind of significance. Then later today, he will travel to Nevada, where he will spend the next two days attending various events, including trying to Latino and black voters while he is there. Now, one thing that many will be watching is to see how exactly President Biden will campaign in this moment. Last night, he said this should be a debate about character, record and issues. That is something that he's expected to stress throughout the coming weeks. But clearly the president at this moment is trying to use his position of leadership to show that it's time for the country to unite, lower the temperature in the political discourse all at a time when there's so many people still reeling from that assassination attempt of Donald Trump.",

It is not clear that he had a robust social media presence. It is not clear what he was saying in text messages and phone calls, although the FBI says that they do have some insights, just a few insights through those phone calls and text messages.But this investigation, at least what happened on the ground, is going to rely heavily on what witnesses saw. And what they say is that they saw a man matching that description, carrying a rifle outside of the perimeter. And when that happened, there was an alert that was sent out. This is according to a senior law enforcement official. An alert went out about the shooter acting suspiciously outside of the perimeter. That information was passed along to the Secret Service, according to this official that CNN spoke with. So, witnesses also say that they saw the gunman going rooftop to rooftop. There is a lot of video, Kate, of witnesses clearly seeing the gunman discussing it, shouting it, saying, officer, look, this man's on the roof. Here's what two witnesses say they saw. Here's their interview with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They have to go through a checkpoint like this one where they're thoroughly searched.They actually have canine officers here that will smell a car to make sure there's no explosives. And then something that you see throughout this entire city is these metal gates. And a lot of times, you know, they're reinforced behind there so vehicles can't approach and if you look down this direction, you can see how far this stretches. Now, when you think about what happened this weekend, of course, people are talking about security, but this zone right here is so locked down, this is the highest level of security that you can have for an event. They believe the planning that's been for more than a year is more than sufficient when it comes to a situation like this one. This hotel here, we believe, is for a dignitary. And there are several people who are on the street who believe the former president, Donald Trump, is actually staying in this area. And you can tell just the intense amount of security that they put up around this area. But listen to Secret Service and the FBI talk about the plans in place for this event.

So, what they think they're looking at in the shooter's car, parked near the event, is a remote controlled device. At the house, they find a similar box in his bedroom, which they consider, since they've seen what's in the car, another potential device.But you have to ask if it's got a receiver on it, and he had some kind of transmitter on him, I am told by sources, what was the purpose of having something that could cause an explosion in the car? And let's take a look at it. One version is, if he wanted to distract all the security personnel from his presence while he was trying to sneak up on a rooftop, he could have cranked off that device, caused everybody to focus on that car. Another possibility, which is really interesting is, he was seen at the magnetometers earlier. They had flagged him as acting squirrelly around the magnetometers. And they had put that over the air of keep an eye on this guy. Was he looking to place a distraction device that would have drawn security to the noise of multiple explosions coming from some direction that would have taken their focus off of him? All of these are not answers. All of these are questions that are on the table about what was the purpose of that device. Did it have anything to do with this plot? BERMAN:  Then the question is, he's up here, the snipers are right here, Donald Trump is right here. What were the rules of engagement for the Secret Service and the local law enforcement snipers? And just so people have a sense of the timeline here, the shooter was spotted by a local police officer near magnetometers. You discussed that. They saw him on the roof. Supporters and police spot him on the roof, then the shooter points the gun at a local law enforcement officer, you know, hits Trump, and the shooter is killed by a sniper there. I'm going to put this map up again here. So, again, what could they have done? Could they have acted more quickly?",

You've got the outer perimeter, which is a mix of Secret Service and local law enforcement. And then you have the third perimeter, which is mostly local law enforcement. So, when they say we've got a guy on the roof with a rifle, people are alerting them.Now, your clock starts at around a minute. An officer starts to go up that ladder to get on that roof and is confronted at gunpoint by the shooter, according to the accounts we got from the sheriff yesterday. And at that point, they're putting that over the air. That word gets that there's something going on over here with an individual on the rooftop to the sniper team. But a rooftop is like this. There's an upside and a downside. He starts on the downside of that roof. They don't see him until he pops up and that first shot is fired. Now, we've listened to the audio. There's about a second and a half between the first shots and the multiple shots that they fire taking him out. This isn't the only countersniper team. There's four set up on the ground. So, the rules of engagement would normally be, we have an individual on a rooftop. He has what looks like a rifle. They would call the detail leader and say, do we have a green light? The detail leader would make a judgment. This happened way too fast for any of that, and their reaction time was split second.",
