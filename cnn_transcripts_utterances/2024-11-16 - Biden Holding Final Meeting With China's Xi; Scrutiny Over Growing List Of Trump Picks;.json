Let's go first to Peru, where President Biden and China's President Xi Jinping are meeting right now, likely for the final time. We're about to get our first video of that meeting, and we have new reporting on what is being discussed. Stand by for the information. But first, the Trump transition also moving at a rapid clip. Just moments ago President-Elect Trump announcing he's tapping Chris Wright to be -- who is the head of a fracking company -- to be his secretary of Energy. This comes amid growing scrutiny for many of Trumps key cabinet picks. RFK Jr. chosen for head of Health and Human services has rung some bells -- alarm bells in the medical community. We've also learned that Defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth was accused of sexual assault. And Trump's choice for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, was the subject of several investigations including alleged drug use and sex trafficking. Let's head now to West Palm Beach for the very latest on all of this. CNN's Steve Contorno is near Mar-a-Lago, where President-Elect Trump is considering more cabinet selections. And Steve, as we've been talking, this is moving at a very fast clip. It is very fluid. What can you tell us about Trumps newly-announced pick for Energy secretary.",

He is the CEO of Liberty Energy, that is a company that services oil and natural gas extraction and production companies. He is -- he and his wife are together major Republican donors and in fact held a fundraiser for Donald Trump earlier this year. He is also someone who does not believe in climate change and has said things like there is no climate crisis, which, given Donald Trump's position on this issue, shouldn't be surprising. But it is notable given the department that he will be leading. He will -- he will be joining a newly-formed Council of National Energy, along with Doug Burgum as well.",

President-Elect Trump has tapped her to be his director of National Intelligence.

But the president has promised to end the war in Ukraine. He said numerous times that he will do so within 24 hours. And so really now the pressure is on him. You're not going to end this war in Ukraine by just putting pressure on the Ukrainians. You're going to have to put pressure on the Russians. And the Russians are frankly feeling pretty good. They're feeling pretty good about some of the progress they're making. And it's not a, you know, massive progress on the battlefield, but they've got initiative on the battlefield. They're also feeling pretty good about some of the nominations he's got. So he's nominating a relative lightweight in a secretary of Defense, somebody that has no strategic level experience, somebody that's never managed a large operation. He's nominating folks like Tulsi Gabbard, who's an apologist for the Russians. He's nominating people like Ratcliffe, the former congressman from Texas and CIA, who's primarily known as a partisan. And people like Matt Gaetz, who's not a serious -- a serious candidate. I mean, just look at what the Republicans in the Senate have said about him. And you know, his commitment to the rule of law at best is questionable. So, I think they're feeling pretty good. And I think the president is going to have to come to grips with the fact that he will have to put pressure on the Russians to come to the bargaining table and end this war.",

And so I don't think we should count out the fact that they won't make it through the process. But if they do make it through the process somehow, obviously it'll be highly concerning. But's he's going to have some headwinds. How he communicates with the Russian government to bring them to the bargaining table when they feel like they're better off continuing to fight and that they're -- they can continue to seize Ukrainian territory. I'm not sure how he does that. It's going to require pressure on the Russians in order to bring them to the bargaining table.",

We had a mission to do. And that's the mission focus that every soldier, every service member in uniform has. And so to denigrate their backgrounds, it doesn't make sense to me. In fact, in the sense that those that come with diverse backgrounds, whether they come from parts of the world where I came from, my family came from the Soviet Union and bring that understanding of language and culture, or whether they come from the Middle East or Africa. Those are actual positives. They provide a lens that very few other countries have. So you don't have many immigrants that come to, to China or Russia that bring that kind of skill set and knowledge. And that diversity has been our strength. So, I disagree wholeheartedly with that.

As two major countries, China and the United States should bear in mind the interests of the whole world and inject more certainty and positive energy into the turbulent world. It is my consistent belief that as the world's most important bilateral relationship, a stable China-U.S. relationship is critical not only to the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, but also to the future and destiny of the entire humanity. The two countries should bear in mind the well-being of the two peoples and the common interests of the international community. Make the wise choice to keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other and realize the long-term, peaceful coexistence of China and the United States on this planet. May the United States has recently concluded its election. Chinas goal of a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship remains unchanged. Our commitment to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win (ph) cooperation as principles for handling China-U.S. relations remains unchanged. Our position of resolutely safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests remains unchanged. Our desire to carry forward the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American peoples remains unchanged. China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences so as to strive for a steady transition of the China-U.S. relationship for the benefit of the two peoples.

And you know, we -- I think we spent a long time dealing with these issues. Let me close with this. We, I think, and I once had to count up the number of hours you and I spent alone together. I remember being on the Tibetan plateau with you, and I remember being in Beijing. I remember all over the world. And both as my -- first as vice president, then as president. We haven't always agreed, but our conversations have always been candid and always been frank. We have never kidded one another. We've been leveled with one another. And I think that's vital. These conversations prevent miscalculations, and they ensure the competition between our two countries will not veer into conflict. In competition, not conflict. That's our responsibility to our people, and as you indicated, to the people around the world. We are the most important alliance or most important relationship in the entire world.

If you are President Xi Jinping and you are bracing for an incoming Trump administration 2.0, during which you expect that there's going to be the need to negotiate on trade, on defense, on a whole host of issues. So for today's meeting you there heard both leaders saying that whatever happens between the two nations is vital for the security of the entire world. That was a common theme that you heard from both President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping. And while he says that the relationship will be unchanged going forward regardless of who's president, we know from our own reporting, the top Chinese communist party officials have been canvasing foreign policy experts and asking them exactly which Trump policies from the campaign trail could actually become his second term agenda. How he approached the military footprint in the South China Sea, in the Indo- Pacific more broadly? Is there a grand bargain that might be possible on trade? Is he serious about these tariffs? So all of those are questions that Beijing is asking of people who know Trump and his team. Well, they're seeking intermediaries to figure out if ok, is there another crop of perhaps business executives or family members that perhaps the Chinese could deal with to circumvent the hardline China hawks that Trump has appointed to his cabinet? Of course, all of that is a work in progress. But for now, the Chinese are focused on tying up their relationship with the Biden administration. Biden is too.

She says that it was really hard to get these crimes prosecuted. And so when you see that, when she experiences it and the people around and see that, that's when you have this perception of crime being extremely high, which then led a lot of people to vote a little bit more red in very blue California.
