I'm Christiane Amanpour in New York. President Biden has finally said it out loud that he is officially running for reelection. It is the first step on a long campaign road, one that could lead to a rematch with the Former President Donald Trump, who Biden says is a danger and remains so to the rule of law. Biden sees himself as a champion of global democracy. And so far, American voters have endorsed that position. The world also watched as he immediately through the weight of the United States behind defending Ukraine when Russia launched its second invasion last year. As long as it takes, a phrase Biden often utters. But behind closed doors, there are reports that the administration is concerned about what can be accomplished in any spring counter offensive. Meanwhile, the Russians keep hammering away. News today that a missile struck a museum in Kharkiv, killing two and injuring several more. President Zelenskyy says, the terrorist country is doing everything to destroy Ukraine completely. I've been speaking about the challenges ahead with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.

Budapest played a huge role in the history of Ukraine, andit was about giving up your nuclear weapons, that was back in the '90s, and your territorial integrity and your sovereignty and independence would be guaranteed by the United States and Russia. And I asked President Clinton about this when I interviewed him around the Northern Ireland 25th year anniversary. I asked him whether he regretted, you know, pushing and arranging for Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons to Russia. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL CLINTON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  That was the right decision at the time. They were the third biggest nuclear power in the world. Brazil had an active nuclear program. India had an active nuclear program, still does. Pakistan did. But South Africa and Brazil were about to join, and they totally gave up their programs because of what we were doing. So, Ukraine played a very positive role there, and we tried, in turn, to guarantee their territorial integrity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

President Clinton rightly mentions other countries, none of them gave up their nuclear strategies and none of them got invaded, and we were. We were given a promise that our territorial integrity would be respected in return for giving up nuclear weapons. But when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the world found no real instrument to stop them from doing it, and Budapest memorandum was largely ignored. So, to some extent, I mean, you know, I have to say that you took our defense from us. You owe something. And yes, it's also an investment in the future of the Euro Atlantic security, but it was a big tragedy. And the reason why this tragedy happened is because the United States, at that time, did not believe in Ukraine. They did not believe that Ukraine would become a reliable partner and friend of the United States, and they still put their stakes on Russia as a reliable partner. But history proved that was the wrong analysis. So those who make -- you know, those who hesitate about the prospect of Ukraine's victory today, as they did in 1994, they have to finally believe in Ukraine.",

We've also seen it in the environmental justice and climate justice movement. The only way that America becomes its best and most full self is through the co- conspiratorship, not just allyship where you care about somebody and then, you can turn your back on them, but rather you walk to the floor of the house with them, the well, you risk something in order for all of us to be able to create justice. That is the only way that we can grow and be the country that we're called to be. And it's what Heather McGhee, in her book, \"The Sum of Us,\" calls the building of the solidarity dividend when white folks and black folks, rich folks and poor folks, people who choose a social location different from their own to be more proximate to folks who have been oppressed and are marginalized get together, it disrupts the status quo, it changes the systems, it changes the narrative, and it makes the fight for the future better. And the people who want to cling to the status quo, like the Republican Party in Tennessee, they don't know what to do when this type of power comes, when tens of thousands of young people get together in our state capital to fight in gun violence.

We know that gun violence is a public health emergency in our community, in Memphis, District 86, in Memphis and Millington. We are dealing with story after story after story of another person being murdered. It was my classmate earlier this year, there's another one of my constituent's grandson last night. We have a problem and we have to do something about it.

It's not a Republican or a Democratic issue, this is an issue to every single American.

And he and Sidney Poitier, who were extraordinary actors at the time and we're stars, went down to deliver the funds and the KKK chased them in cars, and they ultimately were saved because some Snake (ph) organizers came and escorted them to safety, right? That is taking a real risk for the calls of justice. And to lose an icon like that is also for each and every one of us to remember what it takes sometimes for us to create the future that we need to live into. And so, I know he will be sorely missed, but he has left an amazing legacy for us all glory.",

There's always somebody out there that's better than you are. And frankly, what we learned, particularly in combat, is the nature of recognizing that, you know, the enemy -- again, the enemy always has a vote, the enemy can be better. If you under play the enemy, you're likely to get yourself into trouble. And what we tend to do is, before the rangers or the SEALs of the green berets go out on a mission, everybody kind of gets together. And even if you're the leader in charge, you're prepared to listen to the comments about the nature of the plan. Well, is this plan good? What do you think, boss? How should we arrange this? But the real critique comes after the mission. So, if a mission has not gone well, you know, and I think the army rangers probably do it better than anybody, they get these young troops back in the room and, you know, metaphorically, they take off their collar devices. So, ranked isn't an issue. And then, everybody gets to go at each other, you know. Because their lives are on the line. If they fail to listen, if they failed to improve the next time, somebody could die. So, I've learned humility many, many times in my career because I've been wrong many, many times. I hope the ledger shows that I was right more than I was wrong. But it is the nature of leadership is you're going to be wrong.

And as you know, you know, from a military strategy standpoint, there's been a lot of debate even amongst Zelenskyy's generals about the merits of Bakhmut, and probably from a, you know, military strategic standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense to hold this small town that's -- you know, it was about 70,000 people before folks have evacuated. It is a little bit of a crossroads of some rail lines and important roads. But at the end of the day, I think, Zelenskyy's general said, hey, boss, we need to do a withdrawal from Bakhmut because we're losing too many people. But I think Zelenskyy really had the better thought on this, which was, we're going to stand our ground in Bakhmut and we're going to stand our ground for a number of reasons, because if the Russians succeed in taking Bakhmut, then it improves their morale, it will negatively affect the Ukrainian morale. It may, in fact, affect the European support and the U.S. support to Ukraine if they feel like the Ukrainians aren't making progress. So, I like the fact that Zelenskyy has -- is holding -- doing the best you can to hold Bakhmut. I don't think we're ready for a ceasefire just yet. You know, it needs to get to the point to, you know, kind of allow the Ukrainians to start their spring offensive to push the Russians as far as they can. And if anybody is going to ask for a ceasefire, it ought to come from Putin first, because then that's an admittance that they're failing. And if they're failing, then they've really lost. And I do think the Ukrainians can win this fight. They win it by ensuring that the Russians aren't successful in building this land bridge from Donbas down to Crimea.

But at the same time, we need to find common ground with China.

I was talking to a senior official in the White House not too long ago who said they have more conversations with Russia than they do with China. Well, that's not good. The fact of that matter is the world needs China. We need Chinese human capital. We need the Chinese economy. We need what China can offer the world. Once again, you know, we need to hold them accountable. But I think we can, in fact, maintain a two-track engagement with China. One hold them accountable. Be strong on defense, so we have a good deterrent capability in the Pacific. But at the same time, build a path for some level of engagement.

Don't misunderstand me, but we've got to make sure that it doesn't become a self-fulfilling prophecy that we end up, you know, building up the military and we're looking for the enemy, and the enemy just happens to be China.
