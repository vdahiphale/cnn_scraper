So Britain, for example, wants to bring Ukraine quickly into NATO and it's pretty clear that President Biden isn't so sure about that. The big division, though, is on these cluster bombs that America is sending to Ukraine.Many allies in Europe do not see that as a possibility. They do not agree with that, because those munitions are illegal in these countries. So there's a bit of division, they're going into that NATO meeting.   We then saw President Biden coming here to Windsor to have a ceremony, frankly, with King Charles. It's interesting to see them together. They work very well together and they had tea together. There's an inspection of guard here, a moment to really celebrate the long-term alliance between the U.K. and the U.S., which remains strong. We call it a special relationship here. We like to think that America sees it as the same. But American presidents generally enjoy these visits. Normally, they're completely confidential once they go into the castle. But slightly different with King Charles this time was he (inaudible) what they discussed. They went to meet some senior bankers from the U.S. and the U.K. to discuss the idea of getting more investment money into clean energy projects. I spoke to President Biden's climate envoy, John Kerry afterwards. He said it was really positive meeting. But it's interesting to get a sense of what happened to that meeting, when in the past with Queen Elizabeth, we never got any sense of that at all. So a bit of a taste of how King Charles is treating his monarchy as well.",

So we're learning a bit about that as well.You'll remember a few years ago, Michelle Obama put her hand on the Queen's back, and that was seen as a real shock. Maybe they're just different characters. I think it's interesting, actually, that King Charles is being bit more formal than he - informed that he used to be. And actually he welcomed that.

A number of major issues at stake here over the next couple of days, including, of course, as Max alluded to that key question of Ukraine's membership in NATO and whether and when they're going to actually become full- fledged members of that alliance.[15:05:06]   This is something that Ukraine has been pushing for, for the better part of a decade, frankly, since 2008 when it was enshrined in their constitution that they would one day join NATO. And NATO told Ukraine that they would want to have a place there. This is now Ukraine's moments. They are coming here, Ukrainian officials, and they are saying that they want a clear timetable and a clear path towards NATO membership. Now, not everyone is on board with that. Of course, we saw President Biden expressed some skepticism about that. He has been reluctant to provide that very clear timetable for Ukraine's accession to NATO. Of course, the big problem with that is that they are at war with Russia. And if they were to join NATO, even when some kind of ceasefire or some kind of peace were reached, the question that is lingering is always going to be will they be at war with Russia and therefore will NATO have to come to their aid, including, of course, the United States. So that's one of the big topics that's going to be weighed here over the next couple of days security assurances to Ukraine, short of that NATO membership, what can the Alliance actually do to help them in the shorter term, protect them against Russia, practical things like weapons, ammunition, all of these weighing very heavily here, of course, on the U.S. and the allies as they try to come to some kind of an agreement on this Boris.",

The Kremlin has revealed that less than a week after that failed revolt by Wagner, Putin sat down with the man who orchestrated it, the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin.CNN's Fred Pleitgen, he's been tracking this from Berlin. And Fred, quite a revelation from the Kremlin here that this meeting indeed, took place first reported by the French paper Liberation (ph). What is behind this? I mean, was this a show of power?

And I think it's hard to overstate just how bizarre all this is, because just as that mutiny was unfolding, as Yevgeny Prigozhin, in the end, said that his troops were then not going to go to Moscow, Vladimir Putin had a video message where he called this a betrayal. He essentially called Yevgeny Prigozhin a traitor, that Kremlin said he would be - essentially be ousted to Belarus, and now he had a meeting only five days later in the Kremlin. And there's some of the things that we've learned from that meeting, from the Kremlin itself and the Kremlin spokesman that really indicate just what a big turnaround this was for Vladimir Putin, where, on the one hand, now he was saying that there was 35 commanders there, unclear whether they were all from Wagner or possibly from the Russian military and other groups. But then there's one sort of sentence that we picked up on where apparently Vladimir Putin spoke about the mutiny itself, but then also spoke about possible further employment and even further deployment of some of those who were involved. Now, that of course, could indicate that there might be a return to the battlefield for Wagner. It's unclear what role, if any, Yevgeny Prigozhin could play in that.

      "sentences": "Yes. The energy drink, it's about 200 milligrams of caffeine in a 12-ounce can. And to put that into some context, that's about the same amount of caffeine as you'd find in six cans of Coke or about two cans of Red Bull. And that's a lot more than pediatricians recommend that kids and adolescents take in, in a day.The American Academy of Pediatrics actually recommends kids under 12 don't have any caffeine. And for kids over 12 some pediatricians say maybe up to a hundred milligrams per day is okay. For adults, the FDA says about 400 milligrams per day is probably what won't tend to bother most people. There are health concerns about this for kids, including disrupting their sleep, causing dehydration, anxiety, increased heart rate and blood pressure and even affecting their development in terms of their neurological systems and cardiovascular system. So the AAP says that really kids and adolescents shouldn't have energy drinks at all, Boris?",
