The first seven jurors in Donald Trump's hush money trial are seated. And the judge warning the former president he won't have them intimidated. Israel continues to debate a response to this weekend's attack by Iran. The U.S. says it's expecting what does come to be \"limited in scope.\" And a Spanish soccer shocker. Barcelona and Atletico Madrid both out of the UEFA Champions League. All that and more coming up. But first, as I mentioned, seven down, five to go, plus an extra six to follow. Day two of Donald Trump's hush money trial is now over with the first seven jurors seated. They cover a wide range of New Yorkers, including an English teacher who avoids the news, an oncology nurse, as well as a man who works in sales who says he watches both Fox News and MSNBC. Potential jurors face questions this Tuesday about their social media posts and where they get their news. Surprising no one, perhaps the former president made it pretty obvious coming out of the court just moments ago that he disapproves of the presiding judge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We think we have a very conflicted, highly conflicted judge. He shouldn't be on the case and he's rushing this trial and he's doing as much as he can for the Democrats. This is a Biden inspired witch hunt, and it should end, and it should end very quickly.

I thought it would take much of the week to get a couple of jurors seated. I would caution that sometimes you don't want to necessarily move so fast for the sake of expediency that you risk making errors that could -- where a case can be reversed on appeal. And so, when I hear about the juror who was allowed to remain, who had been filmed celebrating a Biden victory, while it's true typically that politics doesn't disqualify you, this case is unique because, essentially, Trump is being charged for trying to take away or influence the election victory by some payment, specifically involving Biden. So, you had somebody who was celebrating Biden's win. That may pose some problems. So, I do think the judge has done a fairly good job at keeping things moving. But you're right. Prosecutors nor the defense team want to have jurors who really are -- have a secret motive, an ulterior motive. So, they need to go through this very carefully, be very careful about social media posts, be very careful about body language that we may see in the courtroom. And they're all looking not so much to choose the right jurors, but to make sure that certain jurors who may have a bias do not get on the panel so that the case can be fair to both sides.",

And part of that lends itself to intimidation when you have -- again, you have the sort of the security detail who's present, you have the former president who is not known for being a shrinking violent in any way he's willing to let his displeasure be known audibly at times, certainly visibly. And so, these are things that the judge is having to watch. But part of it, again, is just recognizing that this is not what I would call a typical criminal trial, and any effort to make it seem so just belies the facts that are present, and that is that this is a trial of huge notoriety, and it's a trial that it will involve and does involve a former president of the United States, and as we know, even issues that move very quickly up toward the Supreme Court. So, you know, no juror likes to be put on the spot. It's an uncomfortable position for people who are not used to being in a courtroom on a regular basis in the first place, but certainly, when you add those other factors, it can create an atmosphere that certainly makes them uncomfortable and it may lend to some feelings that they're intimidated.",

I think some of this back and forth about the gag order, it seems to me that it's about time that we put that down and let's just get on to the trial of this case. And I think that's going to be important. You'll have two court proceedings going on at the same time when you have the Supreme Court hearing oral arguments about his immunity claim, and then you have this criminal trial going on. Again, these are things we haven't seen before. And so, this will make for an interesting view. And by anybody who's following the case and sort of the happenings in each circumstance. I do also have some interest in seeing who is the first witness. You know, prosecution teams should not put up somebody who's an analytical type to sort of put the jury to sleep. At the same time, they can't necessarily put up what I would consider to be their hottest witnesses. In this case, that may be, in fact Ms. Daniels and Mr. Cohen. Those witnesses have their own issues that'll have to be dealt with on cross-examination. So, it'll be interesting to see which witness comes forward, and this needs to be a witness that basically sets the hook for the jury. It gets them interested in the case, turns their attention full speed to the facts that are coming ahead, begins to tell the story, but doesn't serve as really an obstacle or give the prosecution any risk that they're starting off with a weak witness. So, it will be telling to see who they put up. That might be Ms. Hicks, it might be somebody else. We'll certainly see as the weeks progress.",

And then, of course, the question of does the U.S. get a heads up or does Israel act onits own and either not give the U.S. a heads up in advance so that the Biden administration can't object? Or does that heads up come very late in the process with the attack already set in motion? And as you point out the question, what is limited? What does that mean, an attack that's limited in scope? There are a number of different options that Israel can pursue here, from hitting Iranian forces in Syria to carrying out some sort of strike in Iran itself, but each of these has risks, both military and diplomatic. Of course, Israel and Iran are not close together. So, any sort of operation has to take place over range, which is very difficult with Israel's fighter jets, especially because they're unlikely to get any sort of refueling help from other countries. And that too is a major consideration here. It wasn't just Israel and the United States defending Israeli airspace from this Iranian attack, other countries helped as well, including the Jordanians and others, and Israel risks the bit of goodwill it generated here in the defense of this attack if it does decide to carry out its own attack against Iran, crossing the airspace of other countries that participated in the defense of Israel and were able to help in that process. So, all of these are factors that Israel is weighing in, that the U.S. watching very closely. President Joe Biden made very clear to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Iranian attack that Israel should see this as a win because the vast majority was intercepted by the U.S., Israel, and the partners who participated in the defense here. There was no major damage, relatively minor damage in just a couple of spots in Israel. And yet, Israel's leadership, including its political and military leadership, have made clear that some sort of response is coming and that's what the U.S. is watching very closely, specifically because Iran has also vowed to respond to any Israeli attack. So, now, it is a question of waiting here. And part of that waiting, it seems, Julia, is waiting for Israel to decide how it's going to move forward here. And as we just heard from our colleague, Jeremy Diamond, perhaps that decision hasn't yet been made as Israel tries to figure out how to thread a needle between responding and not angering the U.S. and the other countries that helped in the defense over the weekend.",

And I think it's hard to comprehend, even with the wind on some of these pictures here, what was happening and what people were thinking because it was gone, it stopped, and then it was back again. Then it was gone and then it was back again. And did it four times during the day. And so, yes, one storm after another. On top of ground, there's a lot of pavement there. I mean, that's a lot of impervious surfaces there in the area. So, not a lot of it soaked in, especially right in the city. 99 millimeters in just 12 hours. Very few cities in the world can take that. And yes, the biggest month we typically have is February, 35 millimeters for the entire month. So, we tripled that just about in just one day. And there is some of the other numbers too, Abu Dhabi picking up 62 millimeters of rain on the south side of that storm system. America, we've had some tornadoes in the past couple of days. 22 reports of tornadoes so far in 48 hours, and they're still out there right now. Still have the potential for hail, for wind, and also four tornadoes throughout the night. Eventually, tomorrow, it will move up toward the Great Lakes. But even at this point, right now, storms are still out there and tornadoes are still on the ground. So far, today, they haven't been large tornadoes just yet, but that doesn't mean as the night goes on and the winds kind of shift a little bit that that couldn't happen. Certainly, still the possibility for today. And then for tomorrow, moving this ahead until tomorrow afternoon, we could see some of those storms in places we wouldn't expect, like Michigan. This is not Michigan's severe weather season. Not yet. But like you said, when it's warmer earlier, all of a sudden those seems to show -- seasons seem to change just a little bit. And that's always a possibility. A warmer air mass holds more moisture. Julia.",

Among the concerns for governments and citizens alike is the rise of deepfakes. Well, the British Ministry of Justice just announced Tuesday a draft law that would make the creation of sexually explicit deepfake content, a criminal offense. Clare Duffy is on this story for us. Clare, I think the best example of this most recently, most high-profile certainly is what happened with Taylor Swift. What we're saying here is if you take someone's face and you put it onto a body in a sexually explicit photograph, it will become a criminal offense and you could face a limitless charge too or a fine.",

This is just a really troubling trend that has been growing with the adoption of these A.I.tools, this trend of people creating nonconsensual A.I. or otherwise deepfake images that are sexually explicit and sharing them with other people across the Internet. We've seen this happen to Taylor Swift, as you said, but also to high school students and other women around the globe. And so, lawmakers are really trying to get a handle on this. Now, in England and Wales, where this new law has been proposed, it's already illegal to share nonconsensual deepfake pornography that violators of that law can face jail time. And this new proposed law would be a step further. It would make it illegal just to create this content in the first place and violators could face fines, could face having criminal charges on their record for the future. Now, this comes as the U.S. and E.U. are also taking similar steps, trying to get a handle on this one of the most harmful applications of A.I. technology. But I do think it's interesting that in this U.K. case we're seeing them go after the people who are creating this nonconsensual deepfake pornography, but not the platforms that are enabling them to create that content.

How do you find that imagery? So, I think that's one question in terms of the enforcement of this new law. But as you said, there are so many elements of this, where is it shared, should those platforms be held accountable, who's viewing it, who else is sharing it on the internet? I think there are so many questions when it comes to how to get a handle on this, but it does seem like some of the major players that could hold some responsibility here are the A.I. generation tools that are enabling the creation of this content and then the social media platforms where this content is currently being shared, Julia.",
