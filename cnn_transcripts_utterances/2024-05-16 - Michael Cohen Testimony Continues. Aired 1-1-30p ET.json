I'm Brianna Keilar in Washington, with Kaitlan Collins, who is outside the courthouse in New York.And, today, Trump's defense has pressed Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer and fixer, about his history of lying under oath in an attempt to discredit him. The defense has also highlighted some of the various insults that he has lobbed against Trump over the years, painting him as a man out for revenge after their relationship fell apart. At one point the defense played this clip from Cohen's podcast in October of 2020. Here it is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY/FIXER FOR DONALD TRUMP:  I truly (EXPLETIVE DELETED) hope that this man ends up in prison. It won't bring back the year that I lost or the damage done to my family, but revenge is the dish best served cold. And you better believe I want this man to go down and rot inside for what he did to me and my family. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

With me now is the chief legal affairs correspondent, Paula Reid, and CNN national correspondent Kristen Holmes. Paula, it's getting weird in there, because, right before... (LAUGHTER)",

He said he was calling to get to Trump to pass on a message about the payment to Stormy Daniels. Todd Blanche is trying to draw blood right now and say, actually, in that 90-second phone call, you were complaining to Trump's body man about getting harassing phone calls from a 14-year-old prank caller.",

So you have this timeline that really raises questions about whether this next conversation with Keith Schiller and allegedly the president would have been about the pranker that you were just threatening and following up with Keith Schiller about how you can retaliate against the pranker or if it would have been about Stormy Daniels. And this testimony that Cohen had previously given was significant for the prosecution, because it shows that Trump was aware of what was happening with the hush money payment. And if you undercut the credibility of that conversation, it's not game over for the prosecution, but it's definitely a blow to their key witness and one of the most important pieces of testimony that he gave to support the idea that Trump was behind this entire conspiracy.",

But threatening a 14-year-old with Secret Service action seems to be one of the more embarrassing moments. But I think, particularly, this is critical, other than being embarrassing, because part of this has been what we have seen Todd Blanche doing, which is essentially lining up all up until this moment that Michael Cohen is somebody who would lie to get what he wanted out of this. And they have said that what Michael Cohen wants is for Donald Trump to go to jail. Now they are trying to question what he actually said on the stand.",

But if jurors don't believe that Cohen actually had this conversation with him in late October 2016, that does hurt the prosecution's case, because they need each one of these little building blocks. It's all they have, largely, right, is the testimony of Michael Cohen to support the idea that Trump was creating or causing all of these documents to be falsified to cover up the hush money. It's pretty well-established that this was all done to help Trump win the White House. We have multiple witnesses who can speak to that. But Michael Cohen is really the only one who can speak to Trump's role, direct role, in the conspiracy.

This was right around the decision to -- Michael Cohen made to pay Stormy Daniels the $130,000. And so Trump's attorney is going back and forth with him about this call and the time stamp of it at 8:02 p.m. Well, he also showed Cohen that he was having text messages with Donald Trump's security office, or Keith Schiller. And that is who Michael Cohen testified just the other day that he had connected through Schiller to speak with Trump. So what Todd Blanche, Trump's lawyer, did was show him that Cohen was exchanging a lot of messages with Keith Schiller about harassing phone calls he'd been getting, saying that now he knew who it was. It was a 14-year-old. And he asked Schiller what he should do. At 8:02, Schiller said, call me. So it's at that point that Cohen has that phone call, according to the call logs, with Keith Schiller. Now, Cohen has testified that it was then that he talked to Donald Trump, updated him on Stormy Daniels, and said that it was going to be resolved. So, Todd Blanche saying, in the one-minute-36-second phone call that these call records show, that is when you say that you talked to Keith Schiller and also spoke with Donald Trump. At this moment, Todd Blanche is now pacing in the court, flailing his arms up. He's raised his voice into high pitch. And Cohen was maintaining then that he said that he was able to speak with him, to Trump, because he said he ran everything past Trump. Now, this whole time, Cohen has not broken his composure. He has still been answering all of these questions and answering that question, while maintaining an even tone, but certainly the most dynamic moment of this cross-examination, because Todd Blanche also asking Cohen, if you only remembered this phone call when you were refreshed, your recollection was refreshed by documents from the prosecutors, does that mean you didn't remember any of these phone calls that you had in 2016? So they're really trying to hone in here on Cohen's recollection of calls with Donald Trump. And that is because Michael Cohen is the only person that links Donald Trump directly to the hush money payments, decision to make those payments, and the reimbursement. And that is the part of this case that prosecutors say was the crime, the falsification of the records. So, it sounds like they're still getting started. We're at the break here. The -- Trump's attorneys said they do expect to go the full day. And so this session, aside from that last moment, otherwise, they have spent it really trying to point out different lies that Michael Cohen has given in the past, admitting that he lied under oath to a federal judge, among other things, so really, again, this theme of trying to undercut his credibility and suggest to the jury that they shouldn't believe Cohen's testimony -- Kaitlan.",

Michael Cohen lies a lot and lied a lot. Michael Cohen has prior convictions. And Michael Cohen has a bias against the former president. Like, those things were all pretty well-established and laid out. I think the most effective moment today by far was playing the sound of Michael Cohen's podcast for the jury. They hadn't heard him sounding incredibly shrill and incredibly pointed about the former president in a way that this measured witness on stage, who's done quite a good job sort of keeping his cool, I think.

We know he hates Donald Trump. The story with the 14-year-old is so important because it goes to the heart of the allegations in this case. Here's how. On direct testimony, Michael Cohen said, crucial piece of testimony, in October -- I think it's the October 24th of 2016. I had one of the key phone conversations in this whole case. I called Keith Schiller. He patched me through to Trump or he put me on speaker. Cohen doesn't remember. And I told them, Stormy's been paid, matter resolved. That goes to the heart of the case. Well, now we're finding out on cross-exam that that day, actually, what Cohen was texting Schiller about all day leading up to that call was this 14-year-old is harassing me, sic the Secret Service on him. And so Blanche said, well, that was actually what you called Keith Schiller about, not this Stormy Daniels thing. Cohen then retreated to, well, I talked about both, actually, the 14-year-old harassing me and Stormy Daniels. The problem is, Michael Cohen did not tell the grand jury that this phone call in October 2016 was about Stormy Daniels. So, there are major questions about a core aspect of Michael Cohen's testimony that goes right to the heart of this case.",

But the jurors showed nothing on their faces, but they were watching incredibly intently. And Todd Blanche essentially stopped the cross- examination, said to the judge, this -- maybe this is a good time for lunch break. And the judge agreed. So this is what the jurors are going to think to lunch. I was talking to Norm Eisen on the way out from court, who was saying, Todd Blanche should try to keep the cross-examination going all the way until -- through the afternoon, not allowing the prosecution to redirect, so that, for the next three days, jurors will just have Michael Cohen's testimony to mull over.",

Yes, I think, if I was a juror in this case, watching that, I would think this guy's making this up as he's going along, or he's making this particular story up. Todd Blanche was pointing out, you were testifying just on Tuesday in this court. And all morning long, he's been pointing out inconsistencies in Michael Cohen's testimony, or at least questionable aspects of Michael Cohen's testimony, but nothing that you would necessarily as a juror think, OK, that's clearly a lie. Maybe that's just a mis -- he was misunderstanding, or he was bragging, or whatever. This one, Todd Blanche clearly saved this to right before the lunch break, I'm assuming, because it was just so well crafted and just point by point walking through this story, which at first seemed, why -- why -- this seems like a ridiculous story.",
