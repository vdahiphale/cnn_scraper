It should be docking within the next 30 seconds, less than 30 seconds.It's taking place nearly 15 hours after its successful launch from Cape Canaveral yesterday. And after NASA discovered two additional helium leaks during the voyage late last night. With us, as we await this milestone, CNN space and defense correspondent, Kristin Fisher, and retired NASA astronaut, Leroy Chiao. Kristin, first talk to us about what's actually happening right now, seconds away from this dock. KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they've actually extended it to just about a few minutes because they want to make sure the light is right. So what you have is Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, that's that capsule that the astronauts that we watched launched yesterday have been inside for the last 24 hours or so. And what it is doing, it is -- it is slowly approaching the International Space Station and they're going to dock. But this is the first time they have ever done that with a crew on board. And of course, you have astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station. And so what they want to do is take it very slowly and they want to wait until there's actual sunlight on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft. Right now, they're in a period of darkness, nighttime in space. So they're waiting just a few more minutes until they get that sunlight. They're now on the final approach. And they've been troubleshooting these pesky RCS thrusters, as they're called, the things that kind of propel the spacecraft, move through those last-minute final adjustments. But they think they've walked -- they've worked through those issues. And we're now just minutes away. Nine meters away, as we'll.",

But once the spacecraft got into orbit, they found two more. Last night, before NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, went to sleep, they made them do all these things to kind of shut down some of these thrusters to stop the leak. And they troubleshooted it overnight and decided that they we're OK and go for this docking today. So it could have been more serious but turned out not to be.

We -- one, NASA likes redundancy. Astronauts like redundancy. All engineers do.
