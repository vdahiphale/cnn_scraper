We're live from one of the impact sites in Kiev.Then dozens of NATO peacekeepers are injured during violent clashes with (inaudible) protesters in Kosovo. And the U.S. warns it could sanction Uganda after it passed extreme anti-gay legislation. But how effective will those sanctions be? We begin with a swarm of drone strikes in both Kiev and Moscow. The unusual strike in the Russian capital comes as Kremlin forces continue to pound the Ukrainian capital for a third straight day. Moscow's mayor says the drones caused minor damage to several buildings. No one was seriously injured. Ukraine has denied direct involvement. Kiev says it destroyed 29 of the 31 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched at the capital. One person was killed in that bombardment. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is at one of the sights that was hit and joins us now live from Kiev. Fred.",

In fact, we were also hearing for several hours as those Shahed drones were loitering basically overhead here in the capital. You could hear there engines in the night. And then also hear the Ukrainian Air Defense frantically trying to shoot them down. And you're absolutely right, I'm at - I'm actually at one of the places that was hit overnight. And if we pan over here, you can see that there was actually substantial damage that was sustained here. There's a lot of debris still laying around in front of this residential building. And if we pan up, we can see that actually the top floors of that building also pretty heavily damaged. This is also the place where a 33 year old woman was killed in these strikes as they happened. And Max, earlier today, I was actually able to speak to the mayor of Kiev, the former boxing champ Vitali Klitschko. And he called what happened here terrorism on the part of the Russians. Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIIDEO CLIP)",

You noted that a lot of those Shaheds that were coming here towards the Ukrainian capital were actually shot down. And, in fact, even here at this building, the Ukrainians are saying that the drone that struck it was actually fragments of a drone that had before that been hit by air defense. Now at the same time, we, of course, have the situation there in the Russian capital in Moscow and lot of folks there very concerned this morning as they were seeing drones flying towards the Russian capital. But we also have further information from the Russian Defense Ministry, from the authorities there. They say that there were eight drones that were involved. They blamed the attack, of course, on Kyiv. The Ukrainians say it wasn't them. The Russians are saying that three of those drones were taken down using electronic countermeasures. In other words, they then went off course and crashed. But they also say that they had to activate their air defenses to take down five of those drones. Of course, a big incident and certainly a first for the Russian capital since Russia's full on invasion of Ukraine has begun. And just a quick note, Max, the Ukrainians are saying that they were not behind the attacks that happened in Moscow, but they also say they believe that incidents like that will happen again in the future.

Fred, thank you very much indeed.Well, Ukraine's President says a decision has been made on the timing of his country's long awaited counteroffensive.

It comes as Ukraine's foreign minister calls on western allies to send more air defense systems and ammunition following a third wave of attacks on Kyiv. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following all these developments.

Zelenskyy making these comments, which is an advancement from what we saw a couple of weeks ago when he was in the U.K. and said we need more time. Now he says, we know when, we're just not going to tell you yet.And this comes after, of course, we saw just a few days ago from the head of the Armed Forces releasing this really sort of epic trailer style, movie style video, really sort of looked like a trailer for the counteroffensive showcasing, you know, Ukrainian troops training. A lot of Western weapons on display there. Some of the more high-tech ones, HIMARS, Leopard tanks, things like that. And the caption to that was, \"The Time Has Come To Take Back What Is Ours\". On the flip side, we now have Russia saying the Russian defense minister coming out today and claiming that they have hit a lot of those supplies of Western weapons. Claiming they've hit ammunition and weapons depots in three locations intercepted, he said, 29 British Storm Shadow missiles since they were donated and damaged a Patriot system in Kyiv in recent days. Now, none of those claims we've been able to verify, but it does seem that that is certainly part of the strategy of Moscow at the moment to target those Western weapons. And, of course, that bolsters the Russian rhetoric around the idea that it is somehow under siege and at war, not just with Ukraine, but, of course, with NATO as a whole.",

Meaning, actually become the law of the land.Now, because of the hype around this law, activists fear it could be in a few days or a few weeks, unless there's some technicality that creeps in that delays it. Now, you remember, a similar law that was pushed some time ago now was eventually struck down in the courts. And you do have domestic civil society groups ready to try and stop the law once it's actually put into effect.

One is likely to happen, which would be travel or visa bans for individuals who push this law, including members of parliament, potentially sanctions against the president and members of the leadership of that country, in particular, the speaker of parliament who was instrumental in pushing this through. There's also something looming that is critically important, and the White House mentioned that and that's AGOA, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which is being assessed by Congress and others ahead of a deadline. Now that allows tariff free exports of Ugandan goods to the U.S. The White House mentioned this by name. There is a really big stick there for the U.S. to use against the country should they not dial back this law. But domestic politics will certainly be pressuring Museveni and those lawmakers to follow through with this draconian law. And if it does come into place and is enforced, it will be extremely bad, say activists and just ordinary Ugandans I've spoken to who identify with the LGBTQ community. Max?",
