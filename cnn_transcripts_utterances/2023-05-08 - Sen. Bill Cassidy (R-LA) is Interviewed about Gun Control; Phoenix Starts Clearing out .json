In the Uvalde Response Bill we actually created funds for the states, such as mine, to have more resources to enforce restraining orders, for example. The husband, who's estranged, who walks in and kills his family. Now, he's already got a restraining order. He's not a (INAUDIBLE). So, there's resources within that bill to address that. There's also resources for hardening schools. By the way, I'll point out, the administration was slow to put those out. My superintendent of education said, listen, they're not letting us harden schools. I called Secretary Cardona. He goes, we'll connect that, but they've only corrected it for three states. So, the clear message of the bill allows states to harden schools. The administration is slow walking. We've got to enforce -- we've got to enact that bill.",
