We only look at the violent actions that take place that are visible, such as the horrible shootings that we see and Israeli actions and in places like Jenin and the horrible shooting in East Jerusalem. All of these things obviously matter. And he and the administration wants to maintain sort of access of escalation. I wouldn't say de-escalation because de-escalation means the end of violence, but violence is intrinsic to the structure of military control every single day.

And yet, in the last few months, this has become such a strategically important town that the Russians have thrown a heck of a lot of troops, heck of a lot of equipment at trying to capture so far, though, with no luck.Part of the reason why Ukraine has been so successful and actually defending this place is because it has a lot of natural fortifications, hills, valleys, sort of forested areas, waterways that make it very difficult for the Russians to make inroads. It is also extremely well defended by the Ukrainians as well. The head of the Wagner private military group said that every house there is like a fortress and that there's defenses up every 10 meters or so. But now it seems that the Russians are starting to make inroads, at least in surrounding and encircling the city making some progress and cutting off some of the routes to the north and to the south and some of the last remaining roads in and out for the Ukrainians have come under heavy fire over the last week. According to Ukrainian commanders in the town, one Ukrainian commander said that volunteers can no longer come in and out and that those civilians who remain are essentially living in their basement. And he said that if Ukraine does choose to withdraw from Bakhmut at some point, it will be only to preserve the lives of its soldiers so that they can live to fight another day.

But I think that there are other options as well, just changing the nature of the land surface. And I think this was seen -- I think it was in Houston or Dallas with the big flooding there. There was so much concrete and asphalt, the water didn't have anywhere to go. And it was the same story in Auckland really, we don't have a lot of open space in the -- in the city. We could have exposed streams instead of streams and culverts, we could have wetlands, green spaces, more trees planted. And that allows the rain when it falls on the ground to be soaked up more readily, and so less of it flows down the road. So, those kinds of urban planning responses are at least as important as the size of the drains. But I think we have to do all of these things because it's true that these heavy rains will only get heavier as the climate warms up. And we're going to see more of this kind of grief in Auckland and around the country as time goes on.",

We've already got a different climate, and it will be different, more different than 50 years from now. So, yes, we need to be thinking about what the future will look like. And it's not going to look like the past. So, if a council for instance, is digging up the drains for some reason been putting in bigger drains is a very sensible thing to do. And I know that some of the regional authorities are already doing this. We need to be consistent around the country, and make sure that we're taking this kind of action, when it makes sense and where it makes sense.",

And I think there's -- I don't know, a few dozen houses that are going to have to be pulled down and possibly rebuilt somewhere else. So, you know, even the international airport had to be closed because of water in the terminal, and water on the runway, something again, I've never seen before. I've been through that airport many times, and there's never been a problem. So, just the intensity of the rain, really, got on top of all of the infrastructure, and it'll be months if not years before some of the damage is repaired.",
