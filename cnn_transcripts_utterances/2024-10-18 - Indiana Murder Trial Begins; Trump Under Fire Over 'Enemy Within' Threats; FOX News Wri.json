They have tried many different things. They tried, he's a dictator. He's going to take over the whole world. It doesn't seem to be working. I am the most stable human being. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They want him to win. But to hear him come out and say, yes, I had some people from FOX help me write these jokes. I have asked FOX News for a comment about this. Who were these people? We want to know who they were. Did they actually help? Is this allowed? Is this encouraged? Because I can tell you that, at CNN, I'm pretty sure we would not be allowed to help a politician write their jokes for a dinner like this. Now, this is not the first time we have actually seen FOX News personalities helping Donald Trump outwardly. If you remember, in 2018, ahead of the midterms, Sean Hannity actually went on stage during a rally that Donald Trump was hosting ahead of the midterms, and that caused a lot of drama around that as well. So we're still reporting this out, trying to figure out exactly how these jokes were written, who from FOX may have helped him, and is this actually true?",

This week alone, we're hearing about CNBC, also a separate interview that was supposed to happen with NBC, and then this morning Politico reporting that there were conversations for the former president to sit down for an interview with The Shade Room, but that producers were told Trump was -- quote -- \"exhausted\" and refusing some interviews. His advisers had said at the time that that could change. Trump's team is pushing back, one of his spokespeople who was not involved in these conversations saying he's not exhausted, this isn't true. But having read that this morning, Sara, and then to see him pop up actually sitting on the couch, he calls in a lot, but to see him sitting on the couch in that very friendly environment, I just found it to be interesting timing.",

And so he sees it as traitorous almost if FOX News is doing anything that is against him, if it has any sort of contributor like Jessica Tarlov or any sort of on-air person who might be speaking out against him. He sees that and saying, this is my home. This is my home base. Why are you doing such a thing, as even the basic tenants of journalism? So, kind of incredible, though, just to see him saying all of this just out loud, not only talking about going straight to Rupert Murdoch, but also talking about how FOX staffers may have helped him. Again, turn the tables just a bit and imagine if this was happening with Vice President Kamala Harris talking about NBC or something like that. There would be a huge absolute meltdown by a lot of people, especially on the right.",

So, Carrie, let's start here. There's -- yes, there's the political argument. Yes, there's a lot of rhetoric. Would a president actually have that kind of authority?

I have been in situations where we have dealt with the National Guard during the L.A. riots, for instance, when there was what would be called a widespread insurrection or a riot. They were called in, but by the California governor. The president cannot, cannot, under the law, call up the military to deal with the U.S. civilians.",
