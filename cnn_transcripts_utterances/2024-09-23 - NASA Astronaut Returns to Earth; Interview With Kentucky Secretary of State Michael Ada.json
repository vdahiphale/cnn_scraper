And then, later this week, Harris will deliver a speech with more details on her economic vision for the country. Joining us now, Ian Sams, senior spokesman for the Harris 2024 presidential campaign. Hi, Ian. So, say what you want about the polls, but the polls consistently show Trump has an advantage when it comes to the economy, particularly in those key battleground states. What's new about Kamala Harris' economic message that you think could move voters on this issue? IAN SAMS, HARRIS/WALZ CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:  Well, thanks for having me, and congratulations on your new anchor spot here this hour.",

And I think part of what you're going to see this week in her speech on Wednesday about the economy is a real contrast in visions between the two candidates and what they would do on the economy if they win in November. Vice President Harris is talking about cutting middle-class taxes. President Trump is talking about raising middle-class taxes by about $4,000 a year with his plan. She's talking about creating more small businesses and financial incentives for small businesses. Donald Trump's talking about another big tax cut for big corporations and billionaires. And so I think, over the coming weeks, as we close out this campaign, the choice on the economy is going to be crystal clear. And you're going to see that this week when she speaks in Pennsylvania about her own vision for the economy and what she believes in as a capitalist and how this economy can work best for the middle class.",

So I will ask you, does she think Americans are better off now or not?",

It's actually a forward-looking question. And that's what she's doing on the campaign trail every day, issaying, I understand that we have to go further for people. There are still too many people out there who are hurting. Yes, inflation has eased a little bit and prices are starting to come down, but, man, we have got to go even further. And when you look at the choice on the ballot in November, it's either me or it's Donald Trump. And my plan is actually to take on these things and to work for you and to try to help you bring those costs down, whereas Donald Trump is pushing the same old trickle-down agenda that's going to help those people at the very top and billionaires, while jacking up prices on everybody else, including a nearly $4,000- a-year increase on taxes for the middle class. And so that's not going to help bring people's costs down. And so when you look at the future, not the past, but the future, and what these two candidates as president will do if they get elected, she's focused on making sure that people's lives continue to get better and don't go backwards, like they would with Donald Trump.",

And 45 percent of voters say Trump's policies would actually help people like them, versus just 37 percent for Harris. That's looking at the future, not just the past here.

I think what we are seeing consistently in this election is that, when voters start to hear the choice between the two candidates, whether that's on the debate stage -- and Vice President Harris is very excited to accept CNN's invitation to debate on October 23. Donald Trump continues to come up with excuses why he won't participate. Most recently, it's too late, even though it's the day after the one he participated in 2020. And, in fact, in 2020, on October 23, the exact date of CNN's proposed debate this year, he was asked in the Oval Office, would you do another debate? And he said yes. But, suddenly, it's too late for him. We need those debates so that people can see the choice on the economy, on immigration, on foreign policy, on all the issues that are so important to the American people. We need that debate so that they can hear one last time from these two candidates. One general election debate between Vice President Harris and Donald Trump isn't enough. And Donald Trump's team is indicating just this weekend in \"The Washington Post\" he's still thinking about it. Kellyanne Conway has allegedly been pushing him to do it. Is he going to listen? Is he going to be in the mood to do it? Or is he going to balk and walk away? We think that he should come to the debate stage.",

Michael Adams, a Republican and a top election official in my home state of Kentucky, has vowed to ensure a free and fair vote in the state to come November. We bring in Secretary Adams now to discuss all of this. Secretary, thanks for coming on. So, your office received a suspicious letter last week. Tell us about that. And have you since made any changes to your practices there to keep everyone safe? MICHAEL ADAMS (R), KENTUCKY SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, it was sent to our state Board of Elections on the morning of our regular monthly meeting. I don't think that was a coincidence. It contained a powdery substance. We immediately had the help of the FBI, who confirmed for us that it was not toxic. And we went on with our business.

But, fortunately, we have not suffered that. If you look at the way that these people think, if that's the word for it, they're conspiracy theorists, and they think that there's some shadowy cabal at the top, that it's the elites. They're not after poll workers. They're not even after voters. They're after me, and they're after leadership, because they think that we're up to something because we're the government, we're the elite, we're the establishment, whatever it is.

He's promised us regular consultations as we get into this election campaign. My hope is that we will see less of the vote cast by mail compared to four years ago, because, the post office, they're doing their best in good faith, but they have got challenges.
