This is CNN News Central. Breaking overnight, the Harris campaign says they are feeling the energy needed to win Georgia, as the vice president returned to the state for a rally later today, her sixth visit there this year. A new memo reveals the Harris team believes disenfranchised Republicans there will be key to keeping that state blue. The memo saying Trump has waged a full on war with Georgia's top Republicans. It points out these two indicators of Trump's weak support in the state, his performance in the Republican primary, where Nikki Haley took 13 percent of the vote there, and major defections from Republicans, such as former Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan, who says he is backing Harris. Today's stop in Atlanta coming as the Harris team launches a new $50 million ad campaign in battleground states. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now. Priscilla, what should we expect from her rally in Atlanta today?",

So, for all of those reasons, it is going to be closely watched, and it is also why the Harris campaign will be there to rally voters.Now, we're getting a little bit of a glimpse as to what her argument is going to be during this rally, and that is prosecuting the case against former President Donald Trump, something that her ad is also doing.

The acting director is also expected to detail new protocols the agency is putting in place in light of all of this.

It's the detail of it being a mom and baby center, which is just this very common community place that is in every neighborhood here in England. And it is the detail that it was a Taylor Swift-themed dance class full of little girls. We now know there are three children who were killed, all girls, the latest victim, a nine-year-old, the two others ages, six and seven years old. There are several more still in hospital receiving treatment.Taylor Swift has spoken out. I think her statement begins to capture that absolute horror. I do want to read it to you. She says, the horror of yesterday's attack in Southport is washing over me continuously and I'm just completely in shock. The loss of life and innocence and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone who was there, the families and first responders, these were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families. We also have support pouring in from the royal family. The king has spoken out. The prince and princess of Wales have spoken out. The prime minister has spoken out. But as you can imagine at this time, Sara, there is very little that can console this community in the country at large that is just horrified by such a brutal attack with no justification, no reason, and no sense of why.",
