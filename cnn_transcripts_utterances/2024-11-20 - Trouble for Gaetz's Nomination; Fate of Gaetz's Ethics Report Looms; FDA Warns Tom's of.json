Gaetz has been the most searched by far, by far. He has gotten 13 - up 1,300 percent from the median Trump pick. So, he's generating a lot of public pressure. That public pressure may be felt by those who are potentially voting to confirm Matt Gaetz in the United States Senate. I should note, while the public, you know, perception of him could be positive or negative, based upon all those folks who are searching for him, the initial polling data suggests that he is the least popular of Trump's picks. In fact, the only one that's underwater in terms of net favorability ratings. So, at this particular point, Mr. Berman, what are we dealing with? We're dealing with somebody who's not exactly popular on Capitol Hill to begin with.

I want to read for you the quote from Walmart's CFO saying, \"we never want to raise prices.\" This is an interview we did with CNBC on Tuesday. He says, \"our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\" And what he's talking about is all because of tariffs. Is this one promise that you hope that Donald Trump does not keep?",

I think you may see some instances when we deal with countries like China, where you see tariffs implemented. Again, this is also to protect the American worker and in the long-term bring prices down as a whole.And so, I think we'll wait to see what happens. Of course, when it comes to the economy, this is something that, obviously, as Maria mentioned, people voted for President Trump as a result of this. They saw the economy under the Biden administration. They weren't happy. They wanted their prices to go back to what they were paying in 2019. They wanted their wages to continue to go up. Obviously, wages weren't outpacing the rate of inflation. And this was a problem for many American families. And they continue to deal with it today. They can't afford to live the way that it is. And people are making very difficult decisions. When I was running for Congress back in 2022, I talked to so many moms, so many families here in Ohio that said, we're going to the grocery store and having to choose between orange juice and other things because we just simply can't afford all the things we used to buy, and gas, and our, you know, all of our bills, car insurance going up at the time as well. And so, it's very difficult to watch and hear from Americans who are struggling to live. And so, we want to see those prices come down. But when you talk about that mandate for change, I think it goes past the economy. Obviously, the economy was top of mind for voters on November 5th, but I think there's this underlying sentiment among Americans that, you know what, we aren't treated the same as the elites in Washington. You know, this is part of why Trump obviously won in 2016, and they want to feel like they have a larger voice in their government because for so long they were promised by both Republicans and Democrats to get the job done. And so many of the very conventional D.C. elites that continue to get put in these positions weren't getting the job done for them. And so I think, while cautiously optimistic, a little bit nervous in general, I think they're - they're very excited for the change that's to come. And the real answer will be in one year from now, are their lives better and has this change happened? Have we drained the swamp in Washington?",

They have always been afraid of Russian escalation and they've overestimated the chances of that. It's what led us to be so cautious in our aid to Ukraine to this point.

And this is an effort to give the Ukrainians some more defensive capability to slow or stop that advance.As for the type of landmine, you're absolutely right, they're self- deactivating. That means after a few weeks or months they - they will not be a danger to civilians. But it's important that Ukraine actually be able to slow this Russian advance right now. BERMAN: Why right now?

But, frankly, I don't think there's anything there right now that would cause a major reaction from Russia, largely because they don't have many options. As I said, they - their military is deeply stretched. They can't both be on offense and defense at the same time. They're bringing in North Korea. So, I don't think there's much there that Putin can really do. We just - he says these things to deter us, not because he can do much.",

At least one person has died, and hundreds of thousands of people are without power. The worst of the storm is expected to hit parts of northern California on Thursday with a rare level four risk of excessive rainfall.All right, Comcast expected to announce today that it will spin off the majority of its cable properties, including MSNBC and CNBC. Sources tell us under the new arrangement Comcast is expected to keep NBC, its Peacock streaming service, NBC Sports and Universal theme parks, among other properties. \"The Wall Street Journal\" first reported these major spin off plans. All right, Jay Leno, man, look at that. He is recovering after a fall that left him with a broken wrist, a missing fingernail, severe bruises - you can see them there on his face - and a patch over his left eye, which was swollen shut. The former \"Tonight Show\" host told reporters he was walking to a restaurant and decided to take a shortcut down a steep hill when he took a tumble. Leno saying, quote, he hit a bunch of rocks on the way down, but that it isn't a big deal. Although that looks like a big deal. He performed his comedy show, by the way, though, just three hours later. And this morning, a rural village in Italy selling homes to Americans for just a dollar. We've seen this before. Ollolai, a village on the island of Sardinia, is looking to boost its population. That's why they're offering these great deals. The village launched a website writing, \"looking to embrace a more balanced lifestyle while securing new opportunities? It is a time to start building your European escape in the stunning paradise of Sardinia.\" The village mayor told CNN that he is convinced Americans are the best people to help revive his community. Kate, I got to go. I got to go buy a building for a dollar. I'll see you later. Bye.",

So, the CFO of Walmart, David Riley, telling CNBC just yesterday that, quote, \"our model is everyday low prices. But there will probably be cases where prices will go up for consumers.\" Not something that consumers want to hear, especially when they're trying to shop deals at Walmart.
