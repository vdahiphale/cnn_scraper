A top lieutenant also found guilty, a major win for the Justice Department tonight.Also breaking this hour, Trump's former senior advisor Steve Miller testified today for a federal grand jury in the January 6th investigation. That brand-new reporting is next. And China, now going through extreme lengths to silence and punish protesters, seizing phones, and leveling a new warning. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, guilty. The leader of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers, and one of his top lieutenants have been both found guilty of seditious conspiracy. It is the most serious charge brought so far in any of the cases involving the January 6th attack. And it's for their role in the plot to prevent President Biden from taking office, all coming to a head on January 6th. It is a major win for the U.S. Justice Department, which accused Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, and associate Kelly Meggs, of plotting to use force to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. They each face up to 20 years in prison now, and three other Oath Keepers who were also on trial were now found not guilty of seditious conspiracy, but all five were also convicted of obstructing the peaceful transfer of power. There is a lot to this. The split verdicts, coming after nearly a two month trial, a trial in which the defendants claimed that they were fighting on behalf of then-President Trump. Here is Stewart Rhodes from December of 2020. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEWART RHODES, OATH KEEPERS LEADER:  If he does not do it now, or his commander in chief, we are going to have to do it ourselves later. A much more desperate, much more bloody war. Let's get it on now, while he is still the commander in chief. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, further, because, Kate, there are two more seditious conspiracy trial to go. The DOJ, really looking for this boost to carry them through these next few months of seditious conspiracy trials.Stewart Rhodes' conviction is so significant for a list of reasons, but the most important thing here, Kate, is that the Department of Justice had been trying to bring forward this case against him that he was the archetype -- architect of a plot that spanned many weeks, and culminated on January 6th. The plot was to use force to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As you mentioned, Rhodes never went into the building, but what the DOJ presented were volumes and volumes of Rhodes' own words prior to January 6th, and even afterward, that they said proved that there was a specific plan to overturn the results of the election by force. Here's another quote from him. He said after January 6th, after the riot, if he's not going to do the right thing, and him being former President Trump, if he's just going to let himself be removed illegally, then we should have brought rifles. We could've fixed it right then and there, and hang f'ing Pelosi from the lamppost. That's just a snippet of volumes and volumes of things that he said that were then used against him in court. And the message here is that words matter. Words equate to actions here, there was a plot, and the jury bought that narrative from the DOJ and sealing the deal for the seditious conspiracy charge against him. Meanwhile, Kate, his attorneys say that they do plan to appeal, but they think that they got a fair trial. Back to you.",

The reason that investigation is so interested in Mark Meadows is that he was privy to a call between the then- President Donald Trump and Secretary of State in Georgia, pressuring to find votes.He also was in meetings in December of 2020. And so he became a person that they really have wanted to get insight into. Now, one of the things that when you step back from this and try to look at the big import here is Georgia, this investigation is one of the tips of the spear. There are many investigations going on.

This is a rejection of the idea that this was not organized, that this was spontaneous, that this was not serious, that this was not violent.It was a rejection by a jury, our most basic bulwark of liberty, of democracy. Juries are not stupid. Juries can see through B.S., and this jury was very carefully. More practically, Kate, you could see theoretically people flip. I've seen plenty of times when someone has said let me go to trial, see what happens. Then when you're looking down the barrel of a 20-year sentence, that can change incentives a little bit. So, we don't know if that may happen. But if so, we'll see what dominoes may fall. But I think anyone around this should be concerned about that.",

Then Stephen Miller says, and he says to the committee, they spoke to Eric Herschmann, one of the lawyers, who said, get that stuff out of the speech. And then after Trump has a confrontation with Pence, even more of it comes in. So I'm sure he must have had some conversation with Trump over those25 minutes plus to say, what are you trying to get at? What are you trying to produce here? And we know that he said that to the committee. There's a very good chance he claimed executive privilege, like others did. But it sounds like the wall of executive privilege has fallen apart when it comes to the grand jury, and the fact that he's been testifying as a senior aide to the president I think is very significant in terms of the type of evidence he can give.",

Mark Meadows essentially brushed off the congressional subpoena. He was never even charged with contempt. He had no consequences. Well, he learned today from the South Carolina Supreme Court unanimously, you cannot brush off a grand jury subpoena. And now, he will have to go down to Atlanta into Georgia and testify under oath in front of that grand jury, and the D.A. is going to have some really crucial questions to ask him.

So, going beyond that is just -- the media is trying to pick fights between Republicans, and even when Kevin does the right thing, it's sort of unacceptable to the media because they are only happy if Kevin and other Republicans are getting into a fight with one another. It's one of the reasons why he is such an effective leader because he doesn't do that and that's why his party has rallied behind him.",

Chris, this is not clearly the first controversy that Herschel Walker has been dealing with since launching his campaign for Senate. This is a new problem. This new problem, how does it stack up against all of the others? CHRIS CILLIZZA, CNN POLITICS REPORTER &amp; EDITOR-AT-LARGE:  Well, let me -- let me first say, Kate, that clip you played where Herschel Walker says I lived in Georgia my whole life is just not true. He lived in Texas. He moved to Georgia to run for the Senate, which is fine, but just to do a little bit of a fact-check there. On the one hand, as you mentioned, walker has been through a lot in terms of allegations about paying for abortions, which he denied. The campaign has been hit with a lot throughout the campaign. And he's still standing. And there's value in that politically speaking. On the other hand, we are seven days away from the runoff. And this is a very close race. So, when you talk about those things, Herschel Walker would rather not be talking about his residency issues tonight and tomorrow on the campaign trail. So, little things can make a big difference when we're talking about a really close race with really tight margins.",

Generally speaking, and I think about where you're from and how you talk about where you're from matters. Let me take two examples. One, Hillary Clinton who won. She went on, if you remember, almost before she announced her candidacy but right before she went on a long tour of every county of New York, essentially as a way to combat the idea that she was just flying in, she's from New York City, and she wanted to be elected. The other extreme just happened, Mehmet Oz. He was never able to prove that he was authentically from Pennsylvania. John Fetterman's campaign did a really good job of making it seem as though Oz would a New Jersey guy who just happened to be in Pennsylvania because there was an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania.

The Senate passing what is called the Respect for Marriage Act, solidifying protections for same-sex marriage at the federal level.It comes after the Supreme Court overturned the right for abortion this summer, fueling concerns that same-sex marriage would be next. Twelve Senate Republicans voted with all the Democrats on this tonight. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer saying it would pass as soon as Tuesday next week. And President Biden saying he will promptly and proudly sign the bill into law once it reaches his desk. Joining me right now is Democratic Congressman David Cicilline from Rhode Island. He's also the chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. Congressman, thanks for coming in. You've been a driving force behind this effort since the summer. This -- this is expected to pass the House as we know, next week, headed to the president's desk. What does it mean to you? REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI):  Well, this is a really important victory for the LGBTQ+ community. You know, we had a strong bipartisan vote in the House. There was a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate. It will have to come back to the House. But it means for thousands and thousands of LGBTQ people who are married, that their marriages will be respected under the law. This is an important step in our fight for full equality in this country. And I think, you know, it's not a controversial issue anymore. People understand that marriage should be available to everyone. That you should be able to marry whomever you love. The Senate vote is a strong affirmation of that. So this is real progress for our country, for our community. And I look forward to being at the bill signing with President Biden and finally, putting there into law.",

So, of course, I think this Respect for Marriage Act, while it is fantastic in that it protects the recognition of marriage in all 50 states. The fact it would once again allow states to deny couples like John and me the right to get a marriage license in their home state just is wrong. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
