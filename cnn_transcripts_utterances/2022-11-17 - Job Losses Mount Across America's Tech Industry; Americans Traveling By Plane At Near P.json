The investigation found that \"Social media companies have failed to meaningfully address the growing presence of extremism on their platforms. The business models are based on maximizing user engagement, growth, and profits, which incentivizes increasingly extreme content.\" Joining us now is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. She was the target of a terror plot to kidnap her in 2020. She also won reelection last week, defeating her Trump-backed opponent Tudor Dixon by double- digits in one of the nation's most important battleground states. Governor, thank you, and congratulations on your win. We're really glad that you could join us this morning. And I want to talk to you about this and I -- because I know this can be very personal to talk about these issues, especially if you've been a target of one of these -- you know, of one of these plots. Let's start with the warning over this domestic extremism. Homeland Security Sec. Mayorkas says that domestic violence extremism poses the most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat to the country right now. What needs to be done? GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI) (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, first of all, congratulations on the show. I'm glad to be with you. And I think our overwhelming victory last week tells you that the public doesn't want extremism. They want people who are going to make their lives better and solve problems. Extremism doesn't help people pay the bills. What does is a good-paying job and a governor who is going to solve problems. All that being said, this rise in extremism is dangerous. My opponent from last week was a conspiracy theorist and election denier who stoked political violence and sought to undermine our confidence in our institutions. That represents the biggest danger to our democracy. Threats against fellow Americans are not acceptable, whether they are aimed at a Democratic governor or a Republican congressperson like Fred Upton or Peter Meijer here in Michigan. We have got to take a stand against this. And I do think that social media plays a big role in it and I'm hoping Congress will tackle this.",

And a family that's lost a child to gun violence is -- there's nothing you can do to make that better.What we can do, though, is enact common-sense proven policies that will keep guns out of the hands of people that pose a threat.
