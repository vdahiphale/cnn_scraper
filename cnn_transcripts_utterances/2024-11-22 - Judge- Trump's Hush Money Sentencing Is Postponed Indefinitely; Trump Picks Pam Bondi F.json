We're going to look at what this means for a case that Trump wants to see dismissed.And Matt Gaetz out, Pam Bondi in. But will an unforced error by President-elect Trump haunt him in the future? We're going to talk about that. The inauguration is just 59 days away. And then later, Hollywood is hoping that have a very, quote, glicked weekend. I just found out what that word meant. I -- I was late to the party on this. With these two blockbusters hitting theaters, can the new movies recapture the old magic of Barbenheimer at the box office? Hello, everyone. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. Happy Friday to you. You are in the CNN Newsroom. And we begin with breaking news. A New York judge has granted Donald Trump's request to file a motion to dismiss his hush money case and his sentencing is now indefinitely postponed. So let's get right to Kara Scannell. What does this mean for Trump's case, Kara?",

      "sentences": "Well, Pam, this is widely expected because both Trump's team and the prosecutors had signaled to the judge that they were ready to litigate this further, right? Trump's lawyers had asked for permission to file a motion to dismiss the case because Trump is now President-elect and heading into the White House.And prosecutors said that they wanted to go that course, too. They wanted to fight to uphold the conviction. And so they presented this to the judge earlier in the week in both sides saying that, you know, they acknowledge that Trump sentencing has to be postponed in this case because as prosecutors noted, they expect there to be many appeals here. So this was expected. The judge is now officially postponing Trump's sentencing. No future date has been set, so it is indefinitely. And he set out a briefing schedule for them to get these legal arguments underway. So he's saying that Trump's team needs to file their motion to dismiss by December 9th. Prosecutors will have one week to file their response and then the judge will take this under consideration. This also means that he is not issuing his decision on presidential immunity at this moment, saying that is also on hold until after he gets all of these legal briefs. So this is the first step in what will be the next stage of this case as they continue to litigate whether this conviction stands. Pam?",

Harry, what do you think about this? Is this a surprise with all the questions about the case after Trump won the election, did Merchan have a choice here, frankly?HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Oh, he had a choice. But as Kara says, it's not a surprise in that both parties asked for it. But technically, whether to do his motion to dismiss and whether to sentence him are separate. And you could have just gone ahead with the sentencing and just kept them separate. But this is a nod to what everyone has agreed are the exceptional circumstances of a felon, of a criminal convict who's about to take the White House. And obviously, Merchan is thinking, if I do grant this whole motion to dismiss, which is based on immunity and the supposed constitutional prohibition on doing anything criminal with a president who's in the White House, then everything goes away and I don't have to sentence. One thing that's important to note, this is not a suggestion by Merchan that, oh, we'll put this off for four years. If he doesn't dismiss, then he will go forward with the sentencing, although not immediately, because as Kara points out, there will be these series of appeals, but it's not the same as putting it in the ether forever.",

December 9th, the DA responds, and then Merchan decides. If he decides I'm not dismissing, appeals will start there, he would be technically able to continue with sentencing. Or he might, bowing to practicality, wait until those appeals run their course. And they could take a while.Then when they do, if he's affirmed, big if, because this could go all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, then 2025 or something, we're back to sentencing when everyone hardly remembers what this whole case was about. But it's not the same as saying the whole thing is vaporized, as the two federal cases will be, unless, unless Merchan grants this motion to dismiss based on immunity grounds, which would be an extension of what the Supreme Court did last year.",

Trump breaking the news shortly after his former pick, Matt Gaetz, made news of his own by withdrawing his name from consideration for the job. Gaetz said his nomination had become a distraction. Our Kristen Holmes joins us now. So this was really a quick pivot for Trump after it became clear Gaetz just didn't have the votes. Tell us more on how this unfolded behind the scenes, Kristen.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Pamela. And one thing to keep in mind here, it's not that surprising that Donald Trump essentially dropped everything. We know there's still some big names out there that he hasn't put into place in terms of secretaries, treasury, for example. But we know that Donald Trump believes that attorney general is one of, if not the most important job in his Cabinet. He wants to completely redo the Department of Justice.So when it became clear that Matt Gaetz wasn't viable, it's no surprise that he spent the next several hours choosing someone who he believed would be confirmable. So just to give a little bit of the timeline, what we are told is that last, yesterday morning, Donald Trump called Matt Gaetz and told him that he didn't have the votes. Now, these sources insist that Donald Trump let Matt Gaetz come to his own decision on whether or not he was going to withdraw his name, that he didn't put the screws to him, but that Gaetz obviously quickly came to the conclusion that he would withdraw his name.\\ Now, just within hours of that, Pam Bondi's name started circulating. Donald Trump met with her one-on-one, the same kind of interviews he's been doing with all of these potential candidates at Mar-a-Lago and then later offered her the job. Formally, within six hours of Matt Gaetz withdrawing his name, Pam Bondi was named the next nominee for Attorney General. And I can tell you from speaking to Republicans, and I know you've been speaking to them as well, they are relieved with Pam Bondi. They believe she is someone who is confirmable. I heard from one person she's a solid pick. Another person saying she has much higher chances than Matt Gaetz. There was a lot of really concern among transition team, among Trump allies as to how much political capital he was going to use to try to push Matt Gaetz through. Clearly, Donald Trump came to some conclusion on his own by picking up the phone and calling Gaetz to tell him he didn't have the votes. And we are -- we do understand that there had been some conversations where people had essentially told him, Donald Trump, that this could hurt other nominations down the road because of the fact that he would have to expend so much to get Matt Gaetz through that door. So it is not surprising that this is the way that it played out, but also a lot of relief from Republicans that now this is someone that they believe is confirmable.",
