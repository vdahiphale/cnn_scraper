From early afternoon, it has been a steady rise throughout the course of the day. The markets and the main events that we're covering from the UN Secretary -- the UN Security Council is set to vote on a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The Secretary-General is warning that humanitarian support system in Gaza may collapse. Hiring in the US remains robust, and this is in despite a slowing economy. So now, what does it mean for interest rates? And it may be the toughest breakup you will ever have. Tonight, reading for succeeding, how to reset, control-alt-delete, change or improve your relationship with your cell phone. Live from London tonight, on Friday, December the 8th, I am Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight with Israel stepping up its offensive in Gaza. While in New York, the United Nations is voting on a resolution calling for a ceasefire. On the military side, the IDF says it struck about 450 targets over the last 24 hours. That's the highest number since the end of the truce a week ago. An Israeli flag has been raised in Palestine Square in Gaza City. A symbolic victory of the Hamas militants were seen in the area following Israel saying it took control of northern Gaza. On the diplomatic front, we go to the United Nations. There, the Security Council is expected to meet where they will be discussing a ceasefire resolution. It follows the Secretary-General invoking a rarely used clause to bring the issue direct to the Security Council. Meanwhile, the head of the UN's aid agency in Gaza says its operation is on the verge of collapse. The UN Sec-Gen spoke to the Security Council about the conditions. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UN SECRETARY-GENERAL: I deeply regret to inform the council that, under current conditions on the ground, the fulfillment of this mandate has become impossible. The conditions for the effective delivery of humanitarian aid no longer exists. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He said they have taken some important steps, but that there is a gap between the intent and the reality there on the ground.

Now, it's also one of the world's greatest distractions. Don't even get me started on my screen time, there you are. If you were quick enough, you've probably screenshot it. Eight hours 55 minutes a day, up 30 percent from last week that's because I was traveling and therefore using it more. That's my excuse and I'm sticking to it.

We need to know whoare the Andean Bears, what they are eating, how much space do they need. Andean Bears play a crucial role in the regeneration of the forest because they help to disperse many seed species. And also, because they are big mammals, they are very good tree climbers. So when they climb to the trees, they tend to break the branches in order to get the food. So this make gaps and the gaps allow the light to get into the understory and thus help to wake up many seed species that are sleeping.

QUEST (voice over): Catherine Price says our lives are what we pay attention to. When you grab your device, ask yourself where you plan to focus your attention. This makes your phone use intentional, cutting down on the mindless or random scrolling. Secondly, when the urge to check your phone comes, Catherine Price believes finding alternatives is essential. Must you check your phone right now? Or are you reaching for it out of a habit or trying to get a fix? Finally, Price recommends taking a pause before checking your device. We reach for our phones 144 times a day. Before doing so, take a breath and acknowledge that urge to check it.",

So they have every motivation in the world to get us to spend more attention and time on their apps. And they do that by copying techniques that they got straight from slot machines, which are why they're considered to be the most addictive machines ever to have been invented. And what they do is they slot machines hook us by triggering the release of dopamine, this chemical that gets us to repeat behaviors. And our dopamine systems are essential to the survival of our species because dopamine helps us remember to eat and to reproduce. But it's a totally nondiscriminatory system, the dopamine system does not care if it's a habit you want to pursue or need. Or if it's a waste of time or destructive. That means that if you want to create a product that will hook people, all you need to do is make dopamine triggers into the products design. And that's going to reinforce the idea that doing it is worth doing again and again. So, all the problematic apps, social media, shopping, games, news, all of those have different forms of dopamine triggers baked in. in the case of those two categories, I would say novelty and unpredictability are two big figures.",
