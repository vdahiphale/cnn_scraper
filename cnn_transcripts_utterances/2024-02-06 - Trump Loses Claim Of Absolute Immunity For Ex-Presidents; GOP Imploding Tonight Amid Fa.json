And tonight sources say there is one court that Donald Trump doesn't want to turn into a campaign circus. That's the Supreme Court. Sources are telling CNN that the former president plans now to avoid the room where it happens when the justices hear arguments about whether his name belongs on the ballots in November. Now, Trump may want to stay out of the legal spotlight, but he cannot avoid the harsh glare of yet another potentially crippling legal loss. Just today, an appeals court asked and answered in airtight detail a question with historic implications. Are presidents immune from prosecution? The D.C. Circuit answered it unanimously, no. The three-judge panel took 57 pages to spell out all of the ways that the former president's lawyers failed to convince them that crimes are not crimes just because you're the leader of the free world. And they often turned the former president's words against him. The decision drips with derision for Trump's legal theories. They quote, it would collapse our system of separated power and set up, quote, a striking paradox by making presidents who are entrusted with executing the law the sole officer capable of defying those laws with impunity. And joining me now for his reaction to this historic finding is John Yoo, the former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general in the Bush administration and a professor at law at U.C. Berkeley. John, what's your reaction to this really decisive decision by the appellate court here? JOHN YOO, FORMER BUSH U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL: I hope President Trump and his lawyers take away the lesson that this appeal has no chance. This is, as you said, Abby, a watertight opinion. I was reading it carefully today. It is a very thorough and very good opinion. It goes through in great detail, not just the text of the Constitution, the policy arguments, the views of the founders, the federal's papers. And I think it does a pretty good job of rejecting the idea that a president, not just President Trump, but every president, including the current president, President Biden, do not have some kind of lifetime immunity from federal criminal prosecution. I think it's a real blow to President Trump's efforts. But I don't think, and I think most legal observers would agree, I don't think that this argument had much chance. I think most of the court's precedents were against President Trump. I don't think that there's a lot of support for this kind of claim that a president has criminal immunity. He's going to have to challenge Jack Smith's prosecution for January 6th on some other kind of grounds in this one.",

They wrote, the former President Trump's alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were, if proven, an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government.He allegedly injected himself into a process in which the president has no role, the counting and certifying of the Electoral College votes, thereby undermining constitutionally established procedures and also the will of the Congress. It was notable to me, John, that the judges here, they were clear that they weren't making a determination about his guilt or his innocence, but they did put a lot of weight on just the seriousness of these allegations against him. But what do you think that means for the legal fight ahead against this case that the federal government is bringing against him?",

And as you say, Abby, now that this immunity claim has been rejected, he can go to the Supreme Court.He might be able to delay his criminal trial maybe another three or four months pressing this immunity case all the way to the Supreme Court. [22:05:00] But I think once that claim is rejected finally by the justices, then the criminal trial can go forward. He's got all the defenses that any American you or me have when we are put on trial. He has the right to due process. He writes to Miranda hearings, reasonable search and seizure, counsel, so on. Jury, he has the right to a jury of his peers to, decide on whether there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt, whether he committed any of these crimes. And he's going to ultimately claim, I think, that these charges don't fit what happened on January 6th or that he never did anything on January 6th other than give a speech. He still has all of that time, all of the foray (ph) in the federal district court to make these claims, and Jack Smith will now have the opportunity to bring out all the evidence that he says he has out into the public form. And a jury's going to see it and you and me and all the other Americans are going to see it and we can make our decision.",

And one of the main principles of that is no one is above the law. That's what we're all talking about. That's what John Yoo was talking about.But it's also -- and especially the president, isn't above the law, the former president. Because he's the person who, in the Constitution, he or she is delegated with the duty to ensure that the laws are faithfully followed. So, you would be the last person that we would say is immune. And they really do such a good job of eradicating Trump's favorite argument that his team put out even today about the -- you know, this is going to open, this slippery slope, this floodgates of criminal prosecutions by any -- against any former president by the opposing political party. And they basically really eradicate that, again, in such a good way, both using common sense and history to say, but this hasn't happened before because other presidents haven't engaged in this kind of conduct. And even if there's some chance at that, maybe that's not such a bad thing. Maybe we should use the criminal law as a deterrence.",

It stands on its own times ten, as we've all been discussing.Does that mean they won't take it? I cannot safely sit here and say that. I don't think they need to. I hope that they don't for a lot of reasons. And, again, I think the Court of Appeals, you know, we all myself included, you know, handwringing why is this taking so long. But it actually is a remarkably fast time for a Court of Appeals to have such a thorough airtight decision. And, remember, the Supreme Court did not -- Jack Smith tried to get them to take it and they didn't. And that is in part to give the Court of Appeals a chance. So, they have an opinion to rely on either to say, we don't need to take this or to say, okay, affirmed. I mean, they can do that. They can. So, there are a bunch of different routes here. And again, the Court of Appeals did also put in this mechanism by which Trump can't do the, I'm going to seek en banc and do that, and then go to the -- they're trying to keep things moving.",

Julia, thanks for staying up for us. What is in it for Putin to do this interview with Tucker Carlson, both from an American audience perspective and also, of course, his audience back home in Russia? JULIA IOFFE, FOUNDING PARTNER AND WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"PUCK\": Abby, thank you so much for calling out so many of Tucker Carlson's lies. There are so many of them in that four and a half minute video that it's hard to get at all of them, but I'm glad you dismantled some of the most important ones. But I think what's really shocking is the way he kind of just walks right into Moscow and presents himself on a silver platter to the Kremlin, doing the Kremlin's job of misinforming, disinforming the American population. Putin, from the very beginning of this war, has angled to basically create a bridge to American right-wingers and conservatives like Tucker Carlson, saying that he's fighting gender-neutral bathrooms in Ukraine, saying that he's fighting queer gender roles in Ukraine, basically signaling to them that there's an ideological affinity and that I'm your guy. And in fact, if you recall shortly before Putin invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, Tucker Carlson went on his show on Fox News and said, hey, why are we allying ourselves with Ukraine when we should be the allies of Putin? We have the same ideas as him and he should be our friend.",

He likes Vladimir Putin and he has told them to hold off funding for Ukraine, that there should be no more money for Ukraine. So, all of that disinformation, all of that buttering up of the American right wing and of Donald Trump and people close to him has really paid off handsomely for Vladimir Putin because Ukrainian troops are, right now as we speak, running out of ammunition, running out of men in the middle of a horrible, deadly winter.",

And yet, Republicans, they also don't want to hold themselves accountable for a border bill that is stuck now on a road to nowhere. And joining me now is Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas and also with us Republican Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis of New York. Congressman and Congresswoman, both of you, thanks for joining us tonight and thanks for joining us together from Capitol Hill. Congresswoman, I want to start with you. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is calling this bill that's being considered right now the most restrictive migrant legislation in decades. My question to you is, do you support it? NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R-NY): If you're talking about the Senate bill, I don't support that bill as is. I think there are some good components to it. I think that our Border Security Act, which we passed in May, is much better and stronger because it requires the President to reinstate the Remain in Mexico clause. It also requires that he take action to end catch and release, and those are the two biggest issues that we're facing at our border.",

And you've got to remember, every individual that crosses through that southern border is paying the drug cartels to be smuggled in.The only individuals that should be coming to our border are Canadians and Mexicans. Everyone else should be going to the next safe country and then applying for asylum there. That would be the safest thing for everyone involved, including the migrants. Now, as I said, there are some components that I do support, certainly increasing standards for asylum and then expediting those cases so people can know either they qualify or they don't. If they qualify they get work authorization and if they don't they get deported. I think that's really important. And also, increasing visas, employer sponsored visas, family sponsored visas, to meet our labor shortage and economic needs here in the United States, incredibly important and we can agree on that, as well. But it is not the only bill because we passed the House Board of Security Act in May. Chuck Schumer won't bring that bill up for a vote either. So, what I would say is, we pass our bill, let the Senate, if they're going to move forward, and pass their bill, if that's what their priorities are, and then we can reconcile the differences.

We do agree. We just got to figure out what are those points, catch a release, and we got to put funding into the appropriations. I will say this, that we got to put funding because you can't say, President, just stop, close the border, because if we don't have the beds to hold people, then they're going to be released. We don't have enough beds. We don't have enough airplanes to deport people. We don't have enough judges -- immigration judges. We don't have enough asylum officers at the border.
