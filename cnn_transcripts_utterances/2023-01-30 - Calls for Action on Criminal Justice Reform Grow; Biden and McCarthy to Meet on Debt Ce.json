It's part of a major initiative of the Brazil's new government and President Lula da Silva, who has promised to undo some damage caused under his predecessor's leadership. CNN's Rafael Romo reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They move slowly through the jungle. Their weapons are cocked and loaded. It doesn't take long becore they find what they're looking for. Illegal logging has been a challenge in Brazil for decades, but it's gotten worse, expert say, during the last four years when President Jair Bolsonaro was in power. The commander in charge of the unit conducting raid said the previous government only carried about solving emergency situations but lacked strategic planning to combat deforestation. His team later makes an arrest. In his first speech after taking office on January 1, current President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva said one of his government's goal is to reach zero deforestation in the Amazon, adding that Brazil doesn't need to get rid of trees to remain an agricultural powerhouse. After a series of massive wildfires in the Amazon in august of 2019, then President Bolsonaro said his government had zero tolerance not only for crime in general but also for environmental issues. BRIAN WINTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AMERICAS QUARTERLY:  But that wasn't the case under Bolosnaro during his four years in power. We saw deforestation decrease by 40 percent during that time. And so, the challenge for Lula here is going to be enormous. ROMO (on-camera):  Between 2019 and 2022, the four years he was president, Brazil lost more than 45,000 square kilometers of forest according to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research or INPE. By comparison, when Lula was first empowered between 2002 and 2010, deforestation shrunk by 65 percent.",
