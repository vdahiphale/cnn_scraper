I'm Fredricka Whitfield and we start this hour with breaking news.A statement from the US National Security Council, just a short time ago saying the strike in the Golan Heights that killed 12 children was carried out by the militant group, Hezbollah and says, it should be universally condemned. Also, new this hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is meeting with senior members of his government as they weigh their next steps. Israel is warning Hezbollah will pay the price for the attack. Israeli warplanes have already struck the Iran-backed group, deep inside Lebanon and the incident is fueling fears of an all-out war on Israel's northern border. It all comes as CIA Director Bill Burns is in Rome for a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks. We've got full coverage for you, Jeremy Diamond is in the Golan Heights; Ben Wedeman is in Lebanon and Barbie Latza Nadeau in Rome. Jeremy, you first. How is Israel responding or preparing for a response that is.",

These are the senior members of his governing coalition who are working through how the Israeli response will be calibrated. And that of course is the critical question at this hour, the Israeli prime minister was in Washington when this attack happened.He early'ed up his departure from there by a couple of hours, landed back in Israel today. And quickly went into security consultations and now sitting down with that security Cabinet to determine how forceful an Israeli response will be. What he has made clear though, is that there will be a response to what the Israeli government has described as a Hezbollah rocket attack that happened right behind me. As you can see, this crater where there are now wreathes being laid right on top of it. This rocket attack happened at yesterday, around 6:00 PM and it was deadly and devastating, 12 children killed in this rocket strike yesterday. Dozens more injured, several of those still in the hospital at this hour. And I am currently in a community, Majdal Shams. It is a small community of Syrian Druze who are just absolutely rocked by this tragedy. Throughout the day, there has been a steady stream of mourners first at the funeral procession as the caskets were taken through the community to their final resting place. We then met with the father of one of the little girls, 11-year-old, Alma (ph) who was killed in this strike. He is still working through how to exactly process the grief that he is now dealing with. But there is no question that this is a community that has been forever changed by this attack and also a community that is asking for a response and waiting to see exactly what that will be -- Fred.",

Of course, AKA, young voters and celebrities excited about her. So how does she capitalize further in the next week before she names her running mate? RENEE GRAHAM, ASSOCIATE EDITOR AND COLUMNIST, \"THE BOSTON GLOBE\": I think one important thing she needs to continue to do is double down on the issues and the policies that are not only important to her, but important to the Democratic Party. So when we're talking about reproductive rights and also the threat that the loss of Roe v. Wade means to other rights and other things that are considered settled law because she can't just run on the momentum of the moment, she has to then start to concretize -- to make concrete the idea she has about how she moves this country forward. If she is trying to create this contrast between herself and Donald Trump, everything Trump is talking about is about dragging the country back into a dark and dangerous time. She needs to bring this country back to the light and show them how she is going to get them there. It is an interesting thing because Democrats generally are the party of fretting and they've been fretting throughout this entire year. They're not doing that anymore. They have this momentum, but they now need to take that and make sure that will become votes in November.",

It could certainly alienated those same voters going after someone's race and gender over concrete policy, I think we are learning now is sort of a losing strategy when voters just care a lot more these days about what's right in front of them and the kitchen table, issues that matter the most where on the Democratic side, there is a lot of motivation to power this woman, this first to the White House.",

So I really do think that the important thing for them to do is to have someone who continues to look balanced on the ticket, but also pushes this idea of the youth of the ticket, of the next generation of Democrats. So, there is always the problem with Biden for a lot of people was it felt like the party was stuck in place When she picks her VP running mate, then it is going to look a lot like what they want the party to look like going forward and you have that almost regardless of who she picks, but especially when you're talking about people like Andy Beshear who is the governor of Kentucky, or Josh Shapiro in Pennsylvania, or even Gretchen Whitmer.

So pre-Biden dropping out, we had Trump up by two, well within the margin of error in our national average of polling. Now, what do we have? We have Trump up by one. But here is the key difference. Why did Democrats make that change from Biden to Harris? Because at the same time that Trump was up two over Harris in the polling, he was up by -- get this -- six points over Joe Biden. So, the real change that we've seen over the last week with that change from Biden to Harris is the change in the race in which we had a clear leader in Donald Trump, to erase that right now, it is just way too close to call nationally with Trump only ahead by a single point.",

There is so much that can change.The average compared to where we normally end up, six points, the polls on average change from six points from now and the final margin and the biggest recent shift in memory, in 1988, there was a 26-point shift. Michael Dukakis was so far and ahead in the polls at this point. And of course, George HW Bush easily won that election. And in this race, where so much has happened over the last month, don't be surprised if so much more happens. It's truly making me exhausted.

We've been going on now for 10 months with the Israelis and the Palestinians, the Hamas playing the mediators and it's time for the mediators to say no more.

We are getting things done in the United Nations. And I would really take issue with comparing what is happening in Israel-Gaza with what is happening in Ukraine. Russia attacked its neighbor. Russia, a permanent member of the Security Council has broken every tenant of the UN Charter as a permanent member of the Security Council. It was an unprovoked attack that Russia made on Ukraine. And so, there is really no comparison between the two. But in the meantime, we continue to isolate Russia in the Security Council, in the UN system broadly because of their actions in Ukraine and we will continue to isolate them. We will continue to support Ukraine and we will continue to highlight what is happening in Ukraine. So that the Russians are not allowed to sweep it under the carpet.",
