All the supply chain stuff has worked itself out long ago. They are just ripping people off every day. And the Biden administration did put together a task force of the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to look into it. But to your point earlier, Biden never felt comfortable talking about the fact that he was going after this price gouging. Kamala feels comfortable. And, you know, you talk about her strength, you talk about this kind of politics of joy. She's also tough. And she knows that Americans are getting ripped off.

Harris' plan sounds great, but it's kind of like crack. It's going to feel good for a little bit, but it's still going to result in high inflation in all of these issues that we have right now with the economy.And so, you know, I lean towards, you know, Trump's communist leanings on his framing, but like a lot of these populist ideas, they end up in a big circle where far left and far right end up meeting in the middle, so it's a little bit of both.",

The governor is joining us right now. Governor, thanks so much for joining us.This is some of what Vice President Harris proposed today, a ban on price gouging for groceries and food, a $25,000 subsidy for first time homebuyers and expanding the child tax credit. Governor, is it a wise move from the Harris campaign to embrace these sort of economic populism ideas? And do you worry about The unintended consequences? GOV. ROY COOPER (D-NC):  It's absolutely a good idea. And, in fact, Wolf, the vice president deserves some credit for the fact that the United States has the strongest economy in the world. Unemployment is low, the stock market is high, record job growth, inflation is now cooling. She also gets credit for the generational investments that this administration has made to connect people to high speed internet and to repair our infrastructure and to lower prescription drug prices. But she is well aware that everyday families are paying too much for both groceries and for housing and that they're frustrated with the cost of living. I think this is her effort to move forward with the plan here. And instead of Donald Trump's tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, we're going to provide some tax credits, bringing back the very popular child tax credit, because diapers cost money and food cost money. And I think this price gouging idea, for the fact that it can serve as a real deterrent for high prices, we've seen price gouging laws work during disasters. She and I both served as attorney general. We find that when we have these laws in place, companies are afraid to charge excessively high prices. So, you can be a capitalist and still work to prevent people from getting ripped off. I think those were common sense proposals that she made today.",

And what some of those new rules said was that school districts should not be able to discriminate on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy-related conditions, sexual orientation, gender identity, so topics that are much discussed in politics and have caused great divides across the country.What happened then is several conservative-leaning states sued wanting to stop the Biden administration from putting this rule in place, and then courts agreed with them. What the Supreme Court is doing today is they're saying, yes, we're not going to let the Justice Department go forward or the Biden administration go forward with implementing this rule that they want to while this is still being worked out in the lower courts. The court is making a decision that's very legal here, but it was a split decision by the Supreme Court, 5-4. There were four justices writing in dissent today, Justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson in the liberal wing of the court and Justice Gorsuch. And what they're saying is that because of what the Supreme Court is doing here is depriving schools of guidance, depriving people of the ability to file complaints and have protections if they file complaints related to sex discrimination. And so this case is just one of many that is thrusting the Supreme Court right into the middle of the politics around gender and the language around sex, sex discrimination and sexual identity in this country. But it is a moment where the conservative-leaning states that don't want the Biden administration to define things more where they are getting what they want, and they're not allowing things to move forward.

And I think one of the things that really shows that is the fact that the Qatari prime minister on the two days and talks took place, each of those days, then had a phone conversation afterwards with the foreign minister, the acting foreign minister of Iran, to brief the Iranians on the progress that the talks were making. Now, it's quite interesting because the foreign minister of Iran, he came out tonight with a statement where he said that he had that phone call with the prime minister of Qatar, but he said that he had warned the Qataris of what he called deceit on the part of the Israelis, potentially. And the Iranians also are saying that they do not view the United States as an objective mediator in all this, but rather, as they put it, an accomplice to the Israelis. So, the Iranians, obviously, still a lot of bad blood that is there, and after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, of course, here in Tehran on July 31st, the Iranians did vow that there would be strong retaliation. One of the interesting things that you see here on the ground in Tehran when you're here is that there's actually posters that have been put up in public places with pictures of Ismail Haniyeh and a writing that says, revenging him is our duty. Now, the Iranians have not exactly said what that revenge is going to look like and certainly haven't said when that could take place.
