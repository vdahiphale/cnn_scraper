      "sentences": "Donald Trump bailed out in the civil fraud case and hit with a new gag order in the criminal case. But is it really out of the frying pan and into the fire for Trump? Plus, how the abortion law that Ron DeSantis signed could now hurt Trump come November. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, think back. Remember when we asked you who wants to bail out a billionaire? Well, tonight, we got our answer. Thanks for the dramatic music, everyone. Donald Trump posted the $175 million bond in the New York civil fraud case. Well, not him exactly, but an insurance company did it, and they're providing that and promising to pay. Let's just call it his knight in shining armor because the name, Knight Specialty Insurance. Remember, the original judgment was supposed to be more than $450 million. Plus, you got to add the interest. But Trump got it reduced. Not the actual judgment, but the bond he had to pay to appeal. And he had until Thursday to pay up. So, all the talk of the attorney general in New York, Letitia James, seizing potentially his assets, sits on ice for a little while now while Trump appeals the actual ruling. Now, again, the ruling was that Trump lied for years about his finances and overvalued his assets to secure favorable loan terms. Now, in a moment, we're going to get a reaction from businessman Kevin O'Leary on this lifeline that Trump just got. But first, we got to talk about what happened in the criminal case in New York. That's the hush money one. Yeah, I know, you got to have a flow chart to keep up with all these trials. I get it. That's why I'm here. So, Trump is now at risk of having to pay some, well, more fines if he's not very, very careful with what he says next. Why? Because Judge Juan Merchan tonight actually expanded the gag order against Trump to now cover his family and family members of the court. Judge Merchan writing, and I quote here, \"The average observer, must now, after hearing defendant's recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well.\" But you know who it does not cover? And I want to be very clear on this point. It does not apply to the judge, Judge Merchan, or Alvin Bragg on the left side of your screen. That's the prosecutor and the D.A. overseeing this case. Trump is still free to attack them as he wishes. But the new gag order just means he can't attack the judge's daughter like he has been doing, by the way. A daughter who, again, by the way, has nothing to do with the legal proceedings. At some point, I hope that starts to sink in for Trump. It's like attacking the guy outside who runs the hot dogs outside the courthouse. He also has nothing to do with the case. But I digress. And Trump also can't say anything against one of the people that he used to cherish most. Spoilers on the screen right now. His former aide, Hope Hicks. Now, why would he even consider saying anything against her, you ask? Well, it's because we've now learned that she's expected to testify in the hush money trial. Remember who she is. She was part of Trump's 2016 campaign at the very same time that Michael Cohen was paying off Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about their alleged affair, which Trump denies. In other words, we got a lot to get to tonight. So, time for some sidebar with two great lawyers, CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen, who's author of the brand-new book coming out soon called \"Trying Trump, along with the guy who has, well, defended Trump, his former lawyer, Tim Parlatore. I'm so glad to have both of you here tonight. Looking forward to reading your book as well, Norm Eisen. Let me begin with you here, Tim. So, Trump is arguing that he's got this First Amendment right to defend himself and say what he wants to say. It's all sort of campaign speech. So, does the fact that he can no longer post these comments about the judge's daughter, in his mind he'll say, but is it really infringe on those rights to say what he wants, First Amendment wise?",

He says Trump is sending a message that if you're a witness who participates in this proceeding, if you are a member of the court staff, if you're a juror, and if Trump finds out about you, your family is fair game. Given Donald Trump's history, remember, this is the individual who issued the tweet, be there about January 6th, will be wild. His words on the ellipse that led to that violence, his follower, Ricky Shiffer, who attacked the FBI in Cincinnati after Mar-a-Lago, and the stream of invective and the threats that follow when Trump attacks you. I think the judge has an ironclad First Amendment argument, and he lays it out very clearly in his order. We can't have that kind of intimidation through family members.",

He has been able to post a bond. It was not the high $454 million fraud-fine bond that you said was too high. They gave him a lower threshold to meet. What do you think about that lower threshold? Was it truly a crisis averted for Trump? O'LEARY: I'm elated by what has occurred here, not because it's supporting Donald Trump or it isn't, it's because the system is working, Laura. You've got to think about what's so important here about the American brand. A hundred and seventy-five years of attracting trillions of dollars, number one economy on earth because of the transparencies of our laws, the Constitution, which represents and discusses property rights over 25 times, and the appellate court system that allows you your second time in court if you thought you've been done wrong. Now, if you believed that the infraction did not match the penalty, which many people on a bipartisan basis thought was a little out of whack in that $500 million penalty, which made it very hard to get a bond in the first place, which did not allow the appellate system to kick in, that was a big problem. But that's been alleviated. And there's a big sigh of relief. And why did that happen? Because the adults came in the room and realized it was bad for the American brand and bad for our system and bad for New York. And this is just -- the best way to think about it is the analogy of a mother pearl. That's what I like to think of. And our economy is the mother pearl and a little piece of sand got in it in New York. And the mother pearl protected it by creating a pearl around it. And now, that irritant is gone and the system keeps working. Thank goodness, Laura. Thank goodness.",

But I do have concerns. I'd rather invest my money in a place where the laws would protect against somebody committing fraud against me, where what they tell me they have before I make an investment deal, how they evaluate their property is actually in line with what the valuation is. That would make me feel safer as an investor. But maybe that's different between me and a gazillionaire. But speaking of investments, I want to ask you this because while I have you, Truth Social comes to mind, the Truth Social stock specifically. It plunged today. It lost more than 21% after its owner disclosed the company, lost more than $58 million back in 2023. And I'm really curious from somebody like yourself, so focused on investments, is that a stock you would invest in?O'LEARY: I think all social media stocks are under tremendous scrutiny as a result -- with the process going on in TikTok right now, Laura, you can't ignore this bill that's going through Congress. I mean, TikTok is under fire and under siege, but it's just another social media site. And whatever happens, whether this bill passes or it doesn't, and it's highly likely to pass, it has put tremendous pressure on the social media industry. And I think one of the casualties is a new stock like this, which is going to be very, very volatile. It's not profitable yet, but we don't know the outcome of the TikTok situation. And so, what will the laws look like on social media post TikTok? And whether it gets acquired by an American owner and it turns from TikTok China, everybody knows it's basically spyware. I mean, nobody is even debating that anymore. And they would never let us have a TikTok USA in China, so we're not going to let them have one here.

But I -- but I -- but the TikTok scenario is quite different because, one, it's a prospective ban based on a potential divestment by Chinese owner ByteDance and whether they will actually do that or not.Also, Truth Social has a fraction of the users. It's being, frankly, panned as a result of the losses that it has had. It might be prospectively profitable, but it's not now. So, would you now invest in it? O'LEARY: Well, obviously, it's another platform and it has got into the controversy around Trump. And yes, it's volatile and it's smaller, but it's not the only one that's lost. You know, you said 21% decline today in today's trading. I mean, Twitter, now X, it's down 66% and it's private from its 44 billion valuation. These companies are volatile and that's no different than what Trump has got. And, you know, whether it's a good stock or bad stock, you have to wait to see the outcome. But it is a viable platform. It has got millions of people following it. You may not like the fact that it's so tied to Trump or maybe you do. It depends on the way you look at it. I'm kind of agnostic to all that stuff.

The state where, according to CNN senior reporter Harry Enten, Donald Trump is currently ahead by seven points. Yes, that state.The Biden campaign says Florida is now winnable for Biden. And that's in part because of abortion legislation. Just today, the Florida Supreme Court allowing one of the country's strictest abortion bans to take effect. They decided the state's constitution does not protect abortion rights. So, this six-week abortion ban the state lawmakers approved of will now take effect in 30 days. But hold up for a second, because there's more. In a separate ruling, the court also deciding abortion can be on the ballot this November. So, voters will be able to choose whether an amendment to enshrine abortion rights should be added to the state's constitution or not. Here's how Planned Parenthood is responding to Florida's Supreme Court. They say -- quote -- \"This decision triggers a near-total abortion ban, hindering access to care for Floridians. It particularly endangers vulnerable communities, including those with low incomes, in rural areas, and facing discrimination.\" I want to bring in Karen Finney, a CNN political commentator, and Rina Shah, a former senior GOP congressional adviser.

In one case in Tbilisi, it was the son of the unit commander, Averyanov. That's a bit suspicious, if you would.And you look at the ties between the targets that they went after.

You're always getting additional pieces. So, why the heavy confidence that they could just terminate the investigation and just walk away and say, we don't see a foreign adversary?The Russians for years have used directed energy to collect intelligence, using technical efforts to collect our vibrations, sounds, voice, which is why inside embassies -- we work in these, you know, these cells, these SCIFs is what we call them, to shield our power, to shield our typing, to shield our voices. The Russians have also used substances such as METKA, which was a carcinogenic spy dust, what people might remember from the 80s, which causes cancer in people. They used it to track our operations and our contacts. So, you put this together with the movement of the GRU personnel at the same times and same places, it's awfully compelling and it makes you wonder, why did the U.S. Intelligence Community rush to their findings and why they were so quick to go ahead and say, okay, we're done, there's nothing left to see here?",

And now, they sort of are able to take down the team that was defending the crown. And so, for Caitlin Clark, as we've seen her break record after record, and she broke even more tonight, this is just another step in her incredible journey, to have 40 points on this stage the way that she did it. I mean, she completely controlled the game.And there were just points in the game where she was absolutely demoralizing LSU with the way that she was playing. So, I think she made an even stronger statement that she has made as an all-time great women's college basketball player. And for LSU, you know, there's nothing for them to be ashamed of. I mean, Angel Reese, she played her heart out. I mean, she got hurt. I think after she got hurt and dinged up a little bit, she wasn't quite the same. She carried the team as far as she could. It has been kind of a bit of an up and down season for them in some respects. And so, they got as far as they were meant to go, and they got beat tonight by the better team and by a player the likes of which the game hasn't seen before.",
