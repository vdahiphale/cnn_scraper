      "sentences": "Yeah. That's right. It certainly does appear to be one of the most significant Israeli operations in the occupied West Bank in years. As we have already seen, the death toll rise to 10 people killed, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israeli troops as well as border police officers storming two key Palestinian cities in the West Bank, the cities of Jenin and Tulkarm, which the Israeli military says have been hotbeds of militant activity over the course of the last several months.The Israeli military pointed to two key reasons why it is carrying out this operation, which it says is only in its first phases. They say that Iran has been trying to flood the West Bank with weapons, which the Israeli military is trying to seize. And also, they say that a number of attacks have originated from these two cities, attacks against Israeli troops, as well as against Israeli civilians over the course of the last several months. We have already seen that there are still ongoing clashes in both cities, with reports of gunfire there, D9 Israeli military bulldozers tearing through streets to try and protect troops from potential IEDs in those areas. But, the Palestinian Ministry of Health also says that there are several key hospitals that appear to be being blocked or surrounded by Israeli troops. The Israeli military acknowledged that it has surrounded at least one of those hospitals in Jenin. It said, though, that it was doing so to prevent militants from entering that hospital and trying to seek refuge there or carrying out operations from those hospitals. One thing is clear, though, is that this operation is certainly not happening in a vacuum. We have seen a significant uptick in Israeli military activity in the West Bank since October 7. At least 652 Palestinians, that civilians as well as combatants, have been killed in the West Bank since October 7, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. And we've also seen a number of raids on a near daily basis in the West Bank that have resulted in the arrest of some 4,500 Palestinians so far. We have already seen condemnation from the Palestinian Authority to these raids and calls from Hamas as well as other militant groups for a general mobilization, an uprising, effectively, against Israeli forces, but also Israeli settlers in the West Bank.

Joyous scenes this morning at that Soroka Medical Center in southern Israel, as Farhan Al-Qadi walked out to a hero's welcome, effectively, from that hospital where he spent the last 24 hours or so after he emerged from a tunnel in Gaza where Israeli forces rescued him after 326 days of captivity. He gave some comments to reporters today, saying that he was enjoying being out in the light after having spent so much time in darkness. He was greeted by his family members in the village of Tarabeen in southern Israel, where his Bedouin Arab community lives, and where they have been hosting a celebration for him to celebrate his return. But, he also had a message about the hostages who are still in Gaza.We know that yesterday, he spoke with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and urged him not to forget about the other hostages, to bring them all home. Today, he called for a deal and the end of the war in Gaza, in order to end that war, but also bring back all of the remaining hostages. We know that there are some 108 hostages still in Gaza. About a third of them are confirmed dead by the Israeli government, and the clock is ticking for those who are still alive. Rahel.",

It comes on the heels of the Democratic Convention, and they hope to carry some momentum into the southeastern part of the state from the convention. This is a region that typically leans Republican. But, Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, well, he had success there in the 2022 Senate runoff. And then on Thursday, CNN will host the pair's first interview since they launched their campaign. Our Dana Bash will be asking the questions. That's tomorrow night at 09:00 p.m. Eastern. Now, Harris had been facing criticism from her Republican rivals for not doing a formal news conference or interview since her candidacy began about 38 days ago. So, we will watch and see what comes from that interview. A lot of people will be watching, but they'll also be watching the Republican ticket who has been repeatedly attacking the Vice President's record on the economy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala Harris is the candidate of American decline. She casts the tie- breaking vote for the Inflation Explosion Act. She cast the tie- breaking vote to send interest rates and mortgages through the roof. Stop talking about what you're going to do.

After raising complaints, Donald Trump now says that he will participate in the debate against Harris, but Harris' campaign maintains that discussions are ongoing over the muting of microphones when the other candidate speaks. So, the debate, the debate continues, at least for now.For now, let's bring in CNN's Eva McKend. So, talk to us a little bit about this interview with Dana Bash. Obviously, this was a coveted interview, certainly by journalists. What are we learning about these plans? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Rahel, this is going to be an opportunity for the Vice President to set the record straight, as she sees it, on some key policy issues. In the last couple of weeks, we have learned, for instance, on the vital issue of fracking, which is so important in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, that she no longer supports banning fracking. As a 2020 presidential candidate, she did. On immigration, she talks very affectionately about immigrants in her memoir, a real concern she had under the Trump administration for the fate of undocumented immigrants, parents being deported. She now supports a bipartisan border enforcement bill that does not include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. So, there are a lot of policy issues that she has to be asked about. But, this is her opportunity to kind of quell this criticism that she can't handle herself in unscripted settings. And then also, Rahel, she'll have the opportunity to connect with voters. That is something that she has really been intentional about, that we have seen over the last several weeks. She wants to relate to voters that she understands their economic pain. She is from a working class background, and she is uniquely suited for this moment because she sort of understands this experience.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, he had said that the rules have been set and they're going to be the same rules that were agreed to for the CNN debate in June with Joe Biden. Essentially, that means, the rules of that debate were, there will be no studio audience. The microphones will be turned off when a candidate is not speaking. And they'll be standing. There is no notes, those types of rules.However, we have heard from the Harris campaign arguing, actually, we are still working out some details for this debate, including the issue of the microphones. And so, it's unclear exactly what's going to happen with these rules. The debate over the debate continues. It is not over, but it does seem like they are still both set to show up on September 10 in Pennsylvania for that ABC debate. The question still is, exactly what will the parameters around it be? Now, I think this whole issue of the microphones I know, Rahel, that this seems very (inaudible), I'm sure, to all of our viewers that this seems very in the weeds, but it is important. And the reason I think they are harping on this so much is because both campaigns recognize the stakes of this debate. They remember that that CNN debate in June was really what set off the chain of events that led Joe Biden to ultimately end his campaign. And so, they recognize how important this is, and both campaigns are trying to get any sort of advantage and edge over their opponent that they can. And I will say, from my conversations with Trump's campaign, part of the reason that they care so much about the microphones in particular is because one of the things I know that they are focusing on the most, as they prep Donald Trump for this, is his demeanor. They want his tone to be right. They don't want him to be coming off too aggressive. They don't want him to seem like a bully. They recognize that Harris is a completely different opponent than Joe Biden. She is a woman, which has a whole other host of things that they have to consider in whether or how -- and how aggressive Donald Trump may be. And so, that's one of the calculations that I know the Trump campaign is viewing this from. From the Harris side, they are saying, we are not the Biden campaign. We did not agree to those CNN debate rules. And so, we have every right to try and work out and negotiate some of this. And they believe having the microphones on for the entire -- for the debate will only help them and help Harris. And so, we're still waiting to see exactly what exactly will happen, but you will see both candidates on September 10th. Rahel.",

However, it is known and it is clear that this is an unprecedented election. First, it was a President going against a former President. Now, it's a Vice President facing off with the former President. There were different events that day in Pennsylvania, including the former -- excuse me, including First Lady Jill Biden, as well as Vice President Harris, who were also in Pennsylvania.So, Secret Service was, without a question, stretched thin.

The United Arab Emirates have also been criticizing the detention of Pavel Durov as well, as to say he is a citizen then of that country as well.But, it's not just autocratic regimes that are expressing their concern about this detention. You've got libertarian groups. You've got people like Elon Musk who have also come out against his detention and other groups as well, because Telegram is broadly used because it offers basically monitoring free kind of access to the internet, into social media, has that huge social media reach, and that is exploited, of course, not just by terrorism groups and criminals, but also by autocratic kind of regimes as well.

It's been shortened because everything that Trump was doing while he was President with that hat on as the President after the 2020 election up to and on January 6, that can't be part of the supreme of the case, because the Justice Department is following what the Supreme Court decided at the beginning of July. So, the things that are taken out, things like Donald Trump talking to Jeffrey Clark and wanting to install him as a Justice Department official, as Attorney General, to try and find election fraud and investigate things there, how he was being briefed by people that there was no widespread election fraud and that there wouldn't be further investigation by the federal government into that, and also what he was talking to and hearing from aides around him in the White House, even including his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.

Deere &amp; Company, as it's known on Wall Street, is a brand set to be popular with politically conservative customers in the U.S.Let's bring in CNN's Nathaniel Meyersohn, who joins us with the details on this. So, Nathaniel, this is just one example. But, why does it seem like companies are pulling back on not just DEI, but also climate goals?",

The Supreme Court struck down affirmative action and higher education. We've seen brands like Bud Light and Disney be targeted by conservatives for some of their inclusive policies.And so, over the past couple of months, we've seen a line of brands, there on your screen, John Deere, Tractor Supply, Lowe's, Harley- Davidson, Brown-Forman, which owns Jack Daniels, pull back on some of their DEI programs. And as you noted, at the top, these are brands with primarily customers in right-leaning areas, some rural areas, and that's where we've seen kind of the most opposition to diversity and inclusion programs. And so, these companies are pulling back both in response to pressure from customers and a changing legal and political environment.",

I don't know if you know that recently he and Governor Kemp kind of mended fences, so to speak. The two were at odds since 2020 because, as you know, Trump said that the election was stolen in Georgia. The two have since sort of made up. They both extended the odds branch. And one important reason is that President Trump knows he needs Governor Kemp. Governor Kemp has a 65 percent approval rating. He is still on a honeymoon years after the election.
