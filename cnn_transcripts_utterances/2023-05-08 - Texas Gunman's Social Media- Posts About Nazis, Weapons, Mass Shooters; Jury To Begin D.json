He also appears to have scoped out that mall before the massacre and then waited for the biggest crowds. A witness who was there during the gunfire is OUTFRONT tonight.Plus, in the trenches. We have new video into OUTFRONT tonight. This from a Ukrainian sniper that we have spoken to several times. He's on the front lines tonight, and is sharing dramatic new images of the brutal battles he's seeing there with you. And the migrant surge, up as much as 400 percent already in some areas along the U.S. southern border. We're going to take you there live tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening, I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news: obsessed with Nazis, guns, and mass shooters. These are the new chilling details that we are learning tonight about the 33-year-old gunman who killed eight people and injured seven more at a Texas outlet mall. According to social media posts believed to have been made by Mauricio Garcia, the killer, you see exiting a car here just before the massacre, posted several photos of swastika tattoos and numerous photos of guns and ammunition. Along with a disturbing and rambling post, which reads, in part, quote: Even if I did go to a psychologist, they're not going to be able to fix whatever's wrong with me. Besides, that shit's expensive. Well, these are alarming developments, because of what we're learning about Garcia's past. A U.S. military source is confirming to CNN tonight that Garcia was terminated after just three months in the Army because of mental health concerns, terminated after just three months because of mental health concerns. Just think about that for a moment because after that happened, he was able to return to his job in Texas as an armed security guard, and to legally get an AR-15-style weapon used in the massacre after being released from the Army because of mental health concerns. We are also learning that Garcia was using Google Maps to scope out the location weeks before the weekend shooting. He prepared for it. The shooting was the second deadliest this year and the 17th mass shootings in Texas in just the past four months, 17, more than 30 lives lost, more than 60 injured in these cities. It comes as we are learning more about the victims from this latest horrific tragedy. The youngest among them 3-year-old James Cho, a toddler killed along with his mother and father who you see here. His 6-year-old brother William was the only from his family to survive the shooting and he just woke up in the ICU. Among the other victims, sisters, fourth grader Daniela Mendoza and her younger sister, second grader, Sofia, and then there's Christian LaCour, a security guard at the mall. I'm going to speak to someone who knew Christian in just a moment. Also, among the lost, Aishwarya Thatikonda, an engineer who was shopping with a friend when she was killed, Eastern Michigan University, where she graduated in 2020, released a statement that reads, in part: As the nation has to once again grapple with the senseless act of gun violence, we share our condolences with Aishwarya's family and friends. Josh Campbell begins our coverage OUTFRONT live in Allen, Texas. And, Josh, I know that you have been going through the suspect's extremely disturbing social media history.

Second, the frameworks around racial hierarchy and whiteness are different in different places in the world. And neo- Nazism has a foothold in a lot of different places. So, for, instance the patch right wing death squads refers to impart to the Pinochet areas in Argentina where political enemies were flung out by helicopter over the ocean and simply thrown to their death in the sea.

This is a misogynist. It's the theory of the case. That's why he committed these acts of sexual assault.
