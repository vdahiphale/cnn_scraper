And we actually don't know that all of them were intercepted because we are getting reports of at least one person injured by shrapnel. So, that means that likely at least some of them landed or shrapnel could have also fallen from interceptions. This is all still very much developing. But what we also know is that dozens of red alert sirens were going off in the northern western part of Israel, indicating that rockets were incoming.Now, of course, there have been days of tension here in Jerusalem at the al-Aqsa Mosque leading up to this. The Israeli police raiding the mosque twice in 24 hours they say to remove people who were barricading themselves inside with fireworks and stones. But just the act of going into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound is seen as very provocative and offensive to Muslims around the world. We've already seen rockets being a being sent to Israel from Gaza overnight. But this coming from Lebanon, this is a new and very worrying escalation. Now, from the area where these rockets were likely fired from, there's a lot of Palestinian refugee camps. So, these could be Palestinian militants. But in the Israeli military's eyes, all of Southern Lebanon is essentially controlled by Hezbollah and all the Israeli security officials I've ever spoken to, that is their big concern about what the next major escalation or war could be here. It would be a confrontation with Hezbollah, because Hezbollah's arsenal is much bigger, more powerful than what we see from groups like Hamas. And for Israel, the Israeli security officials, they really worry of what this sort of escalation could mean. We know that right now the northern airspace in Israel has been closed to air traffic as a result of these dozens of rockets being fired towards Israel and the prime minister is convening his secure cabinet to decide how to respond. Keep in mind, of course, we are right now in the midst of the overlapping holidays of Ramadan and Passover. It's already been a very tense time, but what we're seeing right now in the north from Lebanon, this could be a very dangerous and very major new escalation here, Kate.",

Let me just show you what's happening around me. It's always starts as a bit of a carnival. It usually ends with tear gas and a small minority confronting police. But that -- those early dramatic pictures, really quite extraordinary. They were railway workers who occupied that building for about 10 minutes. And what you're seeing here is very united front of the unions who say they simply don't want the retirement age raised from 62 to 64, that is set to become law, John, by the end of the year.

And here's why, the three protested on the statehouse floor last week calling for gun reform. This is after six people, including three nine-year-olds were killed in a shooting at an elementary school in Nashville. CNN's Ryan Young is following this story from Nashville. Ryan, Republicans say that, you know, the three Democrats violated house rules. But kicking them out seems like a really extreme move.

When you see all the people who lined up here, despite all this rain, you can see the passion that's involved in this.Sara, as you walk with me here, you can see some of the teachers that have lined up with these signs, ban assault rifle, ban guns not books. It was this emotion that people took inside the statehouse, and those lawmakers said they felt the pain from these folks then went inside and got on the floor. Now, when you talk to Republicans, they say they went the opposite direction. They should never use the bullhorn on that floor. So, now, we're not sure whether or not this vote is going to happen in the next hour, or do they go through some of the resolutions first before this happens. But this is really unprecedented in terms of how this is going to move forward. The Republicans definitely run this. And so, they had the majority. This could absolutely happen. There have been groups that have come out and said, we should not be focused on this. There are six lives that have been lost, and you had those officers who heroically ran in and took care of the threat. And that should be the conversation about how we stop this from ever happening again. But instead, now, you can hear the pain and the people talking about how they should move forward. But today, everyone is going to be focused on what happens inside because of procedural movements from the Republicans.",

And if it all goes through as perhaps expected, it will be the first time in the chamber's 227-year history that a member would be removed for violating chamber rules. Now, as Ryan just reported, the context here, is the protest at the state capital calling for new gun safety measures? Last Thursday, three house Democrats, as Ryan reported, joined the protest. They approached the podium on the house floor even though they had not been recognized to speak.So, that was a breach of house rules. It brought a halt to the chamber for nearly an hour. That is the activity under question today. And this is what matters in terms of the expulsion vote. As an epilogue to this, on Monday, dozens in the house gallery were ordered to leave after Republicans voted to move forward with the expulsion vote. As that unfolded, one of the lawmakers who may be removed today says another state representative assaulted him and took his phone. Look at this. Representative Justin Jones says he has filed a police report over the alleged assault. Now, since the Civil War, only two house members have been expelled in Tennessee. In 1980, it was after criminal charges. And in 2016, it followed sexual misconduct allegations and an attorney general investigation. Both of these were bipartisan votes, not at all what's expected yesterday, Sara -- or today I should say, Sara.",

But prosecutors really weren't that interested in that particular aspect of January 6th. Instead, they want to ask him about the pressure campaign that he faced from the former president and his allies as they tried to get him to block Biden's victory. They're also going to want to know about that heated phone call he and the former president had right before the insurrection. Other witnesses have discussed that. They're also likely going to want to talk to him about the threats that he faced from Trump supporters on the capitol that dayNow, this could potentially, Sara, be historic. I mean, this would be the first time that he would be cooperating in a criminal investigation against the former president, testifying under oath. Now, at this point, we don't know the exact date for his testimony or his appearance before the grand jury. One of the questions hanging out there is whether Former President Trump will try to appeal this on his own on executive privilege grounds. And so far, this investigation, he has lost every time he has tried to push this issue of executive privilege. But I'm told even if they lose on executive privilege, they may appeal just as a formality to preserve this potentially for future appeals.

That happened at around 2:34 a.m. And apparently, authorities were able to show up a few minutes later, but he did, as we know, succumbed to his injuries. Bob Lee had an extensive resume in the tech industry. He was really respected. The founder of Cash App. He was also the first chief technology officer of Jack Dorsey Square. There has been an outpouring of support from those in Silicon Valley and, of course, his friends and family. His father posting on Facebook, honoring his son, saying that, Bob would give you the shirt off of his back. He would never look down on anyone and adhere to a strict no judgment philosophy.
