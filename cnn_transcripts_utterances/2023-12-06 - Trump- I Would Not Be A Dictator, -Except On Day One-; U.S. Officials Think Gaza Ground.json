That was just one in a series of surprising admissions yesterday. It started with President Biden telling donors at a Boston area fundraiser, quote, \"If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running. But we cannot let him win.\" That confession surprised some of his campaign aides, to say the least. One of them said \"Yikes\" when he was told about it.

He was given multiple opportunities to say unequivocally that he would not be a dictator if reelected. This, of course, taking place as there is increasing coverage from The Atlantic, The New York Times, and others about the dark warnings that are playing out right before our very eyes about what a second Trump term would look like if he were a potentially convicted criminal who then was reelected and able to potentially pardon himself, et cetera. We would be in incredibly unprecedented territory.

This January suggestion that they could stop -- that Israel could stop the bombing campaign and this suggestion -- and I think this is something U.S. officials are increasingly pushing on behind the scenes. And some, like Lloyd Austin, the Defense secretary, are saying it increasingly in public that there is a loss, potentially, of support for Israel in the international arena based on how this campaign is being conducted.Is there a recognition of that inside Israel? Is there a rejection of that idea? Do you think that the January timeline to see this war continue for another month, month and a half, two months is the likely outcome?

We see that 118 hostages have, indeed, been brought home, and in Israel's understanding it was the military campaign that applied the pressure necessary to force Hamas to essentially release those hostages. And, of course, the second piece is to eradicate Hamas' ability to ever carry out a massacre like October 7 ever again. Those remain the two central goals and Israel will continue to do whatever it has to do for as long as it has to do them in order to bring those goals to fruition. I think we've seen a great deal of understanding by the U.S. administration and by other allies in the West and elsewhere that Israel needs to pursue these goals. That Israel has been the target of an unprecedented massacre, which is why it had to set about this campaign. There have been various timelines that have been discussed, including by military officials and diplomatic officials about what might that look like and how long it might take. I have heard a similar timeline that we could see an end to the current round of hostilities in Gaza by sometime in January. But I think what we'll have to see over the next two weeks is how that campaign proceeds. How Israel is able to specifically intercept those Hamas threats and militants and their weapon storages in Gaza before we're able to sort of figure out how we can move on to the next stage of the campaign.",

And you had LeBron and Kevin Durant going head-to-head in this one, both having great games. LeBron, here with the lay-up, put the Lakers up five with just over two to go. Durant, meanwhile with multiple clutch buckets down the stretch. Both he and LeBron had 31 points. And with the Lakers up by one with under 20 seconds on the clock, Austin Reaves hits this huge three to put the Lakers up by four. Then after Durant scored, the Suns pressing Reaves -- it loses the ball. But LeBron called a time out and the refs gave it to him even though he -- it was clearly a loose ball. And the Suns couldn't believe it. The Lakers go on to win 106-103 to advance to the final four in Vegas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
