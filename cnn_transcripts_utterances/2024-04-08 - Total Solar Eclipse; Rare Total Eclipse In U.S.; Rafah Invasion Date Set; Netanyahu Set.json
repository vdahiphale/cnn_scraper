Israel's prime minister says a date has been set for an invasion of Rafah in the south of Gaza. And in the last few minutes, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida landing in the United States for the nation's first state visit in almost a decade. And the last dance, Caitlin Clark missing out on a national title as she plays her final college game. What's next for the basketball phenomenon? We'll discuss all that and more coming up. But first, to the celestial spectacle, the total solar eclipse happened across North America earlier Monday, the path of totality from Mexico through the United States to Canada. And millions of people gathered along the path to witness the magical moment of darkness as the moon blocked the sun's rays. In Vermont, for one couple, it wasn't just a celestial spectacle though that was in the air, it was also love. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I was on the second flight and I got a lot of swag included with the t-shirt that says connecting the cosmos. Of course, we had the glasses, the solar eclipse glasses to protect our eyes. The coolest thing about this flight, on this airbus, a A320, just arrived back there, Gate 77 here in Detroit, is that the pilots were able to coordinate with the FAA and make two turns in totality while we were in it for about three or four minutes. So, the plane turned to the right and then turned to the left so those on either side of the plane could get a good view of totality. And what a view we got. It was extremely dark there at 3,500 feet, which was incredibly interesting, something that I was even surprised by. And the experience was actually relatively quiet on board the plane with people's faces really pressed against the windows, fourteen inches tall, on this airbus A320. I want you to listen out of one of the passengers, he says, this was really about the experience, and think of what the experience in 2024 is like, our heads are in our phones, we're mostly disconnected. This was something that really got people together in a really unique and interesting way. You mentioned love being in the air, and it was a bit literal on our flight. We had a couple -- a man proposed to his soon-to-be wife, they're fiances now. They've very excited about that. He said, it would have been a disaster if she said no, but it turns out that she said yes, and it was extra special, really icing on the cake that this took place in the air on this special -- in the path of totality flight. This is what some of the passengers said who are on our flight Delta 1010. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There was a lot of anxiety when we left at Dallas-Fort Worth this morning because of the fact that it was so blanketed in clouds, there was low overcast this morning. Ultimately, they broke up a little bit.

So, it was a really kind of eerie and unique, a bit spiritual, a bit scientific. It was an incredible intersection of a lot of different things. I'm a big airplane geek. I'm a pilot. I've been around airplanes my entire life. I think the only thing that would top this is being able to pilot the airplane myself, although I did talk to one of the passengers who was a flight attendant off-duty who was able to sit in the jump seat, which is the seat that is behind the pilots, typically reserved for off-duty airline crew, that had to be something else being able to see it out of the front of the airplane.

A few things happened today, which I'd never seen before. This field in Texas, where there's a lot of cattle grazing even now, a bunch of butterflies. But when it got dark, butterflies took all of where they went, but they weren't there anymore. And then a couple of other things that were -- I'd never experienced before were the wind, like right now, it's a little bit of a breeze. You can see the camera shaking a little bit, but during the eclipse, the breeze just stopped completely. And it was a shared experience. We had close to a thousand people out here and it was just -- it was really cool. And then the other thing was this prominence. There's a jet of plasma, of gas and particles off the sun. And from our point of view, it's sort of the lower right. And because the clouds were acting like a filter, cutting some of the brightness, you could see it in a way you couldn't normally.

I know it looks like it went away and came back, but that is actually the darkening of the cloud cover itself because well, you know, what, the satellite wants to see the land and wants to see the top of the cloud and this visible satellite was not able to see the clouds when it got dark. So, that's just kind of how it goes. Temperatures did go down in the afternoon, about 9 degrees Fahrenheit as that cloud kind of came through and then the moon kind of moved on over. So, temperatures really did go down. And then when the moon did go over, the clouds went away and the pictures were spectacular. But temperature drop relative. Humidity came up. The winds decreased. And the cloud cover, of course, decreased on the satellite underneath. And here's the 9-degree temperature drop. In Carbondale, Illinois also Caribou, Maine, both dropping 9 degrees as -- well, you don't have any sunshine, you don't have any insulation like the incoming solar radiation, then all of a sudden you don't warm up.

What is your current level of communication between your administration and North Korea? KISHIDA (through translator): We believe that resolving various concerns between Japan and North Korea and stabilizing relations is important, not only for the interests of our two countries, but also for peace and stability in the region. For this reason, we believe that it is important to hold a summit meeting. And under my supervision, I've been conducting high-level outreach to the DPRK. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): Following the U.S.-Japan summit, the two nations will convene with the Philippines, the first trilateral meeting of its kind, to address rising security threats from North Korea weapons testing and aggression in the South China Sea. KISHIDA (through translator): We are not targeting China specifically or a specific country. As Japan, we've been working to strengthen the Philippines' maritime enforcement capabilities.

Thank you so much for that. Now, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has wrapped up her four-day trip to China where she aimed to ease tensions between the world's two largest economies. However, Yellen also didn't shy away from challenging China on their vast manufacturing capacity and exports that are putting pressure on global prices for items such as solar panels and electric cars. Marc Stewart joins us now from Beijing. And Marc, I believe you got the only question actually to Janet Yellen in that press conference and you didn't shy from asking her some of the challenging questions that I think a lot of us are asking, national security risks, opportunities for U.S. and foreign businesses in China. Talk us through your interaction.",

U.S. stocks beginning the new week little changed as investors await the start of first quarter earnings season and important U.S. inflation numbers too. We also had higher bond yields weighing on sentiment as well. And then comes J.P. Morgan, CEO Jamie Dimon, warning in his annual shareholder letter that U.S. government borrowing could contribute to persistent inflation. He said his bank is preparing a worst-case scenario for rates spiking to 8 percent. He's given that warning before and it was met with plenty of raised eyebrows. Now, in Asia, Japanese stocks rising almost 1 percent, eclipsing the performance for the rest of the region, as you can see. And in other business news, call it a case of semiconductors superlatives. Taiwan Semiconductor announcing on Monday that it will build its most advanced chips in the United States as part of a new multibillion-dollar deal with the Biden administration. The money, coming from the U.S. Chips Act, Taiwan TSCM now plans to operate three production facilities in the State of Arizona, assuring the United States it has steady access to its cutting-edge chips.

That means that the U.S. has very little control if something were to disrupt the supply chain for these advanced chips. This is something that the Biden administration has been really focused on for the past couple of years trying to grow the U.S. domestic supply chain for these chips, and this $6.6 billion investment in TSMC will go a long way towards getting there. TSMC has already been in the process of building two new fabrication facilities in Arizona. Now, it says it will be building a third, bringing its total investment in the U.S. to $65 billion. One question, though, that I have, Julia, as I've been talking to experts about this issue, is how TSMC is going to find the workers for these facilities. The company says that these three new fabrication plants will create around 6,000 high-paying tech jobs, but these semiconductor manufacturing roles are highly specialized, and the experts that I've talked to say that the U.S. needs to be doing more to invest in training the workers for these positions beyond just investing in the facilities themselves.

Only two other teams in the last 50 years have been able to repeat as champions, and UConn has a chance to be the next. They'd be the first since Florida did it in 2007, if they can pull it off. They're on a tournament record streak of 11 straight double-digit wins. Now, Purdue has never won a title, but this title run may be written in the stars, playing in the championship on the day their home state of Indiana sits in the path of totality of the solar eclipse. The only other time they played for a title was 1969, the year that Purdue alum Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. And the last time a total solar eclipse was visible in Indiana was 1869.
