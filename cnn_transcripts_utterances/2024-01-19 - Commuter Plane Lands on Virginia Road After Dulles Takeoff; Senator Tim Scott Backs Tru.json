That's to the northwest. Apparently had an issue almost right away. And there were no other better landing spots other than the Loudoun County Parkway there at Arcola Drive. Put it down pretty easily, it looks like. And we're hearing from the air traffic control audio that the pilot reported to the tower at Dulles that there were two pilots and five passengers on board. Apparently, they are all okay.The latest from Dulles International Airport is that the airport is still open right now as they are starting the initial investigation on this. You can kind of see the silhouette of the Cessna caravan there. This is not a private plane. This is a commuter airliner operated by a company called Southern Airways Express. They operate flights on the east coast between Dulles. This flight was on its way to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, but only made it to about 850 feet. And according to the flight tracking data that we've been able to look at already, the plane made a little bit of a right turn and then a descending left turn to go south on the Loudoun County Parkway there. Roads are often the last resort for pilots if you have a bit of an engine problem or an engine failure. You have to be going the same speed as traffic. You have to find a bit of an opening there. A lot of other concerns. And instead of landing on the runway, even though it looks like a runway, you've got to be worried about wires. You have to be worried about telephone poles. You have to be worried about streetlights. Obviously, there is a streetlight right there. It doesn't look like all that much damage to the airplane right now, although this is still preliminary. And you can see the fire trucks and ambulances still rolling up to the scene. This only happened less than an hour ago, according to the latest from Dulles International Airport and the Virginia Department of Transportation as we're able to see on this traffic camera right now, live.",

And so it doesn't seem like they were all that high, and the visibility was at least good enough for them to see the road in front of them. And so, so long as you can see it and line up with it, it looks like a runway, may as well try it. So, the impossible turn is what it's called, typically when you have an engine failure in a single-engine airplane like this. This is not an airplane that has two engines. It can't keep climbing. It can't keep flying on one. Once the engine quits, the airplane turns into a glider, using the potential energy that you have in altitude, turning that into kinetic energy coming down to land.And so if you try and turn back, it can be very dangerous. So usually you try and make turns only a little bit to the left, a little bit to the right. In this case, it was a left turn, straight right up with Loudoun County Parkway there, and it was a very successful one at that. This is what the FAA is calling a hard landing. I'd call it a good landing. (CROSSTALK)",

Gore. And the question is whether states can remove Trump from their ballot based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the so-called insurrectionist ban. And last night, the Trump team filed their brief before the Supreme Court, expanding on the argument that they're going to make before the justices in just a few weeks. And they argue that, look, you can't strip voters of their choice of candidate. They say, quote, doing that would, quote, threaten to disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans and promise to unleash chaos and bedlam if other state courts and state officials follow Colorado's and exclude the likely Republican presidential nominee from their ballots.Of course, this is an appeal of the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to remove him from the ballot. Now, some folks really emphasize the language there, chaos and bedlam being unleashed because that echoes, of course, things that Trump said in the lead up to January 6th, which helped to promote violence. Now, it is also true, though, if the Supreme Court were to allow each of the 50 states to handle this issue in terms of who appears in the ballots individually, it would be chaotic and it would be incredibly confusing, which is why we do expect the Supreme Court will weigh in here. And of all of Trump's legal cases and legal issues, this is the one where most legal experts agree he has the greatest chance of success. It is expected that the justices will be unlikely to issue a sweeping ruling that would take away the choice from voters, especially based on this constitutional language where we're seeing even courts within the same states can't agree on exactly what it means.

And look, the two of them both hail from the same state, South Carolina, a state that Nikki Haley and her campaign very much, as you mentioned, have high expectations for. And remember, Haley, when she was governor of South Carolina, she was the one who actually appointed Tim Scott to the Senate in 2012. And his endorsement was highly coveted by all of these candidates. And I know from my conversations with Trump's advisers, that they had been talking and pursuing Tim Scott's endorsement for several weeks.And the timing here was really, I think, interesting to note. And also part of why this is a blow to Haley, because he could have waited until South Carolina to roll out this endorsement of Donald Trump. But he's doing it just four days before the New Hampshire primary, where Haley and her team have very high expectations as well for how she will perform in the state. And by giving his endorsement to Trump so early, it does allow the Trump campaign to try to paint her as not being viewed as highly by some members of her own state. Now, I also want to point out just, you know, how Donald Trump and his team may want to use Tim Scott on the trail. His endorsement is one thing, but also having him as a potential surrogate would also be a huge boost to the Trump campaign. We know that they're relying heavily on other surrogates from South Carolina, people like Governor Henry McMaster and Senator Lindsey Graham, to help attack Nikki Haley as well in their efforts to beat her when it comes closer to New Hampshire.

One reason is his team is very closely watching how Nikki Haley is doing in the polls, watching her narrow the gap with him in the state. And that is a concern to the Trump campaign, according to my conversations with their team. But the other complicating factor is they acknowledge that New Hampshire is a very different style of a primary, very different from Iowa.It's a primary that is very different from Iowa. It's a primary that is very different from Iowa. It's not a caucus. They also allow undeclared voters, their terms for independent voters to vote and participate in the primary.

He has ducked all debates throughout this campaign cycle. But Nikki Haley made the decision after Iowa that the next time she was going to debate was either going to be with former President Trump on the stage or if she were to be the nominee against current President Joe Biden.

Basically, the publisher of this magazine didn't own the rights outright to publish Sports Illustrated. Those rights belong to another publisher called Authentic Brands Group. And the publisher, Arena, the Arena Group, they missed payments for the publishing rights to publish this magazine. And as a result, the company that actually owns those rights has revoked this company's ability to publish the magazine. And as a result of that, Arena Group, which does publish it or was publishing it, said that it is laying off its staff.So it's unclear whether the owner of the actual publishing rights for Sports Illustrated is going to step in here and try to revive this paper. The staff is obviously calling for that. But right now, the owner is not saying anything. And the future of this iconic sports magazine is really in jeopardy.",
