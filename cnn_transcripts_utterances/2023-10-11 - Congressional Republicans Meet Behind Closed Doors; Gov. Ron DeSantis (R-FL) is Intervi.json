      "sentences": "All right, happening now, congressional Republicans are about to gather behind closed doors. The goal is to determine who they will back to be speaker of the House. Whether they achieve that goal, totally unclear. The only two announced candidates are Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan. Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy is telling colleagues not to nominate him again, but he does seem to be playing a little coy at the same time.CNN's Lauren Fox up on Capitol Hill for all of this. How is this going to play out?",

      "sentences": "I wish that there was a clear answer right now, John. The honest answer is that we do not know right now how this is going to play out. There's a couple of variables at play right now. One of them is whether or not Republicans adopt a rules change in how they elect a speaker behind closed doors.Right now what you need to be the confirmed nominee to be speaker and head to the floor is a simple majority of the conference. That's around 111 votes. But it's likely that they could move to try and change the rules. That would be the first order of business so that you'd have to lock down 217 Republicans in that room before you go to the floor. Of course, what they are trying to avoid is a messy floor fight that we saw back in January to elect Speaker Kevin McCarthy in those 15 rounds. The question is whether that rule passes because that could certainly change the dynamics both in the room and whether or not we see a speaker candidate emerge by the end of the day. Now, we don't know how many rounds this could go. The first few rounds of actual voting on the speaker candidates, those are done by secret ballot. Obviously, that means that members don't have to talk about who they're supporting. Some members have already publicly said who they're backing, but you just don't have a great gasp of where the votes stand until members get in that room, until we can talk to them afterward, and until we can see whether or not that rules change passes. It's just important to point out to viewers back home, though, that without a House speaker nothing can be done to support Israel. They cannot pass a resolution simply saying that they back Israel, that the U.S. is a key ally of Israel. They also cannot provide critical funding that may be necessary, something that the administration is looking at sending a supplemental request up to Capitol Hill for. So, that just gives you a sense of the gravity of this situation as it affects the geopolitical status around the world. John.",

But there's another way of looking at it. There are supporters of Steve Scalise who say the Jordan people are pushing that because Scalise actually, they say, has more than half of the Republican conference. Any way to know for sure?",

There are a lot of Scalise allies who argue this is really akin to trying to change the rules in the middle of the game and this is how we've elected speakers time after time. This is actually how Kevin McCarthy got the nomination and everyone was fine going to the floor and having a messy fight then, why not now? So, obviously, we're going to see in just a short period of time whether or not House Republicans, a majority of them, support that rules change or not.John.",

We've been a magnet, since I've been governor, for Orthodox Jews. I was just in south Florida at a synagogue announcing that we're going to be expanding state-based Iran sanctions because money going into that regime, unfortunately, is turned around and used to facilitate terrorism. And there's people in the congregation down there, there's people all throughout Florida who have lost friends, who have lost family members, who have friends or family that are missing and still unaccounted for. So, the emotions are very raw, but I think the resolve of being able to cut through the clutter and just being able to bring justice to this situation, this is probably the darkest hour in Israel's modern history, and that's saying something because they've faced a lot of attacks.

I mean what happens in Washington, all the drama, constant soap opera, but they're not delivering results for the American people. In Florida we do it just the opposite. We don't do any of the drama. We're not running a soap opera. We produce results, economic results with budget surpluses, paying down the debt, tax cuts, low crime rate. That's one of the reasons why our economy is ranked number one in America and why we lead the nation in net in migration.So, focus on the American people. They're paying too much for everything.
