And an emotional day for the people of Israel as four hostages are rescued from Gaza after eight months in captivity. Loud cheers there from a crowd greeting the newly rescued hostages as they climbed out of a helicopter and took their first steps back in Israel. The four hostages kidnapped by Hamas from the Nova Musical Festival during the October 7 attacks. They include 25-year-old Noa Argamani, 22-year-old Almog Meir Jan, 27-year-old Andrey Kozlov, and 41-year-old Shlomi Ziv. And you may remember Noa Argamani from this horrific video from October 7. It shows the attacks. It shows Hamas fighters taking her away on a motorbike. Israel saying the special military operation took place this morning in central Gaza, among residential buildings where Hamas had been keeping those hostages. Palestinians described the raid as hell on earth as heavy shelling and artillery fire bombarded that area. The Hamas-run government media officer in Gaza says at least 210 people have been killed. And more than 400 injured including women and children. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers and Gaza's media office does not differentiate between civilians and militants who are killed. CNN's Paula Hancocks is in Tel Aviv with more on today's rescue mission and the aftermath in Gaza (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Their first video call in eight months. Friends or former hostage Almog Meir Jan welcome the 22-year- old home.",

I do want to ask you more broadly what today's operation, if at all, what does it mean more broadly for the conflict and for those negotiations that continue to be ongoing for a potential deal. OREN: Certainly. Jessica, I'm not a spokesman for the government. I'm not in office, but I think I reflect a lot of Israeli opinion in saying Israelis would be willing to agree to a temporary ceasefire -- six weeks in return for the release of say, 33 hostages. Thats the deal that Israel put on the table that President Biden presented to Hamas, that Hamas has so far rejected unfortunately. A permanent ceasefire means the war is over. Israel withdraws. Hamas comes out of the tunnels it rearms, it recapture Gaza and its own leaders said they're going to launch 10,000 more attacks on Israel until it's -- until we're destroyed. So I think Israelis generally were willing to make that risk of a temporary ceasefire to get more hostages back. But until that happens, Israel's going to have to keep up the military pressure on Hamas. And it's (INAUDIBLE) that goal of denying Hamas the ability to mount another October 7 type attack.",

Ok, how do you plan to stop that happening not just in the short run but in the long run? And I think that's crucial for Israelis because there are still tens of thousands of Israelis in the southern part of the country, who can't go back to their homes, who won't go back to their homes unless they're sure that two years from now, three years from now, another October 7 is not going to happen. I think that Israel also has a primary interest in concluding as quickly as possible major military operations in Gaza wo we can focus the major thrust of our military might to meet the threat from Hezbollah, which I said earlier is a threat of a far greater magnitude.",

And now in the wake of the conviction seemed to be pulling back. So I do think this is a very fluid race. But yes, to your point there's no question that Biden is struggling and he needs his surrogates out much more aggressively because he's not the best messenger for his own message.

I first want to get your reaction to this very high-stakes rescue mission that brought home four Israeli hostages today. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, from the details we know about it, Jessica, we know that these four hostages were in two different locations. They were very close to a refugee camp, a U.N.-sponsored refugee camp. They were taken out of civilian homes. And what we know so far is the Israeli government has suggested, is that there were citizens in those homes who were taking care of these hostages. We also hear early reports from the Hamas-driven Ministry of Health within Gaza that over 200 people or 400 people -- they can't even get the figures correct in terms of their estimates -- have either been killed or wounded. So it is a continuation of the kinds of things on both sides where the Israeli Defense Force is attempting to find, through intelligence sources, where these hostages are. They -- they evidently had some good -- pretty good sources on this one because they were able to rescue these four that were in a neighborhood, basically in a refugee camp or in a resident area. So I mean, were talking about the continuation of Palestinian citizens protecting Hamas or Hamas using them as human seal shields and asking them to do their -- to coordinate with them in terms of their actions.",

All of the military analysts, myself included, have said since October that unless you have a political strategy as opposed to just a military strategy for these operations, it won't come to a good end state. Mr. Netanyahu has said from the very beginning that he wants to destroy Hamas. That's a very valid military strategy, but it has nothing to do with what then. What does it look like when you do destroy Hamas? Because you have an area of Gaza with two million people living there. And it has to have some kind of political outcome. And Mr. Netanyahu has been hesitant to describe what that looks like, even when Mr. Biden has pushed him on that. So there are -- you know, I don't have a doubt that the CIA assessment said exactly what Zachary just said, but truthfully, this war is going to continue because Mr. Netanyahu has placed the destroying of the Hamas organization before anything that has to do with the political ramifications of what happens next in Gaza.",

We can't independently verify those numbers. And they don't differentiate between civilians and militants killed. At the same time, the IDF is saying the previous rescue missions were called off, saying that Hamas is holding hostages in civilian buildings and it makes it impossible for them to get to the hostages without entering civilian areas. But you and I've been talking about this for eight months now and it always comes back to this push and pull of going into the civilian areas. And that is, again, where these hostages were being held. Do you think we're going to keep seeing these types of things?",
