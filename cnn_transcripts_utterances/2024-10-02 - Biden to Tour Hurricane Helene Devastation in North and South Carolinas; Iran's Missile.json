He said that the G7 has spoken and that there will be a statement at some point coming about what Iran did. Also saying that we believe the question, we are going to have to go back and confirm this. The question was about, we know it was about Iran's nuclear sites and whether or not Israel should go ahead and attack those as we were talking to Nancy Pelosi about. His answer was no, but we have to clarify exactly what that give and take was.But then, he also said that the Israeli response should be proportional. We heard that. And Maureen Dowd, we have this. While you have Donald Trump and J.D. Vance on the debate stage making the argument that the world is on fire. None of this happened when Donald Trump was president. We didn't have the war in Ukraine. We didn't have the Middle East as hot as it is right now, and return him to power and everything will be fine. Whether or not that's true, this is one of those moments. We are in October and maybe people don't say they're going to vote on foreign policy, but how much does the kind of thing we are seeing now affect people's votes? Whether it's sort of intentional or maybe it's in the backs of their minds.",

So, it is hard to tell how this actually plays out but it is definitely a factor. It is also an economic factor because you saw this morning, already oil prices which have been on the way down, on the way up. You've got this strike going on, so -- at the ports. So, does all of this sort of leak into the economy and be part of voters' calculation.But obviously, a sensitive different cold spot for the Biden Administration, and as Nancy Pelosi was saying, their goal is not to have a wider war. You are going to have Republicans out there saying, now is the time. You already see it, now is the time to take care of Iran. So, that's where the tension is going to be.",

Hello to both of you. Let's start there. I thought it was really noteworthy that President Biden just flatly closed the door on that. So the question is, there a lot of questions there, first of all, the decision to do that and then what if Israel does it anyway? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yeah, Dana, I think the key thing here is that President Biden is trying to pre-empt a nuclear attack.

Iran has been weeks to months from putting together a nuclear weapon. U.S. intelligence, European intelligence, all think they can. They haven't decided to go ahead with it though. And if they do, that could launch a nuclear arms race across the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia possibly next, but there are other options.There are -- possibly, they could do strikes on some of the nuclear energy facilities that are under construction, so that they don't actually hit nuclear material, but they do a symbolic strike, and combine that with hits on ballistic missile sites from where the ballistic missiles were launched. Those ballistic missiles are expensive. So if they know where they're stored, they could take a whole bunch of them out.",
