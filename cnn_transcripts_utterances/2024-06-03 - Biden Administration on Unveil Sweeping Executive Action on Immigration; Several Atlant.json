CNN's Arlette Saenz is at the White House. Arlette, what are you learning?  ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, sources have told us that President Biden could unveil these potential border executive actions as soon as tomorrow. And in fact, sources have told us White House officials have started reaching out to mayors who represents cities along the US southern border to potentially join the president here at the White House for that event. Now, the president has been weighing executive action relating to the border for several months now in the wake of those failed bipartisan border talks up on Capitol Hill. In recent weeks, administration officials have been working on this potential executive action that would dramatically limit asylum seekers' ability to seek asylum at the US southern border. It is expected that this policy could be reminiscent of an approach former President Donald Trump took while he was an in office, seizing on a pre-existing authority to try to clamp down on border crossings. Now so far, the White House has yet to confirm that the president will in fact unveil this executive action this week. A White House spokesperson simply saying: \"As we have said before, the administration continues to explore a series of policy options and we remain committed to taking action to address our broken immigration system.\" Now, this comes as the president and his team are trying to tackle an issue that has been politically vexing for Biden heading into November's election. They had also been hoping to potentially roll out an executive action before Biden faces off against Donald Trump on that debate stage, a bit later this month, and it comes at a time as Americans have increasingly showed concern relating to the issues along the US southern border. Trump has really tried to make that a key focal point of his campaign. But you've also seen Biden and the White House really take a more aggressive approach when it comes to the border in recent months, especially after Republicans tanked those bipartisan border talks at the urging of former President Donald Trump, something that Biden said was that he would try to hold Republicans accountable for that going forward. So we will see when and what exactly the White House will unveil relating to a potential border executive action at a time when the president is trying to move the needle with voters on an issue that has really emerged as a top concern heading into November's election.",

We started building up pressures and things are working fine in terms of water being to the residents for them to be able to wash their hands, take a shower, et cetera.

We had 60,000 people that Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Individuals in the city were at parks and our swimming pools were open, splash pads were open.
