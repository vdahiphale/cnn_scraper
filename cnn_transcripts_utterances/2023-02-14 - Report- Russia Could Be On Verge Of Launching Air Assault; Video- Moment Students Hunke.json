Offers of $3,500 to anyone who would put their life on the line to fight Putin's war, as a new report says Putin looks to be on the cusp of launching an all-out air assault. We're live in Ukraine and Belarus tonight where Russian forces are also gathering this evening.Plus, an OUTFRONT now front investigation, our Selina Wang in Beijing tracks down Chinese factories that make spy balloons, factories belonging to Chinese entities that tout their balloons' military capabilities. One exec even pointing to its balloon flying over the United States on a map, wait until you see this. And Congresswoman Angie Craig speaks out after being attacked in her apartment building. A stranger follow her into her elevator, punched her, try to get into her apartment. She fought back. She's my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, $3,500 for your life. That's what one city aligned with Russia is now offering men who sign up to fight Putin's war. This is it. This is the decree. We got it in hand. It's a decree signed by the leaders of Baikonur City. It's a city aligned with Russia, technically right over the border in Kazakhstan. It establishes -- let me just read what it says -- it establishes a lump sum payment to mobilize citizens, as well as persons who voluntarily expressed their desire to take part in the special military operation and who signed a contract for military service, residing in Baikonur City, as a measure of social support, in the amount of 260,000 rubles. So, there you go. You got the price of a life there. The price of the life is 260,000 rubles. That's about $3,500. It seems it may be more of a choice there, though, $3,500 to die, than it is in any other places in Russia. The mayor of Kuznetsk in western Russia now saying unemployed men should only be given one option. He's suggested the town shut down the unemployment center and instead send anybody who needs work to war. His words, quote, the unemployed must enlisting the army. If you have nothing to do, then defend your homeland and you will be paid for it. Now, the mayor insisting this will solve the city's unemployment problem and Putin's problems on the battlefield. It's incredible to hear this, $3,500 for your life. But, of course, from the numbers we know, there's a high chance that anybody who takes these deals and goes to the Russian front does not come home alive. We sometimes share intercepted phone calls with you. And tonight, we have one that Ukraine intercepted, which is of a Russian fighter slamming his superiors for living larger than the enlisted men who are drinking water out of dirt puddles on the ground. And he complains at his request to come home was denied. Here it is. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  There are these centaurs who live in three-story cottages in the town for (EXPLETIVE DELETED) sake, while you are here lying in a trench. You sleep in the dirt, eat in the dirt. You drink from puddles, while they walk around. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  Are you going to try to get discharged? RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  Well, around New Year's, everyone lost their mind because they had rejected all of our requests to go home. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

One of the things Ukrainians have been saying for a very long time is they fear the Russians might be preparing for that very large offensive that Belarus could indeed play a large role there. And, of course, as you also mentioned, that first thrust that the Russians had when the war began nearly a year ago, that also came from Belarus. There were a massive amount of Russian forces that went into Belarus, and the Russians still have thousands of soldiers on the ground here in Belarus. They train them here to then actually go into Ukraine to fight there through the Donbas. But, however, the Ukrainians believe that right now, there's not enough Russian ground forces on the ground in Belarus. But the air element, that really is the major important thing for them right. Now there were just massive air exercises, air force exercises with the Russian and Belarusian militaries that just concluded a few days ago. Alexander Lukashenko, the strongman, he said it was all defensive in nature. It really doesn't really mean anything. But, of course, we know, that Lukashenko is very dependent on Vladimir Putin. Lukashenko himself has said the Belarus security would not be possible without Russia. Now, there's many believe that Vladimir Putin has tried to draw Belarus more into his orbit and possibly trying to drive into this war as well. One of the things we're looking at, Erin, is that in a couple of days, Lukashenko and Putin are set to meet once again. We are going to wait and see what happens there. But certainly, what the Ukrainians are saying if they see an uptick in Russian air movements on the Belarusian side -- and also, the Russians are using Belarus as well to hit Ukraine with some of those missiles that are obviously having devastating effects on Ukrainian cities -- Erin.",

The battles here at close quarters, unrelenting trench warfare at the edge of the city. It's so hard, the enemy is pushing from different directions, says this Ukrainian soldier. All the efforts our men are making are priceless. Fighters of the Wagner mercenary group paraded their flag at the village on the outskirts of Bakhmut. But they're being forced to fight for every single house. And Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin admits -- Bakhmut will not be taken tomorrow because there's heavy resistance and grinding. Fro the meat grinder to work properly, it is impossible to suddenly stop festivities. This as Wagner units continue to endure heavy losses and its efforts on the heels around Bakhmut. They are vulnerable to Ukrainian drones. Ukrainian officials now expect another Russian thrust in the north, in the forest near Kreminna. There's been fierce fighting here for weeks. A Russian advance here would allow the Kremlin to claim it's captured all of the Luhansk region, the key objective of Vladimir Putin's war. But the Ukrainians are putting up resistance.

Soldiers they clearly don't mind that they get killed in battle, and it's sort of wave after wave of Russian soldiers coming at them, some in ambushes and some just sort of constantly targeting them. And so, definitely, there's been an uptick in fighting. Their goal obviously is to exhaust Ukrainian forces, so that when they come in, you know, wave after wave, eventually, they send in the most professional fighters at a point where Ukrainian soldiers are exhausted already, and running low on ammunition.",

We spoke to Michael Schwartz, our reporter, in the really the story was led by him. But we've met both on the front line, the trip to the front line was very quick. It was extremely dangerous.

Congresswoman Craig says he blocked her from the leaving the elevator and punched her in the face. Congressman Craig since she escaped by fighting back. Luckily, she had a hot cup of coffee on her. She was able to throw that at him. Congresswoman Craig is now OUTFRONT. And, Congresswoman, look, this is -- you know, just even hear this, I'm so glad you're okay. I mean, it's disturbing and terrifying. Get in an elevator something like this happens, it's really terrifying. What else can you tell me about what happened and when you realize that there was something really wrong? REP. ANGIE CRAIG (D-MN):  Well, it was clear from the start that I was going to have to try to reason with him in the beginning to get out of the elevator. He slipped in just as my doors were closing and of course I tried to stop the progress of the elevator immediately and ask him to get out of my elevator. But he insisted on following me up, he wouldn't get out and, so, look at the end of the day, he jumped in front of the buttons of the elevator, I asked to go to my apartment, and it was no way in hell he was going to get to my apartment.
