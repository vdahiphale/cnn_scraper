The U.S. State Department says it's working to free kidnapped American nurse Alix Dawsonville and her child in Haiti. They were abducted on Thursday, according to the Christian Aid Organization, where she works. CNN's Athena Jones has the latest.ATHENA JONES, CNN U.S. NATIONALCORRESPONDENT: Well, we know U.S. authorities are working closely with their Haitian counterparts and with U.S. government interagency partners to try to resolve this crisis, but there's also a lot of things we don't know. It's unclear right now who is responsible for this kidnapping or whether they've made any demands, whether for ransom or anything else. El Roi Haiti, which is a humanitarian organization, the Christian humanitarian organization this nurse from New Hampshire was working for, put out a statement. Here's what they said in part. \"Alix is a deeply compassionate and loving person who considers Haiti her home, and the Haitian people, her friends and family. Alix has worked tirelessly as our school and community nurse to bring relief to those who are suffering, as she loves and serves the people of Haiti in the name of Jesus.\" Now, El Roi has also said their highest priority is the safe return of this mother and her child, and they want to limit the amount of information they're sharing. We also heard from a State Department spokesperson saying that they have no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas. But this kidnapping comes at a time of growing concerns about the worsening violence in Haiti. It was just two years ago this month that then President Jovenel Moise was assassinated by a gang, and there's been a power vacuum ever since, with some gangs taking control of various different swaths of the country. The State Department has warned Americans not to travel to Haiti because of the frequency of kidnappings, crimes, civil unrest, and also the poor health infrastructure. And just last week, the State Department ordered all family members and non-emergency personnel of the embassy to leave the country immediately because it's so unsafe. This came after at least three days in a row of restrictions where embassy staffers and families were supposed to stay there on the embassy compound because things were so dangerous. The U.N. Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, said during a recent visit to Haiti that Haitians are trapped in a living nightmare with humanitarian conditions that are beyond appalling. Guterres went on to say, we are calling for a robust security force deployed by member states to work hand in hand with the Haitian national police to defeat and dismantle the gangs and restore security across the country. But bottom line here, we're still awaiting more details of this scary and dangerous situation there in Haiti. Athena Jones, CNN, New York. CHURCH: And earlier, I spoke with Pierre Esperance, Executive Director of the National Human Rights Defense Network, about the situation in Haiti. He says the government needs to be doing more.

Back five years ago, in lead July, we'd seen an attack which had killed over a hundred people. The Islamic State had claimed responsibility for that. Now, the Islamic State has previously been targeting the JUI in the district of Bajaur, yet, however, we do not have a claim of responsibility. There has been a wide number of people condemning the attack, the Prime Minister, the Interior Minister. There is an investigation underway. But as of right now, no claim of responsibility. A heightened sense of insecurity in the country. There has been an increase in militant attacks in this country.Since the beginning of the year, in January, we saw over 80 people being killed after an attack on a mosque. The Pakistani Taliban, the other predominant militant group in this country has denied responsibility for this attack. So again, we're going to have to wait to see how this day unfolds and whether there will be more from the investigation on from whichever militant group comes forward to claim responsibility.

The area in that region that we're talking about is actually on the border itself. This, if trueIf true, and we haven't had anything from the Ukrainian side or seen any verifiable images or video of this yet, but it would be the third time in four days that Russia is blaming Ukraine for an attack on its soil. There was a missile that hit the Rostov region on Friday that Russia claims it shot down, but still 14 people were injured. On Sunday morning, the early hours of Sunday morning, Moscow, again targeted by drones, they were, Russia claims, also shot down, but led to damage in the Moscow city area, a business district in the west of Moscow high-rise buildings there damaged. You can see from those images, and it comes after we heard comments from President Zelenskyy on Sunday saying, gradually, he said, the war is returning to the territory of Russia, and this is an inevitable natural and fair process. So, I think, look, again, nothing from Ukraine on this latest strike this morning in Bryansk, but it does speak to a strategy, not only given that we've seen also attacks in the Crimean Peninsula, an effort to hit behind enemy lines, but also, I think, more significantly here, a real, concerted effort to bring the war to the Russian people to make it impossible for them to ignore it.

And so, separately, we are also hearing that Ukraine is planning to hold what they're calling peace talks in Saudi Arabia. The Wall Street Journal says it'll be this coming weekend. But this is a process by which Ukraine is trying to sort of rally international support around President Zelenskyy's 10-point peace plan, bring in more backers for that plan. The talks are set to include developing countries such as India and Brazil. So, it doesn't include Moscow.

Now, this was rolled out by the Department of Education in a beta website opening up applications during a test period for the latest version of the Income-Driven Student Loan Repayment Plan that the administration is calling the Safe Plan.Now, this would apply to those who have federal student loans. Private student loans are not part of this and it applies to current loan holders, as well as future borrowers, as well. This plan would be based on your income and family size and the Department of Education is estimating that one million borrowers could potentially see their payments go to $0 per month. This will be based on discretionary income so that money that you have after paying your taxes and also other living expenses. And individuals who are making $32,805 or less in families of four making $67,500, they would see their monthly payments wiped down to zero. Another interesting component of this plan is that as you are paying off the student debt, the interest would no longer accrue on those federal loans. Now others, when this plan goes into full effect next summer, they can see their payments cut in half and ultimately could have them all forgiven if they make their payments on time for 10 years. So, this is the latest effort from the Biden administration to try to offer relief to student loan borrowers after the Supreme Court had struck down President Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Plan. Now, there have been Income Driven Repayment Plans in the past going back decades, and officials that I spoke with believe that they do have the legal standing, the legal grounds for this type of program because Congress has given them authority to build these income-based repayment plans. So ultimately, they do not think that there will be a successful legal challenge since they hadn't seen those with this plan in the past.

CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Thirty-nine-year old Mark Mechikoff is now facing a felony murder charge after police say he filmed himself stabbing a woman and then posted that video on Facebook. Police saying he filmed her last moments. Now, this all started on Wednesday when the Nye County Sheriff's Department in Nevada actually called the San Mateo Police Department saying that they received a call from a woman saying she watched the stabbing on Facebook. That woman was able to provide a name and a phone number, and that information led authorities to an apartment complex. They say it was actually a large building, so it took them about three hours as they went door to door trying to find the suspect or the victim in this case. Unfortunately, they found that woman that had been killed, and authorities say that the two did have a connection, but so far they do not know what the exact motive was in this case. Now, he was arraigned on Friday and assigned a public defender. We have not been able to locate that public defender, and it is also important to point out that we reached out to Meta to ask exactly why that video was on there, how long it took or how long it was posted on the website before they took it down.

Now, it's part of a global trend of digitizing border security. The U.S. government is also investing in it on the U.S.-Mexico border. The European Union is also investing with things like automated lie detectors and facial recognition technologies.But the question is really what is this technology and the information it provides going to be used for? Because the A.I. companies are advertising that this tech has life-saving capabilities, that it can help save lives by improving the times of rescue operations, alerting authorities to people in distress faster. But what we found with this investigation is we looked into the deadliest incident in the English Channel last year where four people died and we found no evidence this technology was used and we found it was part of a campaign of deterrence. Have a watch of what we found. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLGLASE (voice-over): It's three in the morning on the 14th of December 2022 in the middle of the English Channel. A fisherman has spotted multiple people in the water and is trying to haul them out.",

Please, we are in the water.POLGLASE (voice-over): And just before 2 AM, the boat had made a distress call here to Utopia 56, a French migrant charity that passed it on to the French and U.K. authorities. The French coast guards say the boat is undetectable on shipping radar, but estimate it will shortly cross into British waters. Now, CNN has found that, at the time of the incident, the U.K. government had expensive A.I. technology designed to spot these boats, and knowing that the vessel was soon entering their territory, and that there were people freezing in the water, including children, they could have sent this. A Takeva AR-5 drone designed to detect small boats and capable of deploying a life raft. It's licensed by the U.K. government. Even the British prime minister proud to show it off. CNN has established it flew over the same area where the distress call was made on multiple previous journeys. It even flew the day before and after the incident, but not in the hours the vessel was sinking. Instead, it took more than an hour for the first U.K. lifeboat to arrive. In which time, a fishing crew rescued the majority on board. This tech forms part of a campaign of deterrence and hostility by the government towards those attempting to reach British shores. Millions of pounds have been spent on A.I. cameras trained to find rubber dinghies, some able to see beyond U.K. waters, drones with automatic identification abilities. Companies tout their life-saving capabilities. Footage from these drones is also being used to identify those driving the boats and prosecute them for human trafficking. A new bill will take it even further, criminalizing anyone who seeks asylum in the U.K. this way.",

But unfortunately, the reality on the ground is the opposite. It's assisting powerful actors to be able to sharpen their borders, make it more difficult for people to come, and again, using surveillance for this kind of ends.POLGLASE (voice-over): And it follows a global trend in digitizing border security. The same sentry towers made by the American tech startup Anduril that line the U.S.-Mexico border have recently been installed along the British coastline to identify and track boats. Another company, Sirius Insight AI, whose technology is also available to the U.K. authorities, insisted their tech is used for saving lives, but stopped short of talking about how the government uses it.",
