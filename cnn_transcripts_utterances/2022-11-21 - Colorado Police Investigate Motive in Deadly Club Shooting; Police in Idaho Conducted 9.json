But when it came to the football and the atmosphere, well, it wasreally quite bizarre for a World Cup opener. Yes, you had the Ecuador fans bringing their usual yellow wall and chorus of chants. Then they were opposed by a really well orchestrated group of Qatari fans with their songs, with their chants, who we'd actually seen practicing when we were here in April for one of the games. But that group was in stark contrast to the majority of the Qatari fans watching in a much more moderated stoic fashion. And when it came to the second half, a lot of them decided not to stick around. They had seen enough of the football because it really wasn't very inspiring from the hosts. This was their big moment on the world stage, a first-ever World Cup finals match with the eyes of the world watching. It really didn't go to plan. Their coach Felix Sanchez -- I think understatement of the year -- said there's room for improvement. But remember, Max, this is the day that this tournament was meant to start.
