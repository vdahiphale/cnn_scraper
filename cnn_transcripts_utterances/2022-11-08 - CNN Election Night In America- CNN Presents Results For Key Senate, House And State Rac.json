Right now, polls are about to close in the political powerhouse of California as well as three other states out west.We have some projections for you now, wwo for Democrats, one for Republican. In California, CNN is projecting that Senator Alex Padilla, who was appointed to that seat after Kamala Harris became the vice president, that he will be elected senator from California, defeating Mark Meuser. In Illinois, CNN is projecting that incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth will be reelected, defeating Kathy Salvi. And in Idaho, CNN is projecting that incumbent Republican Senator Mike Crapo will be reelected, defeating David Roth. States that are too early to call at this hour: In Washington State, incumbent Democratic Senator Patty Murray is running against a strong challenge from Tiffany Smiley, the Republican. That race, right now, CNN deems it too early to call. In Oregon, Senator Ron Wyden is running for reelection, that race as well, too early to call. Let's look at the balance of power. As you know, there are 100 seats in the U.S. Senate. Democrats currently have 42 of them. Republicans currently have 44 of them. The fight over these 14 remaining seats is what we are going to be covering for the next few hours. Republicans need to pick up one net democratic seat in order to wrest control of the U.S. Senate. We have some governor's races to report for you now. Let's go to Boris Sanchez.",

      "sentences": "Jake, a handful of projections to make. In all them, the incumbent keeping the governor's mansion.We begin in California with Governor Gavin Newsom. Remember, he survived a recall election last year. There are whispers that he may be considering a presidential run in 2024. He easily defeats election questioner Brian Dahle to win reelection in California. In the most expensive governor's race in the country but perhaps one of the least competitive, incumbent Democrat billionaire J.B. Pritzker, who largely self-funded his own campaign, he defeats election denier Darren Bailey to win reelection in Illinois. Let's get a look at Maine now. There, the incumbent Democrats, Janet Mills, had a close race this summer with former two-time Governor Paul Lepage, but Lepage fumbled a question about abortion rights during a debate and Mills never looked back, maintaining an advantage in polling. Tonight, she wins another four years in Maine. This time, in Idaho, the Republican incumbent, Brad Little, he will win reelection in a state that Donald Trump carried by some 60- percentage points in 2020. He defeats educator Stephen Heidt to win reelection in Idaho. Some key race alerts now to bring you, beginning in a true toss-up state in Wisconsin. Remember, Joe Biden won here by very slim margin in 2020. Right now, Tony Evers leads by 62,000 votes ahead of election questioner Tim Michels. Sixty-two percent of the vote in in the state of Wisconsin. We have an update for you now from Michigan. Gretchen Whitmer growing her lead against Tudor Dixon, the conservative commentator. Ninety- eight thousand votes ahead, roughly seven percentage point advantage for Whitmer. Thirty-three percent of the vote in in Michigan. And what would a key race alert slew be without the state of Georgia? Brian Kemp, the Republican incumbent, 305,000 votes ahead right now of Stacey Abrams. About nine percentage points with 86% of the vote in in the state of Georgia. As we hand it over to Kasie Hunt with an update on the senators. I would be surprised if you did not update us on Georgia.",

That is really what we are looking at in order to determine whether or not Republicans are going to be able to wrest control of the House of Representatives.Of the 23 competitive seats that Republicans need to win in order to take control, they are currently leading in 17 of them, 17 out of 23. So, that is pretty good. Let's take a look at the Democrats now. Democrats have a taller order on their hands. They need to win 50 of the 82 competitive seats. Right now, they are leading in 35 of them. So, neither party is where they need to be. Republicans have a slight lead -- an easier job to do in terms of what they need to do. Let's take a look at where we are right now in the battle for control of the House of Representatives. And again, this is where -- these are not called races, necessarily. This is where the vote is.",

Narrowed it down just make it easier to understand the stakes in the battleground competitive districts. We bring them up now and you just see, just looking at the map, you don't need the map to see more blues than Republicans had hoped.You still mentioned the key point, though. This is a very tough climate for Democrats. The margin is so small. Republicans need only a net gain of five, which is eminently doable when you look at the map. But we talked earlier, could Republicans pick up seats in New England? Again, we are not done now. Let me stretch it out for you a little bit, stretch out the map of New England. If you look at the map right now, again, a lot of these races are not called, Republicans thought they could pick up one or two in New Hampshire, they picked up one in Maine, they might get one in Rhode Island and they might get one in Connecticut. They are all blue at the moment. They are all blue at the moment. So, if you had a lot of red on this map here, just in New England, you would be taking that would be the building block away. You have no such building block here. It does not mean Republicans don't get the majority, but you do not have it. And so, again, some of these races are yet to be called, including the Maine race. I just want to peek at it and bring it up here. Ranked choice voting, this could go on for a while. But you see, we just called the democratic governor's reelection. The Democratic candidate here in what is a republican plus six District, Jarred Golden, has proven he's a tough Democrat, often at odds with his national party. He is leading there. Again, still a ways to go. Let's come down to the state of New York in the competitive districts there. If you walk right through it here, I still want to peek in on this one, this is Sean Patrick Maloney, he's ahead of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, 65% of the vote now, and he is losing by 11 points, if look at that. It does not mean we are done. We still have more votes to count. But this would be a trophy for Republicans in their quest not only for a House majority but to knock off a very prominent Democrat and the deputy of Speaker Nancy Pelosi. So, Jake, as we go back to you, we are still working on a House map. It looks okay for the Republicans but it does not look like a blowout.",

Maggie Hassan will be reelected, CNN is projecting.This is a seat that Republicans thought they could win. They thought they could defeat Hassan. They were very bullish. They were talking all week about momentum being their way. And instead, Maggie Hassan, the Democratic senator, holds on to that seat, CNN is projecting. Let's look at the balance of power right now in the U.S. Senate. You know, 100 seats, Democrats currently controlled 43 of those seats with Hassan keeping her seat. Republicans- have 44 of them. There are 13 seats remaining. Republicans need to pick up one net democratic seat in order to wrest control of the U.S. Senate. Those 13 seats are what we are waiting to see to determine if they are able to achieve that. But there are governor's races, too, and we are going to go to Boris Sanchez with some major news there.",

Let's just isolated the competitive races. That's what I was trying to do.You see out here, you may remember Katie Porter. She's a prominent Democrat progressive. Her district in Southern California has a competitive race. But let's just come to the middle of the country for a minute and look at these races because, as you said, here's another one of these vulnerable frontline Democrats, Elissa Slotkin. You look at this right now and you say, 43%, the Republican has the lead. I just want to isolate it by county to go through some of these -- this is what is going on in their campaign headquarters right now. Remember, Spanberger held on, right? Slotkin is another one of those frontline Democrats. This is a Democrat zero plus nine. It's a 50/50 district.",

So, you are looking at this, you are saying, red county, red county, red county, this is a very republican county by 20 points. But it is a small county, population wise. Most of the people in this district live here. They live in Bingham County, which is Lansing. It is a 32-point. Joe Biden won this county by 32 points and only 11% of the vote is in.So, Elissa Slotkin, when you pull out to the district, she is losing right now, but you only have 11% of the vote counted in the giant, by far the largest county within the district. [23:30:04] So, this one here is far from over. You pull it out, let us come back, there is Michigan in the Midwest. Let us pull out to the national map. Jake was just talking about how close many of these races are. These are just the competitive races, right? So, you want to look at win margin. The lighter the color, the more displaced. Let me get that to kick in. Look at all these races that are incredibly competitive as you go through them. Let's pop up the state of New York. This one through up here in the Rochester area, you have a Democratic incumbent who is losing, Joseph Morelle losing 49.1%, 3,300 votes. You see it is up by county now and you see Rochester. Let me turn the county up and get to the entire district and come out here. Another race right down here. You have, I think Jake mentioned this, Mark Molinaro, the Republican candidate, against Josh Riley, 50.3% to 49.7%, 1,700 votes. This is the environment that is playing about across the country tonight. Democrats fighting to hold their House majority or at least to keep any new republican majority as small as possible. One race that is not close, if you look here, this is the chairman of the Democratic Campaign Committee who, with 68% of the vote in, is losing quite significantly. We will see if that holds up. Again, I said this earlier, this would be a trophy for Republicans because he is such a prominent lieutenant of Nancy Pelosi and runs the campaign fundraising arm. But that one is not done yet either. I just want to pull out back to the national map again. You see the white or the lighter, those who are closer or competitive races. So, they are coast to coast. The vote count has to be more early out here. Let me talk of the race here and look as well -- Tom O'Halleran, a vulnerable Democrat in the state of Arizona, losing by 2,100 votes to Eli Crane. These are the building blocks, if you try to think Republicans need a net gain of five, if these frontline Democrats who are in the tough districts who you are going to watch, especially as we get closer to knowing, calling more races in the east and coming out to the west. And so, you see more of the light races out here. We will continue to count them. Again, Republicans favored to take the House majority, but you are looking at this map right now, Jake, and it is incredibly competitive. The Democrats are fighting tenaciously at least to limit that.",

So, let me bring in the uncounted vote. Among the mail vote, about a quarter of the mail vote is still out and that is a 36.5-percentadvantage category for Raphael Warnock. So, that is significant because a quarter of it is still out. He also has an 8.4-percentage advantage among early in-person voting, but there is really little left of that to count. Here is what I find super interesting. Herschel Walker's margin of success over Warnock with election day voters is now at about 19.1%. That's a little bit lower than we had seen earlier. And there was a huge amount of the election day vote uncounted when we talk about this race earlier, guys. Now, it is down to 28.4%. That remains to be counted. And I want to remind everyone, I'm going to click off here the election day vote. These two categories of early vote, the mail, early in-person combined, we expect to be the larger share of the overall vote. We expect that to make up about 61% of the overall vote. The election day vote, which is the Walker category here where he is beating Warnock by about 19% now with the election day vote, that, we expect, at the end of the day, is going to be about 40% of the overall vote.

But the question was, will these other things come into play? The Dobbs decision, extremism, Trump, all of these have played into this to make this not the normal midterm election. It is really, really interesting.",

Maggie Hassan was a beatable candidate. That could've been a pick up for Republicans. But solely because of Donald Trump, he ended up being the nominee. He is celebrating O'Dea, a moderate losing in Colorado.

She took over, of course, for disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo after he resigned. She defeats Congressman Lee Zeldin to win a first full term in the state of New York.Next, an update for you from the state of Minnesota. Tim Walz, the incumbent Democrat, projected to win reelection there against Scott Jensen, a physician who made some dubious claims about the COVID-19 vaccine.

In the U.S. Senate, 100 seats, Democrats control 46 of the seats, Republicans control 46 of the seats, there are eight seats remaining. All Republicans need to do is win one next democratic seat and they can wrest control of the Senate.But Republicans are definitely not having the night that they thought they were going to have when it comes to picking up seats. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Democrats control 146 seats, Republicans control 183 seats, including five pickups, 106 seats remaining. Remember, the magic number there is 218. Neither party has achieved that as of yet. Let's look at some of these states in the competitive races in the state of play. At the beginning of the night, we told you there were 82 competitive House races we're keeping an eye on. Republicans need to win 23 of them as of now. They are leading in 26 of them. So right now, they are on track to be able to win control of the House of Representatives. But we're not making that call yet. That is the status as of right now with the votes as of right now. But right now, leading in 26 competitive seats, they need to win 23. How about the Democrats? Democrats need to win 49 competitive seats, and they are leading in 40 competitive seats. So, Democrats not where they need to be. Let's go back to the Senate races. I want to bring in Kasie Hunt. Kasie, tell us what's going on because we got some Senate races. I need to know what's going to happen.",
