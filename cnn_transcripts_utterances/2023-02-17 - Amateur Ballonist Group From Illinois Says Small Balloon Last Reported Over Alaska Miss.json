Is it possible that the U.S. government scrambled fighter jets and used a $400,000 sidewinder missile to shot down a $12 hobby balloon from Illinois? What's more troubling? That or that the Pentagon new about Chinese spy balloon during the Trump administration but said nothing? We'll have the latest on both those developments.Plus, trains have become less safe. Tonight, we'll talk about the rollback of regulations that allow them to carry more hazardous material through all of our neighborhoods, just as they did through East Palatine, Ohio, causing that toxic spill.

So, here with me to discuss all of this tonight, we have Natasha Alford, we have L.Z. Granderson, we have Josh Barro, and Chapin Fay. Guys thanks so much for spending Friday night with me. Great to have you guys here. Okay. Let's start. The Northern Illinois Bottle Cap Balloon Brigade is missing a balloon tonight. It is missing their balloon tonight. They last saw it on February 11th over the Yukon. Is it possible, L.Z., that the Pentagon scrambled fighter jets and used a $400,000 sidewinder missile to shoot down an amateur balloon club's balloon? L.Z. GRANDERSON, OP-ED COLUMNIST, LOS ANGELES TIMES:  It is possible. Before we go in and have complete joy and like how crazy that sounds, let's back up like a couple of weeks, right? There was a spy balloon from China, right? And that spy balloon from China freaked us out a little bit. Why? Because the year before, China and Russia said before the world, our bond is unbreakable. A couple months after that, they're doing military exercises together. So, I do not fault the administration after the Chinese spy balloon for blowing up a toy balloon.",

The safety rule issued in 2015 required electronically controlled brakes, which apply braking simultaneously across a train rather railcar by railcar over a span of seconds. He wanted it to be installed by 2023.The rule only applied to certain high hazard flammable trains, case and point. The Trump administration repealed that brakes requirement three years later. If this train had had that, it did not, it would have been able -- well, experts have said it would have been able to stop before derailment. FAY:  Yes, it was mistake. When you're -- conservatives and Republicans, ever since time immemorial, have talked about cutting regulations. In my mind, it doesn't mean safety regulations. It doesn't mean, exactly what you said, things that will make our transportation system safer. There is a lot of blame to go around for this situation and I'm sure we'll get to all of it. But the overall point I would like to make is our train system is like light years behind almost every other developed place in the world. You know, getting places in China takes, you know, a couple of hours, where, you know, you have to board a flight here in America to do the same thing.

Because what I have read is that they're sort of crunching the numbers differently because now they have so many more cars on each train. They've added more cars. It's gotten longer. So, if you add 26 more cars on there, that can derail but it counts somehow different than the whole train derailing. I don't know how to explain it, but they're using different numbers.",

And it got back up to about the same level with a significantly lower number of train derailments. And then as with a lot of things with the pandemic, things went a little bit haywire. There was a significant decline in train traffic at least initially.But my understanding is that it mainly has to do with higher quality of the tracks. You have fewer broken rails. So, that's separate from the braking issue. Obviously, there's a lot of different regulations, a lot of different safety considerations, and a lot of things that you can get wrong here. I just think it's worth noting that we've had certain improvements there. And the U.S. has a relative high reliance on freight rail compare to tracking, compared to Europe for example and that has environmental benefits, has benefits in terms of producing wear and tear and traffic on highways. And so I think it's the clear -- this was a regulatory mistake. They should have had this sort of braking system requirement on these trains. But there's also significant value in having the reliance that we have on freight rail for transportation. So, it's a matter of finding the right set of regulations to reduce frequency of derailments further, to especially focus on these trains would be specially hazardous if they did derail. But it's sort of -- this one horrible event happened. But you have -- the choices that we will make on regulation are not just about not repeating this one specific incident, it's about building a system that is safe overall.",

If those -- if those classes are adequately resourced, it doesn't appear that tracking actually hurts those students in a way that it does where you don't resource them and they do appear to be benefits for students who are tracking into the classes.

I think it's complete trash to get rid of the AP courses, in part, because students who graduate with AP courses are able to transfer them and be able to use them to help graduate college. That's a money saving measure as well. So, it isn't just the achievement in high school, it's about saving pennies on the other side.I mean, if you are going to get an associates degree, taking AP courses can get you like almost a fourth of the way they're depending on what time you start. So, I am more concerned about how does this impact students financially on the opposite end that you get rid of the AP courses. And with your raised question is concerned, listen, especially when it comes to DeSantis, the founding member of the, what, freedom caucus, the person who after the primary said, let's not monkey up the budget and Florida in regards to his candidate, his opponent, who happens to be black. I think it when it comes to DeSantis specifically, he does not mind using these opportunities to blow a -- to blow a dog whistle, but I think holistically in terms of our conversation as a whole, it's about resources, and I hate the fact that kids who could be using this as a leg up for college are getting this taken away from them.",
