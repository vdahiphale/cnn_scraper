They will square off on this stage in Philadelphia, maybe the most important 90 minutes of the campaign. The prime-time showdown is their only scheduled debate of this presidential race so far with less than two months until Election Day. Both candidates are determined to break away. This \"New York Times\"/Siena College poll shows no clear leader, with both Harris and Trump locked in a statistical stalemate. Polls vary, but this is about as close as it gets. This hour up on Capitol Hill, we should note a Gold Medal ceremony for the 13 U.S. service members killed in the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. They will be honored. Members of both parties are honoring the fallen. We will dip into that live in just a few moments from now, so stay with us for that. But in the meantime, joining me now to talk about the debate is former deputy communications director for Vice President Kamala Harris Rachel Palermo and former Trump administration official Matt Mowers. Rachel, let me start with you first. What do you want to hear from Vice President Harris tonight? I mean, does she have to look at tonight as kind of an introduction to voters? We're seeing polls that show a huge chunk of voters just -- they just want to know more about the vice president.",

And she has this really powerful vision of wanting to bring our country forward, not bringing it back. And she's fighting for opportunity. She's fighting for fundamental freedoms. And she really does represent the future of this country. And so I think it's a really important opportunity for her to lay out that vision and that contrast with Donald Trump.",

He talked a lot about immigration, talked a lot about inflation. Going into debates and been in debate prep for presidential candidates, you often want to have just a couple of core things you're doing, because you never quite know all of the questions that are going to come your way. So to overprepare for every single question I think is usually a mistake actually a lot of candidates make. But if you're Donald Trump, there's two core things you have to do. You have to compare life under the Trump administration to life under the Biden/Harris administration when it comes to the cost of living, as well as the sense of security. And the second thing he has to do is just hold Kamala Harris to her own words from 2019 and 2020, when she staked out these very left-wing positions, and then make her try to defend why she no longer supports them. Try to make her actually go out of her way to try to defend doing a backflip a few weeks before an election. He doesn't even have to go that far. He just has to remind voters of what she actually said back then.",

And Donald Trump told his allies to not pass it because he wanted to make sure that immigration was an issue this election.

Obviously, the speaker of the House does control the schedule. I don't think it's a coincidence it's happening today. It's hard to prove. But we have seen a lot of activity.

So, that was negotiated with a bunch of countries around the world. So, this was not a ratified treaty by the Senate.

And it was keeping the country together. And I don't think it was an accident that Vladimir Putin moved an army of 70,000 soldiers to the border of Ukraine a few months after we left Afghanistan because it looked like the United States is pulling back from the world. I mean, he was going to do that at some point, but I think he saw this as a sign of weakness. Which, I mean, there's no way to sugarcoat this. This was a -- it made the withdrawal from Saigon in 1975 look like the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. I mean, this was a total fiasco. And it was a predictable one. I actually wrote for CNN in April 2021 when Biden announced the withdrawal, saying, this is going to be a fiasco. You didn't need any special information, any classified information, because it's obvious. Once the Americans pulled out completely, once they started talking about it particularly, which we have been doing for years under the Trump administration, then under the Biden administration, it undercut the Afghan government and Afghan military.",

We know people will have to resort to communicating through Signal and encrypted messages and worry about people knocking on their door in the dead of the night to come after them if they dissent against their government.

Having security on our border, she's not going to play politics with it. She's going to go for a solution, not for the politics. And then she needs to tell the story of how she's always done this. She and I both got our start in the same prosecutor's office in Oakland. We didn't overlap, but we worked for the same boss. And that boss described the prosecutor's office as an aircraft carrier. He said some lawyers work on the flight crew. Some lawyers, very few amount of lawyers, are the fighter pilots who take on the hardest cases and bring justice.
