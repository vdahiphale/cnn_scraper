It's 3The U.N. secretary-general said he was horrified by what he saw, and this video explains why. We should warn you it is very graphic. The Israeli military admits it struck an ambulance just outside the al Shifa hospital. The explosion left a scene of carnage and chaos with at least 15 people reported killed according to Hamas-run health authorities. The ambulance was said to be part of a convoy carrying patients to southern Gaza. The IDF claims the ambulance was being used by Hamas, which it said has used emergency vehicles to transport fighters and weapons in the past. Eleni Giokos, she's following developments for us from Abu Dhabi. Eleni, let's start with the airstrike on the ambulance convoy. What's the latest?",

And we also have seen the images of the strewn bodies on the street. U.N. secretary general saying this was horrific and absolutely harrowing to see some of these images.Look, the Palestinian Red Crescent said it was part of that convoy that was carrying injured people and patients into the south. We know that the International Red Cross knew about this. They were aware of this convoy. But even though they weren't involved, it does not justify any attack on an ambulance. The IDF's position is that they were targeting Hamas operatives, and there are many questions around this because we know this convoy was specifically assisting the injured. Look, the death toll in Gaza is becoming untenable not only for people watching on in international organizations that have been calling for a cease-fire or some kind of pause, but also for the United States in terms of questioning the proportionality of the response of the terror attack on October 7th. As the death toll rises and we're seeing these harrowing images, mostly of children being pulled out of rubble, and of course losing their lives, there are a lot of questions coming through right now. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken who was in Israel yesterday and also talking to Benjamin Netanyahu specifically mentioned the disproportional response we've been seeing coming through and also the impacts on children. I want you to take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I've seen images, too, of Palestinian children, young boys and girls, pulled from the wreckage of buildings. When I see that -- when I look into their eyes through the TV screen, I see my own children. How can we not? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That would be 450 trucks, aid trucks per day.Now since October 7th, the number according to the Palestinian Red Crescent is 374. We actually saw a significant number of aid trucks going into Gaza yesterday. [03:05:03] Antony Blinken was very clear that more aid needs to be going into the strip. Look, you also just had that conversation with UNRWA, who was just talking about a very dire situation that it's very tough choices, he said, need to be made right now. Where people are getting bread and a tin of canned cheese and figuring out how to actually distribute that in a place where you have food deficits, you have water issues, and, of course, medical supplies are not coming in quickly enough. We've heard from doctors that are operating on patients without anesthetics, without any disinfectants as well. Some doctors have been posting they've been using vinegar. It just goes to show the enormity of this issue. The issue of fuel is a sticking point that has been raised and the U.S. is discussing this. The IDF and the Israeli position is it might end up in Hamas' hands. On the other end, you've got hospitals that have had to shut down operations because they do not have fuel for generators to keep critical operations going. And that is the reality, that if you extract fuel from this conversation, that means you can't supply for desalination plants, supplying key water. I mean, you've got the sewage issue which, of course, is also creeping in as one of the big issues. Look, a big call for a cease-fire, the U.S. calling at least for some kind of pause not only for mediation talks, but also to allow more aid to come in. It is a big conversation that is happening, I think, with all international organizations, putting enormous pressure on Israel right now, and, of course, the humanitarian plights that we are seeing playing out in real time in the Gaza Strip.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The U.S. military's flying surveillance drones over Gaza in attempt to provide Israelis with intel about the possible location of hostages and assist in hostage rescue efforts, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the operations. These drones have been flying since October 7th, when the U.S. shortly thereafter said it would help Israel in any way it could on intel and planning for a hostage rescue effort. These drones -- and we don't know what type of drones they are, but these drones have been a part of that. They are unarmed surveillance drones according to the Pentagon, which acknowledged on Friday these operations that are meant to provide intel in the ongoing hostage rescue attempts by flying over southern Gaza. Take a look at this graphic. That red line -- those numerous red lines, I should say, shows the trajectories and the flight paths of these different drones. You can see them focusing there on southern Gaza over the course of the past several days and weeks. Now, this coming as the U.S. now has two carrier strike groups in the eastern Mediterranean Sea that have been operating and exercising together. The Defense Department putting out these images of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group and the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group working together in the Eastern Med. They've been exercising together for the past several days. And then, shortly thereafter, the Pentagon had announced that the Dwight D. Eisenhower will then go through the Suez Canal and be in the waters of U.S. Central Command, the waters of the Middle East, essentially. This as part of a broader effort not only to deter Iran and Iran's proxies and others from getting involved in the fighting in Gaza, but also to make U.S. forces have force protection.

That was the climate that President Biden was visiting over the course of Friday. He met with first responders, nurses, others that were on the front lines of responding to the pair of shootings that happened a little bit more than a week ago now. You can't go far in this Lewiston community and the surrounding areas without seeing signs of support, even just behind me where I am outside the bowling alley, which was the first site of where the mass shootings happened that night.We've got signs of support, saying Lewiston strong, saying things simply like \"be nice\", acknowledging the climate and the pain so many are going through still even at this point. Eighteen people killed total in these shootings, and their families are still trying to figure out how to process. Now, President Biden, along with meeting with first responders, he also met with members of some of the victims' families. He also took some moments to make some remarks about his visit. Take a listen to some of what he said in regards to the political climate around some of these mass shootings.",

This is about common sense, reasonable and responsible measures to protect our children, our families, our communities, because regardless of our politics, this is about protecting our freedom to go to a bowling alley, a restaurant, a school, a church without being shot and killed.",

      "sentences": "In just over two weeks, a three-judge panel here in Washington will hear arguments about whether or not this gag order is constitutional. And while that is pending, the former president is not subject to these specific restrictions.Now, Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge overseeing the election subversion case here in Washington, the case filed by special counsel Jack Smith, she imposed these restrictions at the request of prosecutors. Most defendants know they are not supposed to attack witnesses or go after the prosecutor, but the special counsel's office asked for a broader set of restrictions on Trump after he made a series of statements appearing to attack the judge, witnesses, and prosecutors. Now, his lawyers have argued that these restrictions are unconstitutional, that they violate his First Amendment, but Judge Chutkan has said that Trump's First Amendment rights must yield to the orderly administration of justice. She points to the fact that she has a trial to put on, and these restrictions are essential to protecting people, she says, who are just trying to do their jobs. Now, this case will be heard before two judges appointed by former President Barack Obama and one judge appointed by President Joe Biden. Again, that argument will happen later this month. It's unclear when we could get an answer, but this question about whether you can restrict the speech of a presidential candidate who is a criminal defendant across multiple jurisdictions, this is something that the courts just have never contemplated before, and it could possibly wind up at the Supreme Court.

And in the evolution of the solar system and our earth, 4.5 billion years, first there was a star that was spit out of a cloud of dust and gas. That became a medium-sized star called our sun. And then all of these gases and dusts started forming into smaller planets, and some of them were bigger.And then things crashed into each other, and planets crashed into each other. And over that 4.5 billion years, some of these asteroids that are flying through space are the remnants of those early collisions. And it gives us, then, when we bring a sample back or we send a spacecraft like Psyche out to an asteroid closer to Jupiter, we can determine what is in that asteroid. And this particular asteroid, Bennu, we know it has ice crystals, and it has carbon. And those are the building blocks to life.",
