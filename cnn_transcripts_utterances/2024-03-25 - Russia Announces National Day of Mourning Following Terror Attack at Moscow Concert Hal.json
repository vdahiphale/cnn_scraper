But this is just one electronic wasteland. An alarming new U.N. report says that since 2010, the amount of global e- waste has grown five times faster than it can be collected and recycled. According to the study, a record 62 million metric tons of e-waste was produced in 2022. That`s an increase of 82% from 2010. And the world is on track to generate a whopping 82 million tons of e-waste in 2030. What`s more, e-waste recycling only produces 1% of the rare earth elements needed to meet the current demand, which leaves the world highly dependent on just a few countries where rare earths are mined, including countries in Africa. The continent generates the lowest amount of e-waste, but recycling rates there are below 1%. A high-level official with the International Telecommunication Union says it`s up to the manufacturers to make a difference by giving devices a longer life cycle. While some countries have implemented environmental regulations to tackle the problem, some are working on a more grassroots level. Places like the Fixing Factory in London are teaching consumers to make more sustainable choices.",

At a total cost of more than $100 billion, the ISS holds the record for most expensive object in history. We recently had the opportunity to speak with two astronauts who worked at the International Space Station, Dr. Peggy Whitson and John Shoffner. One of their main aims now is to inspire the next generation of astronauts. Mr. Shoffner started the International Space Art and Poetry Contest, and you can enter. Submit your space-themed art or poetry at spaceartcontest.com, and the lucky winners will see their masterpieces floating in space with astronauts. The submission deadline is April 5th, so get those wheels turning. We`d love nothing more than to share the story of a CNN 10 artist or poet gone galactic.
