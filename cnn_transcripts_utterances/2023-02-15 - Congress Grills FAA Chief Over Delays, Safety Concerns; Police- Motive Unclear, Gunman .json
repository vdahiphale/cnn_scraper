Why the agency cannot be so sure there will not be more runway near misses and grounded flights. Plus, Nikki Haley officially kicks off her 2024 campaign, bringing a pledge to bring in a new generation of leadership. But how long can she maintain this delicate dance, throwing subtle shade at Trump while not alienating his supporters? And hey, you know, that first flying object shot down, the one that was deemed a Chinese spy balloon -- U.S. intel says maybe it wasn't supposed to be over the continental U.S. after all. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. We start with our politics lead and the airport chaos taking over Capitol Hill after the series of near collisions and the nationwide ground stop that led to thousands of delayed and canceled flights. The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Billy Nolen, today faced bipartisan criticism and probing by lawmakers who hauled him before the Senate Commerce Committee where Nolan admitted there remain vulnerabilities in the system that led to that ground stop, a computer system known as NOTAM. The issue with the NOTAM system last month led to the first nationwide stoppage of flights since the September 11th attacks in 2001, and, of course, it left tens of thousands of Americans stranded across the country. Just two days later, a Delta flight had to abort its takeoff from Newark's JFK airport after an American Airlines flight crossed right in front of it. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

We want to be able to be in front of this. To me, the signals are out there already that we need to be proactive, not reactive. And I'll tell you this, in my state, in the great state of Alaska, boy, we need huge upgrades to our aviation system. We have over 250 communities that aren't connected by roads, and you need safe travel by air in Alaska but across the country. So the answer to your question is absolutely yes.",

It's a highly classified briefing, but I will tell you this, it was a sobering briefing, because our military advantage relative to the Chinese continues to erode. And we need to focus on that, and I'm calling on the president to focus on that. It was his administration giving this briefing that I just walked out of about the erosion of our advantage relative to the Chinese. And each year, the president sends up a budget for defense that's defense cuts. And, you know, it's a huge disconnect. His administration is literally telling 100 senators right now about the challenges and the erosion of our military advantage, and each year, they send up cuts to the Pentagon. It makes no sense.

I still think we should suspect the worst, like our adversaries, China and Russia.And then you have right after that briefing, Admiral Kirby at the National Security Council staff saying he doesn't think it's China at all. Again, that's a disconnect to what 100 senators were told yesterday, so I think they need to get their story straight. My understanding of that Chinese spy balloon had propulsion to do some directional travel, so I'm not sure it was subject fully to the winds, and it seemed to be directed over Alaska and the rest of the country in a way that was purposeful.
