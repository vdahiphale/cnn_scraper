How much did the state poll averages miss by, all right? The average error since 1972, in the close races, in those battleground states that we've been looking at, 3.4 points, 3.4 points. Every single state. All seven of those key battleground states are within 3.4 points.What's the chance for an even larger error? You know, we talk about the margin of error, right. So, what is that 95 percent confidence interval? What is that true margin of error? Five percent of errors in state polling averages are off by more - off by more than 9.4 points. These battleground states are well within that. I want you to remember this number because the bottom line is, this race is going to be too close to call almost certainly all the way to Election Day. It's definitely going to be within this interval. And its most likely going to be within this interval. So, the bottom line is, the state polling averages tell us, what it tells us is it's just a race that is too close to call. Maybe one candidate has a slight advantage over the other one.

What happens then? Well, then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states, plus Nevada, plus the other states he was leading in, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia. But 2020 is just one election. What happens if we have a polling miss like 2022? Well, in that particular case, now, the winner has flipped again and Kamala Harris wins in a blowout with 319 electoral votes because she retakes those Great Lake battleground states, carries North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona. So, the bottom line here is, yes, we have those state polling averages, but the real thing they tell us is that this race is too close to call.

I think that what the vice president was saying last night is - is true, which is, right now, in this very moment, the most important thing that the United States and the international community can be doing is supporting Ukraine and - against this invasion from Putin and his war of aggression that has been brutal and slaughtered so many people in Ukraine. And she is committed to doing that. I think that what she was saying last night is that, like, there will be a time and place for discussions like that. Right now the most important thing is that the international community rally around Ukraine. CNN, just this morning, has new reporting on Bob Woodward's book that is coming out that reveals that President Trump, since he left office, as a private citizen, has, according to Trump's own aides, had at least seven one-on-one calls with Vladimir Putin. I don't know what those are about. I don't know if the Trump campaign or President Trump have explained what those are about. But what the vice president said last night rings even truer, Donald Trump's plan with Ukraine and Russia would be for Ukraine to surrender and to let Vladimir Putin take territory that he is trying to steal. That is dangerous. It shows the kind of risks that the country would face with him returning to office.",

Does Kamala Harris agree with that? [08:45:03] SAMS: Well, I - again, I'm going to reiterate what the vice president said, which is that there will be a time for that conversation. Right now the conversation should be focused on, how do we make sure Ukraine has the resources it needs to repel Putin and Russia. It is something that she has led the international community on, meeting with President Zelenskyy numerous times and rallying our allies. Donald Trump is saying cede territory to Russia.

Just trying to nail that down a little bit more.Let's move on. Florida's staring down another hurricane. This will be the second major hurricane to hit the state in less than two weeks. A White House official has now told CNN that Vice President Harris reached out to Ron DeSantis, the governor, multiple times since Hurricane Helene, and that the Florida governor did not take any of her calls. Responding to the reports of him not taking her calls, she called it political gamesmanship, irresponsible and selfish, which then led to Ron DeSantis - we don't have the sound bite? We don't have the sound bite. Which then led to Ron DeSantis saying that she has no place - she has no place to be involved in any of these talks with regard to Hurricane Helene recovery, that he has been in touch with Joe Biden, and she's basically trying to get her - she's playing political games by trying to insert herself. What do you say to that? SAMS: What I would say to that right now is, you know, I think, you're right, we saw yesterday that the governor spoke to the president. The vice president has tried to speak to the governor and would look forward to speaking to the governor, because a moment like this is about putting politics aside and making sure that states who are impacted by the devastation, whether it was Hurricane Helene, or preparing for Hurricane Milton to come, which does seem very concerning. And the vice president said yesterday she's been briefed on this from FEMA and is encouraging residents in Florida to listen to their local officials, including Governor DeSantis, about what to do on the ground there as this storm threatens. And I think that what she was speaking to more broadly, which I think is very, very important, is in a moment like this, when you have a choice in a presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, who is actually putting the country first when it comes to preparing for a natural disaster? We know right now Donald Trump's own former aides said that when he was president of the United States, he would hold up relief to places that he didn't think voted for him. He politicized getting people the help they need in a moment of pain and crisis. Vice President Harris absolutely will never do that. She wants to make sure that people in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, the states who have been so impacted by Helene, the states who may be devastated by this hurricane that's barreling toward Florida, that they get the help they need and that they have the resources that they need, which is why she and the president have mobilized thousands of federal personnel, a thousand active duty military, sent millions of liters of water and meals to states who have been impacted by Helene. That's the kind of leadership you need in a moment like this, not Donald Trump, who's lying about disaster relief not getting to places, who's trying to divide Americans who are facing some of their biggest tragedies of their lives. That is what we don't need from a president and a leader in a moment like this.",

      "sentences": "Good to see you, John. You know, Chief Justice John Roberts is starting his 20th term on thebench. I mean talk about very fast 20 years for John Roberts, who was one of the youngest chief justices in history when he first came on. And it's a very fraught time for the court. You know, they've had a series of divisive rulings, including the one giving Donald Trump immunity from prosecution last July. They've got ethics controversies. And as you just mentioned, election litigation could loom over this court once we get to November. But - and - and it's - it's played out in the polls. Multiple surveys show that the court's stature has shrunk. Just one in particular, the Pew Research survey found that 47 percent of Americans had an unfavorable opinion of the Supreme Court after July, when the term ended, and the justices issued that immunity decision. And much of this falls on the shoulders of John Roberts, who, from the start, has tried to differentiate the Supreme Court from the political branches. You probably remember, John, that he famously said, \"we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges,\" we only have neutral judges trying their level best to do right by both sides. But as we start this new term, it's really John Roberts, and opinions he's written, that have put the court in this position. He wrote the Trump ruling. He wrote earlier decisions that favored Republican interests, such as against voting rights and essentially endorsing partizan gerrymandering, rolling back administrative regulation of the environment and consumer affairs. So, this is a fraught time, but a lot of it - and a lot of it lands in his lap. But it's by his own hand, John.",
