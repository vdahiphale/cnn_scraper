These Israelis have insisted that what they`re doing is trying to target military assets. Although that may include, for example, the home of a Hamas leader, where there may be a lot of people involved. There`s a hospital in which, Hamas says, well, that`s a hospital. The Israelis say, yeah, it`s a Hamas base hiding in a hospital. That sort of thing. Going after the entrances to tunnels. The tunnel network there is a big deal going after command-and- control structures. If you look at an overall satellite map of the area, you can see that in the Northern part here, this is where most of this has happened. This is where most of the population lives. Every little orange dot there represents one of the strikes that we know of. There`s been talk of Israeli troops coming into this area as well. What it all adds up to is really, as we said, at the beginning, an extraordinary military assault on this area. Yes, Hamas has still tried to fire some missiles out striking Israel. Some of them have struck. That seems to be greatly reduced as this tremendous military pressure comes into this area. And we wait to see what might come next. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

People in Europe, Africa,Asia, and Western Australia saw it best. But if you were here in the U.S. on the Eastern coast, you may have spotted it too. A lunar eclipse only happens when we have a full moon. We also call that a Hunter`s Moon, which may have gotten its name as it once warned hunters to prepare for a cold winter. Many of you may remember, we learned all about solar eclipses on CNN 10, a few weeks ago. That`s when the moon passes between the earth and sun. Well, for a lunar eclipse, they switch positions. Can you guess how? Here`s CNN`s Rachel Crane to help us out? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Twofactors decide which of three possible eclipses the moon will experience. The tilt of the moon`s orbit around the earth and which of the Earth`s two shadows, the moon falls behind. The Earth`s darker inner shadow is known as the umbra, and the lighter outer one is called the penumbra. The penumbra eclipse is when the moon passes through, you guessed it, just the penumbra. NASA says this type of eclipse is so subtle that if you didn`t know it was happening, you might not even notice it. A partial eclipse is when the moon only gets covered by part of the Earth`s umbra. So only part of it is shaded in darkness by the earth, a partial eclipse happens at least twice a year. And then there`s the big one. The total lunar eclipse. These are rare often separated by years and require the moon earth and sun to be in perfect alignment. But don`t think this blacks out the moon, as the moon shifts deeper into the umbra, it takes on a red hue, which is sometimes called a blood moon. The moon turns red because the atmosphere is filtering out color at the opposite end of the visible spectrum, the blue light. The short-wave lengths of blue don`t travel as far as the long red wave length. So they scatter before reaching our eyes, leaving behind the red glow. Not everyone on earth can see a lunar eclipse at the same time. You`ll need to be in an area facing the moon during the moments it`s shaded by earth, unlike a solar eclipse, you don`t need any special equipment to enjoy a lunar eclipse. They`re safe to watch at any stage. Although a pair of binoculars might make it more fun. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Meaning Rapid Eye Movement, REM sleep is the deep sleep phase where the brain is most active. Ah, to nap or not to nap? That is the next question. Sometimes we just feel like we need a midday slumber, right? Or maybe a lot of times we feel that way. Of course, there is a time and a place for everything. Don`t go falling asleep on your teacher or teachers don`t go falling asleep on your students. Did you know that one-third of adults in the United States take a nap during the day? That`s according to the Pew Research Center. Well, CNN`s Dr. Sanjay Gupta says a little siesta might be more helpful for our brains than we might think. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

These studies showed that it looked like people who took a nap did have better cognitive functions. So their thinking skills improved, whether that be things like how quickly you process things, your memory, those sorts of thinking skills. So the biggest takeaway is that we found very clear effect of having a regular daytime nap on the total size of the brain. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The study found that people who had regular naps saw an objective difference in brain size compared to those who didn`t. We know that as we age, our brain shrink and that can be associated with cognitive decline. And what she`s fundamentally saying is that people who napped regularly in many ways had younger brains than those who didn`t. (On camera):  Is there a right length of a nap?

Your brain is preparing and mimicking that sleep at night and think you`re now ready to sleep for the rest of the day. So in order to avoid that, we`ve been quite conservative and said, well, maybe something up to about 30 minutes. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
