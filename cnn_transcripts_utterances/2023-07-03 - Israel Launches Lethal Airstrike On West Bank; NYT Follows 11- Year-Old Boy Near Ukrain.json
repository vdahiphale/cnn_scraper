      "sentences": "This has turned into the largest Israeli military operation in the occupied West Bank since 2002, since the days of the Second Intifada.What we've seen is huge Israeli number of forces, hundreds of forces, if not up to 1,000 entering especially the refugee camp as well as the use of bulldozers to tear up streets. The Israeli military saying this is because IEDs are being hidden beneath the pavement. And we have even seen the use of drone airstrikes targeting militants. And we have even seen Israeli tanks outside of Jenin itself. But still, it's hard to emphasize just how the image of Israeli tanks in the West Bank. These are things we have not seen since the violent heady days of the Second Intifada in 2002. The Israeli military saying they'd actually been planning this operation for quite some time. It started overnight with what Israeli military is saying are precise drone strikes on militant locations. They say that over the past 18 hours they've been targeting what they say are command centers for militants, a weapons storage sites, explosive manufacturing sites. They say they've targeted some tunnels that militants were using under a mosque. But it has turned the Jenin refugee camp into essentially a war zone. And I was actually just in Jenin yesterday speaking to residents and those same residents today are saying they have never seen anything like this, and they are really afraid to leave their homes. Now, the Palestinian Ministry of Health saying that eight Palestinians have been killed. Israeli officials have been saying that nearly all of them were armed when they were killed. We do know that several of those killed were teenagers. And there are some 80 injuries. I should emphasize that this operation is still ongoing. So we will likely see those numbers increase. The Israeli military saying one of their soldiers were injured. Now Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just spoke in the last hour or so, and he is saying that this operation will go on as long as necessary. He says, in recent months, Jenin has become a haven for terrorism, and they are not ready to accept this. We have seen, of course, increasing levels of violence across the occupied West Bank and Israel over the past year and a half between these regular Israeli military raids and Palestinian attacks against Israelis. But what we're seeing right now, this is at a new level of intensity. And the big question now is, will this spill over into something much broader than what the Israeli military is saying is a targeted operation focusing on Jenin -- Boris?",

And seeing it through the eyes not of a soldier or doctor or journalist, but the eyes of a child trying every day just to survive.An 11-year-old boy named Ygor. A photojournalist for \"The New York Times,\" Lynsey Addario, followed him and his mother, Lena, living less than 15 miles from the war-torn city of Bakhmut. They suffered through shelling, the loss of basic services such as running water, electricity, schooling, and a constant closeup view of the casualties of war. Lynsey Addario joins me now. These are such powerful photos. I think that they carry such meaning with them because they bring people there in a way that they might not get otherwise. I think that sometimes people get numb to over time as a war like there carries on. You wrote a note in there, you said that \"Ygor no longer flinched when shells were fired as he ate his morning dumplings.\" And I, like you, have a son of similar age to him. My first thought was, wow, he's strong, but my second thought was the scars must be so deep from all this. LYNSEY ADDARIO, PHOTOJOURNALIST, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Yes. I mean, I've been covering the war in Ukraine for a year and a half now, and I have repeatedly photographed children dealing with trauma. And I have an 11-year-old, just like Ygor. I first met him in January of this year. And he was learning how to suture trauma wounds with one of the military medics at a hospital, a military stabilization point. And of course, the first thing I thought was, I -- I can't even fathom what it would be like for my son to be in this situation. And so I had the idea of trying to live with him and his mother to really try and get a sense of not only the moments where it was intensive fighting nearby but also those sort of quiet moments.

If not, they would send him to an orphanage. So that is the sort of stress that families are living with. And she was just able to make it out, as well, in the last 10 days.

Last month, a Russian court upheld his extended detention in a Moscow prison until at least the end of August. And Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen traveling to Beijing later this week.

That number will change at 665 because it's a running total as it updates every couple of seconds. So, yes, a lot of lightning out there. That's what I'm truly concerned with today. Yes, there will be wind damage and even maybe the possibility of some hail, especially across the northeast here. If you're outside -- so many people are outside -- and you get that lightning detector on your phone that says something's within 10 miles, you need to get inside because, today, there will be tens of thousands of strikes that come down today in a minute as we get into the afternoon and the heat of the day.
