The judge's latest decision is raising questions about whether Trump will ever be sentenced for his 34 felony convictions.CNN's Paula Reid reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Judge Juan Merchan has delayed his decision about whether President-elect Trump's conviction in the hush money case earlier this year on 34 counts of falsifying business records should be tossed out after the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have some immunity for their official acts, including the fact that you cannot use official acts as evidence in a case, which is exactly what happened in the Manhattan case. Now the reason the judge decided to delay this is because both sides, both prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed that they need more time to figure out exactly how they address the questions in this case now that Trump is headed back to the White House and is president-elect. CNN has previously reported that the Trump team will now argue that as President-elect Trump cannot be sentenced, that he has constitutional protections from either being indicted or prosecuted or even sentenced by state actors. It's unclear if that will be successful, but the judge has at least one more week before he has to make any decision in this case, and we can expect both sides will likely weigh in with their thoughts on this over the next week.

As a social scientist, I see study after study that shows the negative impact of just the political advertisements and the political rhetoric, not to mention the laws when they do go into effect. And so I think there's a lot of anticipatory anxiety among LGBTQ people right now and among trans people in particular that their rights are going to be taken away, that it's going to be harder for them to access health care, harder to get an education, harder to provide for their families, harder to, access community and to thrive in their lives.

When you talk to these folks, they're not so much worried about culture wars. They're worried about everyday issues. They're worried about how they're going to provide for their families, what kind of jobs they're going to get after college. They're not worried about the issue of a trans student using the restroom in their school. They're not scared of their peers. They're scared of the outcomes in social life. And so I think that folks are using a fear of the unknown to distract people from the real issues that they don't have answers for. Instead of offering solutions to the real problems faced by Americans, and the real fears that people have about their future and their present, politicians are marginalizing people who are already oppressed, targeting a population that makes up less than one percent of the American public, using vast amounts of resources to stoke fear and division rather than answering the question of what they're going to do for you and your family in the coming terms.

Police caught the 62 year old driver as he tried to flee the scene.And CNN's Marc Stewart is following the story for us from Beijing. He joins us live. So, Marc, what more are you learning about this horrifying attack? MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT; Rosemary, the big focus is on that 62 year old man. According to an initial report from police, he was upset about how his divorce settlement went, and perhaps that is what prompted all of this. He is in custody, but as of last night, he was unconscious. Police add that he hurt himself, on purpose, they believe. He had -- they found a knife in the truck that he was in, his vehicle. They say that he has severe neck injuries, and that he is receiving medical treatment. So, that is a big unknown. They desperately want to question this man. But this case is getting attention for so many different reasons including the fact that violent attacks like this and violence in general is very low in China with this population here of more than a billion people. The violence rates are low. But this -- but we have seen in recent weeks, a series of violent spontaneous outbursts like this often in public places where people get hurt. Sometimes it's with a motor vehicle. Sometimes it's a knife attack. But that is why this case is getting so much attention. It shows a series of disturbing and perhaps dissatisfaction in China right now as families deal with a lot of struggles, including the economy, Rosemary.",

Most of the heavier rainfall was south of Da Nang. Now we take a look at Toraji, the storm that did affect the northern part of the Philippines a couple of days ago, really falling apart now. And that's kind of what happens when the water isn't as warm as it has been. And there's a little bit of shear out there too, but really we're going to take this storm and turn it into nothing. There were some showers in Hong Kong today. Now let's pay attention and focus on what's still coming, Usagi. Usagi will likely be a typhoon of about 185 to maybe 195 miles per hour as it makes contact here with the extreme northeastern part of the Philippines, a very strong event. Then farther off to the east still to come, there's Man-yi, and that's where it's going all the way down to the south. And then making another run at the exact same place here across the northeastern part of the Philippines. Now will they be 30 or 40 miles away likely from the landfalls? But they could be very, very close and many, many models are taking this very seriously when it talks to you're just talking about so much precipitation that can come down 250 to 500 millimeters more rainfall in places where we just showed you all of that flooding. So yes, there will be wind and some spots will pick up 200 KPH.

The theory is that magma or pressurized gas under a volcano increases as glaciers melt because the heavy ice no longer weighs down the Earth's crust, allowing magma to move more freely underground. And those subterranean pressure changes can permeate to areas which aren't directly under glaciers, like Askja, which is just north of the country's largest glacier. But with recent eruptions in Grindavik, a town in southwest Iceland, which not only put on a spectacular lava show, but also forced the evacuation of the town's residents, scientists are eager to learn more about what's triggering such volatility.",
