And then, in the last sort of final steps, the last details to actually make this happen, this final delay. Of course, we expected that the agreement would have already gone into effect today, only to find out fairly late last night when Israel's National Security Council said it would not go into effect before tomorrow. So, certainly leaving open the possibility that there will be a further delay although that's not the expectation on the ground right now.Crucially, even with these delays, the process is moving forward, and that would be the pause in fighting that we expect, and that then will be followed by the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. 10 to 12 at a time, women and children over the course of four days, in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners, women and children released from Israeli prisons. Now, we have learned a bit more about how the process will play out. Hamas will everyday transfer the group of women and children to the Red Cross. The Red Cross will then bring them to points on the Gaza border, either with Egypt at the Rafah crossing, or with several options on the Israeli border, to then hand them to the IDF, to Israeli soldiers, who will take them to hospitals for immediate evaluations and then for reunions with their families who have been waiting for weeks now for news of their loved ones, and of course to see them.

You've seen attacks launched from Yemen against Israel. And so, the longer that the conflict in Gaza persists, the greater the risk of an escalating conflict in the region becomes.",

      "sentences": "Look, from what we've been seeing, that huge convoy of trucks from Al Arish into the Rafah border, waiting for the truce to kick in. And we're hearing from the Egyptians that that is set to happen tomorrow, that these aid trucks are ready and waiting at the border, more trucks than we've ever seen over the past couple of weeks, which, of course, is big -- one big element of this breakthrough deal that is about to start.We have not seen enough aid going into Gaza since October 7. And I'd like to remind you, there were over 458 trucks going in on a normal day before with this war broke out. So, it's just been a trickle, and the international aid organizations have been talking about running out of food and water and importantly fuel. But, from November 21, we actually started to see some fuel going in. And the reason that fuel is important, it's keeping the generators on, keeping the hospitals going. And horror story is, Max, frankly, from the doctors about running out of anesthetics to operate with, to amputate. I mean, it's really been difficult to listen to these firsthand accounts coming out from Gaza. Over the next few days, the hope is that it's going to alleviate some of the pressure. But, the Norwegian Refugee Crescent is saying that it's not enough. They need a full out ceasefire in order to get sustained humanitarian aid into Gaza. And Martin Griffiths from the United Nations yesterday said to CNN that while they do negotiate with the Egyptians, they also negotiate with Israel. But, Israel does have the final say in terms of creating those humanitarian corridors, and just how many trucks of food and fuel and medicine get to go into Gaza. So, this is one element of this very critical negotiation to see the release of hostages finally, some of those hostages, and then also to alleviate the humanitarian pressure. Speaking to some of the foreign nationals and dual nationals that I met in my hotel, they were telling me that they had run out of food and water for many days, and they were scrambling just to find a piece of bread. And that just gives you a glimpse of what it's like to be like -- to live in Gaza right now, and then continue on our conversations with the doctors on the ground, and understanding just how harrowing the situation is. This four-day truce is going to be important once we start seeing those eight trucks going in. Of course, there is always a delay because they've got to be checked. There is a checking process, but then hopefully handed over to the humanitarian organizations first and foremost.",
