His two Democratic predecessors, former presidents Obama and Clinton, flanking him on stage for a record-setting fundraiser. They brought in $26 million in this effort to have Biden join them as a two-term president.But inside the event, and also outside, pro-Palestinian protesters calling out Biden for his handling of the war in Gaza. So the Democratic division's still apparent at the high-profile gathering. We have CNN Political Director David Chalian here for some expert analysis on this. How much would you read into this show of force, but also this record haul?",

Though the Trump campaign notes they've got a big Florida fundraiser coming up where they think they're going to bring in $33 million, so we'll see about that.But clearly the Biden team has been raising a ton more money than the Trump and larger Republican effort. And the other piece that the show of force is designed for is to rally the Democratic faithful, to feel good about Joe Biden being the nominee, getting behind him. You know so much of what we've talked about in the lead up to this campaign season has been pieces of the Biden coalition that haven't quite shown up in force in the polling so far that he had back in 2020 when he won. And I think part of the design of bringing the Democratic superstars all together on the stage is to make Democrats feel good about the Biden effort and that it is time to enthusiastically get on board. KEILAR: And it's a united front that Trump cannot replicate on the Republican side, for sure. Biden taking a couple swipes last night at Trump's literal fitness. He implied he's old and out of shape. And here he was joking about Trump's stamina. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that kind of speaks to, I think, the gravity of the moment that we're in. And I think it's important to note that this judge is not overseeing Trump's case in Washington. He is a sitting U.S. district judge there. He is a federal judge there. That's what makes this all the more remarkable. But he's not the person handling Trump's election interference case that's on hold right now in Washington.But he did feel this need to come out, Kristin, and speak publicly because of just what we've been seeing happening. The context that we are now living in. And Trump's attacks this week on Judge Merchan here in New York are all the more remarkable because he has only upped them after the judge affirmed that, yes, he will be going to trial in a few weeks. But what Trump is doing lately is kind of going around that gag order to attack the only people who aren't covered in it, which is the judge himself, the district attorney, but also naming the judge's daughter in this. Because she's worked in - for Democratic campaigns before, essentially arguing that because the judge has - that as his daughter, that Trump himself can't get a fair campaign. And so we spoke to Judge Walton about this just because he's someone who knows what this is like. He's obviously been on the bench for decades. He's someone I should note was appointed by both Bush presidencies for different judgeships. And so it just speaks to the moment that we're in, that a federal judge felt the need to come out and talk about what he believes this is a threat to the judiciary because these threats obviously come with consequences. They aren't just in this vacuum of Truth Social because he was essentially arguing to me that even if Trump doesn't intend for his words to cause violence, that that is not always the case. And we've seen that happen with judges just recently. Some judges have had members of their family killed by people who are targeting them or targeting their family members because of who they were.",

Because he was essentially arguing, if you can't have a functioning judiciary where people feel like they can do their jobs without the potential threat of physical violence, he was saying that it's a threat to democracy in the United States, that it could mean tyranny in the United States.If you can't have judges who go to work and feel like they can do their jobs. We've seen a lot of criticism of that, though, from people in Trump's circle. It's not surprising, really, because they're criticizing this judge for breaking a norm by going out and speaking on cable news. But, of course, we see Trump break norms every single day, attacking the daughter of the judge who is going to be presiding over his criminal trial, something I should note even his own attorneys wish he would stop doing.",

So don't think of this as being prices falling. Prices are still going up. They're just not going up as fast, but they're still going up. And I think this number tells the Fed that they have to be obviously extremely cautious about cutting too quickly and sending everybody off to the races. But because the trajectory is in the right direction, I think we're still on for a June cut and probably two more before the end of the year. This was expected.

And we're now starting to see savings depleting, going down quite a lot. And you're starting to see credit card debt. Well, we're not starting, we have seen credit card debt rising, defaults rising, people getting into trouble with these higher interest rates. And don't forget, when rates start to come down, they're not going to come down so fast that you're really going to notice it that much. You just won't have to - you just won't be going up anymore.
