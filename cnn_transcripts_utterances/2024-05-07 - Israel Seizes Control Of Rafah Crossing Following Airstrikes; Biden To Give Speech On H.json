This after Israeli officials indicated that a deal that Hamas said it accepted on Monday did not correspond to what Israel had expected. And without the deal Israel decided to quote, exert military pressure on Hamas, end quote. New overnight, the IDF seizing control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing after conducting a series of airstrikes that have killed at least 15 people. The Rafah crossing is a vital access point for humanitarian aid along the Egyptian border, which has now been shut down. The U.N. chief appealing to the two sides to reach an agreement quickly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS:  The ground invasion in Rafah would be tolerable because of its devastating humanitarian consequences, and because of its destabilizing impacts.

      "sentences": "What we understand, Kasie, is that this is a three-phase proposal that Hamas said it agreed to. In the first phase, which is supposed to last for 42 days or six weeks, 33 hostages would be released. That would include the elderly, women, children, and the sick, and exchange Israel would withdraw from parts of Gaza. There would be halted reconnaissance flights for 10 hours a day over Gaza and hundreds of Palestinians being held in Israeli jails, either prisoners or detainees, would be released.Now in the second phase of this proposal, there would be a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. All the other hostages would be released and there would be what's been called a sustainable period of calm. In the third phase, they're talking about three to five years, Gaza would be reconstructed. Now the Israeli say this isn't what they had agreed to before. It's not exactly clear what were the points of disagreement, but we understand the Israelis do not want anything that would indicate essentially an end of the war because Israel continues to insist that in addition to the release of the hostages, Israel wants to completely destroy Hamas. Now the Americans have told them that might not be a realistic goal at this point, but politically, it would be very difficult for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war without achieving that one of its basic goals -- Kasie.",

So in this preview of this speech, she did talk about, of course, the balance between free speech and making sure that people are protected in terms of the antisemitism that we have seen flare up on these college campuses.

Most of the comments have been coming from the White House and from his aides on behalf of him.So this speech today is going to be really notable, just given not only what's going on in Israel and Gaza, but what's going on here in the U.S. and now, across, across the world, we've seen protests breakout in light of this. And so, I anticipate that he's obviously going to talk about antisemitism. But what I'm really curious to see is how he addresses some more of the specifics about the situation with Israel, with Benjamin Netanyahu and with humanitarian questions over in Gaza.",

This was in Wisconsin, in Madison, Wisconsin earlier this month. This -- these are the scenes that are putting so much pressure on the president.And our Ron Brownstein is a columnist here at CNN, in addition to his role at \"The Atlantic\", put it this way in terms of the pressure on Biden and the way he sits inside the Democratic Party. Quote: Through the -- though the vast majority of Democratic officeholders show no penchant to fundamentally break with Israel, Biden could be the last Democratic president for the foreseeable future who aligns so unreservedly with the nation. Do you see that being -- I mean, Biden clearly, he's -- let's be honest, reaching the end of a very long political career, that he's had here in Washington, shaped very much by this particular issue, but younger generations seem to view it very differently.",

But you're right, were seeing that younger generation have a shift in mentality where it comes to Israel, where they're not as an avowedly pro-Israel, or at times they believe that the situation needs to drastically change. And so I think that's a fair argument.We're seeing this change -- this not just on college campuses, but even with younger generations of people in Congress and people running -- running for Congress. And so, there is the possibility that in the long term, perhaps the stance with the U.S. and Israel does change particularly if the Democratic Party.",

We've seen Donald Trump talk for months on the campaign trail about the Afghanistan withdrawal, about the Ukraine-Russia war, and about this. And so the campus protests sort of just add onto that argument.In terms of swing voters, it's interesting because when I talked to the Biden campaign, they're not convinced that this specific incident is the situation is actually going to move the needle because yes, while there are a number of young voters who are concerned about this, they point out that young voters are more concerned about things like the economy, which at the same time still doesn't bode great for Joe Biden at this point. But certainly, this is going to be a topic regardless of whether it ends up persuading people to one side or another.",

I'm not saying the moving away from the U.S., but countries like France or certainly embracing the opportunities that Chinas been offering, that's partly why they've been chosen Serbia where he's going onto next, you know, has a tense relationship obviously with NATO, and it's exposing the tensions within NATO. And there are certain countries he could have gone to, which are particularly close to the U.S., like the UK. He didn't go there. So I think a lot of the messaging here is that it's about that new world order, how China's trying to step into it, show some leadership, show it has support within Europe.

It's been publicized, has been leaked, so we were meant to hear about it that could be the intention here. That's certainly what the Americans are suggesting. But the very idea of nuclear weapons being in a battlefield is frightening, isn't it? Because, you know, even if they're not used, they could there could be some misuse of them or it could there could be some level of escalation, where were they, you know, are misjudgment where they use when they shouldn't be used. It's just a frightening the idea that they could actually make it into a battlefield, but it could just be messaging as it often is, Russia.",
