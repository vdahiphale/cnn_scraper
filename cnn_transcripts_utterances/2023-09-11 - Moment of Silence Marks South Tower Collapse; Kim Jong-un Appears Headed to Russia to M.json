I got to tell you, at the ground zero, at this hollow ground, you see people walking around, placing flowers in the names of the loved ones that they lost etched into this monuments. But then when that moment of silence happens and those bells ring, everyone just stops and everyone is still down here and the gravity of what this day means really, really settles in.And now you can hear the people now reciting the names of all nearly 3,000 people who were killed on 9/11. And to give you some little thing to look out for as you watch the coverage of this, look at the people who are reciting names that are younger. They tell me that they made a purpose to have people of younger generations come out here and read those names to, like you said, Kate, never forget, a reminder to these generations that weren't alive during 9/11 to never forget about those lives lost, what happened here, the history that really changed, of course, New York, this country, and the entire world. So, that's something to certainly look out for. We understand that Vice President Kamala Harris, she is no longer here, but she was here to be a part of this ceremony. There are also some New York City dignitaries. I can tell you to my right, there is an NYPD honor guard that has stood at attention since this ceremony began at 8:30 this morning. And we've just been watching families come by and pay their respects. some with the pictures of their loved ones on T-shirts, people who are survivors of 9/11, paying respects to others that they lost the day that they responded here to this scene at Ground Zero. So, it's a pretty emotional feeling here being on 9/11. We are coming up on yet another moment of silence at 10:03. And so I'm going to stop at that moment. But let's listen in soon as that moment of silence is coming right upon us.",

He's at an Eastern Economic Forum. And we have heard from the Kremlin and also from state-run media in North Korea that the two will be there together in the coming days, KCNA saying that they will have a one-on-one meeting. Now, it is a meeting that neither Washington nor Seoul welcomed because they both believe that this is to try and hammer out the final deals of an arms deal. The U.S. officials, intelligence and also South Korean intelligence, say they believe that they are close to some kind of an arms deal. The belief is that Russia would gain ammunition or small arms out of this deal that they would then be able to use on the frontlines in Ukraine. And in return, U.S. officials believe that North Korea would be able to secure some kind of satellite technology or some nuclear submarine technology from Russia. So, both sides really do stand to gain from this strategic alliance. It is mutually beneficial, not just militarily as well, politically. These are two countries that are very isolated by the west at this point. They're two countries that are sanctioned heavily by the west as well. And they are united with and by a common enemy, the United States. So, certainly, these two countries getting together is not something that Washington welcomes. Sara?",

The other thing that's happening is, you know, a lot of countries have stuck their neck out for the U.S., for the West, sanctioning Russia. Sanctions hurt early on, but, eventually, the target of sanctions finds another way to do business. Right now, we're seeing Russia together with North Korea and China becoming a new trade nexus that can replace some of those avenues that were meant to harm Moscow and try to change its behavior.",

Let me play how the chairman said it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN:  There's still a reasonable amount of time, probably about 30 to 45 days, worth of fighting weather left.

Ukraine is grateful to its partners who tried to include strong wording in the text. At the same time, the G-20 has nothing to be proud of in the part about Russia's aggression against Ukraine.

Nearly 2,500 people have already been reported dead, but the final death toll is impossible to estimate right now, as some areas are still so hard to reach.It was a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that struck hardest in the country's Atlas Mountains. This new footage we're going to show you is from inside one building, just to show kind of how it hit. The halls covered with debris, whole chunks of walls missing, as you can see there. CNN's Sam Kiley has been on the ground seeing the devastation and hearing from people who are still in shock from the tragedy and folding all around them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Another victim buried, returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2,000 people have perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over 100 years. Most of the deaths were in villages in the Atlas Mountains, where homes cracked and crumbled late Friday night. The pancaking of these buildings down a side street here in Moulay Brahim killed 25 people. Three or four are still missing, believed buried in the rubble. And this is a pattern that has been repeated throughout this province. And it looks very often like there's been some kind of airstrike, the collapsing buildings here actually leaving holes as if they've been hit by Russian bombs in Ukraine. But this has been an all too natural disaster. At least three elderly people have been entombed here in the remains of their hotel. And a fourth guest is missing. After the quake, Sami called his parents for a day-and-a-half. It rang out until the battery died, too.
