Thank you for joining me.I will begin with, Donell, because there was a \"New York Times\" analysis, which I was particularly interested in. And it found that the officers in this encounter shouted at least 71 commands. Seventy- one commands in approximately 13-minute period. And I want to play a clip, frankly, from that initial stop for a moment. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT:  It is clear he didn't even know what he was getting pulled over for. So, there's that immediate shock getting pulled over. And then many police academies -- I went to the police academy. We were trained not to do that. I'll let your law enforcement analysts get to really the nuts and balls of that. But when you go to the police academy, they instruct you to have one individual interacting with that -- with that person so that you don't have those conflicting type of commands because -- then people don't know what to do. The more it escalates, the more yelling there is, the confuse the individual gets. And so, that is exactly what you saw there. Later on, it gets even worse.",

The first thing -- the first rule of medicine is to do no harm.Clearly, I think, in my personal opinion, my professional opinion, it speaks to an environment, perhaps a culture, in the streets of Memphis for emergency responders where this is -- the norms are accepted. I've worked in a lot of departments, and I would be aghast at seeing this and no one stopping it. And so, I called these -- you know, these people are silent perpetrators. They are not committing the act of violence, but they're committing passive violence.

I mean, it was Tyre Nichols whose hands were restrained, not those whose job it was to at least even perform a cursory inspection on what happened.I want to turn now to Democratic Congressman Steven Horseford. He is the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, here with us this evening. Congressman, thank you for being here. It is difficult to watch this happen go from never again to once again. And in that space and in that vein, legislation possibly could fill back out. I do wonder what your reaction is into what can be done at a legislative level to go from, once again, back to never again. REP. STEVEN HORSFORD (D-NV):  Well, first, thank you for having me on. On behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, we are committed to doing everything we possibly can, working across party lines with the president, with our community and the families to uplift their voice. I spoke to Tyre Nichols's father and his mother by phone on Sunday to hear directly from them, to express our condolences on behalf of Congressional Black Caucus, and to ask them what do they want. And what they told me first is to remind people who Tyre Nichols was. He was a son, he was a father, he had purpose and passion and a life ahead of him. He loved skateboarding and photography. And while going to his mother's home, just 80 yards away, he was pulled away for a supposed traffic violation that resulted in him being beaten. And in the course of that, yelling out mama, and he ended up dying a few days later. Yes, bad policing practices are happening in Memphis, but the problem is too many of these incidents are happening all over America. Now, this is something that all of us should be able to agree. Bad policing shouldn't exist anywhere in America. This not republican issue or democratic issue. This is about safety. All of us should want safety. And as a Black man, as a father, as someone who has responsibility to serve my constituents, I want them to come home safe.",

All of us should agree bad policing shouldn't exist anywhere in America.One of the other reports that have been shared with me is the fact that in Memphis, for example, the use of force is used three times more often on Black people, Black residents, than on white people in Memphis. They know that. We should know that about every law enforcement agency across America. That's about having the data to then make good decisions on pattern of practices.

DOUG WILLIAMS, SUPER BOWL '22 MVP, FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK TO START AND WIN A SUPER BOWL:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me. You know, I can remember some 45 years ago (INAUDIBLE) image in myself was, uh, first two Black quarterbacks playing in a regular NFL game back when I was in Tampa and he was in Chicago. And last night, when I was sitting there watching Patrick, I had already seen (INAUDIBLE) win his game, sitting there watching Patrick, (INAUDIBLE) came through to me, from the emotional standpoint.

I want to underscore the importance of what he was able to do as a very first Black quarterback to start and also win a Super Bowl. We honor you.I feel as if 2023 is far too late for us to say, guess what, we have two Black starting quarterbacks in the Super Bowl. It is the narrative of Black quarterbacks. It's old. It's tired. And quite frankly, we've seen over and over again that these Black quarterbacks have been able to not only sustain the position and be more than serviceable in the position but we can go down the list. If we talk about Michael Vick, if we talk about Cam Newton, there have been so many before these two young men now. What these two young men now, when we see what they're doing, what they are doing as quarterbacks is more than historic. They are the generation. They are the next Brady versus Manning. They are the future of quarterbacks in the NFL. What I would like for us to really take away from this, though, Laura, is that looking at these Black quarterbacks, it is far too discouraging for these head coaches that are not Black to see these Black quarterbacks in these positions. This is the conversation now that we need to have, to say, guess what, if we're looking at these Black quarterbacks starting in the Super Bowl who have made their way, who paid their dues, isn't it time for us to look for their head coaches? Isn't it a time to have that conversation as we've been trying to have? We continue to push this aside. I can tell you right now that there are offensive coordinators and defensive coordinators who have helped these young men get to the point where they are right now and succeed at this level, right? That's the ultimate, which is winning this game and getting to the game, and they don't see a Black quarterback on the sidelines -- a black head coach, rather, on the sidelines. And I'm so grateful that we're having this moment where we're celebrating these two young kids, right? They're so young, 27 and 24. And they're winning at the highest level. And I know that there is a Black head coach sitting somewhere, thinking, it's my turn, too. And so, I'm glad that we're having this conversation. It is far too ridiculous in 2023 that we are celebrating two Black quarterbacks when that should just be the norm. It shouldn't even be a conversation.",

Division comes just days after Presley laid her daughter to rest at Graceland.Joining me now is CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson and thewrap.com founder and editor-in-chief Sharon Waxman. Thank you both for being here. I want to begin with you, Sharon, on this. What changes were made to Lisa Marie Presley's will back in 2016 that Priscilla is challenging? SHARON WAXMAN, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE WRAP:  So, she's saying that the trustee was changed. She is challenging the fact that an amendment was filed to make the trustee, Riley and her brother, Benjamin, who is no longer with us, and that means, basically, that Priscilla Presley is challenging her granddaughters', you know, validity to be the person who is now dealing with her mother's estate. I just say that in these kinds of cases when you have these huge celebrities, it is really not that unusual that the family ends up in a big public dispute. She is saying that the signature doesn't look like it is Lisa Marie's. She is saying that she was not informed of this change to the trusteeship that she has. Shew is claiming that she wants to remain the trustee of that will. And so, there's going to be a lot of money at stake care, but it really is putting a grandmother against a granddaughter.

And if someone has a will, a will, of course, is a document, and if you want a mandate, it is legally binding in the event that there are certain formalities in place.In order to do that, right, witnesses have to witness what you do. Certainly, there should not be a misspelling of a name if it happens, you know, certainly, to be your mom. And so, someone can change it to whatever they want, but to your question and the point is that it is subject to an evidentiary hearing. And at that hearing, it would have to be established that it's an authentic document. In the event that you have a will, you can put in place and do anything and everything you want. It is up to you. Right? It is your prerogative with respect to how you want to control your assets and who you want to leave them to. But if the formalities are not in place, it is subject to challenge. At such a hearing, there would be an opportunity to determine whether it's valid or not. If it is not valid, of course, and it's contested as it is, then it is declared invalid. And as a result of that, you can see the changes that are being made. In the event it is deemed to be authentic, then the will then pursues as it is right now. And so, I think, regardless, it is the person's right to do it. The bottom line is to get it right and to have it right, and hopefully, at such a hearing, it will be determined that it is right.

In this case, these incredibly charismatic little primates, you know, when you think of a monkey, Laura, you probably think of something big like a spider monkey or a chimpanzee, like an ape. But these emperor tamarins are really about this big. They're a tiny, very charismatic monkey. They actually are named after the German Emperor Wilhelm II with his big, long, prestigious moustache. This is a creature that falls prey to the black market wildlife trade, which is $60 billion a year industry.

This person is getting unusual access. This individual can get inside the zoo and know how to negotiate, where to cut in, and it's almost like he's testing the waters, like someone who, you know, is committing that first fire and then goes back, watches the blaze. It is like there is a real neurosis to this criminal. And unfortunately, now these animals are disappearing, these very precious, precocious primates.
