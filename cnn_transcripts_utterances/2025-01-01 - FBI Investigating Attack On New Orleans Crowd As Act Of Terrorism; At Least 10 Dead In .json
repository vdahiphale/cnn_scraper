Our breaking news coverage of the mass casualty incident in New Orleans continues this hour. The FBI is now looking into the attack on a crowd on Bourbon Street early this morning as an act of terrorism. Police say a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into that crowd, killing at least 10 people and injuring at least 35. According to the New Orleans police chief, the driver was hell-bent on causing carnage and a federal law enforcement official says that suspect is dead. A new video captured on Earth Cam shows the moment multiple officers can be seen running in response to the incident.The officers can be seen standing outside of Crazy Corner on Bourbon Street when they appear to receive this call about the vehicle that plowed into the crowd. You can see this on your screen. Look at them running. They get that call. They are running. This is what they have been training for, something like this. Take a listen to the emergency radio call from first responders. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Paula, do you first, I just spoke to a law enforcement source who said, look, they have the license plate of this suspect, right?

There was a little confusion about that earlier today in the briefings about whether this was being viewed as potential terrorism. Now the FBI confidently saying in a statement released a short time ago that they are investigating this as an act of terrorism. I want to read that statement.\"This morning, an individual drove a car into a crowd of people on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing a number of people and injuring dozens of others. The subject then engaged with local law enforcement and is now deceased.\" And as I said, \"the FBI is the lead investigative agency, and they are working with their partners to investigate this an as an act of terrorism.: Now, as they said here, the suspect is dead, but a law enforcement official said they believe that this individual acted intentionally and they continue to investigate a motive here. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed on this situation. I want to go back to an interview, that great interview that you did a short time ago, Pamela, with Senator Cassidy there. There, he suggested that they may know who, quote, these people are because they have a license plate. You smartly followed up and asked if that meant that there were additional suspects. The guidance that I am getting from my sources is that there was only one suspect at the scene. That suspect is now deceased. But they are looking into whether anyone else was involved in this plot. And I'm told we may get more information or more clarity on that question at briefings coming up.",

So we'll show that now.We've blurred this video because obviously the carnage is just unspeakable. But we know around right after 3:00 o'clock that F150 was used to weave around barricades and then start plowing into people. We know 10 people are dead, more than 30 injured. Level one trauma centers were used. At some point, that suspect then started exchanging or started shooting at officers. We know two officers were shot. They are in stable condition. The big question here, of course, is why? And then were officers able to follow him, open fire? Those are the parts that we've been trying to figure out for quite some time.

And of course, this investigation, not only do you have crime scene investigators trying to collect evidence, but then you have the morgue out there trying to -- medical examiner out there trying to collect some of the human remains that have been left behind.As they do this investigation, they're taking shots digitally to put this whole crime scene together. But of course, as you try to put these pieces together, you want to figure out why and what the motive was. Those so far have not been answered. But let's not forget it's seven hours later. We know there's a news conference in the next hour, so hopefully we'll get some more information. But at this point, just a tragedy, people asking so many questions. And the Sugar bowl is tonight.

Those barricades were not on, period.They had the flimsy orange ones that you could just push over with your finger. We actually thought it was kind of odd because usually when you get to Bourbon Street, you can turn your back to Canal and not worry about anything. You can just walk the street, especially on New Year's. And there were still vehicles coming after 8:00 p.m. and then, I mean, the fact that they never raised them. That's how the. That's how this guy was able to get down Bourbon Street so quickly and cause so much damage. Because there's other barricades past the Canal and Bourbon intersection. There's more like every two, three blocks. So what was 10 or 15 dead and 30 wounded. Could have only been maybe 5 and 15. I mean, who can say? But it definitely would have been minimalized because this truck cannot go around those barricades. Everything in New Orleans, in the French Quarter, has a balcony. All the balconies have poles, several steel posts, and there's no going around anything. If that barricade's up, that's a wrap. That's your end.",

We just spoke to this eyewitness who said these -- he was in a bar. He had been right there. These women came running in from the street and said that truck was going around 60 miles per hour according to those -- those women who were there. Just imagine that, this street packed with people enjoying the New Year's and then this happens. It's beyond comprehension. Ten people died, dozens are injured. The FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism. Let's bring in Democratic Congressman Troy Carter. He represents NewOrleans and he's a member of the House Homeland Security Committee. Congressman, thank you for being here and I'm sorry for what has happened in your city. Have you been getting briefings on what happened here? Is there any information you can share with us about the suspect and whether there are accomplices? REP. TROY CARTER, (D) LOUISIANA: Thank you very much for giving this the coverage that it deserves.
