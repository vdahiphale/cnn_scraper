      "sentences": "Everybody's had their say about Ronna McDaniel, except me.I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia and now it's my turn. When MSNBC didn't take Donald Trump's victory speech the night that he won the Iowa caucus, I said on radio that it was a mistake and that it's set a bad precedent. If you're a media outlet, you can't talk about the 2024 election a year in advance, hype the Iowa caucus, interrupt programming for the night, engage a panel, show the votes coming in on a big map, and then not give the victor his just due. It's like carrying the Super Bowl and then deciding to dip out of the presentation of the Lombardi trophy because you don't like who won the game. And carry to its logical conclusion, I said, this censorship would mean not taking his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention or his inaugural address, should he win the election? Ironically, it's now the RNC saying they might limit NBC's access to cover their convention, even though it's doubtful it could exercise that control. And now, Trump is getting the political benefit of the brouhaha, notwithstanding that he instigated McDaniel's firing from the RNC. The hard question remains, how to cover Donald Trump and his supporters. Ignoring or disrespecting the presumptive GOP candidate and his base I think is a mistake. It won't diminish their cause nor make them go away. The grievances that gave rise to Trumps election in 2016 will still be with us when he's gone. Global migratory shifts, immigration battles, changing demographics and the corresponding belief of some that they've been forgotten amidst all this change will outlive Trump's political career. Remember Brexit preceded his election. Better to engage the beliefs of the 45 or so percent who stand ready to vote for Trump again, they deserve a seat at the table. Of course, no ones views should be aired without challenge. That's a journalist's responsibility. And I said much the same a year ago when many objected to CNN hosting Trump for a town hall. \"How could every other candidate but the leader be offered a town hall?\" I asked and Kaitlan Collins did a terrific job in peppering the former president with questions. Giving this constituency the cold shoulder only strengthens them. It emboldens claims of bias and gives other networks something that they can run a loop. It reminds me of the fallout after \"The New York Times\" published a controversial essay by Republican Senator Tom Cotton and the aftermath of the George Floyd riots. Two days later, the paper said that it should never have been published. Editor James Bennett lost his job as a result. I don't agree with Cotton, but I defended his right to be heard. Same with Ronna McDaniel, who wasn't just any Republican. She was the head of the RNC. I'm not advocating for her personally. I'm advocating for balance and I'd be a hypocrite if I didn't say so today. After all, I'm the guy who time and again has responded to your social media complaints in real time after any number of guests that I've hosted, that some of you don't like. You remember Matt Gaetz, the very week that he played a pivotal role fighting the election of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy or RFK Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and Dean Phillips right after each announced their candidacies. John Eastman, the former Trump lawyer, now facing disbarment has been my guest here discussing his role in the January 6 rally. Doctors Scott Atlas and Jay Bhattacharya from Stanford both spoke to me here about herd immunity in the context of COVID. Even January 6's QAnon shaman, after he got out of jail and announced he was running for Congress. I could continue -- Sean Spicer, Kellyanne Conway, Kari Lake, Roger Waters. They've all been my guest. (BEGIN VDIEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): Congress said drain the swamp --",

And it's a vicious cycle. If more would accept an invitation like mine than their base audience might feel more welcome and tuning in. I've said since my first show here on CNN 10 years ago, this tribalism among elected officials and polarization in the media. It's killed civility and made compromise the new C-word. And you know what else? It's boring. Why would anybody want to watch a discussion of the news that only reinforces their beliefs and doesn't challenge people to think? Instead, invite all sides, confront the false hoods from the right and the left, and if something slips by and we've got to do a fact check later, then so be it. That get over the idea that the risk of metastasis from one falsehood getting through warrants, total censorship. There are responsible people at both ends of the political spectrum.

When Ronna McDaniel showed up on \"Meet the Press\", I thought Kristen Welker did a good job of kind of challenging and pushing back on some of the things she believed in or she has spouse previous. I don't know if she believed in or she espoused previously. I don't know if she believed in it, but she espoused previously. So, to your first question, should they have hired her? Well, listen, hit it depends on what their goal was. If their goal was to have a divergent viewpoint on their, otherwise, left-leaning network then yes, they should have hired her, and they should be big enough, men and women to understand that her -- she's not going to agree with them. They're not going to agree with her and push-back, push-back on the January 6 things, push back on the election denial that the things you don't agree with, you push back on and you challenge that you have this is a marketplace of ideas. If that's what NBC wanted to be, then sure have her on. If they want to have just one viewpoint, a viewpoint from the far left progressives, so that people don't get triggered when they're watching their network, then no, don't have her on.

Yeah, that's something different. I think than saying he was not fairly -- he was not duly elected. Let's -- we heard that, Michael, you go play the tape. The RNC's got like a half-hour tape of -- after 2016 of Hillary Clinton, others saying that Donald Trump was not legitimate president so there's a little bit about both sides having some of that in their background, so you can pick and choose the vignette as you'd like.

GEOFFREY SKELLEY, SENIOR ELECTIONS ANALYST, 538: That's right, Michael, about -- you know, in 2016 and 2020, the libertarian nominee, for instance, got on all 51 ballots, 50 states plus Washington D.C. Major third-party ballot candidates like -- independents like John Anderson in 1980, Ross Perot in 1992. Ross Perot as the Reform Party nominee in 1996 and these very notable individuals, they got on all 51 ballots. And so, looking at someone like RFK Jr., his campaign actually has raised a fair amount of money for an independent or a third-party campaign. Actually, more than twice what Gary Johnson raised in the entire 2016 cycle so far.

And so, there's going to be a hearing and some appeal about that. And, you know, in the end, Kennedy will probably get on the ballot there, but at least shows sort of what's happening from state to state. In Nevada, for instance, there's been a bit of a snafu. This isn't necessarily because of the Biden campaign or Democrats, but it sounds like Kennedy may have needed to name a vice presidential candidate on his petition papers in Nevada but didn't do so because he didn't have one yet.

But if in the end those candidates tend to take more of the vote and not -- to be clear, not every voter would have voted for a Democrat or Republican who votes for those candidates. But if they would tend to be more likely to vote for one of those major party candidates, they could influence important results in the swing states that are most likely to decide the election.",

Because the fact is that, for the reasons that you gave, there is a very significant possibility that Joe Biden will not be able to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court during his second term because of Republican control of the Senate. And there's also a significant possibility that Donald Trump will be able to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court if he were to be reelected president and the GOP controls the Senate.The chance that one or both of those things will happen is so high that it's just simply isn't worth it to take that kind of a risk, given that as good as justice as Sotomayor has been, there are many excellent, very well qualified people out there who can who can fill the role that she has filled on the court, and it would really be in the public interest for her to do a very, very statesman like thing and step down from the court rather than running this risk which would be just a completely catastrophic development from the perspective of progressives and liberals in regard to the composition of the court.",

Unfortunately, Justice Sotomayor had some significant health problems over the years and she's also a very heavy former smoker. Those are the kinds of things that have to be taken into account in terms of an individualized risk assessment. Secondly, even a small risk here would have -- would have really, really catastrophic consequences if it should come to bear.And so, that's -- you have to take into account a 10 percent chance of something really terrible happening is a much worse risk than say an 80 percent chance of something only moderately bad happening. So, the risks here are so high that I think Democrats and progressives, in general, need to learn from the example of the RBG fiasco, and I hope that Justice Sotomayor is really taking this to heart.",
