Seen as a clear sign Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is determined to stay the course in his never ending quest to bring down inflation. The Fed increased the official key rate by a quarter of a point on Wednesday. Well, that came to most as no surprise. The U.S. financial markets did not respond well. The Dow was down more than 500 points, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P each lost more than 1-1/2 percent. Let's take a look at how markets in the Asia Pacific region are faring right now. The Nikkei is down a quarter of one percent, Hong Kong up by three quarters of one percent. Shanghai basically flat and Seoul KOSPI also flat as well. Fed Chairman Powell said the banking system is sound and resilient. He rejected calls for a pause in rate hikes. Notably a statement by the Fed did not explicitly refer to any future rate hikes, instead saying further increases may be needed. More now from CNN's Rahel Solomon. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAHEL SOLOMON, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): One says Fed announcement concludes, perhaps one of the most important Fed meetings in recent history. That's because while inflation is still a major concern, as of two weeks ago, so was bank instability. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Federal Reserve would be raising rates another quarter of a percent as most expected they would. He also reiterated what we've heard a lot from the Biden administration since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10th, that Americans should feel confidence in the banking system.",

We took powerful actions with Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors' savings are safe, and that the banking system is safe.Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week. And the last thing I'll say is that we've undertaken -- we're undertaken a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation. SOLOMON (voice over): Since March 2022, the Fed has raised rates an extraordinary amount of 475 basis points, or 4.75 percent, including this meeting. Now, when the Fed raises rates, it makes borrowing more expensive for us consumers which leads to less spending, which ultimately brings down prices. But higher rates also makes existing treasury bonds less valuable. And that can create issues for banks that are holding a lot of these bonds if they need to sell them anytime in the near future. That's part of what happened to SVB. And there's also fear of banking concerns grow, another bank could also fall to that's the tightrope for the Fed to walk. This widespread debate about whether the Fed can walk the walk and talk the talk. Essentially, can they strike a balance and do both things simultaneously? Prevent further damage with the banks, but also address inflation. SOLOMON (on camera): Rahel Solomon, CNN, New York, (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Or do they raise rates a little bit less aggressively than they might have otherwise because they're worried about a recession.So, I think that's what he's communicating there. He's saying, we're going to watch what the data does as it comes in, he keeps on using this term data dependent, the Fed is data dependent, and they are going to try to calibrate policy, depending on which risk they think is more dire at any given moment, is the risk inflation, is the risk recession slash financial turmoil. So, I think actually this is not a great situation to be in, where they have to maintain so much uncertainty about what their outlook is, and about what their likely trajectory is because they don't know where the economy -- the economy is going to end up.",

But that outcome is not guaranteed. What Powell, among others at the Fed have tried to communicate is in order to get inflation down, and to get price growth back to its long term target of two percent, that may require some tradeoffs, including potentially some layoffs, potentially some weakening of the economy, they obviously don't want those things to happen. But again, you know, there's no free lunch here. Whatever they do, will have some negative consequences on that. Now, I don't know if they're right. It may be the case that we can get inflation out of the system without more rate hikes. But I think the path of policy and the path of inflation that we've seen so far suggests that that will be challenging. That soft landing, you know, is definitely hoped for, it is possible, but it is not guaranteed. And there may be pain that results from that, but the Fed is certainly not seeking out that pain.
