I'm Becky Anderson coming to you live all weekfrom Doha in Qatar where we are following yet another stunning upset in the World Cup. It's been a day of high emotions on the pitch here in Qatar with a thrilling win in the day's opener. Iran scoring two goals very, very late into stoppage time to defeat Wales two-nil. They had the best of the play. Iran's chances of advancing the final 16 now revived with that win. The same cannot be said for host, Qatar, desperately needing to squeeze out at least a draw against Senegal, but the African champion won three-one despite what was a spirited effort by the host. And there was history made here. First goal of the tournament which the crowd in the stadium and the fans here in Doha - in downtown Doha into a frenzy. The biggest game of the day yet come, the United States facing off against England, World Sports Don Riddell is getting ready for that. He is outside the Al Bayt Stadium where that match will kick off at 10 o'clock, local time. What can we expect? Phil us, sir.",

It kind of has the atmosphere here wherewe can have a bit of a kick around ourselves before the game, if you want it to, Becky. But this was described pretty much as soon as the draw was made as one of the most hyped or most anticipated games of the group stage. Of course, England and the U.S.A. they have a bit of history when it comes to the World Cup. Famously, the Americans beat the England back in 1950, which was a national humiliation. They drew back in 2010 and the U.S. has made such great strides with their development of soccer, as they call it, that this really could be quite a game and the English team certainly know a lot of the American players, a handful of them play in the Premier League. They've improved a lot over the last few years. But some people are tipping England to go all the way in this tournament, especially the way they began with a six to drubbing of Iran. America definitely need to get something out of this game after they were disappointed that Wales came back against them and snatched a draw the other night.",

For a lot of Iranian football fans, today's win that we've just been discussing will be bittersweet a massive win on the pitch as we've been suggesting, but overshadowed by recent events inside Iran. Some fans wanted to use this opportunity to express their solidarity with protesters back home. One of them holding up a flag with the name of Mahsa Amini, the young woman whose death in police custody has set off weeks of deadly protests and calls for change. This fan also wore makeup depicting tears of blood. We should also note the Iranian players sang their national anthem before today's match after not doing so in the World Cup opener. And Italy's captain and goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon, had a message after the pitch for his counterparts on - in Iran saying, \"You will be remembered for your courage. This win is a sign of hope and strength for those in your country who are fighting for freedom. For many people you are heroes.\" Well, my next guest is Iranian American football fan, Camellia Senemar. She was at Iran-Welsh game earlier and says the match security, giving her a hard time over a protest patch she was wearing in support of Iranian women. She joins us now. Tell me what happened. CAMELLIA SENEMAR, IRANIAN- AMERICAN FOOTBALL FAN:  Thank you for having me. It was clearly - I went to the first game for Iran and it was clearly a much stricter security. And all I had was same similar top, a patch that said women, life, freedom on it in very small writing. And they gave us the hardest time to even try to go through. They were going to bar us access from the stadium. We saw this happened to a handful of other people in line. My family, I was with my mother and father and brother. I hid mine in my pocket just before I entered the security area and I was able to get it through. They gave my brother a very hard time. That's what I caught on video and it wasn't until I caught the footage and I had my phone up, they backtracked and they said, okay, you can go.",

My guess is, the Women's World Cup next year, we're going to be number one or number two in terms of tickets sold and, of course, the World Cup coming to North America in '26, the numbers are going to be insane in terms of the number of fans who go to games and so, yes, it's only going to grow.",
