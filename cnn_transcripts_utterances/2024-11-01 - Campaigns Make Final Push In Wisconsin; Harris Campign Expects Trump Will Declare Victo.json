Let's put her with a rifle, standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face. You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh, gee, Will, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.

We have CNN's MJ Lee, covering the Harris campaign from West Allis. But let's begin with CNN's Steve Contorno, who is in Michigan.

But we certainly expect that whenever she does address them to hear a strong condemnation of those comments and really any kind of rhetoric that incites political violence, we did just hear from some senior campaign officials, though, who basically said, look, we think that this kind of rhetoric, this late in the game, can still make a difference with voters, whether it is the comments that you were just talking about that Trump made about Liz Cheney or the kind of rhetoric that we heard from some of the speakers at Donald Trump's recent Madison Square Garden rally, they said it can have sort of the capacity to turn off voters away from Donald Trump.On this call with reporters just now, something else that the Harris campaign said that they were readying for is the possibility of the former President declaring victory early on Tuesday. This is what one senior campaign official said. They said, this should be no surprise because he lies all the time and he wants to sow doubt about a loss that he anticipates is coming. Now, we are standing outside here in Milwaukee where later tonight, the Harris campaign is going to be hosting a big rally featuring celebrities like Cardi B, obviously, a part of the last minute, eleventh hour push to mobilize voters as much as possible in this critical state. And I'll tell you, you know, talking to Democrats who are working on trying to elect the Vice President to the White House, it's pretty remarkable how much still we are seeing sort of the ghost of 2016 looming over and haunting this party. This, of course, would be a reference to when Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election to Donald Trump. And in the course of losing, she lost all three of the critical blue wall seats including this state of Wisconsin, a state that she ended up not setting foot in once during the general election. So this is certainly a mistake state that the Democratic Party does not want to repeat with Kamala Harris going for the presidency. And that is why we've seen such a focus from this campaign on this date, really, since day one. Boris and Brianna?",

And it's a good sign for the former President of the United States, I do believe. And that is the right direction wrong track number. All right. Just 28% of the country believes that currently, the United States is on the right track. Look at the average for the -- when the incumbent party is lost, it's 25%, pretty much equal to that 28%. The average when the incumbent party is won, which is obviously the Democrats, is 42%. I've looked back at presidential elections since 1980. There is not a single case of the incumbent party holding onto the White House when so few Americans believe that the country is on the right track. So this is a good sign for Donald Trump.",

They're giving them a reason to get off the couch, to actually come over when they really were kind of apathetic about the race to begin with. I don't think there's a whole lot of persuasion going on in the last 72 hours. If you're persuading in this final stretch, I mean, that's really tough. It's all about getting your vote out.And if some of those late deciders now, I don't think that someone today is who they're talking about. I think they're (inaudible) over the last week, we've seen both campaigns have moments of momentum.

But when he raises the idea, hey, well, how would she feel if she had a bunch of guns, quote, trained on her face? I think it's very dangerous. You know, all it takes is one crackpot to see that as somehow a permission slip.Politically, it obviously doesn't help. It's a dumb stupid statement. And it's only going to turn off more women. You know, between Biden, and Trump, and the comedian, and all of that, I'm beginning to wonder whether this election is going to go to the person who doesn't make the last stupid remark.",

Chris, I wonder what you make of the kind of rhetoric that we're hearing in the sense that it's not just more sort of weaponized and militarized, but it's being specifically directed with intent.In other words, it fits into a pattern of Trump talking about resentments and a desire for revenge.",

Clearly, he feels that a lot of his base is angry, is resentful, is alienated, feels that they're being preached to, and have policy made by an elite that advantages other elites, but not them. And he is trying to speak to that resentment.But again, to go back to this comment about Liz Cheney, you know, you could sit there and say, oh, well, you know, what he's really saying is, you know, she's all for wars, but she can sit back in Washington. But this is the same guy who's talking about the enemy within and talking about the National Guard and even the military conceivably being used. And when people say, oh, okay, it's just violent protesters, he talks about Nancy Pelosi. He talks about Congressman Adam Schiff. So there does seem to be, I mean, if you believe what the man says, he does seem to be indicating that the use of force against his political enemies. I don't think it's a stretch.",

I think he's got wild political skills. If he were a stock, I'd invest in him. And I think whether it's in 28 or 32, he's only 46. We'll be talking about him as a possible presidential contender. But at one point, I asked him, he's a big football fan. And he -- we actually play a video where he get -- takes a pass, a really skillful reception of him from Lamar Jackson, the quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens. I said, honestly, Governor, if you had to choose political career or you could be a good pro football player. And he says, no question, I would have traded all of my politics to play pro football. It's a perfect game and it's not even close. And he said, I've actually begged the coach of the Baltimore Ravens. He, of course, is a Baltimore Ravens fan coming from Maryland. I have begged John Harbaugh, the coach, to let me be a Raven for a day.",
