But as you've mentioned, we've seen yet again, strikes targeting Beirut, southern suburbs and Haret Hreik and Dahiyeh.These are areas that Hezbollah strongholds, but they are also areas that are densely populated still with civilians and of course we have seen those evacuation orders put in place. The Israeli military has once again said that it issued evacuation orders for families living in these southern suburbs but so many now across Lebanon are internally displaced. This is a very packed, densely populated city and so efforts to mitigate civilian risk can only go so far as you can imagine in such a tightly packed city. And of course we've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu who despite dialogue between the United States and Israel has once again reiterated that Israel will target Hezbollah wherever they are located in Lebanon, regardless of whether it is the capital or not. And of course, we have seen Hezbollah continue to target Israeli territory as well. The Israeli military says some 90 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel on Tuesday. But again, we're hearing really staggering figures. I mean, Lebanese authorities say that the number of attacks on Lebanon by Israel has now surpassed 10,000. The death toll continues to rise. So this is a deeply concerning situation, particularly if we are not seeing, once again, Israel heeding those warnings and discussions with one of their closest allies, the U.S.",

Esper wrote in his book, \"A Sacred Oath\" that at that time, Trump asked of a possible military response to the protesters, quote, \"can't you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?\" Esper also wrote that in 2020, Trump asked him about launching U.S. missiles to attack Mexican drug cartels. General Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump, told journalist Bob Woodward that Trump is, quote, \"a fascist to the core.\" MEREDITH MCGRAW, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"POLITICO\": We saw how Donald Trump tested the limits of what the military could do in his first term, but now as he's looking at potentially a second term, he and his allies are raising questions about how they might be able to deploy the military on everything from the border to go after those perceived political enemies.",

But we've never seen quite something like this. This is a first and it marks a significant step in terms of the U.S. demanding that Israel do more when it comes to humanitarian aid going into Gaza.In a letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the two write to senior Israeli officials that more needs to be done, that aid since the spring has dropped by some 50 percent, and that September had, quote, \"the lowest of any month during the past year.\" In light of that, and because of the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, Blinken and Austin call on Israel to carry out an, quote, \"urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory.\" Now, the U.S. gives Israel 30 days to address the humanitarian situation in Gaza. They point out that this review is effectively necessary by U.S. law because you have to make sure that countries that get U.S. foreign military assistance are following U.S. law and international humanitarian law. So that, they say is the reason for this litter, but there is clear concern about the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, and that's the driving force here. The real question, does this lead to meaningful change when it comes to the U.S. providing military assistance to Israel? Over the course of the past year, the only thing we have seen consistently held was a single shipment of 2,000-pound bombs that remains held to this point. But in theory, at least, that's what this warning is about a threat that if Israel doesn't take stress steps to address the humanitarian concerns, you might see that play out and affect U.S. military assistance to Israel. At the same time, the U.S. making it absolutely clear that it will do and provide everything it can for Israel's defensive needs. And on that note, the first parts and the first service members from an advanced U.S. anti-ballistic missile system have already arrived in Israel. The THAAD system, Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense. The U.S. and the Pentagon said that would arrive in the coming days. Now the first components of that are beginning to arrive along with some of the advanced troops that will help set that up. It's not the full system, but that is clearly on the way. The U.S. very much concerned about first, Israel's promise to respond to an Iranian ballistic missile barrage from earlier this month, and second, Iran's vow to retaliate to any attack. And that's what the THAAD is there for, to make sure Israel has not only high-quality defenses against Iranian attacks, but also a great quantity of defenses because we have seen very clearly how large those Iranian barrages can be.

And if you get into the upper elevations of West Virginia, there could be a snow flurry or two. Let's get to La Nina. This is when there is a cold pool of water in the Pacific Ocean that bumps up against South America. What it does is reflect the jet stream a little bit and it affects the weather. So rather than having weather coming in from the west like El Nino, now all of a sudden it's coming in from the northwest keeping things cool but as it makes a turn here in the Midwest and the Great Lakes it gets fairly wet. There could be some tornado activity here in the spring as we get closer to that warm cold clash. And I don't really see that with El Nino, but it's certainly possible with La Nina. So this is where we bend warm, dry across the upper Midwest, cool across the deep south. And that's all about to change.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN SR. U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: They're saying Bao Li, Qing Bao, Have a safe trip. You are getting a very rare look at the panda send-off here in China. I've never been this close to a panda, but there she is. A few hours earlier, a private farewell for the three-year-old panda pair and a ceremonial transfer of care from China to the U.S. We got here a few days ahead of the send-off. We made it. It's a long journey. Traveling to Chengdu and meeting up with panda keepers from the Smithsonian's National Zoo. Thanks for making time. I know you guys are busy, Mariel, Trish. We catch them just outside the panda quarantine zone. TRISH JARVIS, SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL ZOO PANDA KEEPER: This was what I worked for, and it feels so surreal.",

MELISSA SONGER, CONSERVATION BIOLOGIST, SMITHSONIAN'S NATIONAL ZOO: Part of the reason for putting them in an area like this and keeping them away from people is so that they're not acclimatized to people.
