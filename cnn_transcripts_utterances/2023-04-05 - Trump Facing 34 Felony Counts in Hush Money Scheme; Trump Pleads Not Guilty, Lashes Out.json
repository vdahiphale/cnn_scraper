This is what the district attorney was saying at his press conference yesterday that, you know, he's going after 117 people just in the last year around falsification of business records. It may not matter outside of Manhattan, but it matters a lot in Manhattan. This is a big part of what this office does.And so, you know, for Donald Trump to sort of, say, well, well, this doesn't matter, this is politically motivated, he's going to say that, he's the defendant. For others, I'm a little baffled by this to say this doesn't matter whether or not it was a crime. And it's like, well, it seems to matter to the grand jury. It matters to the prosecutor. I think Alvin Bragg made a compelling case that it matters because Manhattan in particular is the business center of the world and the transactions have got to be kept straight. There are other jurisdictions that are somewhat like that. You go to chance record in Delaware. They take a lot of these things very seriously. So, yes, it's --",

Now, police say that the vehicle that you see here, that white vehicle, was believed to be stolen. And inside was 17-year-old Delanio Martin (ph). Now, police say he was asleep in the parked car. The video shows, as you can see here, police, in the moments beforehand discussing ways to get into the car to arrest him. And at one point, an officer opens the backdoor to get in while another officer opens the front driver door. Now, the footage shows the car suddenly drive off and one of the Park Police officers is still in the backseat of the car and yells for him to stop. There's a tussle and then these are the moments.
