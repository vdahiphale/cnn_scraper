(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley making a generational appeal to Republican voters in Iowa on Sunday night at a CNN town hall, telling voters she's in it to win it, making clear that she's trying to elevate her candidacy in the growing field of Republican candidates. She did so by taking direct aim at former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, particularly on Social Security and Medicare. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know that Trump and DeSantis have both said we're not going to deal with entitlement reform. Don't lie to them, and say, oh, we don't have to deal with entitlement reform. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. It's the reality. I'm always going to tell the truth. Is it going to hurt? Yes.",

Ron DeSantis is in a stronger position as a Trump alternative, I think, than any single individual alternative was in 2016, whether it was Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or John Kasich.I think DeSantis has the capacity to consolidate more of the Republicans hesitant about Trump than any of those did. But he is not kind of an infinite capacity. And there is, in fact, a kind of overlap of the dynamic -- repeat of the dynamic of 2016 in this sense. In 2016, Donald Trump won about half of the Republicans without a college degree. He only won about a third of the Republicans with a degree, but the rest of those white-collar Republicans never consolidated around a single alternative to him. That's the risk, I think, for Republicans. Again, many of these candidates getting into the race, Nikki Haley, Chris Christie, Tim Scott, even probably DeSantis, ultimately they appeal more to the white-collar side of the party than to the blue- collar side of the party, that is Trump's strength. And so, there is the risk that there's too little competition for Trump in effect in his pool and too much competition for the pool of voters who are the most skeptical of him.",

Well, first, I mean, it is extraordinary that we went as far as we did toward the brink of a domestic and global financial catastrophe, perhaps over such a modest set of policy goals. I mean, the ends and the means were so out of whack here that it really gives you the feeling that the main reason for this fight among Republicans was to show their voters that they were having this fight.The resolution of this shows you Biden's approach to the presidency, I think, very concisely in miniature. You know, he has, at times, raised very sharp objections to Republicans, to MAGA Republicans, but, by and large, his instinct is to make the system work rather than trying to call out Republicans as a threat to it. And here in the end, he abandoned his position, which had really been the position of Obama as well after 2011 of not negotiating over the debt ceiling, not seeming to want to reward hostage-taking to in fact negotiate a surprisingly good deal from the point of view of Democrats. Republicans didn't get a heck of a lot of what they wanted, but they got something of what they wanted. And in that sense, he did reward hostage-taking. And so, this is -- you know, this is  kind of the tightrope of the Biden presidency, trying to call out the breaking of norms, the threat to small-D democracy represented by the Trump faction within the GOP, but also trying to show that he can work with at least some of the Republicans and make the system work. He has certainly been able to reach more bipartisan deals than many people, myself included, expected, but he is presiding over an era in which you are seeing these kind of mounting threats to democracy and you have, on the Democratic side, those who wish he would be more aggressive at calling it out and less focused on trying to grease the system and keep it functioning.",

Russian missile strikes once again renewing their calls for help from the international community with their air defenses. But similar calls are coming from authorities inside Russia in the border areas now, they say, under bombardment from Ukraine or from Ukrainian-backed Russian dissidents who split into two different groups, have attacked villages across a substantial stretch of territory now inside Russia, just across the northern border with Ukraine with the local authorities saying over the last 10 days or so at least seven civilians have been killed, four thousand have had to have been evacuated from a number of towns and villages where they've been burning buildings and a number of artillery strikes that they blame on the Ukrainians. And the Russian dissidents have paraded a number of prisoners of war, at least to the people they claim to be prisoners of war, Russian prisoners of war, that they've offered today to exchange with the local governor if he agreed to meet them. He didn't make the rendezvous. And so, they have posted online a commitment now to hand those prisoners of war over to the Ukrainian authorities. We've got no independent way of proving whether or not these men were prisoners of war, but we do know that these Russian dissidents are very fast on the draw when it comes to social media. This is very much part of their campaign to try to spread the dissident message to try to spread ultimately some kind of revolution against Vladimir Putin.

Now on Saturday, we had warships from China and the U.S. that were involved in a near collision. And now we have -- new video was released earlier today of this close encounter.So, this is what happened here. Let's take a look at this video. The U.S. and Canada, they were staging a \"routine transit\" through the Taiwan Strait. When you see that vessel straight ahead, a Chinese ship cut in front of the U.S. warship. The U.S. military says that the Chinese vessel came within only 150 yards. That's about 137 meters of the U.S. ship in a \"unsafe manner.\" And that forced the U.S. ship to slow down to avoid a full-on collision. Now, hours after this happened in the Taiwan Strait. Meanwhile, in Singapore, China's Defense Chief Li Shangfu accused the United States of creating chaos in the region. He was speaking as Singapore's security forum, the Shangri-La forum, he said this, \"They are not here for innocent passage. They are here for provocation.\" Now, Li, the Chinese defense chief also said in his speech in Singapore that the U.S. and China should see common ground and common interests. But keep in mind that China earlier rejected an offer from the Pentagon Chief Lloyd Austin to meet face to face at the summit formally setting sanctions on Chinese individuals and companies. Austin, he expressed deep concern about this lack of high-level military communication between these two powers when he gave a speech at the Singapore summit on Saturday and springing up the statement for you. This is what Lloyd Austin said. The U.S. Defense Secretary saying \"For responsible leaders the right time to talk is any time, the right time to talk is every time, the right time to talk is now.\" U.S.-China relationship is at a very low point. The lowest point in decades. The two are at loggerheads over a slate of issues from trade to Taiwan to access to sensitive technology to territorial issues, but some engagement is happening. In fact, on Friday U.S. official told CNN that the CIA director secretly traveled to China last month to help reset relations and also keep in mind that handshake that took place, you know, dinner Friday night in Singapore, Secretary Austin shook hands with his Chinese counterpart but that was it. It was only a handshake without high- level military talks. That single gesture is not enough to cool the tension. Laila.",

So that obviously puts a wrench into the Fed, which then goes 10 times in a row, we've seen the increase in the rate.

There are 19,000 Directors Guild members and they wanted more money. They wanted artificial intelligence and streaming concerns to be addressed and it looks like they got that. So, there's going to be a five percent wage increase in the first year.Assistant directors are going to see their workdays cut by an hour. We had been hearing that many members in multiple guilds feel not only overworked and underpaid, something that is interesting is that in the contract, it also bans live ammunition on the set. This is coming a little over a year after what happened on the set of Russ where cinematographer Halyna Hutchins being killed by a live round of ammunition that somehow got its way onto set. And in that prop time that actor Alec Baldwin was holding. When it comes to artificial intelligence, the agreement would also put in to writing a clause about the use of A.I. stating, \"A.I. is not a person and that generative A.I. cannot replace the duties performed by members.\" And for the first time, global streaming video on demand residuals would be paid on the number of international subscribers. So, this results in a 76 percent increase in foreign residuals for the biggest services. So, this is tentative. This is going to be submitted to the guild's national board in a meeting on Tuesday. But again, we still have the Writers on strike. We still have SAG that's currently figuring out their own deal. And this is important because the content that we all watch and we consume, this is a -- this means we need directors, we need writers, we need actors to do that. So, the Writers Guild has come out and said that they support their friends in the DGA, but that they are still holding out for their own deal and for their own agreement on wages and residuals and concerns with A.I. So, we'll see. You know, I've had writers tell me that they think the writers strike could go through the summer. Back to you.",
