Just one of the rail cars within that mess that you're seeing on your screen. Inside of it is a chemical called vinyl chloride. It's used to make PVC pipes, plastics, things like that, and it is extremely flammable.And the safety valves on that rail car which would typically release the chemical after a derailment like this aren't working, which has trapped that vinyl chloride inside the rail car. And as this massive fire that you've seen on your screen is burning, that railcar has been heating up. And so, officials are concerned that if it gets too hot, it could actually explode and send potentially deadly shrapnel flying up to a mile in any direction, creating, as you said, that extremely dangerous situation. And so, right now, crews are on the ground trying to figure out how to get that chemical out of the railcar before something like that happens. And as you said, they're also evacuating people. They've evacuated everyone in East Palestine within a mile of that derailment site, and they've even evacuated the police department's communication center. It gives you a sense of just how seriously they're taking this. Here's the warning from the fire chief. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, what I see is a path in which inflation is declining significantly, and the economy is remaining strong. And really that path, I believe, is possible.

      "sentences": "Hi, Kristin. Yes. And I should say Secretary Yellen look is not the only person who believes that we're hearing over the last month or so from other economists -- many other economists and officials who say that look, we may avoid a recession. And yet Kristin, it seems like Americans aren't exactly buying it. Take a look at these poll numbers. So, you can see only 33 percent of Americans have a good view of the economy now. That is higher than last week -- slightly higher than last week, but certainly still in pessimistic territory. A few reasons why. Of course, inflation is the elephant in the room, right?Prices are higher by about six and a half percent compared to a year ago. Off the peak of 9.1 percent, but still painfully high. And, Kristin, those higher prices has meant that for some, you either have to tap your savings, below through your savings, or potentially even use credit cards. Part of the reason why people are feeling crummy about the economy, also wages. For most people, even if you have made more in the last year, inflation has probably outpaced that. So, even if you are making more, it probably feels like you're bringing home less. All of that explaining why Americans still feel pretty lousy about the economy. And, Kristin, I should say it's not just the feeling that's out there. We're also starting to see it in the data. When you look at consumer spending, when you look at retail sales, Americans starting to pull back on their spending and pull back on their discretionary spending. So, also showing it with their wallets.",

They stole the designs 15 years ago for the F-35 fighter, the most expensive fighter in the American arsenal, and built their own version. They took from the Office of Personnel Management the security clearance files of 22 million Americans, including 6 million fingerprints.And that gave them great detail about who works on what. I doubt they got as much from this. But the fact that you could be out in Montana or Kansas City or off Myrtle Beach and see the collection instrument right above you, I think drove home the nature of the U.S.-China competition, much more viscerally to most Americans.",

It's not clear that the Trump administration recognized at the time that they were trying these balloon launches, but in retrospect, people have begun to piece these back together.But they didn't run straight across the country. They came to the edges of the coast. They were over islands, and one was over Florida. But they did not do what this one did, which was to transit the entire country.

He represents the Beach family. 19-year-old Mallory Beach was killed in 2019 on a boat that Paul Murdaugh was driving. And the Beach family was suing Alex Murdaugh because he was the owner of that boat. So, Tinsley said that he wanted Alex Murdaugh to prove that he had the financials to pay the Beach family. He wanted him to expose his accounts in a -- in a hearing that was upcoming on June 10, 2021. The murders took place on June 7, 2021.

I feared this ruling -- I feared this ruling because the prosecution has a very weak case for murder and then they're using a very weak motive theory to bolster that case, essentially doing a trial within a trial, a white-collar fraud trial, to bolster, you know, their weak case of murder.And my concern was that to help the jury or try to sway the jury that he was under tremendous pressure that he would not only kill his wife but blow his son's head -- you know, brain out that they would have to show tremendous evidence. The more the evidence, the more the pressure. And this is why I was concerned that the judge would open up the floodgates to all of this coming in. This is really, really consequential because it's going to go to whether or not Alex Murdaugh can take the stand and testify. In South -- in South Carolina, there's a three-strike law and a breach of trust of over $2,000, very draconian is a strike. Now he's got 99 charges and 19 indictments. He's got way beyond three. When he takes the stand -- if he takes the stand, he's essentially going to have to admit to these financial crimes, and that subjects him to life without parole just on the financial stuff. So, the question becomes for the defense, do we put them up and get them off murder, hopefully, or does he get elbow up on the murder? Does he get elbow up on the financial crimes? It's a very difficult decision that is already difficult but even more difficult now for the defense.",
