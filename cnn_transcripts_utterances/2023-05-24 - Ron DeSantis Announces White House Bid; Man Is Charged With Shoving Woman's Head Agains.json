We have Sara Fischer, Danny Freeman, Bianna Golodryga, and Miguel Marquez. Great to have all of you here tonight.Okay, so, Republican Governor -- Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis announcing his 2024 White House bid tonight on Tweeter in a conversation with Twitter owner Elon Musk, but they did have some technical glitches and crashes beforehand. Sara Fischer is covering this story for us. Sara, I joked before in the last hour that Elon Musk has had easier rocket launches than this, you know, launch of Governor DeSantis's presidential announcement. What went wrong, what happened to derail this?",

Wasn't he the person who supposed to bring product updates and innovation to Twitter? The fact that this was going to be your most high-profile event and you couldn't get it right is a huge issue blow to Twitter. I will say, hopefully, this is an impetus for them to start to take a lot more things seriously. They fired a ton of engineers. They had 7,500 people that work for them. There's about 1,000 now. So, maybe they are starting to realize that this product is going to need actual serious attention if they want to continue to host live events like this, announcements, shows, etcetera.",

I don't need to say that Fox isn't relevant. It is. It is definitely the number one cable news network for Republicans.

And so that is not something that is indicative of a false flag.Second, it wasn't followed up by a major operation. So, when you hear of Russia operating a false flag, it is too bomb attack, do something that you know is going to happen rather quickly after that false flag operation. That never happened here. So, I was always skeptical as to that argument, and I thought that it could very well be the Ukrainians that were behind this. Now, was it the Ukrainian military proper? No. I am hearing from many sources that it was likely Ukrainian intelligence and this was something to do to rattle the Russians. And as intercepts have shown, Russians communicating with each other were very skeptical about this, again, coming from them. And we're concerned that this was, indeed, at the hands of the Ukrainians. Now, whether Zelenskyy knew about this or not, I think there is some question about that.
