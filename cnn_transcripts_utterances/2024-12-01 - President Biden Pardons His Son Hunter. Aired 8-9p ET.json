We're going to start first with CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez, who, Evan, you just got the statement from Hunter Biden. I'd also want to touch on the statement from President Biden himself that he issued and really tried to explain himself frankly to the American people, saying that he hopes they understand that he's making -- why he's making this decision that it was something he had wrestled with but that ultimately in his words he believed this was a miscarriage of justice. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica, those are really stark words to be hearing from the president of the United States. I mean, this is a president who ran for office and said he was trying to turn the page on Donald Trump, who had attacked all the institutions and said he was here to restore faith in those institutions. And you see from this statement that it's clear he doesn't believe those institutions have treated his son very well and very fairly. I'll read you his statement and then we can talk a little bit moreabout it today. He said, \"Today I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I watched my son being selectively and unfairly prosecuted.\" He goes on to describe some of the aggravating factors in these two twin cases, the gun charges that Hunter Biden faced, as well as tax charges. And I'll read you just another part where he says, \"The charges in this case came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then a carefully negotiated plea deal agreed to by the Department of Justice unraveled in the courtroom, and a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had that plea deal held, it would have been a fair and reasonable resolution of Hunter's case.\" And then he goes on to say, really addressing the American public who he knows will be judging this, Jessica. He says, \"For my entire career, I have followed a simple principle -- just tell the American people the truth. They'll be fair-minded. Here's the truth. I believe in the justice system. But as I watch, as I wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it has led to a miscarriage of justice.\" And he said that once he made that decision this weekend, he made -- he decided to go ahead with it. The president, by the way, Jessica, is leaving for a trip to Africa I think in the next few hours. And, you know, Hunter Biden was facing sentencing in both of these cases in the coming days. First, in Delaware, where he was convicted of three charges, gun-related charges. He's facing 17 years possibly in that case, Jessica. And then in Los Angeles. he was also set to be sentenced later this month on tax evasion charges. Those carry a sentence of up to 25 years. So this, with this signing of this pardon, President Biden is resolving all of those things, things that have hung over Hunter's head really for about six years.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I mean, part of the problem here was, I think as Elie Honig was describing a while ago is that, you know, these cases are a little unusual. You don't see a lot of them in the federal system. Not certainly the gun charges. You don't see it unless there is some other aggravating factor, for instance, you know, if you're -- if someone dies as a result of you buying a gun when you didn't have the right to own it.So things like that usually are what those cases come about. So it's very unusual and it's hard to judge what would have happened in this case. But yes, I mean he was looking at the likelihood of spending at least some time in federal prison, especially because he had two separate sentencings that were coming up in the next few days. And by the way, Jessica, you know, for Hunter Biden, obviously, you know, he hopes that this resolves all of this. But the incoming administration has also made clear that they have additional questions. They want to spend more time investigating Hunter and Joe Biden. And you keep hearing rhetoric from Capitol Hill about Republicans who say that they want to take another look at what they say was criminal issues that they say were associated with the Bidens. So this may not be over for those people obviously.",

His other son, Beau Biden, dying from glioblastoma in 2015 and there has been so much -- they are so close and they spend so much time together and Hunter has advised him on a number of moments and decisions, both as president and before.Jeff, stay with us. Let's go to Elie Honig who's joining us as well. And Elie, I just want to get your legal perspective on all of this because as you and I talked about last hour, but also as Jeff was just talking about there, this idea that President Biden really got at in his statement that this was a miscarriage of justice, that this was not -- that Hunter Biden was prosecuted because of who his father was. What do you make of that?",

And Elie, just going -- Evan just explained that this dismisses all these charges, these specific charges. For people watching what might this mean, though, moving forward? Because we're also getting this reporting that there is concern from the Biden family that the Trump administration may zero in on Hunter may come back and try to investigate him further or prosecute him further. What does the pardon mean going forward? Anything?",

    {
      "timeStamp": "20:35:13",
      "speaker": "HONIG",
      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica. So in terms of scope, we have to look at the specific language of the actual pardon documents that come out. If they just say Hunter Biden is hereby pardoned for case number, whatever it is, the federal case in Delaware for guns and case number whatever it is in federal case in California for taxes, then that's the only coverage that Hunter Biden has. And if the next Justice Department decides it wants to keep on investigating Hunter Biden and look at other areas, then it can do that if the pardons are narrowly crafted.However, if the pardon is broader, if it's a blanket pardon and Joe Biden can issue a pardon if he wants, it says, I hereby pardon Hunter Biden for everything that has happened from the beginning of time until today, until December 1st, 2024. If that's the way the pardon reads, then Hunter Biden's coverage is much, much broader and essentially blocks out the possibility of any other federal charge. We have seen blanket pardons before. Richard Nixon was given essentially a blanket pardon by Gerald Ford. So we need to look at the specific language of that pardon. One thing that cannot happen from a pardon is a president cannot issue a pardon that works forward in time. In other words, a pardon can only excuse someone for everything they've done up to this point. But you can't say, I hereby issue a pardon for anything the person might do in the future. Might do from December 2nd of 2024 on. So the scope and the coverage here are going to be really important. And if Joe Biden wants to ensure that Hunter Biden cannot be continually federally investigated moving forward, then his move would be to issue a very broad blanket pardon as opposed to just a narrow pardon focusing on the two specific cases.",

Joe Biden pardoned his own son. So that's the standard that now Joe Biden has in the process of protecting his son from the charges that he was facing and the jail time that he was likely facing because of he feels like political retribution for him and thinking about what might be coming down the road. He's also given Donald Trump a talking point here. There's no question about it.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back to our breaking news coverage of President Biden pardoning his son Hunter Biden. This coming after he said for months that he would not be doing that.We are getting a statement from the Trump team via spokesperson Steven Cheung. It reads, quote, \"The failed witch hunts against President Trump have proven that the Democrat-controlled DOJ and other radical prosecutors are guilty of weaponizing the justice system. That system of justice must be fixed and due process must be restored for all Americans, which is exactly what President Trump will do as he returns to the White House with an overwhelming mandate from the American people.\" Again, that is a statement on behalf of President Trump. I want to go to Ron Brownstein, who is with us. And Ron, you hear that and then I'm starting to see, we're starting to get reaction from members of the Senate -- of Republican senators. Tom Cotton kind of stuck out to me, which he had several points. But he said, lastly Democrats can spare us the lectures about the rule of law when, say, President Trump nominates Pam Bondi and Kash Patel to clean up this corruption. The politics of this is pretty dynamic.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, look, I mean, Democrats, I think, you know, started the Biden presidency with the idea that if they stood for norms, they would make it harder for Republicans to depart from those norms. And, you know, you got Merrick Garland and all the hesitancy in the Justice Department about taking on Donald Trump for years.And then Donald Trump nominated Matt Gaetz and Kash Patel to the FBI. I mean, the idea that, like, there's a forbearance on the part of Democrats that will kind of embarrass Trump into upholding norms, just seems to me nonsensical. So, you know, what you're talking about here is, you know, Biden taking a step that is going to be very controversial, even with his own party to protect his son, but is certainly in line with what we have seen from Trump in the past with all of his senior campaign aides and advisers. Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, yesterday, you know, the pardon for Jared Kushner's father, who he's now sending to France, wants to send to France as the ambassador. I actually think that, you know, there's going to be obviously a lot of uproar about this, but some of the question is going to be, should Biden go further, given how Trump has overtly threatened to prosecute people who are involved, for example, in his, you know, in the special counsel's investigation of his role in January 6th? Is that something Biden should consider?",

I think Ron is right on when he says that the Democrats have been trying to play by the norms and then here we have Trump coming in with norm busting nominees for cabinet posts, particularly at FBI and the Department of Justice. So that isn't going to play. I mean, you can't really argue norms in these situations. This is a norm buster, too, but I think it will be probably heatedly debated for some time.",
