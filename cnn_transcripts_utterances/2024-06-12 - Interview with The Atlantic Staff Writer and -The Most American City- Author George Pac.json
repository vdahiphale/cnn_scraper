And Phoenix, I think, is about as good a lab as you can find because it really has all the major themes and conflicts and issues of our time. It has political extremism in a big way. Every election year is a tense year in Arizona, and this year is no exception. It has a climate crisis that you just described and that I reported on in my piece with unbearable heat as well as disappearing water in some parts of the state. And it also has the border and immigration as a huge factor in the coming election. Abortion is another one. It's got this incredible nexus of issues, some of which divide people almost hopelessly, and others have this odd effect of overcoming some of the divisions that seem so permanent and insuperable in our country.",

And people who are homeless, people who are vulnerable in the ways that I described, are risking their lives every day and dying every day. And the emergency rooms over the summer fill up with people coming in whose body temperatures are 106 or 107, which is heat stroke and can be fatal. People find ways of coping. The City of Phoenix has lots of innovative methods of allowing people to come inside and cool off in these cooling buses and cooling buildings. They're trying to plant more trees and build more shelters, because it's a kind of naked exposed city in the summer. But it, it all feels unsustainable. Because driving, which is one way to cool off, because you're in your car, which is air conditioned, is also burning you up because air conditioning causes 4 percent of global emissions. So, there -- and the temperature rises every year. There is no abating of it. And who knows where it will be in 25 years. So, there is a sense of eight months of the year, it's paradise. And that's why people move there. And four months of the year, it's deadly.",

So, one of the things that George said, he quoted in his book in the article, whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting. You know, there's a lack of water, but apparently people didn't seem to think that that was something that, you know, should be an election issue or a political issue. What are you seeing in terms of the politics around this now? LEAH STOKES, PROFESSOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS, U.C. SANTA BARBARA AND CLIMATE POLICY EXPERT:  Well, that's a great question. You know, the fact is, as we just heard, the climate crisis is happening now. For decades, it was sort of viewed as a problem for the future. Something that would affect our grandchildren, or maybe poorer people in developing countries, you know, maybe something for somebody else. And what we are seeing is that this is the climate crisis, it is on our doorsteps. This is what we are seeing in the United States at just one and a quarter degree centigrade of warming. What happens when we blow past that 1.5 degrees target that, you know, governments around the world are trying to hold us to? What if we go to 2 degrees or 2.5 degrees? What does life look like for everyday people? And so, this is becoming a really important political issue. And in the United States, for example, with the upcoming election this fall, there's going to be a very clear choice between somebody who says he \"wants to be a dictator on day one to drill, drill, drill.\" That's of course, Donald Trump, and somebody who really is the best climate president this country has ever seen and has really focused on this issue. So, will that play out in the election? Will people show up to vote for President Biden because of his climate record? I think it's too early to tell. But we're certainly seeing the impacts are hitting everyday Americans every day.",

Here's another quote. The Republican Party there is more radical than any other state, but the chief qualification for viability is an embarrassingly discredited belief in rigged elections. So, you've got that. How does that affect what people think about climate policy, Leah? Because there are conservative Republicans who do believe -- I mean, they may be a small group, but they do believe that climate should be a unifier.

And the sides line up and nothing gets done legislatively. But if you look at it locally and in terms of a community's water supply or even the well in somebody's backyard in a rural county, a conservative rural county in Southern Arizona, once people find that they're losing their water and it's in Arizona, it's partly because in rural areas, there is no regulation. Phoenix is highly regulated and Phoenix has a lot of water. It's not about to run out. But exurban communities around Phoenix and even more rural areas around the state are risking losing their groundwater. And it's because it's unregulated and big agribusinesses are coming in from out of state and even from other countries and pumping relentlessly, local people, including MAGA Republicans are upset about that and are now starting to demand that their state representatives allow legislation to pass that would regulate groundwater. It's still stuck in the partisan gears of the Arizona State Legislature, but what's interesting to me is to watch actual personal experience of that incontrovertible fact, my well is dry, change the mind of a voter.

I want to ask both of you. Basically, we're not hearing much about climate in -- you know, in any of the political manifestos and talking points that both parties are using right now on the campaign trail.

And it is a very detailed plan for how to dismantle our federal infrastructure. Things like getting rid of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which literally just keeps track of, you know, data around what is happening to our earth. You know, they want to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency. We saw what a first Trump administration would do, rolling back, you know, almost 100 environmental rules, pulling us out of the Paris climate agreement. And what does a well-organized second Trump administration look like? If you want to know what it looks like, look at that Project 2025 document. It's very scary. By contrast, what the Biden folks want to do is they want to keep delivering. And as you're saying, why don't people know about it more? Well, this law is just beginning to roll out. And we really need those four more years for all of those jobs to start rolling into these communities for people to get electric vehicles, for them to put in a heat pump to start seeing those benefits. You know, laws take time to really take hold. And with those crucial years before 2030, whoever wins this fall election will really be rewriting, you know, world history when it comes to the climate crisis.

I think people vote more and more along what I would call tribal lines. This is my identity. This is who I vote for. And if they discovered that Biden's three big legislative achievements have brought a battery plant to their town, they may not think, therefore, I will vote for Biden. It may just kind of go in one ear and out the other. I saw a lot of that, just national politics and the ins and outs of Washington legislation having very little effect on people's thinking about the election. And it's also, I think, the failure of the Biden administration itself to defend its achievements and to speak for them. And that goes to the president himself, who is not a master of rhetoric, and rhetoric is important in politics. So, that doesn't quite answer your question. But I do think we shouldn't expect there to be a logical cause and effect if a bill gets passed by a president that leads to certain electoral results.",

Why -- you know, all this emotion and enthusiasm around Greta Thunberg, which really powered a green sort of momentum in Europe a few years ago seems to have not materialized this time.

It's true thatthe green parties did not do very well, and there was some surging in the far-right, but it was not as bad as people were predicting in the polls. And the coalition that will continue to govern is does want climate action. And of course, as you know, what really matters is who is controlling the countries in the European Union. So, for example, the election coming up in the U.K. within a month, which looks like the labor government, the Labour Party may regain government. It's going to be crucial that they actually govern on climate change, that they use these years up until 2030 to make a difference. Because as you were saying, we could be seeing rollbacks in the United States. In fact, we would be if Donald Trump becomes president. And so, countries around the world really need to be electing climate leaders and having them deliver. Because 2030 is just really one election cycle away.

And so, these court cases are really starting to change the dialogue. There's also laws beginning to be passed, like in Vermont, really just in the last couple weeks, that say that the fossil fuel companies who lied about climate change, they will be responsible for paying for some of the damages that they caused.

And in that respect, African-Americans are just like their white counterparts or their Asian counterparts or their Latino counterparts, they deeply care about the economy. They care about social mobility. They care about their communities. And for many of these people, they have seen that, you know, the policies that either the Biden administration has touted, or in some cases that the Trump administration has touted, that none of those have actually affected them their lived experience. So, when you see African-Americans and we when we interview African- Americans or pull them on across a wide field of data, we tend to see overwhelmingly that they are deeply unhappy with their position and their lived experience within the United States.",

You know, one of the things that we see is the number thatpeople give in these kinds of polling data tends to be offset by at the end of the day. And when people go into the ballot box, they either vote for the Democratic candidate or they don't vote at all, right. So, it manifests itself as a non-vote at the top of the ticket. But I also want to remind people that anything within the range of 18 -- roughly 18 percent is actually within the norm of the last 50 some odd years. We tend not to see it as the norm because of the Obama era. At the Obama era, those numbers are just Astronomical because of the overwhelming level of black support for the first black president. But what we see starting in 2016 really is a return to the average. So, I like to say that when we see these Trump numbers, whether they were in 2016, 2020, or 2024, we are seeing a return to home, that essentially black people who vote for the Republican Party are coming home. The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is that when black people perceive very little difference between the two major political parties, really one of three things happens. Either they vote for a third-party candidate, they don't vote altogether, or in very small numbers, within the mean of what we're seeing with the GenForward, I think, polling data, they will vote for and support Republicans. So, I think that tells us something about how black voters perceive the Democratic Party, or at least 17 to 20 percent. We also know that younger black voters are increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party. Many of them have indicated that they view President Biden and his administration -- whether rightly or wrongly, they view that administration as either indifferent or outwardly hostile to issues of civil rights.",

And yes, that may be true, but it's also true that there is a slow trickle of black voters who are expressing dissatisfaction and also articulating a kind of argument about the failures of the Democratic Party. And so, part of what I would put forward is that we're not necessarily seeing a robust effort on the part of Republicans. They're not winning black voters over because of their policies or procedures or programs, but instead, because of the failures of the Democratic Party to connect organically and authentically to a very, I think, tense section, cross-section of black voters. And in that case, one of the things that we know is that there is a way in which the Democratic Party has completely missed an opportunity to really get down organically and understand the needs, the desires, and the frustrations of black voters in many ways.",

And, you know, in 2020, President Biden said, I will point a black woman to the Supreme Court, and he did it and it was one of the most powerful things that he could do, even though the naming of a black woman and saying, I want to put a black woman on the Supreme Court is something that may have alienated, you know, extensively racist people that maybe the Democrats needed to win.

One of the things that the Trump administration did very well is that they spoke explicitly to their core base, the people that they needed to win. And a lot of people, I think, were taken aback by that. But actually, if you look at it on the grand scheme of things, it was incredibly important strategy. You need people enthusiastic around these things, but you also need policy wins, very big policy wins. And so, I think, for many audiences, you know, you can point and say, well, I'm being gridlocked, and all those things are true. I'm being blocked out of Congress. It's not possible to do these things. But that's not what audiences see. They see themselves being left behind.",

But something else that we've seen really just explode over thelast eight years is that there is a concerted cyber effort, international cyber effort that is explicitly aimed at black voters and black people more generally. It pops up across this various kind of technological platforms, including Instagram, Facebook Twitter, now known as X, TikTok. One of the things that's remarkable about these, I think, concerted efforts is that they are built on kernels of truth and frustration that African- Americans and black voters have with the Democratic Party. And then, of course, what happens is that these things are blown up into misinformation, into people in digital blackface, right? These kinds of conversations that take on a life of their own. And then, the other thing that we know is that it is very hard, if not impossible, to track how these things are showing up.",

So, if you know that, for example, black men feel very strongly about the criminal justice system and about the disproportionate way in which the American criminal justice system has treated black people and, you know, that there's some way in which Joe Biden, President Joe Biden was involved in the passage of, say, the crime bill in the 1990s or things of that nature, it is very easy to take that and to blow it up into something entirely different.",

One of the things that we see over and over with black audiences is that there is a particular kind ofcandidate, black candidate, that has enormous amount of appeal. Think Barack Obama, right? They have to be authentically and organically connected to black communities. They have to -- seem invested in essentially the uplift or the betterment of black communities. Neither one. And I would particularly point to the congressman's remarks the other day where he romanticized Jim Crow. I would point to the fact that both of them have white spouses, that matters to black voters. And one of the things that we know from studies about black Republicans and black audiences is that black audiences actually treat black Republicans more harshly than they do white Republicans that have the hold the exact same views. Why? Because they view those black Republicans as traitors, as betraying the best interests of the black communities. Now, where it matters though is for white audiences, particularly white audiences that are deeply uncomfortable with Donald Trump's brand of bigotry, xenophobia, and racism. Tim Scott is a reassurance. He says, well, if Tim Scott supports Donald Trump, then he can't be that bad, correct? It provides a kind of shield for accusations of racism, of bigotry, and xenophobia. And I do actually think, politically, from a political calculation point of view, that's very important.",

But I want to remind people that the Democratic Party actually has a much harder battle right now than the Republican Partyin terms of its relationship to black voters. So, one of the things that they really need to pay attention to and really invest money into are these organic listening conversations. Sit down with black voters and say, tell us what you want, and then listen rather than lecture. It's the same advice that I gave in my book to Republicans. If you're actually serious about winning over black voters, sit down and listen. Don't start six months before an election. And I think it's a tall charge, but it's not too late. And certainly, if the Democratic Party is willing to invest money and time and effort, they can win back those voters who seem disaffected and disenchanted with their relationship with the Democratic Party. It is absolutely not too late.",
