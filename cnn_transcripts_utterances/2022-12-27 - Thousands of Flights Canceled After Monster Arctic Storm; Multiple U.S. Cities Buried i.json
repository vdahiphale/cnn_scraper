Now also the two main airports in and around Seoul, Gimpo and Incheon stopped all takeoffs for about an hour on the military's command as this was all unfolding. So, there is concern here in South Korea. It's not unprecedented but it is certainly unusual. It was 2017 the last time that this happened or the last time it is known to have happened. That's when they discovered a crashed North Korean drone which appeared to have been filming and taking photos of a U.S. built missile defense system in the country. A similar situation in 2014 when they found a crashed drone. Those were fairly basic drones. They were a fairly crude sort of camera taped on to a drone. We're waiting to hear how much more sophisticated they may be now. We understand from the military they're less than two meters long.
