Like, what's really remarkable to how stable the race has been for the 6-7-8-9 months, even over the Summer.Like think back to the Summer that we just came out of. Two Vice Presidents picked, two conventions happened, one of their leading -- one of the nominees was indicted more than a dozen times, was convicted of a felony, the other nominee dropped out of the race and was replaced. There was an assassination attempt and after all of that, we're still at a 50-50 results. I'll give you a scoop for \"Axios\", saying I'm coming out in your inbox and next hour, it's toss-up America, like really digging into the numbers behind this, that we are still a very evenly-split nation, Donald Trump has a base of 45 percent of people who will never move from him. He has a ceiling, maybe of 47 percent, that's right there in that margin of error. And so, what can really move the needle on, can kind of give someone a lead of that.

She has been rolling out more and more policy proposals. I think there's a policy -- policy page up on the website. Now, finally, so, we're getting a sense of what her administration might look like. And I think you've seen the way she talks about moving away from Biden, some of the proposals that -- like a little bit of an evolution to be nice about it, a flip-flop, another way to say it from her prior campaign. And I think it's a way to just show how she's a little bit different than Donald Trump. I think there's also a key thing here, and I think we saw that just in Donald Trump's -- the way he was talking at his rally. A tone and a context changed that is very different from her. And I think that's what the campaign is hoping, is that they can get him kind of rattled, act like more traditional Donald Trump, what his aides do not want him to be, which is like contrast on the policy, that's a good night for Donald Trump.

Remember, we've seen some of President -- former President Trump'sevents, the one in New York last night, answers can be kind of rambling. Remember the last debate was a lot about who has the mental fitness, who is the younger, more spry candidate? Well, they were both pretty old and so, Joe Biden lost that race, well, now Kamala Harris is 20 years younger than Donald Trump.

It will be given later this morning if not into this afternoon because the storm is going to consolidate and become more organized as time goes on. So, we still have these tropical storm watches that include parts of the extreme southern Texas coastline, including Brownsville. But let's go forward in time because you can see a strengthening tropical storm making its way into a Category One hurricane before making landfall late Wednesday evening into early Thursday morning, somewhere near the border of   Texas and Louisiana. This storm has a lot of warm water to deal with, and so, that's going to allow it to strengthen along with some other environmental conditions that will consolidate the storm into a tropical storm or low-end hurricane by the time it reaches the United States mainland. Now, one things is for sure, aside from the wind and the storm surge threat, there will be significant rainfall that could lead to flash flooding, especially across Louisiana, where 4 to 8 inches of rain is possible. Check out this magnificent photo coming out of California. Not great for the residents here, of course, this is a lightning strike attempting to start new wildfires. There are several wildfires across California and the West. Look at the Davis Fire, here's the Line Fire in southern California, a 0 percent containment with over 20,000 acres burned. There's quite a significant wind event with the system as well. So, that could fuel more additional flames and wildfires is 70 active wildfires burn over the western U.S., Kasie?",
