After she learned about it, after nearly half a million gallons of it was already in Harris County and said that she first learned about this process while watching the news. So you can imagine the frustration for her there. Texas Molecular, which is a company that's been hired to dispose of this potentially dangerous water, saying that it already has over four decades managing water safely. So hopefully that reassuring some Texas residents. But then there's also the contaminated soil, some 4,800 cubic yards of it that the state of Ohio said would have to be removed and were on their way to a waste disposal facility in Wayne County, Michigan. However, elected officials raising concerns there, too, saying that they also did not get any word from Norfolk Southern. As a result, on Saturday, the EPA temporarily halted these shipments so they can further review the disposal plan that's currently in place. Officials in both states saying that they have no reason to believe or suspect that the water and the soil are not being disposed of safely. They merely want to be informed in a case where information has been very hard to come by, especially during the initial stages. The EPA certainly recognizing that this material has to be disposed of somewhere, so long as it's safely transported. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Mary, first of all, you know, as we know the cleanup efforts are underway, testing continues when it comes to the air and the soil and the water.

I mean, why not just let them know, hey, heads up, we're sending it over to you the dispose of? SCHIAVOAnd I certainly don't blame anyone for being outraged. But this was, you know, this is not a new process where they have taken materials. I mean, the states of Michigan, I know, the states of Ohio and other states in the Midwest, have been the recipients and sometimes they didn't want it either. But have been the recipients of materials for years or decades into facilities. And again, the federal law has said, oh, it's OK to transport these through.

And in a situation like this in a terrible accident like this, you have so many different government agencies that at some point, they, you know, are running into each other, running over each other and clash.So, for example, the National Transportation Safety Board has absolute control over the investigation and, in fact, the parties to the investigation, the railroad, the rail car manufacturer, for example, the companies that made the equipment for the hotbox, the overheated axle detectors, they will all be part of the investigation. They are not allowed to release information from the investigation without the express permission of the National Transportation Safety Board. That's the NTSB use rules. So then when the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and remember, they are both federal and state EPAs come in to start their work, I mean, it's an entirely different federal agency. And yes, they're supposed to coordinate, but they don't control the investigation. So when they start the cleanup and they start moving things out, that isn't necessarily part of the NTSB investigation at all. They're busy working on what happened and what to do so it doesn't happen again. So coordination would certainly be an order and yes, the people that have to live around this terrible disaster do need all the information that they can get besides. And we have to remember one more thing as somebody who grew up in Ohio, a lot of people have their own labs.

Areas highlighted in red were a little more vulnerable for that severe weather threat. It's a significant damaging wind threat. We're talking about winds over 75 miles per hour and then isolated to a few strong tornadoes, long lift, EF 2 or stronger with this as it continues to build late afternoon and into the evening. Hashed areas show you where we have the greatest risk for strong damaging winds and again, that area highlighted in red, where we're not only concerned for tornadoes, such a greatest risk. But where we are at greater risk for damaging winds of over 75 miles per hour. This system redeveloping as we move into the evening, 6:00, local time in the Central Plains moving into Missouri as we get into late Sunday and early Monday morning. Then scattered rain showers as we get through the Ohio Valley in the upcoming 24 hours. Boris, Amara?",

The Anti-Defamation League found that for every decade, between the 1970s and 2000s, there were between two and seven mass killings tied to extremists. But as you can see on your screen, by the 2010s that number jumped spiking to more than 20.Gun violence, generally, has also trended upward in recent years. So far in 2023, the Gun Violence Archives says that there have been at least 88 mass shootings in the United States. Killing more than 100 people, with hundreds more injured. We want to discuss the ADL's findings with Oren Segal but it appears that we're having some technical difficulties so we're going to give it another second. Do we have him?

I wanted to bring back up the chart that we previously shown our viewers that shows that the last decade, the number of mass killings because of extremism has spiked more than 20 in the 2010s. Oren, in your view, what's causing that rise? OREN SEGAL, VICE PRESIDENT, ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE CENTER ON EXTREMISM:  Yes, the numbers are stark and alarming. And I think one of the things that we are noticing is that extremists of all kinds are feeling emboldened. You know, the narratives and tropes that are the lifeblood of extremist groups, that may be used to be fringe, you know, happening on platforms that not many people would access or in conversations that a limited people would coalesce around are now, frankly, part of our public discussion.

Here are people that engaged with hateful either antisemitic, racist, anti-LBGTQ, type of rhetoric online.Literally, either built manifestos or websites in order to promote these ideas. And in that process, we are not only getting more radical themselves, but signaling back to the wider community.
