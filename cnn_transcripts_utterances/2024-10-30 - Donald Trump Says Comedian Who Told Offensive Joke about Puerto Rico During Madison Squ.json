But we find on scams like this that this is for people of all ages. This whole idea that only old people fall for this, you have people in their 30s, in their 20s who were really excited about the campaign who are falling for these things. And the FBI wants you to report them, because that's how they track where the fakes, where the real ones to that www.IC3.com (ph), the Internet crime complaint center.But in the event that some elderly people might have trouble filling out that form, the Department of Justice does have for 60 and up the elder care hotline where they can actually walk you through that and help you do it.",

And I think that was her mission last night. Obviously, the setting of the Ellipse draws the immediate contrast to Trump's speech there, which she did explicitly from January 6th, 2021.But then she took all the attention on this speech and used it to lay also lay out her affirmative vision, lay out her plans to bring down prices, exactly what she would do on the economy, and other areas of concerns to voters. So it wasn't just a speech about the theory of democracy or how to protect it. She ticked through abortion rights. She ticked through even immigration at one point. But what she kept coming back to in each part of the speech was trying to invite Americans to envision either her sitting in the Oval Office or Donald Trump and what that means for them. And that's what she hopes for the next six days that voters consider in their minds.",

There's no reason to insult a country, a nation, a nation that has served this country for many, many years. In all wars in this country Puerto Ricans have served, and they shed their blood to defend the liberty and freedom of this country.

We are very strong in who we are as a Puerto Rican, as a Cainos (ph), as a black people, we are mixed, a mix of different culture. And we represent those people. We represent 9 million Puerto Rican on the island and stateside. And we said no to that. And if you dear to insult our great country, our sons, our daughter, our military, and people that serve in your country, you don't deserve to be in the Oval Office because you insulting your own American citizens. That is unacceptable. And we are telling to our people get out and vote. Tell them, tell this bad joke and heinous joke and racist jokes for a president for a campaign, that is unacceptable. And November 5th, I asked my people, my Puerto Rican people in the whole diaspora, that get out and vote. Don't stay or home. It's not an option. You have to get out and vote because they're insulting our history. They're insulting our heritage. They're insulting who we are. And that's not acceptable for any country, for anyone.",

But taking this a step further, we are told by two western intelligence officials that some small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine. This is deeply concerning for the South Koreans and so they have been making the rounds really briefing NATO, as well as of course today, they will be at the Pentagon to discuss the deployment of these North Korean troops and what their intention actually is. We are told that these North Korean troops are special operations troops that the North Koreans are sending specifically to get combat experience because of course, North Korea has not actually fought in a war in over 70 years. And so, it remains to be seen, of course, just how effective these North Korean troops are going to be on the battlefield. There is, of course, a language barrier and we are told that officials expect there to be some defections in some North Korean troops to actually desert their post once they are in Russia and Ukraine. But still, you know, the North Koreans we are told are very confident about these troops' ability to perform well because they are specialized, they are highly trained and importantly, they are expected to augment the Russian forces there who are fighting against the Ukrainians. So, deeply concerning for the South Koreans. And we do expect South Korean's defense leader to speak out with Lloyd Austin today at the Pentagon in a press conference about all of this.",
