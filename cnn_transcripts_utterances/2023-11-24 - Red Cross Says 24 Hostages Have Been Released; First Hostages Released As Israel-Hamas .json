They were moved from inside Gaza over the Rafah crossing into Egypt. A short time ago, we got our first look at some of these hostages. We have video. It includes pictures you're looking at right there, of a little girl in a yellow shirt, one of the 13 Israeli hostages released.We have other video to show you as well, different vantage points, where you can see some of the people including, again, that girl who was released and then a number of people boarding a bus from a facility -- a holding facility inside Rafa. A number of these people now on a bus on the move, presumably back into Israel. This is the first part of this pause in fighting agreed to by Israel by Hamas to allow for the release of some 50 hostages over the next several days in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners and a pause in the fighting. And breaking just moments ago, the identity of two of the Israeli hostages that have been released their names Margalit Mozes who was either 77 or 78. She may have had a birthday in captivity and Adina Moshe, 72-years-old, so to women 72 and 77 or 78. Among those who have been released, we are following the movements of these hostages as they experienced freedom for the first time in 48 days. Let's get to Kaitlan Collins who was in Tel Aviv with the very latest, Kaitlan.",

They say that they are with IDF Special Forces an international Israel Security Agency Special Forces.They say that they underwent an initial medical assessment inside Israeli territory and that they will continue to be accompanied by those IDF soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals to be reunited with their families. And for more on the status of those hostages, I want to bring in Eylon Levy a Spokesperson for the Israeli Government. Thank you for joining me sir.

But let's remember these people, these women and these children were brutally abducted on October 7th, by the terrorists who burned, beheaded, mutilated, tortured, and raped these people's relatives and neighbors in those Kibbutzim in Southern Israel.And since then, they have been held in the dark, and their families have been kept in the dark, though we're not given any access to the Red Cross, we have no information about their condition, no information about who was alive and who might be dead. So it's important that they get that medical attention. We will of course, be looking for signs of how they may have been abused by Hamas, while they were in captivity, and hope to begin a process of rehabilitation. You know, there are little children. We don't know. They saw sunlight in the last 50 days. Were they fed properly if they come out malnourished? You know, I don't want to speculate about how awfully they may have been treated. But we're all very anxious to make sure that they are safe and begin a long process of physical and psychological rehabilitation. Let's remember, while many of them have lost family who were murdered on October 7th, and they still have family in the Gaza Strip as hostages of Hamas.",

Is it OK if I hold you? Is it OK if I carry you because they have been into the bowels of hell, and back in the last 50 days, and hopefully, hopefully, we'll be able to get them the care they need and give them the first hugs of whole and safe family inside Israel?

Eventually we will return. This war has to end with the end of Hamas. We will not leave in power, the terror organization the sick monsters that abducted these children in the first place.

Emilia Aloni, six years old and her mother Daniel Aloni, who was 45. We have now confirmed that they had been released to go along with the Adina Moshe and Margalit Mozes, I will say I spoke to Adina Moshe's granddaughter Tuesday night, so a couple days ago. And Adina Moshe's granddaughter, they had no idea whether the grandmother would be among those released or not. They had just received word of the deal that was brokered. She was hopeful, but said they would not believe anything until they saw it. Now they've seen it. Now they have their grandmother out. Again, these were the pictures moments ago at the Rafah border crossing as they moved out of Gaza into Egypt. All the hostages we are now told are back in Israel itself.

And we are seeing multiple vehicles heading in the direction past near where these helicopters are near our position. We don't know yet whether or not anybody will be brought into the helicopters? Our understanding is that if somebody needs urgent medical attention, then they would be Medivac via helicopter. We don't know whether that is the case. That is why it appears that these helicopters are on standby and we are seeing them now at least the first two vehicles with flashing lights just went past the turn off where they would need to turn in order to get to these helicopters. Several more vehicles are following behind. They are dipping behind the wall here. One of the helicopters is actually beginning to take off already. You can see that. I think you can see in our shot the helicopter is taking off. [12:15:00] And several of those vehicles just went past along that road. I don't -- I can't see from my position, what types of vehicles they are. But clearly this was a significant movement of vehicles away from the Kerem Shalom crossing with flashing lights moving in the direction that they would go if indeed, that was the convoy with those recently freed hostages inside.",

This is Karim Shalom, where Jeremy is right here not far from Rafah. And this is where we believe they are headed to the Hatzerim Airbase right there.

Hard to imagine what they may have endured inside Gaza while they were in Hamas captivity, but now at least they are firmly on Israeli soil.

They are now on their way to Israeli hospitals. They are being accompanied by Israeli Special Forces and it is once they arrive at those Israeli hospitals that they will be reunited with their families. At least 12 of the 13 hostages who are free today came from Kibbutz near Oz, of course, that was one of the scenes of complete slaughter on that day. A quarter of the residents there were either kidnapped or killed that day and at least 12 of them have now been released. We've gotten confirmation from a spokesperson for the Kibbutz. Those ages of what we are seeing who we are seeing come across range from 2.5 years old to 80 years old. The 2.5 year old has now been returned along with her sister and also their 34 year old mother also being held hostage. This is huge welcome news for all of these families really for everyone here in Israel as they are watching all of this incredibly closely. But it is 13 out of the 50 expected in this deal has been brokered between Israel and Hamas. Of course there are still 215 according to the Israeli Government, hostages still being held in Gaza.
