And oftentimes, if not all the time, you know, they're not swayed by political aspects of it. There are jurisdictions where that's been a problem for sure. The biggest problem with challenging this in court based on what the administration might do come January 20th is the length of time that it takes.If someone is prosecuted or sued, I mean, Trump threatened to sue me for treason, it doesn't exist, but he did it. But you know, if something like that happens, it takes time to go through federal court. We just saw that with the special counsel prosecutions. The reason why they failed was not substantively, it was procedurally. They took too long. So, that -- you know, I'd hate for any of my clients to be facing whether criminal or civil prosecutions in certain way and they are victimized for that for two, three years.

Trump never invited Biden to the White House or even conceded the race to Biden during that time. But as the two men are preparing to meet, they are former competitors and now will be sitting down to talk about some of the most pressing domestic and foreign policy issues at hand. One area where Biden is really hoping to exert some influence in the coming weeks of his presidency is trying to explain to the Trump transition why he believes it's important that aid for Ukraine continue beyond the Biden presidency. Biden has charged his team with deploying as much approved money and weaponry to Ukraine before leaving office, and it comes at a time when Trump has really cast doubt about what future U.S. support for Ukraine will look like. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan yesterday said that the president in his arguments plans to argue that not furthering aid for Ukraine would -- could lead to instability, not just in Europe, but also for Asian allies as well. So, this is one of the major topics that could come up in this meeting tomorrow. Of course, Biden is now facing this new reality that the man that he had beat in 2020, who he has painted as a direct threat to democracy, will now be returning to the White House in January, and they will go through this transition of having that meeting in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",

      "sentences": "All right. Joining me now are our political commentators Scott Jennings and Karen Finney. Thank you both for being here. Let's talk a little bit about the jockeying for position in the Trump administration. Trump made very clear with this tweet that he expects those that want to be the Senate majority leader to -- and here's what he said, any Republican Senator seeking the coveted leadership position in the United States Senate must agree to recess appointments in the Senate, without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.Scott, judging from the response of Senators Thune, Scott, and Cornyn all vying for this job, how do you see this shaken out? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR AND FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:  Well, look, they want to make Donald Trump happy and they wanted Donald Trump to get what he deserves here, which is a chance to build his administration and staff it with people who are going to execute on his agenda. So, I'm not surprised to see them coming out to support Trump's viewpoint on this. Although, I would say in the early going with 53 senators, I would suspect Trump will have no trouble, hopefully, getting most people confirmed right out of the gate. And obviously, the most important positions, the cabinet level positions, you know, they'll be sent up and they do need to be confirmed quickly so Trump can get about the business of executing on his agenda. So, I think what he wants is ultimately just the best possible working relationship with the Republicans in the Senate. Because, you know, people are policy, and getting your people in means you can execute, and when you don't have them in, it slows things down.",

Of course, any president wants that, but it's about, A, getting what you want. And by that, I mean, B, making sure that you are setting from the beginning a relationship where Congress understands he -- what Trump wants, Trump expects to get, and he expects total loyalty. He's made that very clear throughout the campaign that he will expect loyalty from all the people that he puts in the administration.And frankly, the way he's moving to consolidate power makes it clear, he expects full loyalty also from the legislative branch, because, in some ways, he views that as basically an extension of his administration. The thing that would concern me is that these recess appointments may mean that we don't have the regular scrutiny of who these people are, or even just the basic background information to know the level of qualifications about some of these individuals he may try to put in place because, again, he has said the number one qualification is loyalty, not necessarily competency in a given issue area. But you know what, the American people, those who turned out, decided they don't care. And so, America is about to get the government it voted for.",

And so, I don't think there's disagreement on that. And again, with regard to others, I think the questions -- and we'll have to see, frankly, how it unfolds, because we really weren't given details during the campaign. What we just heard from Mr. Homan, that's actually more detailed than we got largely during the campaign about how this would work.How do you determine who are the individuals that are going to be deported and will -- again, when we talk about separating families. So, if -- what we're saying then potentially is if a child is an American citizen, in order not to separate that family, you could be deporting an American citizen with a parent who may not be here legally. So, I think that's one of the questions. We'll have to see how that shakes out. And the second question is just the impact on the economy. We know that many of the people who are here illegally work in industries and corporations where they are paying Social Security taxes, where they are, you know, part of the labor force. And when you start to deport and remove that from the labor force, what does that mean in terms of costs, in terms of the ability to fill those jobs?

So, you have -- Americans say that they are carrying debt on their credit cards, 50 percent of Americans report that. And also, the U.S. right now has over a trillion dollars in credit card debt.
