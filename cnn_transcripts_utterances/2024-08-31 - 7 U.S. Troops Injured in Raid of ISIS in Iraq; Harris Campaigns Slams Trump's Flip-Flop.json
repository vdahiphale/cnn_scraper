I'm Alex Marquardt in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield.New details coming into CNN, seven U.S. troops are recovering after they were hurt in a raid that killed at least 14 members of the radical group ISIS. That raid happening Thursday in Iraq. And according to U.S. Central Command it targeted ISIS leaders in order to disrupt the group's ability to plan future attacks. And you're looking at brand new images of the cache of weapons and other items that were seized in that raid in the Anbar Desert in western Iraq. The Iraqi militia just releasing these pictures. CNN's chief international security correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is following these developments and has the latest from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Vice President Kamala Harris blasting her rival Donald Trump for saying that he will vote no on an amendment to Florida's abortion law. The amendment is on the ballot in Florida this November. And if enough voters in Florida vote no that would pave the way for a six-week abortion ban to stay in effect. The former president appearing to flip-flop on this highly divisive issue in recent days. Earlier this week he seemed to indicate that he planned to vote to overturn the Florida ban when he cast his ballot in November. Yesterday, he again reversed course. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I think six weeks, you need more time than six weeks. I've disagreed with that right from the early primaries when I heard about it. I disagreed with it. At the same time the Democrats are radical because the nine months is just a ridiculous situation where you can do an abortion in the ninth month. And, you know, some of the states like Minnesota and other states have it where you can actually execute the baby after birth. And all of that stuff is unacceptable. So I'll be voting no for that reason. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And reminding voters that he has previously boasted about the overturning Roe v. Wade because of the justices that he put on the Supreme Court.Now in a statement from the vice president herself yesterday, she said the following, quote, \"Donald Trump just made his position on abortion very clear. He will vote to uphold an abortion ban so extreme it applies before many women even know they're pregnant.\" She goes on to say that he is not done and concludes with the choice in this election is clear. Now of course, the campaign has seen abortion, reproductive rights as a galvanizing issue among voters. It's one that they feel that they have the momentum and they're going to launch a reproductive rights tour on Tuesday in Florida, where it's on the ballot and what the former president Donald Trump was replying to there on Tuesday. So they're going to have at least 50 stops. It's going to be mostly surrogates, elected officials and celebrities. But what it indicates to us is just how much they see it as an issue where they have the upper hand, one that they can bank on and one that is clearly resonating among voters simply by the fact that we're seeing the former president and as vice presidential nominee have to answer questions about this as well as infertility and IVF. Now, the vice president had been put as the voice of this issue earlier in the year when it was the then-Biden campaign. She had her own reproductive rights tour at the start of the year. It's one of those stops where she called them the Trump abortion bans when referring to restrictions across the country. So clearly now at being the Harris campaign, it is an issue that they are going to consistently put front and center and often also frame as freedoms and protecting freedom. So it's not only the issue, but also them taking sort of a broadening out of that and putting it under this umbrella of multiple freedoms that are at risk if former president Donald Trump were to take a second term.",

That was how the rules were for the CNN debate. That was the expectation for the ABC debate.Now, ABC says that they're going to use similar rules, but the quibbling behind the scenes is whether or not they change the one rule about the microphones. Now, the former president said this week that he doesn't care either way, but behind the scenes, that is not what is happening between the Trump campaign officials and the Harris campaign officials. And the vice president has been needling Trump on this, even taking to Twitter or now X earlier today, saying that let's debate in a transparent way with the microphones on the whole time. So this has not been resolved yet. There are still ongoing discussions. That's what I'm being told. But certainly it's clear that each campaign here is trying to strategize to put their candidate in the best position. And the Harris campaign sees it as a winning position for them if they were to have the microphone.",

The fact is that they will make a difference. They will have an impact.The idea that the Ukrainians will be able to employ them against airfields housing these bombers that are launching these glide bombs from 60, 70 kilometers way to devastating effect, including the strike that they had on Kharkiv. It would force the Russians to draw those aircraft further back degrading the amount of time that they're actually flying in support of a Russian military operations. The ability to use F-16s with long-range weapons inside Russia will force those bombers even further back or potentially neutralize Russia's capability to strike out with this weapon that really the Ukrainians don't have an answer to right now. So I think it's a bunch of, frankly, I'm just going to say it's a bunch of nonsense. These weapons would make a difference. We should lift this restriction. We should not enforce a no-fly zone over Russia. The Biden administration in its waning days, you know, months left in term, should make a bold decision, but a correct decision to support Ukraine properly without restrictions, without, you know, this idea that somehow we'll be able to get back something to sort of normal with Russia and without this idea of a risk of escalation.

This was really important for Clemson to kind of get off on the right foot, but they cannot fail to do so. Cade Klubnik not looking as comfortable as maybe he should, and Garrett Riley is here, too. So Clemson -- or excuse me, Georgia meanwhile looks like they'repicking off right where they left off. They're favored to not only win the SEC, but to win a national title. So, you know, we'll see what happens for Clemson. They're not out of anything yet. Obviously with the 12-team playoff, but not the best showing when you have so much pressure on you for Dabo Sweeney and a critical season for the Tigers. Elsewhere across the country, Penn State is currently leading West Virginia, 20-6. They're actually in a lightning delay right now, have been since halftime. Drew Allar looks really, really great, 199 yards, three touchdowns already. Elsewhere happening across the country, Florida in Miami kicking off right now in Gainesville. That is a huge matchup, kind of a non- conference tune-up game for both of these schools, but critical for both of these third year head coaches, Billy Napier and Mario Crystal Ball. Billy Napier and the Gators haven't cracked 500 yet in his two seasons. Miami meanwhile haven't really done much in the ACC, but they come in with a lot of talent. It's led by Cam Ward, their transfer quarterback from Washington State. Interesting to see how this game will happen, will play out because Florida is a really tough place to play. Miami has a lot of talent surrounding them and hype. They're in the mix to win the ACC this year. But I do think for Florida, it'll hurt them down the line to lose this game because I think for Florida to keep Billy Napier in Gainesville, Florida will have to make a bowl this year and they have one of the toughest schedules in all of the country so I think if you lose this game, start 0-1 at home.",
