      "sentences": "Thanks for joining CNN on this Monday. I'm Erica Hill in New York.Israel rocked by its largest protest since the start of the war with Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing growing pressure to resign and to hold new elections. We are live in Jerusalem. Plus, a tale of two Easters on the tails of two very different holiday messages. President Biden taking part in the annual Egg Roll at the White House today. Well, Donald Trump takes to the campaign trail and goes on the attack. And fast food workers in the state of California will now see the highest state minimum wage in the United States starting today. Elections now, that's just one of the demands on the streets of Jerusalem in the biggest protest since the Israel-Hamas war began. Protesters calling on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, angry over what they consider to be his failures to both protect the country on October 7 and to secure the release of all hostages still being held in Gaza. Some demonstrators have set up tents outside the Knesset, vowing to stay there for at least several days. The challenge to Mr. Netanyahu's leadership comes as he underwent surgery to treat a hernia, which doctors say was successful. Let's bring in now Melissa Bell, who joins us live from Jerusalem with more. Pretty substantial protests, Melissa.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Erica. In fact, what we saw yesterday was thousands of people out in the streets of Jerusalem. It's the first time really that we've seen that protest movement returned to the streets. The cities you can see behind me, they've now set up tents. Their plan, Erica, is to stay here until Wednesday. And I think what's interesting about this crowd and the one that we saw around us in Jerusalem last night is that you have those people that are on the street to say, look, there is still more than 130 hostages in the hands of Hamas. The way this war has been prosecuted has been a failure. The government spent too much time going after prosecuting its war, not enough time trying to get the hostages back or finding other ways to negotiate.There are those who are out in the street before this all began, before that incredible unity was achieved here in Israel after the October 7 attacks, who were opposed to Benjamin Netanyahu before, and those who are unhappy about what has happened to the many tens of thousands of Israelis still not able to return home because of the tension along the border with Lebanon. So, a lot of different people that have come out to make their displeasure known. But, what unites them is their anti-Netanyahu focus, with that sharp call for elections to be held now, and again, the determination that they will stay out here to continue putting pressure on the government until the Knesset goes off for its spring recess. I think what's interesting about the pressure that's mounting on Benjamin Netanyahu is that it comes from the left, those who are concerned about the fate of the hostages and the way this war has been prosecuted. It comes from the right because of changes that are being made right now to the law and that could force for the ultra-Orthodox, the Haredi, to enlist in the army. It comes from the outside, as we've seen those devastating pictures emerging from the Al-Shifa Hospital complex again today. A lot of pressure building up very suddenly on Benjamin Netanyahu, and again, protesters who say that they won't stop until they've been heard, Erica.",

Thank you.We just heard it, Melissa, of course, mentioned what had been happening at the Al-Shifa Hospital Complex. Israeli forces have now withdrawn from that hospital in Gaza following a two-week siege, leaving behind charred buildings and bodies in the streets. Of course, this used to be Gaza's largest and most advanced hospital. Civil Defense officials say at least 300 bodies have been found at the complex so far. Israel says Hamas and Islamic Jihad had been using Al- Shifa as a base and conducted a precise operation to eliminate them.

      "sentences": "Well, earlier this morning, there were scenes of utter destruction around the Al-Shifa Medical Complex. It has been difficult over the last two weeks to get an accurate picture of the situation on the ground, given the communications difficulties. But, we have been hearing from the Civil Defense in Gaza and we have been seeing videos from our teams on the ground emerging, as civilians are finally able to return to the area surrounding the complex. And we have heard those reports, buildings around the complex, completely destroyed, some of them burnt, others still flame earlier this morning, a blaze earlier this morning.And of course, the civilian death toll here is staggering and shocking to say the least. Gaza's Civil Defense says they have so far recovered 300 bodies. They expect that figure to go up throughout the day. Of course, CNN isn't able to independently verify these figures. We don't have independent access to Gaza, of course. But, this is a troubling development and what has been two weeks of horror for civilians who have been trapped in and around the Al-Shifa Hospital over the course of this siege. Now, we know, of course, that the Israeli military has described this as a precise and targeted operation, they say focused on Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants who they believe were operating in and around the hospital complex. They have said that they found weapons and intelligence documents, and they believe that Hamas had been using this medical complex as a base. But, of course, as we know, there were also hundreds of civilians who had been trapped inside the hospital, some of them patients, and also, of course, medical staff as well. And over the course of the last few weeks, we have been hearing from medical staff who have reported really troubling accounts of what they have been forced to endure. They have, of course, faced drastic shortages in food, in water, in medical supplies. They have been unable to treat patients in the hospital. They've been unable to provide care for those injured outside of the hospital. Many told us they were unable to move between the complex's buildings of fear of being targeted by snipers. And of course, many in the surrounding area, living in residential buildings in this neighborhood, have also been impacted by this siege. It has been near constant shelling, gunfire and air strikes and drone strikes around this neighborhood. So, this has been two weeks of absolute horror for the Palestinian civilians living in and around the complex, those sheltering in the complex. And of course, important to remember that there have been many who were able to flee the hospital and we have heard testimonies from them as well, some teenagers as well, saying that they had been stripped and interrogated by Israeli soldiers before being able to flee and move southwards. But, of course, there is fear around what could take place in the south. As Melissa just mentioned, real concern, of course, around the situation looming in Rafah.",

We just heard a little bit of what was going on over the last couple of days from Arlette. Joining me to discuss, CNN Political Contributor and Republican Strategist, Alice Stewart, and Democratic Strategist, Maria Cardona, who is also a CNN Political Contributor. Nice to see both of you this morning. So, let's pick up if we could where Arlette left off. There was all this concern about how the eggs should be decorated. Alice, it was very clear that this is the exact same guidance that's been in place for 45 years. It was also in place under Donald Trump. Is this just grasping its straws now in this whole world of outrage politics? ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, it's funny you say about outrage politics. If there was ever a time to put your outrage at the door and put that to the side, Easter weekend is probably a good time for that, I think, Erica. And look, if you're going to criticize the administration for something such as religious symbols on eggs, make sure that you get your facts straight. And it's important to note that many people of faith have concerns about this. But, it wasn't the Biden administration's decision. This was the Egg Board. So, I think that's important to keep in mind. And overall, I just think it would be nice for Christians, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, Catholics, Republicans or Democrats, to focus on Easter weekend for what it is, the resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and making sure that that's the focus, and political outrage can wait until the days and weeks after Easter. HILL: Alice, I think that this is one point that you and Maria would likely agree on. And we did see that, I mean, we didn't see that from the White House, right, in the Easter message. MARIA CARDONA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, &amp; DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Yeah.",

And to Alice's point, if there is any point when Americans should be focused on unity, it's Easter weekend.But, I think what this also shows, Erica, is that there are some in the Republican base, especially the MAGA extremists, who are so desperate to look for division and chaos, that this is what they do, because they believe that's the only way that their leader Donald Trump is going to be able to win, and to inject this kind of division on a holiday like Easter, and I was so honored to be able to take my children to this Easter Egg roll during all eight years of the Obama presidency, and they decorated these same such as eggs, that it should be something that is good for everyone. Religious, non-religious, this is a day for Americans to come together in unity and in faith and in the focus of trying to figure out what works for all of us to find unified solutions. So, Democrats will continue to point out that if the only thing that Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans have to offer is this kind of hatred, this kind of division, this kind of violent rhetoric, and we have seen that Donald Trump is full of that, especially this weekend. That's not the kind of leadership that this country deserves.",

But, that support, as we have seen, has waned in recent years. And some of the latest polling suggests that Donald Trump is seeing pretty significant increase in his support among black and Latino communities. A number of voters who turned out for Barack Obama and then for Joe Biden telling CNN, they don't feel they've seen much change in their personal lives. That's something that Donald Trump has been able to speak to directly, really honing in on that disappointment, the apathy, the frustration. We know he has been able to use it to his advantage. Maria, I'm going to kick this one off with you, because I think that these are significant challenges for the Biden campaign.

If we can call up these numbers, if we're looking at some of the exit polling, right, so, this is just last month, if you look at Joe Biden, went from 80 percent support in 2020 to 55 percent now. Donald Trump really ticking up from 18 percent to 34 percent. Now, this is clearly not all right, just based on my quick math. Those are not all of the supporters moving from Biden, right, who left Joe Biden some 25 percent based on that exit polling over to Donald Trump. Yet, it's a significant move.However, and I know you and I have discussed this, Alice, there is some concern about the former President being able to broaden his message beyond these attacks and negativity, and really catering to his base. Are there enough people around him to make that happen? STEWART: I think he has got a very disciplined campaign operation this time as compared to years past, and it's why he won virtually every state so far in the primary, except for Vermont and the District of Columbia. And look, to my dear friend Maria's point, I think Democrats have more than a messaging problem when it comes to blacks and Hispanic voters. They have a perception problem. They don't feel as though the economy is good. They don't feel as though the border is secure. They don't feel as though we're on the right footing with regard to national security. And Erica, those numbers you showed in Michigan that President Biden dropping 25 points with African American voters, we're seeing similar numbers in all of the battleground states. And that is a -- should be a tremendous concern. When you see Biden dropping from 80 percent to 55 percent, and Trump increasing from 18 percent to 34 percent with voters of color, that simply goes to show one thing, and that is that African American voters, voters of color, do not feel the Biden administration is delivering for them. And there is a very well-known voice for the African American community, Charlamagne tha God. He speaks about this issue quite often. And he says, as an African American, he knows people -- voters of color don't feel as though the Democrats are delivering. They have been traditionally Democratic voters. They don't feel this administration has helped lift them out of their economic situation as much as they have promised. So, they are looking elsewhere. They're looking, who can improve my economic situation, and it does not appear to be Joe Biden. And quite frankly, Erica, a lot of them expressed concern, as they were angry that the administration comes after them when it's time to get them out to vote. But, once they're elected, they're nowhere to be seen in terms of improving their situation. And that's why we're seeing a lot of voter dissatisfaction with voters of color, with Joe Biden.",

But, I really just have to urge everyone who is involved in the political sphere, to not both sides this. Right? There is one candidate in this race who is focused on hateful rhetoric, who is focused on division, who is focused on tweeting out images of a President of the United States hogtied. That is not both candidates. That is Donald Trump.Joe Biden is the one who is trying to talk about unity in this country, who is the one who is trying to talk about putting forward policies that help all Americans, who, frankly, is the one who does have accomplishments on the books that have proven that he is helping all Americans, and that's why his messaging is focused on making sure that Americans know what he has been doing, the $35 Insulin cap, record job creation among black communities, among Latino communities, making sure that everyone can go to college and not have debt. These are things that matter generationally to so many communities of color in this country, but maybe they don't know about it. Right? And so, moving forward, this is exactly what the Biden administration is focused on, their record investments. And by the way, their record fundraising, Erica, shows you that not everyone feels that both candidates are the same. Right? Americans are putting their money into the candidate that they believe will give them a better life. And when Joe Biden is outracing Donald Trump two to one to three to one, that tells me volumes about where people really are than just this candidate coming out of Texas, calling himself literally anyone but the ones that are there now.

And the most important thing they can do is focus on results and not rhetoric, results that Donald Trump has done to help improve the economy, secure the border, and help with regard to foreign policy, and stay away from the divisive rhetoric.Look, President Biden is raising tremendous amounts of money, millions of dollars in fundraiser alone just last week. They're going to need every bit of that because they're trying to convince the American people that the economy is good. The border is secure. And national security is great. And that's not the case. That's not the way people feel.

It's really not clear, and it's not clear what type of ships, what vessels are actually going to be able to use it. They've described it as these commercially essential vessels really taking that first step toward reopening the Port of Baltimore, but we don't know how large of a ship that alternate channel can actually handle.And I spoke with the Joint Information Center, the command center here, just a little while ago, and they told me, in the short term, the only vessels that are going to be using that new channel are the ones that are actively participating in this salvage operation, trying to actually remove the bridge and all of that wreckage and debris from the river. So, it's not clear when the Port of Baltimore is going to be able to really reopen. And as you mentioned before, there are major economic implications, thousands of jobs here in Baltimore that are at stake, potentially millions of dollars in lost wages and business operations, and then the broader implications for the U.S. economy as a whole. So, Erica, we are waiting to find out more about that timeline. The governor expected to speak around 3 p.m. But again, as we have seen over and over, really these timelines are fluid and unclear because the work that they're doing is so delicate and sensitive. This wreckage of the scene has been described to me as essentially a rubber band that's been pulled really tight, a lot of that wreckage. And so, they're worried that if you cut it in the wrong place, the whole thing might snap and it could really hurt some of the crews that are working. [11:40:00] It's a delicate dance. And so, they're mapping all of -- every inch of it right now, surveying, trying to make sure they're cutting it into pieces in the right spot so they can do this safely and effectively.",

Now, this includes full names, dates of birth, mailing address, email address, passcodes, account numbers, and most alarmingly, Social Security numbers.

The company also says that you need to be vigilant, right, monitor your account activity, monitor credit reports. You can also set up fraud alerts for free. Some experts say that customers should consider freezing their credit with the credit bureaus because that can make it harder for someone to try to steal someone else's information.But, Erica, this is just another reminder of how hackers are constantly trying to break into major companies, and they only really have to get it right once, and when they do, the pain and the damages can really be very significant, both for the company and for customers.",

It also means this is the state which now has the highest minimum wage for fast food workers in the U.S. In anticipation of that change, many business owners have increased some of their prices, they say, to cover those extra costs. Others say they're going to use technology to reduce human labor hours, including things like self-serve kiosks and AI drive-thrus.For a closer look at what this does mean for those employees, business owners and consumers, CNN's Natasha Chen is live in Los Angeles this morning. So, it sounds great for the folks who are taking home the paycheck. But, we're already seeing some of the ripple effect. NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Erica. We know from certain franchise owners who have told me they already increased some of their menu prices across the board in the past few months, about four percent to seven percent, in anticipation of today, knowing they would have to pay their workers more. Now, this has been a long, hard-fought win for the workers, several years in the making. I've covered this for a couple of years now through several iterations. They were trying to create a fast food industry-specific council, which is in place now. But, this $20 minimum wage came along with that bill. And higher wages is something incredibly important to them. We're hearing from a worker who works at a McDonald's along with her mother. Her father is a construction worker. They've been living together in the same apartment since the 90s. And for her, she feels like this higher wage might be the chance they have to move to a place a little bit more comfortable, maybe sometimes afford a cup of coffee out, have a little bit of an easier time paying bills, because the cost of living is so intense here in California. Now, the minimum wage in California for the entire state as of January, $16 an hour, fast food workers now at $20 an hour, and this is just for business owners with a restaurant chain with more than 60 nationwide locations. So, if you're a mom and pop with one location, you don't have to do this. But, you do have to compete for those workers. Right? And we are also hearing from the franchise owners that this is going to be really intense for them. They've had a while to think about this. Some of them told me as, you were saying, that they might implement new technology and cut back labor hours. They might consider self-service kiosks or AI in the drive-thru. Another franchise owner who has 18 McDonald's locations in San Francisco, he told me this is -- he is not going to cut hours. He really believes in keeping the people that he has employed at the hours they are currently working. But, here is what he said about this change. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT RODRICK, OWNS 18 MCDONALD'S LOCATIONS: This is such extraordinary unprecedented territory that 15,000 businesses in California are about to embark on. I think that to understand where this -- what the repercussions are going to be, would really be a guess. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, this goes far beyond just wages. That council will also be able to increase this wage annually based on inflation going through 2029. Erica.",
