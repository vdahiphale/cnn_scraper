Half-a-dozen Republican hopefuls, including former President Trump, spoke at dueling political events this weekend, jabbing each other over government spending and cultural issues, as many in the GOP look for a way to bypass Donald Trump, even as polls show he is still the man to beat. We also saw President Biden preview his likely campaign message, urging Democrats at a party conference to focus on their successes over the last two years in the time of newly divided government, while his party faced urgent new questions about crime in traditionally Democratic big cities, as Democrats hope to flip the House and regain unified control in 2024. Here with me now is House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Thank you so much. It's great to see you here. House Democrats were in Baltimore this week, and you all were laying out a strategy for the next two years. I want you to listen to something that President Biden told your retreat this week.

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY):  Well, good morning. It's great to be with you. Listen, House Democrats are unified, President Biden was dignified, and our base is electrified, for three reasons. One, we have an incredible track record of support for getting big things done to make life better for everyday Americans. We have a vision for the future. We're going to continue to put people over politics, to fight for lower costs and better-paying jobs and safer communities, defend democracy, fight for reproductive freedom, and build an economy from the middle out and the ground up, as opposed to the top down, which is what Republicans have tried to do for decades.

It showed some pretty stark divisions in your Democratic Party, because President Biden unexpectedly -- unexpectedly, rather, announced that he's going to sign a Republican effort to override a new crime reform bill in Washington, D.C.; 173 House Democrats, including yourself, voted against that GOP bill. And, in large part, that was because you believe that the White House signaled that the president would oppose it. So, did President Biden pull the rug out from under you and your fellow House Democrats? JEFFRIES:  Not at all. We have a House, we have a Senate, and then we have the White House. In terms of my particular reasons for voting the way that I did, one, I believe that local government should have control over local matters. And that's a principle that I have supported from the moment that I arrived in Washington, D.C. It's one of the reasons why I believe in D.C. statehood.

What's your response? FMR. GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR):  Well, Larry Hogan is a star. He's governed well in Maryland, elected in a blue state. I think the fact that he indicates he's going to continue to fight in the Republican Party for alternatives to Donald Trump and a new direction is a good sign. He did say he wanted to avoid a multicar pileup. I got a kick out of that reference.

When I see Hogan or see DeSantis, or some of these other people in the low single digits, what I'm wondering is, are they going to be comfortable getting behind a DeSantis if he continues to be the principal alternative to Trump?
