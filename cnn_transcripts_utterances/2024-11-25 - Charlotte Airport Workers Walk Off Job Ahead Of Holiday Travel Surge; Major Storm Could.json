They clean airplane passenger cabins. They drive trash trucks on the ramp. They push wheelchairs through the terminal. Their main push is for higher wages, and the union says they make between about $12.50 and $19 per hour. I want you to listen now to ABM worker. Priscilla Hoyle.

It's been causing problems in San Francisco all day. This will likely be the bigger source of problems for delays as we go through the travel week. You can see that front, that first storm that we we're talking about, again mainly exits going into tomorrow should really be out of our hair by tomorrow evening. Meanwhile, that second storm right behind it really starts to come together tomorrow and starts to deepen and develop and could cause more headaches as we go into Thursday. Wednesday, we've got one exiting. That one not quite developed yet. But then, by Thursday, look at the swath of even some snow for interior New England and the rain that stretches down the east coast to the southeast. We're looking at a pretty soggy Thanksgiving for a lot of people. So you can see several inches of snow possible from Maine into interior New England. And then you've got at least an inch of rain possible from D.C. down to Atlanta, a lot of the southeast. And again, some snow up in the mountains and the Rockies there. So as far as these delays go, again, you've got one exiting on Tuesday. You start to have some problems in the Rockies going into Tuesday and Wednesday. And then we start to find this storm flourish and develop going into Thursday. I mean, some of these delays we could be looking at from the snow from Boston back towards Detroit on Thursday. And then down the east coast from D.C. to Atlanta with some of that rain by Thanksgiving evening. So again, pretty soggy along the upper -- along the eastern seaboard here with all of that rain. We have cold air that comes in behind this front. So it's going to be pretty chilly. Cold for Black Friday and the weekend behind this front. We'll have a punch of some of that wind coming with it too. So it does look soggy, unfortunately, for that Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade -- guys?",

Also, the president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Doctor, thank you so much for being with us. What do you make of these picks from President-Elect Trump for key public health positions? What's your reaction overall? DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, CDC &amp; PRESIDENT, ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION: Well, you know what gives me pause is having as a nominee for secretary of health and for the director of CDC, two individuals who have done a lot to undermine trust in vaccination in America. And I practiced general pediatrics for more than 30 years and public health as well during that time. And there's nothing that I did in public health or pediatrics that I know has more value in protecting children's lives than getting them vaccinated fully and on time. And so having two people in those roles, who have questioned that, it gives me great pause and great concern. And I'll be watching the confirmation hearings very closely.",

As a doctor and policy maker, Weldon's focus on vaccine safety, he's been skeptical of the CDC's role researching and promoting vaccines.As CDC head, what influence would he have on CDC policy? BESSER: Well, there's a lot. The CDC director is the one who makes a recommendation in terms of what vaccinations children or adults should receive in America. The requirements around that are left to the state. But it's the CDC director who makes those recommendations. And once the CDC director recommends a childhood vaccination, it kicks in payments from the government so that no child in America will have to worry about getting a vaccine based on -- based on income. We need a similar system for -- for adults. But for children, that CDC recommendation is -- is critical. And so it will be important for -- for the Senators to explore what approach Doctor Weldon will be taking when it comes to childhood vaccination. Another key piece, the CDC is a technical public health agency and leads in emergency response around public health events. This is one of the first CDC directors who has no experience in public health. And so exploring how Doctor Weldon would -- would lead the next time of public health crisis arrives. Because it's not a matter of -- of if, but when. We -- we always experience public health crises. We can't predict what they're going to be. And you want to make sure that he has there at the CDC with him people with significant experience in managing a public health event.",

And we've seen autism rise since then. It's really important to -- to look and see what are the causes of that that rise. But it's clearly not vaccination. Yet, Doctor Weldon, even after the National Academy of Medicine, an independent body, reviewed the evidence, he still kept raising concerns about vaccines and autism. You know, as a -- as a parent, what are you going to do if one of the top health leaders in the nation is raising concerns? It really makes it challenging.

That's one of the key questions. The Pentagon said earlier today, their legislative affairs team here is very much willing to work with the Senate when it comes to questions like this. So what we've learned is that Senator Markwayne Mullin is holding the promotion of Lieutenant General Chris Donahue. Donahue was nominated to be the commander, the four-star commander of U.S. Army Europe, Africa. He currently serves as the lieutenant general in charge of the 18th Airborne Corps. At the time of the Afghanistan withdrawal, he was the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division. He was brought into Afghanistan to effectively manage the closing of the withdrawal, those last few critical weeks, in which we saw 13 U.S. servicemembers killed because of the bombing at Abbey Gate. It was Donahue who was on the ground there. And there was a very sort of symbolic, iconic picture of him being the last U.S. soldier out of Afghanistan. You see that picture on your screen right now. What was effectively the end of the U.S. presence there and the end of the 20-year war. Certainly, not how the U.S. wanted to see that end. And some Republicans, including President-Elect Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance and Senator Markwayne Mullin, have continuously criticized the Biden administration. Trump, on the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing, said when he comes into office, he wants all of the senior officials who took part in the withdrawal of Afghanistan to resign immediately. Mullin even issued a statement on that same day saying that nobody has been held accountable. And although much of the criticism has focused on the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, at the time, it was Mullin who specifically name checked General Donahue. So it is a question now of if he's willing to simply ask questions, learn about the issue, learn about Donahue's role here, or if there's no way he gives ground here. And that's one of the key questions we'll be looking at as we see how this plays out. Worth noting that Tuberville's hold on hundreds of nominees lasted months.",

As was the case when it came to the withdrawal of the Biden administration from Afghanistan. Donahue is well respected. Probably why he was the guy in the picture as the last one there.

And both of them recommended against a complete withdrawal. And yet, the civilian leadership that runs the military, that is then- President Trump and then President Biden decided to continue with the withdrawal, Donahue, as a two star, was brought in essentially to manage a very difficult situation.
