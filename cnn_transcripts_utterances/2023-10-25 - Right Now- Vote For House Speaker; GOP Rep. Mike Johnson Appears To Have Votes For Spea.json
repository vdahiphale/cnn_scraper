There has been furniture and other items removed from the speaker's suite. That has been happening all through the course of the day as Kevin McCarthy plans to move into a different office. In fact, moving into a suite nearby the House floor where Nancy Pelosi used to occupy, something that McCarthy has since uprooted her from that location. Dana, there is a big question about Kevin McCarthy's future. He has indicated he will serve out his term. He will play such a huge role fundraising for this party, trying to keep Republicans in the House majority. What will he do now? Will he step aside? Will he continue to serve? Will he play that key role that Republicans needed him to play to keep the House? Those are huge questions for the former speaker who is moving out of the suite that he has still occupied for more than three weeks, even though he was ousted 22 days ago -- Dana?",

Meaning kick Mike Johnson out the way that you did Kevin McCarthy? Does that rule still exist? I should say, this is McCarthy who just voted for Mike Johnson. REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO): Yes, absolutely. The rules haven't changed in the House. I anticipate, at some point, a Republican member will move to change the rules. It goes to conference first. Then the rule would go to the floor.

John King, I want to get your thoughts. He's 51 years old, Mike Johnson. The Republican representative from Louisiana. He was elected in 2016, sworn in in 2017. We did some checking. He would be the first speaker in 140 years with that limited amount of experience in the House. JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: So at a time when people in both parties are asking for generational change, here's an opportunity. You're right. He'll be tested. The critics will say, you've never chaired a committee, you've only been here seven years, you're not up to the job, you don't know enough. You don't know enough about how the institution works, you don't know enough about the policy challenges. And that will be the criticism. And he knows that coming into day one. The question is, can he somehow do what no other Republican has been able to do, Republicans who have worked it for a decade or more? Like a Steve Scalise, like a Tom Emmer. They helped win money, helped recruit candidates. That's the traditional path to the speakership. Mike Johnson has done none of that. That doesn't mean it can't work. But we don't have to look far back to see Steve Scalise was toppled. Congressman Scalise, number two in the membership, couldn't even get to the floor for a vote. The number four, Mr. Emmer, who just led them to the majority, helped lead them to the majority. Mid-terms were a little mixed message. They didn't do as well as they thought they were going to do. He couldn't even get to the floor. Because of -- yes, their personal differences with some of the other members. But also the fact that they were viewed by the most rebels, most rebellious members as part of the establishment. Mike Johnson is none of those things. But can he satisfy the six or eight or 10 who are always looking to upset the apple cart and, at the same time, satisfy the 18 who have to go back to districts Joe Biden won, whose election next year is in question. It's a job somebody -- whether you like him or not, McCarthy studied how to do that job for years and could not pull it off. Can this untested man do it? It's a giant opportunity. But there is a trap door under him every step of the way.",

      "sentences": "And out of three weeks of chaos comes very important history. A man even many Republican Senators knew nothing about this morning, and I would believe most Americans knew nothing about this morning, is about to be third in line for the presidency once he is sworn in as speaker of the House.Mike Johnson will be third in line for the presidency after the president and vice president. He will be the leader of a very fractious Republican conference. And we were talking earlier, the Democrats believe they can use him and Trump to run the 2024 campaign. That will be a challenge. A huge difference between him and the Democrats. But we're going to see the president in the Rose Garden in a few minutes. He's never negotiated with Joe Biden. He'll now have to negotiate with the president of the United States. He's also never negotiated with Mitch McConnell. This will also exacerbate because of the wing of the party he comes from, the differences we've seen play out the last couple of years between House Republicans and Senate Republicans. So it's a new face, a new leader. He's a blank slate. That's an enormous opportunity. The challenges are so many for a person who has zero experience at this level. That doesn't mean he can't do it but he has zero experience in what he inherits in just a matter of minutes. They'll tally the votes. He will be sworn in as speaker. He will get the gavel. And then, wow, we move into the next very big chapter. (CROSSTALK)",
