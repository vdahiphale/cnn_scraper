Plus, Donald Trump's lawyers have a very busy few weeks ahead. We'll tell you the key dates to watch in his multiple civil and criminal trials.And Republican Lauren Boebert barely won her very red district last time around. Her solution moved to an even redder district. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and Inside Politics. We start in New Hampshire and one of those campaign moments that you just knew would immediately go viral. It was a Town Hall last night in the state where Nikki Haley has been doing quite well and a voter asked what seemed like a simple question with a simple answer. Listen to for now, just part of what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Of course, the Civil War was about slavery. We know that. That's unquestioned always the case. We know the Civil War was about slavery. But it was also more than that. It was about the freedoms of every individual. It was about the role of government. By the grace of God, we did the right thing and slavery is no more. But the lessons of what the bigger issue with the Civil War is that let's not forget what came out of that, which is government's role, individual liberties, freedom for every single person, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to do and be anything you want to be without anyone or government getting in your way.

And, you know, I heard in how she was addressing that, you know, I covered her campaign for governor of South Carolina. This seems like the kind of answer you give when you're being careful to talk to a certain group of voters in a southern state, about, you know, an issue like this, that I think let's be clear, this conversation evolved during times of racial strife. Well, after actually, the end of the Civil War, when a lot of these monuments to the Confederacy went up, etc. And there's a lot of pain in the way that this conversation is had for people who were directly impacted by slavery, whose ancestors faced that horrible reality.

But what it does right now is, first of all, it punctures this image that she's had and that she has cultivated during the primary campaign of being this very disciplined on message kind of this, you know, very perfect candidate, if you will. And it really kind of knocks her off that. Clearly, this is not what she wants to be talking about for the day, but on the - and then the second thing that it does, it really does highlight her history on her kind of really tough history on race. If you look at, you know, going back to her race for - going back to her campaign for South Carolina governor, she said a version of this before back in 2010 when asked about the causes of the Civil War, she said it was kind of these two sides arguing about tradition and change. And then obviously, she had - there was a history with her, obviously, being governor when the Confederate flag was taken down of the South Carolina Statehouse grounds. But a couple of years before that, or about five years before that she had said the Confederate flag was not a racist symbol.

It was a very productive meeting, it was a very good meeting. But of course, we were looking for substance.What actually happened? What deal was made? What agreement was made? We're learning from a National Security Council spokesperson that Mexico's president has taken significant law enforcement steps on the Mexican side of the border. Now why is that important? That's important because whatever Mexican - Mexico does impacts the number of illegal entries into the United States. Now I want you to take a look at this drone video taken by producer extraordinaire and also drone pilot Ashley Killough. You can see that there is very little to no activity here in Eagle Pass, which just last week was the epicenter of this crisis. Now what could this be - this mean? Why could this be happening? Well, this could be up to law enforcement efforts on the Mexican side of the border. We've seen this in the past. Whenever Mexico upsets law enforcement, whenever they add checkpoints at trains that are used by migrants to move north, whenever Mexico ups its deportations or repatriations or starts moving migrants from the northern from its northern border to Central or Southern Mexico. That is what we see. And so we're kind of seeing on the ground, perhaps the result of those talks. Now we're also learning from Mexico's president. He used the word agreement, that there was some agreement between the U.S. and Mexico. We don't know the details of this agreement, but Mexico's president saying that there's some agreement so that the ports of entry can reopen. Now, the U.S. government was the one who closed several ports of entry in several states to respond to this crisis because the personnel that worked at the ports within reassigned to process migrants, to transport migrants. Again, that's a way that they surge resources to the areas that are most impacted by the illegal crossings. And Dana, it makes sense for these two countries to agree on reopening these ports of entry because they're major trading partners. So all that makes sense. Now, we're going to continue trying to figure out what else it was part of this deal, who got what and what's happening. But for now, that's what we have. Dana, back to you.",

But then there's the commerce issue that comes when you start shutting down crossings or limiting crossings, that also has to be factored in. And then you also have to think about the political climate, where I think that's what you brought up Kasie, that the political climate as it ebbs and flows, there isn't always truly the will to get it done. That's something we saw with Senate Republicans back during the Bush years, where there was an agreement that a lot of people kind of in hindsight, say, we wish we had got it done then when we had the best chance. The question remains whether there's truly a chance. Now there's a lot more writing - now there's foreign policy that's connected with the border security issue. Maybe that'll get something done, because there's more at stake now, but it's just been such an elusive solution to the problem.",
