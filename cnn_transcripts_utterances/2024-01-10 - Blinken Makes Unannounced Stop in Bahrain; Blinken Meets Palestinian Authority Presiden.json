He is on a tour of the Middle East in an effort to prevent a wider war. It is 5:00 P.M in Manama, it's 6:00 P.M. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You are watching \"Connect the World.\" We are also covering in the next 2 hours, gunmen in Ecuador storming a TV station during a live broadcast. Violence erupted across the country after a gang leader escaped prison. It's the final debate before the Iowa caucuses, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis going head to head in a CNN debate tonight. Frontrunner Donald Trump Decided to sit this one out. And Boeing CEO acknowledges a mistake has been made as he to employees about the terrifying Alaska Airlines midair blowout.

You can see the Futures behind me all but flat after what can only be described as a rough start to the year for investors in stocks. The Consumer Price Index set to be released on Thursday morning, so traders in the U.S. may be in an inflation focused holding pattern as it were. More on that at the bottom of the hour. Plus, a look at a couple of economic reports that caught our eye today. Well, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, has just landed in Bahrain, in region, on a what is a surprise stop, it has to be said. Bahrain, part of the U.S. led Red Sea coalition aimed at stopping Houthi attacks in what is a vital shipping lane. Blinken will meet with Bahrain's King, and we will have a lot more on that in a moment. Earlier today, Antony Blinken and the Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas met in the West Bank, on Blinken's latest leg of his Middle East tour, aimed at protecting Gazans and getting them desperately needed help. That at least is the positioning from the State Department. Abbas reportedly telling Blinken that his government would reject any effort by Israel to separate or divide Gaza. What Blinken told Israel's leaders on Tuesday is they must move towards a two state solution with the Palestinians to help get Arab help in ensuring lasting security. Antony Blinken also says Israel has agreed to allow a U.N. assessment mission in Northern Gaza as a step towards getting displaced Palestinians back home. While Antony Blinken is urging restraint of the Israelis, the war is showing no signs of slowing down. Israel's military claiming it has hit 150 targets over the past day. All this happening as the U.S. Navy, with the help of a British warship, repelled one of the largest Houthi attacks in the Red Sea since this war began, shooting down more than 20 missiles and drones launched from Yemen. Jeremy Diamond connecting to us, from Tel Aviv, and Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon tonight. Jeremy, let's just start with you, there. And a surprise visit, unscheduled by Antony Blinken to Bahrain. Of course, he's been in Israel, speaking, with the Netanyahu war cabinet. He is now -- and also he's been on the West Bank. We expect him back closer to where you are in the coming days. Meantime, he's in Bahrain. Why?",

Let's just remind ourselveshow the Red Sea fits into what is going on, of course, with the, Israeli attacks on Hamas. It is the Houthis, the Iran backed Houthis, who since the outset of this conflict have said that they will attack or they would attack Israeli shipping, whilst this assault by Israel continues. They, alongside, you know, other states around, this region have been calling for a ceasefire since October. Of course, these Houthi attacks, on shipping have escalated, and we have seen very specifically now, U.S. -- not just U.S. involvement leading this coalition, but very specifically, U.S. attacks on the Houthis. Just explain what we understand to be going on at present and why this is now such a national security issue as far as the U.S. is concerned?",

      "sentences": "Well, Becky, we're seeing a cycle of Escalation play out already. On December 31st, the U.S. Navy shotdown, or I should say, they sunk, basically three Houthi boats that were attempting to board a commercial ship. And the Houthis now say that this latest barrage of missiles and drones that they launched, against targets in the Red Sea was in response to the U.S. sinking those boats and killing all of the Houthi militants that were on board. But we should note that while the Houthis say that they're carrying out these attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians to target the Israelis, most, if not all, of the vessels that they have been targeting have no ties to Israel at all. And so U.S. officials say that this is very opportunistic of these militants trying to kind of bolster their reputation among amongst the Iranians, amongst other Iran backed groups. But in general, what we're seeing now is a cycle that is likely going to force the U.S. and the coalition there to respond in a more meaningful way, in a preemptive way. And we got a sense of that in the Central Command statement that was released following this latest barrage of missiles and drones shot by the Houthis that were downed by the U.S. and the U.K. overnight. And in that statement Central Command said very clearly, that the Houthis will bear responsibility for the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, or the free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways. The U.S. as well as 13 other nations they released a statement to that effect last week, saying that it was going to be their last warning to the Houthis. So it is very possible that we see some sort of escalation in the coming days by the U.S. in this maritime coalition that has been formed in order to respond. Because as you have pointed out, this is such a critical waterway. It is such a critical shipping lane, and it is seriously interrupting the free flow of goods in the international economy. So the U.S., likely going to feel like they have to respond soon.",

That is a serious problem according to current and former officials, and the Pentagon has issued a mea culpa for that saying that there were clearly shortfalls in the process. But as a result, the Pentagon and the White House, they have now initiated procedural reviews for how authorities are transferred and who is notified when that happens. Because not only was the White House not notified during that procedure that the Secretary underwent in December for this prostate cancer, they also were not notified when he went back to the hospital on January 1st when he was undergoing severe pain and was placed in the intensive care unit. So there are a lot of questions still to be answered about why this played out this way. The Secretary is a deeply personal person, deeply private, but that according to officials really does not cut it when you are the Secretary of Defense, such a key member, of course, of the President's cabinet.

He did not have to be there. It was not mandatory for him to attend, but he chose to do so. And I think there's, a lot of reasons for that. One is that he cares deeply about this case.

And you heard him make that argument, after the hearing.

Those are the markets as they have opened. Worth noting, A couple of economic reports out today, and perhaps some will be surprised that these haven't actually moved the markets much, but I'll get you them anyway. The World Bank and the World Economic Forum. The World Bank says the global economy will slow in 2024 for the third straight year, and the overall global economy is, quote, \"lagging.\" And according to the World Economic Forum's Risk Report, it highlights, quote, \"A predominantly negative outlook in the short term that is expected to worsen over the long term.\" Paints that gloomy picture is a squeeze on global trade in the form of cargo shipment disruption as we've been discussing this hour, and we led, at the top of this hour, with the U.S. Navy repelling a large Houthi attack, shooting down 21 missiles and drones launched from Yemen on Tuesday night. Let's take a step back to look at the results of these incidents. According to one shipping firm, 419 vessels have been impacted. That's ships either diverted or directly attacked. Last week's shipping analysts, Lloyd's List, said shipping activity through this route was down nearly 20 percent. That means the average cost to ship a 40 foot container from East to West has jumped to $2,670 as of January 4th. That is about double the cost from November, huge implications as you can see to the shipping industry and consumers' pockets ultimately. Because at the end of the day, you and I foot this bill. Marco Forgione, Director General at the Institute of Export and International Trade, joining me now live. Marco, close to a third of global container shipping goes through the Red Sea.

So what you've got is the Houthi rebels are attacking the shipping, which is causing the shipping lines to either pause, waiting to see the impact of Operation Prosperity Guard in the U.S. led naval intervention or they are diverting their ships south to go around the Cape of Good Hope, up past West Africa.
