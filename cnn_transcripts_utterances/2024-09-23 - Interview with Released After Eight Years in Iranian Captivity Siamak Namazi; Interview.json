In an exclusive interview, Hisfirst since being released this time last year. Then, with the U.N. General Assembly starting in New York, I speak to one of America's closest allies, the Irish Taoiseach Simon Harris. Also, ahead, Walter Isaacson interviews historian Timothy Snyder about his new book, \"On Freedom.\" Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour outside the U.N. in New York, as world leaders are meeting at the annual General Assembly against a grim backdrop of global conflict and deepening geopolitical divisions. In the Middle East, war is escalating. Lebanon says at least 274 people have been killed in the deadliest day since 2006, that war after Israel conducted extensive airstrikes on Hezbollah targets across the country. Talks aimed at ending the war in Gaza are at a standstill. But sometimes diplomacy can yield important results. This time last year, Siamak Namazi was released from Iran's notorious Evin Prison in a hostage prisoner swap with the United States. He was the longest held American in Iran, a horrifying eight-year ordeal. Now, six months before his release, Namazi had bravely called into this program from inside Evin to make an emotional plea to President Biden. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we can differentiate very clearly between Hamas, a brutal, horrific terrorist organization that offers no hope of a future to the people of Palestine, and the people of Palestine who aspire for the basic things we all aspire for statehood, for freedom, for democracy.

More broadly, I think we've got to get back to a further peace summit. We have to get more people around the table. I do believe, not to link our previous conversation, but the failure to consistently apply international law is making it harder to get some other players to the table, in terms of the Global South, I think that is a real issue.

I'm right about everything. Whereas, I think freedom involves recognizing that you're wrong. I think a person who can't recognize that he is wrong can't be a free person because he's inside somebody else's story. So, what I'm trying to show with that image is how I believe that the time, when I was a kid, that the bell I was ringing on that farm, which is part of where I grew up, was connected to other bells, the Liberty Bell, that bicentennial thought made me think of 1776. But what I didn't know at the time was how to ask what it meant to be free, and I didn't know other people in the U.S. who'd had other kinds of experiences. So, the book is a kind of attempt to consider the U.S. story, not because it's all wrong, but because if we take history seriously, we learn where we can do things better. My sense of freedom is that it has to be positive. It can't be about worshiping the past. It can't be about believing somebody else to take care of freedom for you. It has to be about combining the things that you believe are good. And what happens is that, as individuals, we realize to do that, we need help from others. And so, freedom is an individual thing. I believe it's the value of values, but we can only get there if we together create the condition so that we can grow up to be free people, like I was lucky enough to do.",

If the government is pushed away, if oppression is pushed away, if government is small, if we eliminate government. And I think that is at best half the story or just the beginning of the answer. And this was brought home to me actually in parts of Ukraine that were de- occupied, where it was clear that, sure, removing the torture facilities was really important, stopping the deportation of children was really important, but it was only the beginning of something else. People who arrived at concentration camps after the second war had a similar experience. People said liberated, but then once they contemplated the concentration camps, they realized, wait a minute, these people aren't free just because the Germans are gone. They need health care. They need medical attention. And those extreme cases bring us back to a basic reality. We need other things besides the absence of government to be free. We need cooperation so that our kids can have education, so that we're not afraid when we need medical attention, so that we can look forward to old age and retirement pensions. These basic things that create security around us actually make us more free because they make us less anxious, less fearful, and more capable of thinking about what we individually think is good and more capable of realizing in the world. And that's the positive vision, that freedom is about believing things are good, combining those good things in our own way and leading a life of moral character.",

And for the last 30, 35 years, there's been too much talk, at least in the U.S., about how freedom is brought inevitably by capitalism, which it isn't, or inevitably by the founding fathers, which it isn't. One has to take hold of the economy or take hold of history. One has to take hold of things to be free. And when we preach that, we're better or the capitalism will save us. We're actually making ourselves unfree because we're habituating ourselves to the idea that somebody or something from outside is going to save us. So, I think that's part of it. But then the other part of it is, I completely agree. If we talk about freedom, but make it impossible, we're creating this condition which is psychologically very demanding. If we say this is the land of the free, there's an American dream, and then, we don't make that American dream accessible, then people are going to look for easy answers.

And that was really, really helpful, partly because, as you know very well, Ukrainians are the people right now who talk about freedom the most. And so, I wanted to listen. And in what they were saying, there were a couple of important lessons. One was that freedom is about the future, which is really, really important. Very often the authoritarians, who you mentioned earlier, or the people you call a populist, are trying to bring us into some kind of nostalgic past. But you can't go back to the past. You can go to various kinds of futures, but they're only there if you can imagine them and if you can realize them. And the way the Ukrainians talk about freedom is not negative. It's not, we just have to get the Russians out, it's something like, the Russians got in the way of these futures, which we really believed we had. And the second thing, as I mentioned before, was the positive negative distinction that when you're in the rubble, you realize, well, it's good that the Russians are gone, but someone's going to have to clear this rubble, someone's going to have to restore this sidewalk, someone's got to rebuild this road, someone's got to restore the bus line. And then, the third thing is character, right? So, if freedom is just negative, it's just the absence of barriers. That means it means doing whatever I feel like at a given moment. But is that really freedom? I mean, what I think is that freedom is about having positive values and asserting them and realizing them and trying to live consistently with them. And as you do that over time, you become a personality or you build something like character. And when that happens, there are moments that you can only do one thing precisely because you are free. And it was Zelenskyy staying in Kyiv and millions of other Ukrainians staying at a time when we thought that they would flee, or maybe we would have fled, that got me thinking about that, that an unfree person can always try to run, but sometimes a free person has to be the right thing precisely because he or she is a free person.",

Freedom to make decisions about your own body, a future when no child lives in poverty, and we can all afford health care, and no one's above the law. How does that definition of freedom and the grabbing of the banner of freedom by Kamala Harris, how do you assess that?",

And a people that can rule has to be a free people, which raises the question of how do you create a free people? It takes work. It takes institutions. It takes cooperation. It takes -- as she says, you have to choose freedom, but on the other hand, you actually have to -- you also have to build the institutions, which allowed children to grow up free. So, I mean, I'm watching this from afar, right? Like, it's -- from my point of view, it's a coincidence. But it is interesting to watch her move from a language trying -- first, she's trying to take the language of negative freedom from the Republicans. She's talking about -- she's saying, we're the party that's going to keep government off your back. But then there's a kind of glide towards positive freedom, as she and others in the campaign starts talking about freedom not just from government oppression, but the freedom to do things, which I think is the right move, philosophically anyway, and hopefully, politically as well. Because as we were saying, like, freedom from is important, but only because it's necessary for freedom too. We want to have a country where we can all grow up to be diverse, beautiful, different, flourishing individuals, that's what positive freedom is about. But to do that, we can't -- we have to decide to create institutions together that make it possible.",

I think it's infuriating, right? Like this whole rhetoric of us and them, it makes freedom impossible. Like freedom has to be about we're all individuals, we're going to kind of create some conditions together, whether we agree with each other's ideas or not, we're going to create some conditions together, call them rights, call it a welfare state, a reasonable way that we can all live decent, dignified lives. As soon as it goes to us and them, we don't like the Haitians, we're going to make up stories about them. As soon as it does that, and people's minds change, we flip over to fear and anxiety, and who we are suddenly depends upon who somebody else is not. And that's just completely inconsistent with freedom. So, it upsets me, right? Because Springfield is a normal place where like the Haitian immigrants are making a significant contribution to normal life, like they do in other medium sized cities and towns in Ohio, by the way, it's completely normal. And they're not being allowed to live this normal life because of this us and them stuff. This us and them stuff which leads to threats of violence and disruption, it brings this unreality into their lives. It really upsets me.",
