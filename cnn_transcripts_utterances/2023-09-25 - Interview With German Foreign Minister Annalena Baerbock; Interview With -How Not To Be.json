I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. A pathetic attempt at retaliation, that is how Ukraine's new defense minister described the Kremlin's overnight attack on the Black Sea City of Odessa. Two people were killed. And the sea port, a hotel and grain infrastructure were damaged. Kyiv claims Moscow was responding to an attack on Russia's Black Sea fleet headquarters on Friday that killed a commander. We cannot independently verify his death. While we're at the U.N. summit though in New York, NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg told me that we're in for a long war. As a reminder, back at the start, one country, Germany, literally turned its postwar defense policy around and vowed to provide Ukraine with military help for as long as it takes. In New York, I asked the German foreign ministry, Annalena Baerbock, about the urgency then and a general sense of anxiety settling in now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

However, my feeling here at the U.N. is -- because I've been here the first weeks after this brutal war of aggression when many countries said, well, we don't actually know what's going on. We don't actually know. Maybe there was -- Ukraine's fault or NATO's fault, but this definitely changed. So, I feel way more support because many, many countries around the world see this is not only about Ukraine, this is not only about peace in Europe, it's about our charter of United Nations.

And this is impossible in a word. In my own country, we didn't even mention coal phase-out here. Now, we are not as fast as we should have been. But it's like 10 years later, it is kind of normal thing to phase out coal. And similar with the argumentation environmentalist but also some party said -- back in time saying, well, the future technology, the future industrial countries have to be carbon neutral. People, again, were laughing about this kind of things. And now, we see electric cars. And we were speaking about China, we had the automotive fear in Munich just the other week. So, we see from China one of the most advanced electric cars. So, because of this push from economy, this is also a chance. And now, we have to combine the possibilities which are all there in the economy, in the industry, to make a carbon neutral world together with political decisions which are quick enough. And awkwardly (ph), at this week, we didn't delivery. But we do have the COP, the climate conference at the end of the year in the Gulf country.

I mean, there are countries, I would say also like mine, yes, we decided as new government to totally phase out of coal. This is was one of our core energy sources. Was in the brutal war of Russia. We cut totally with our dependency on gas. Obviously, we had needed different gas sources from other countries, but we said that by midst of 2040, all the infrastructure for energy in Germany loses its permission, so you cannot use the infrastructure anymore if it's not carbon neutral. So, there are these countries, not only mine, and we could do better as well, but we have to join forces. And this is what I did here, bring together those countries, no matter if they are all Europeans or if they are all industrialized countries, bring together small island states, industrialized countries who are ready to walk the climate path. Countries from Africa, like Kenya. Kenya is a front runner in this. They are going carbon neutral in the next years to show that they are models, they are countries. And we cannot wait for the last in line any longer and this is a change and they are able to agree with Al Gore again.

So, because we know -- and we said it in the beginning, some are not really functioning. When we deliver, it does have to work in the field. And this is why, with the Leos, this is the explanation why now for the Taurus, I cannot say, well, we will deliver Taurus, but this, again, is so sophisticated. And we -- it's a new thing we are having. So, we have to be clear on every detail. How does it work? Who can actually operate with that one? And yes, it takes some time. I totally understand that there is not enough time in Ukraine. But when we delivered, it has to work and we saw it, for example. Also, with the IRIS-T or with the howitzers we delivered, then you have the material but no ammunition for that, it doesn't work then as well. So, it has to come altogether. And that is why, also, the cooperation with others. I'm always asking, why do you wait or discuss first with the Americans or others? Because this has to go combined, yes?

And this is really something which follows me throughout my time now as a foreign minister. You see that everywhere. You see it in Ethiopia. There was conflict in Tigre. If there is a sexual violence, destabilization, not only family, villages. So, yes, we took a new approach of saying women rights are hard politics, it's security politics, yes? So, this is one part of it. And the other dimension is, I always say, we have to give the war human face. This is not about tanks, ammunition numbers only. And if people do not understand, wow, this could be me as a mother, my child being kidnapped, yes, then you do a different politics. And one important part is why I'm talking all the time now about this deportation of children is, it's around 20,000, the figures, but nobody knows that, for example, with South Africa, in the beginning they said, well, we don't know. Actually, maybe we should stop the shooting. And I tried to explain to them, I mean, there's an aggressor and victim country, Ukraine. But if Ukraine stops defending itself, all the villages will be gone. It didn't really convince them. And then I told them about the deported children, told them, imagine, they are Russian soldiers coming to the school of your girls, telling them to go in holidays and you never see them again, what does this have to do with any war with NATO, with Russia, with Ukraine? This is most in human thing you can think of. And they didn't know about it. We only talked about self- defense and not the human faces. And this has changed something. So, South Africa, for example, is now calling on Putin to say, OK, first step for peace would be to bring back these children. And this is something we have to spread all over the world and this would be also my call to everybody actually to speak about these innocent children.",

And, you know, we put our bags on thesecurity belt to go through the metal detector. And as we were collecting our bags, a security guard came over and pulled this personal injury attorney aside and he said, oh, you know, you've been flagged. We use a facial recognition system here. And my manager is going to come over and he's going to need to talk to you. And this attorney was one of thousands of attorneys who have been placed on a ban list at Madison Square Garden, enforced with facial recognition technology because she works at a firm that has a case against the company. She's not working on that case, but this something that the owner of Madison Square Garden, James Dolan, has decided to deploy to kind of punish his enemies. And so, the manager came over and said -- he gave her basically a note kicking her out and said, you know, you're not welcome here until your firm, you know, resolves that litigation, drops the case against us.",

And if a company wants to use it, they need get consent. And if they don't, the company would need to pay up to $5,000 per, you know, face or biometric information that it uses.

And I ended up talking to police officers who were using the app. And oftentimes, the police officers would offer to run my photo to kind of show me how well the app worked. And every time this happened, the police officer would eventually stop talking to me. And -- or two of the police officers they said, you don't have any results. There's no photos in the app for you. It's really strange. And eventfully, I found out that Clearview AI was actually -- even through it wasn't talking to me, it was tracking me. And it has some kind of alert for when my photo was uploaded. It had blocked results for me. And one of the officers I talked to, minutes after he ran my face, got a call from the company telling them -- telling him that, you know, they knew he had done this and he wasn't supposed to and they deactivated his app. And it really freaked him out. He said, I didn't realize that this company would know who I was looking for, that they know who law enforcement is searching for and that they can control whether they could be found.
