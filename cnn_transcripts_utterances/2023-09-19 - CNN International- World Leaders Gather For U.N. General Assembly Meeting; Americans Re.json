      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, all eyes on New York as world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly. Who's there? Crucially, who isn't?Plus, the five Americans freed from Iran land back on U.S. soil. What's next for them? And Canada says there's credible evidence that India was behind the alleged assassination of a Sikh leader. India says that accusation is absurd. More on their diplomatic spat coming up. International diplomacy takes center stage this week as the United Nations kicks off its 78th annual General Assembly. In just about an hour, leaders are gathering to tackle the world's most pressing problems, including Russia's war in Ukraine. Devastating floodings in Libya as well. Climate change are just to name but a few. But key players are skipping this year's summit, including the leaders of China, Russia, the U.K. and France. U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are both set to address this assembly today, this morning. CNN's Richard Roth has been covering the U.N. for years. He joins us now live. What are the themes you're looking out for, Richard? And should we read anything into the fact that these key leaders aren't coming? RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: I don't think so. They have their delegations here. It's modern communication. Somebody could reach out if needed. It's been this way for different years, off and on. I mean, China rarely comes, Putin very rarely comes. So it's the fact that Britain and France are not represented. All the while, the discussions go on for year 30 on how to reform the Security Council to give more power to countries that are locked out of that permanent five with veto power. Brazil, South Africa, India, things like that. I've walked past someone in the hallway 20 minutes ago who sort of yelled out, today is the day. By U.N. standards, the Tuesday is the first day of the speeches. So you have President Biden, you have the President of Ukraine, who's making his first in person visit here since the war, and later in the afternoon, the President of Iran, the day after five different prisoners were released. Max?",

They arrived at an army airfield on Tuesday morning after an initial stop in Doha, Qatar. Their release on Monday was part of a wider deal that included the Biden administration unfreezing $6 billion in Iranian assets and releasing six Iranian prisoners. CNN National Security Reporter Natasha Bertrand is following the story for us from Washington. Obviously, huge relief for everyone personally involved in this repatriation, if I can call it that.

Thank you so much, Natasha Bertrand for bringing us that on a momentous day for them.Now, India has expelled a senior Canadian diplomat following Canada's decision to expel the head of the Indian Intelligence Agency in the country. On Monday, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that there are credible allegations linking the Indian government to the murder of a prominent Sikh leader in June. According to the Canadian authorities, Hardeep Singh Nijar was gunned down in his truck by two masked men outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia. India has rejected all allegations and denied any involvement in the killing. Canada's accusations are a significant worsening of the relations between the two countries, which have been frosty for many years now. Canada is home to an influential Sikh community which has long been one of the sources of tension. The Sikh separatist community is a religious movement demanding a separate homeland carved out of the Indian state of Punjab. Over the years, tensions between separatists and the central government have been or have resulted in violent clashes and have claimed many lives. The violence has often spilled over to Canada as well. CNN's Vedika Sud joins us live from New Delhi. This is off the back of that very tense meeting between the leaders of the two countries at the G20.",

And that's the meeting I want to start with the handshake between the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau from the 9th of this month. It was a brief handshake. A lot of experts did read through the lines and they did say it was a frosty kind of equation between them at that moment. But ever since, the highly fraught relationship between the two nations has gone further south. And that was pretty evident with what Justin Trudeau had to say yesterday on the floor of Parliament when he accused New Delhi of having a possible hand in the murder of a prominent Sikh leader. And his name is Hardeep Singh Najar.Now, ever since that handshake, there was also a meeting on the sidelines of the G20 where we're told by the Indian government that the Indian Prime minister made it very clear to Justin Trudeau that he wanted action against those who were committing anti-India activities on Canadian soil. But Justin Trudeau, just a week later, maybe eight days later in Parliament, made that very explosive claim. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
