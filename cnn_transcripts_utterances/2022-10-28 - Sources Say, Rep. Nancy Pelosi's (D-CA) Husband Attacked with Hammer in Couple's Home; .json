Thank you.Top of the hour here on CNN, I'm Erica Hill. The breaking news we are following this morning. Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, hospitalized at this hour after being attacked with a hammer at the couple's home in San Francisco overnight. We do have our correspondents and analysts standing by. I want to begin with CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Manu Raju. Manu, we are hearing from the speaker's office about this incident.

She was not there at the time but her husband, Paul Pelosi, who was 82 years old, was at the time. And what we're learning from law enforcement sources is that an assailant came in, broke into the couple's home and attacked Paul Pelosi with a hammer.Now, the speaker's office put out a statement about what is happening -- what they understand has happened here. They said in a statement, early this morning, an assailant broke into the Pelosi residence in San Francisco and violently assaulted Mr. Pelosi. The assailant is in custody and the motivation for the attack is under investigation. Mr. Pelosi was taken to the hospital, where he is receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery. The speaker was not in San Francisco at the time. Now, we have learned that the speaker was in D.C. at the time. She has been traveling across the country, raising money, appearing in campaign stops as we head into the critical midterm elections. Sometimes Paul Pelosi travels with her and oftentimes he does not. He has his own company, a financial leasing services company. He's 82 years old. He was in the news recently, has pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in August. But this comes also as threats of political violence and actual political violence have been playing out in all across the country as we head into these midterm elections, fears over election workers' safety alike. We don't know the motivation of what exactly why this assailant broke into the Pelosi home. Whether it was politically motivated or not, that is something that is still under investigation. We will learn more and report that when we learn more about it. But a staggering and scary moment at the Pelosi home as the speaker's husband attacked by a hammer. Erica?",

There is still a lot we don't know but we know but there is a suspect in custody. This is what was referred to as a violently assaulted, according to that statement from the speaker's office, and we've learned from law enforcement that a hammer was used.

We still don't know if this has anything to do with that. But the speaker of the House is an enormously powerful official in the scope of the U.S. government, in the line of succession and receives 24-hour protection from the Capitol police when she travels to places, like New York, she sees additional protection from the NYPD and the same in San Francisco.

We don't know if there is anything political behind it but we can't ignore the warnings that we've seen from the NYPD here in New York City and really across the country about violent rhetoric.

It hasn't been a major part of the conversation going into the midterms. And those responsible have yet to be held accountable.And that being said, I know that from the many members of Congress that I speak to, just like myself, have had to seek private contractors to provide security. Them, because U.S. Capitol police is unequipped, and me, because I have no other alternative.

There has been a major push for people to get back on who have been banned, including the former president, and what potentially that could mean in terms of more heated rhetoric online.S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes. Twitter is a big platform for this kind of rhetoric. And you can say it is just talk. But it is not always just talk. It is a very dangerous time to be a lawmaker, to be an election worker, to be a journalist. I did a story a year ago in COVID that it was very dangerous for public health and safety administrators, really low level rank and file public servants who were enforcing things, like mask mandates. They were being targeted with violent rhetoric and violence. This is not a third world country. It shouldn't be dangerous to be any of those things, a journalist, a lawmaker, and yet here we are. And I think to pretend that words don't have a direct implication and chasing conspiracy theories and really sort of out there whacky ideas and platforming anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism is unrelated or doesn't have real consequences.

We know that he was at Twitter headquarters yesterday hanging around one of the coffee bars, talking to people there.So, he is now the boss. In fact, his Twitter profile calls himself the chief twit of Twitter. Look, a lot of people say that he way overpaid for twitter and he sent this note to advertisers, this sort of statement to advertisers, saying he didn't do this for the money, he's doing this because he believes in humanity, and that he wants to try to provide a place where there can be free and fair discourse, right, that you don't have people just on the right and the left in their own echo chambers. So he is going to take over this pretty important platform here. And the question is we know that he has been against permanent banning before. Is he going to let former President Donald Trump back on the site? Would he let people like conspiracy theorist and provocateur Alex Jones on this site as well? What are his plans for Twitter, we just don't know. We do know that when he said he would buy this for $44 billion and he turned around and spent months trying not to buy it. So, this has been really one of the strangest takeovers I have ever covered, and now the company is in private hands. It is not publicly traded any more. It belongs to Elon Musk. Erica?",
