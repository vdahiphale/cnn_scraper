Certainly, a continuation of the war with his far-right coalition members is not a threat to him in power. In fact, those coalition members on the far-right have threatened to take down the government if he agrees to a ceasefire. But that, of course, is only part of the equation. You need Hamas to agree to a ceasefire as well. And if they're not coming to the negotiations that are set for later this week, it's unclear that they can make any sort of dramatic breakthrough. You know, Hamas also wants to go back to previous iterations of the negotiations, that in and of itself may be difficult.

Obviously, the introduction of Kamala Harris has been a major game changer. And you look at Donald Trump's strategy here, nothing is working. Nothing is sticking. He's questioned how black she is, whether she's black enough. He said that she hates Jews. He's called her dumb. I mean, the list goes on. Why is it that the strategy that worked in 2016 just simply is not working anymore? Why?",

And the fact Democratic National Convention is being held next week, except for the protests that may interrupt it, that suggests the convention will extend the good period for Kamala Harris. What is Donald Trump's reaction? As one of your correspondent said, it's the same old Donald Trump. He pouts. He pouts. And he pouts when things don't go the way they were predicted to do and the way he thought they were going to go.

I'm wondering how much you think, listen, this may still be a honeymoon period. We still have a ways to go before Election Day. But how much are you reading into these polls, specifically in the Blue Wall states, right? Of Pennsylvania, of Wisconsin, Michigan, where you're seeing Kamala Harris close the gap without really introducing her own specific policies, so this is still effectively the Biden-Harris policy on issues like the border, security, the economy.

We've seen black women consistently with the democratic candidate, but Latina women were not. And they are now coming back on board. Young women had been defecting not to Trump but either to non-voting or to one of the independent candidates. They're coming back to the democratic standard with Kamala Harris. So you're left, again, as you noted with white female voters. And I've gone through the recent cross tabs for several of the polls and I'm noting that it's support for common hairs is going up a point or two or three with that critical and incredibly large group.

Happy to be with you again.I think we need to separate between what is known to Israeli intelligence or what Israeli intelligence -- the Israeli-U.S. intelligence, believe they know and assess about the coming Hezbollah-Iranian attack. And maybe some calls or some alerts from possible developments after the attack that are aimed for maybe American base to any Iranians to make sure that both the enemies of Israel and the friends of Israel will understand the risk of the deterioration to an all-out war, regional war. So about the first, the assessment is, according to the latest assessment, is that the attack will happen from tomorrow until the weekend. It will be a Hezbollah attack followed by an Iranian attack and it will aim at few. There is small number of military targets like air force bases or intelligence bases with the aim of making something significant, hitting something significant but not too significant with the possibility of Israel containing the result of the -- of this attack. Now, the -- I think what the Minister of Defense Gallant was trying to say is that the possible outcome of such an attack is that maybe the Iranians or Hezbollah will miss, civilians are killed. Some of the missiles, as we saw in the previous attack on the 13th, 14th of April, some of the missiles will cross Israeli defense, air defense that are very strong but not totally in (INAUDIBLE) the country from being hit. And this will force Israel to retaliate. I don't think that the Israeli intelligence believe that the Iranians are going to initial few strikes, one Hezbollah, one Iran and that's it, but that they maybe are willing or are thinking that it could prolong if Israel will retaliate, that the Iranians will retaliate to retaliation. There is a name for this exchange of blow, it calls war.",

Even in this readout over the weekend, Gallant highlighted the urgency of achieving an agreement for the release of hostages and thanked the U.S. administration for its leadership and commitment to this issue. Why do I bring this up? We don't hear this type of language from the Prime Minister himself. And as you know, and we've been reporting over the past few days, the friction behind closed doors has now come public between the defense establishment and this prime minister, the defense establishment saying now it is the time for a deal. It may be the only opportunity. And things are getting very testy now and personal between the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister. Walk us through what is happening.",

But the still living hostages are in dire condition. And many of them will not hold for too long. And this is really the last opportunity to get some of them back alive. But this is the duty, this is the obligation, this is the (INAUDIBLE) unwritten contract between the state of the Jews and its citizens, that it will be safer for the Jews. Now, the consensus today, among Israeli leaders of the defense establishment, people that are in the know-how of the negotiation team, people around Minister Gallant all saying the same, not just it's the right time to sign a deal, not just that the Israeli armed forces are ready to take the risk in such a deal, including a ceasefire, but it is the blame of the prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu, for sabotaging the deal and making it impossible because of (INAUDIBLE) to have a deal signed. So there, it's like a consensus against the prime minister, not just in favor of the deal. And the prime minister stays and said, we will prefer to continue fighting for the upmost victory where the prime minister is basically being held to the world by members of his coalition, who says if you sign a deal for a ceasefire or exchange of hostages for the ceasefire, we will disassemble the government.

Based on that, you have these really staggering increases in both cases and deaths projected for men around the globe. For cancer cases, in 2022, they were at 10.3 million. That's expected to grow to 19 million by 2050. That's an 84 percent increase. For cancer deaths, they were at 5.4 million in 2022. And that's projected to grow to 10.5 million by 2050. A 93 percent increase. Deaths are expected to grow particularly quickly among men over the age of 65. They're projected to double in that age group. You're also seeing disparities in these numbers. In lower income countries, you're seeing a much faster rate increase in terms of cancer deaths among men. And so these disparities already exist and they're only expected to get bigger. Now, we already knew that men die from cancer at higher rates than women. They have greater exposure to risk factors like smoking and drinking alcohol, as well as exposures through their workplace to things that cause cancers. Now, in these data, the researchers find that the top cause of death is expected to still be lung cancer in 2050. That is currently the top cause right now. The largest increases in cases is expected to come from a cancer called mesothelioma, which is most associated with asbestos exposure. And the largest increase in deaths is expected to be seen in prostate cancer, guys.",
