We'll have all the details on his expulsion. Then, celebration turned nightmare. Iraq in mourning as more than 100 died during a devastating fire at a wedding ceremony. Plus, a potential U.S. government shutdown now less than four days away. We will explore why there's such a deadlock. But first this evening, North Korea has now returned U.S. Army Private Travis King to American custody. A U.S. official says he's expected to arrive in San Antonio, Texas, as soon as Thursday morning. North Korean state media reported earlier that the country had decided to expel him. A rare move considering Pyongyang's relationship of course, with Washington. Hours ago, the Pentagon thanked Sweden and China for playing a role here. But the circumstances around this whole story have been -- well, let's just say, somewhat bizarre. In July, King appeared to make a dash for the North Korean border during a civilian tour of the Demilitarized Zone. He had been released from a detention facility in South Korea about a week before that. Here's what the U.S. State Department's spokesperson said just in the last hour. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, SPOKESPERSON, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: I would not want to speculate on any motivations on the North Korean side. And I don't know that I would take from this and herald some breakthrough in diplomatic relations. Obviously, we're pleased to have secured his return. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A transfer to China with the help of Sweden, the protecting power for the U.S. and Pyongyang, the U.S. and North Korea have no diplomatic ties. North Korea said earlier Wednesday, they would expel  him, adding King had confessed to illegally intruding into the country due to quote, \"in-human maltreatment and racial discrimination in the United States Army.\" Pyongyang works through state media, King has not been heard from or seen since mid July. Photographed here on a civilian tour of the joint security area in the DMZ just before he ran across the military demarcation line into North Korea. U.S. officials say he tried to access the main building which was locked, ran around the back and was bundled into a van by North Korean guards. There's a fairly safe assumption he would have been extensively questioned by North Korean officials. MALCOLM DAVID, SENIOR ANALYST, DEFENSE STRATEGY &amp; CAPABILITY: He was a fairly low-ranking of a soldier. He wasn't an officer, he didn't really have access to any classified information.

The second thing to keep in mind is, if you look at the circumstances in which it happened, you know, once the North Koreans did their investigation and went on, it was pretty clear in terms of what happened with Private King and the incident that happened along the border there. And so, with that, the resolution, it looked fairly straightforward from that particular angle here.

A relative says the bride and groom are alive, and authorities have announced arrests. They say those found negligent will be responsible. Now, that's little solace really for this largely Christian community. They've suffered through years of war, ISIS and now this. And instead of a honeymoon today, funerals have begun. Our Salma Abdelaziz has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): A celebration-turned nightmare at an event hall in northern Iraq. More than a thousand people were gathered here to attend the wedding of a young couple. Social media video shows the moment the ceiling apparently caught fire. The sparklers setting the decor ablaze. This eyewitness described how the horror unfolded. \"During the slow dance, one of the fireworks hit the roof and it caught fire all at once.\" He says, \"it spread everywhere because it was made of panels, vinyl, fabric, everything was burning and it started falling on people's heads, no one could get out.\" Highly flammable and illegal building materials made the venue a tinderbox, according to Iraq civil defense. Ecobond(ph) panels which violate the country's civil code set the flames, and within minutes, portions of the building collapsed, living families trapped in the inferno, official said. Burns and asphyxiation led to the deaths and injuries of dozens according to Iraq's health ministry. The full extent of the tragedy made clear as daylight broke while rescue workers sifted through charred concrete and twisted rebar. And loved ones discovered the fate of their relatives. \"These are my mom's, my mom's!\" This man screams. \"My mom's clothes\", as he holds up all that remains of his mother. Her dress. This is already one of the most devastated areas in hard-hit Iraq, Qaraqosh, which are predominately Christian town was captured by ISS in 2014. And nearly all of its 60,000 residents forced to flee the terror group's wrath. Liberated more than two years later by U.S.-backed forces, life was slowly coming back. A visit from Pope Francis in 2021 marked the persecuted communities brave return. The day after what should have been a celebration of joy, mass funerals and mass mourning at this Christian cemetery. With survivors left asking how so much avoidable death was allowed to happen and if corruption may be to blame. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
