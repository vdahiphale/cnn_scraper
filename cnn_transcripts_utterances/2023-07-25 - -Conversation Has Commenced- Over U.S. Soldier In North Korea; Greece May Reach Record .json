The Philippines and Taiwan bracing for a super typhoon that has formed in the Pacific. Typhoon Doksuri is headed their way in the next 24 hours with winds around 150 miles an hour. Iran has banned an annual film festival after a promotional poster showed an actress not wearing a head scarf. The minister of culture and Islamic guidance deemed it inappropriate. An official with the U.N. Command says a conversation has commenced with North Korea over the fate of a U.S. Army private, Travis King. King, of course, sprinted across the border between North and South Korea last week while on a civilian tour. That happened the day after he was supposed to be returned to the U.S. while facing military discipline. CNN's Marc Stewart is following this story from Tokyo. Mark, so nice to see you. What more do we know about these allegations and these negotiations now with Pyongyang?",

Good morning.Look, this is complicated because right now, the United States and North Korea have no formal diplomatic relationship, and even though the United States did make an overture to North Korea it has heard nothing back. So, indeed, the United Nations Command, which you mentioned, is having a big role in this discussion. We heard from a top leader there that communication lines are open and that a discussion has begun. But Christine, we still do not know the location of the soldier, his well- being, his health, how he's doing, as well as any possible next steps. This still remains very murky.",

Now, Yates played for the Wildcats from 2015 to 2017 and is the first plaintiff to identify himself in a lawsuit against the school. He says he was sexually assaulted by his teammates as a part of ritual hazing. The lawsuit alleges that the hazing was, quote, \"In an effort to break them, punish them, control them, or get them in line.\" Now, this latest lawsuit comes about a week after longtime head football coach Pat Fitzgerald was fired as a result of this scandal, though an investigation found no credible evidence that Fitzgerald was aware of alleged hazing. The university president said he is still ultimately responsible for the team's culture as the head coach. Fitzgerald has denied any knowledge of the hazing in the program. Now, Yates, meanwhile, spoke to CNN last night about what he calls the school's toxic culture. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, look at the mortgage rates, more than doubled. If you want to take out a loan to buy a car. Look at consumer credit. Look at what businesses have to pay. It usually brings on at least some recession. It hasn't yet and it and you particularly see that in the labor market. I think if we're talking about growth overall of the economy, the data is murky.

What we're seeing is that goods prices -- you know, things like used cars -- came down. Went up a lot and then they came down really fast, and that has flattered the headline Consumer Price Index. But if you look behind that to services, restaurants, hotels, dry cleaners, and things like that, there are still lots of pent-up inflation. The demand is really strong.The labor market is really strong in many places. Usually, when the labor market is this strong and there's that much pent-up demand, you get inflation for a while. I think the Fed expects that. They do not think they have won this battle but they certainly will be patient. I think what markets are thinking is well, if inflation keeps going down they'll start lowering interest rates and stop raising them. I think that's an open question. If the Fed really wants to present sooner they may have to do that. Now, why do they care so much? The thing is, so far, we haven't seen inflation expectations built into interest rates. People have gotten used to low inflation so they're not building it into their price increases, wage increases, interest rates. But if that happens, then it gets harder to get it out of the system. You've got to convince people no, no -- we really did mean two percent. So that's the tightrope the Fed is still walking.",

And that's really the thing that's calming people is that they stood back and let the Federal Reserve take over. If things go south, of course, they may feel differently.I mean, I think a lot of Bidenomics is really addressed at things like trying to prevent climate change. Trying to redistribute income more effectively. But I'm not sure so much there's stimulus. Although I will grant that a lot of money has been coming from Europe -- that they were spending on investment in Europe they're now spending on the -- in the U.S., particularly because of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act.
