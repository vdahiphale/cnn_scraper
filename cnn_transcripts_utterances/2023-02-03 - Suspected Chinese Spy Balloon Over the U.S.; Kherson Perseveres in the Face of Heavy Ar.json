As fighting rages in eastern Ukraine, the president of the European Union is in Ukraine for some of Kyiv's requests for membership in the E.U. is top of the agenda. And who knew that mafia and mozzarella go together? An infamous mob boss on the run is hiding in plain sight as a pizza chef. We are live in Rome for details. I'm Eleni Giokos. Hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. We are live in Dubai. Right now the U.S. and Canada are tracking a suspected Chinese spy balloon as it hovers above the northern U.S. And you can see it here in video filmed in Montana. The Pentagon says the balloon is the size of three buses and is drifting at an altitude above commercial air traffic. According to U.S. Defense officials, it does not pose a threat to anyone on the ground. But they have decided not to shoot it down. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says the balloon is a civilian airship which deviated far from its planned course. CNN's Marc Stewart is joining me now from Hong Kong, and we've got Natasha Bertrand joining us from Washington. Good to see you both. We are watching these spectacular images that are coming through of this balloon. We've just heard from Chinese authorities that it could be a civilian air ship that deviated off its course. Marc, I want to start with you on this. I want you to tell me what the Chinese reaction has been as this balloon is being tracked right now.",

      "sentences": "Indeed, Eleni. It is late in the evening here in Hong Kong. And we are receiving word from Beijing of a slightlydifferent storyline. The Chinese government is claiming that the suspected spy ship, if you will, is actually a weather balloon that veered off course. We have a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that I want to refer to, and in it, it refers to this civilian air ship as something that is used for research mainly meteorological purposes, saying that it was affected by the westerlies and that it deviated far from its planned course. The Chinese side offers regret, calling this a case of forced majeure, the French phrase meaning unforeseen, uncontrollable circumstance. So while this narrative is still being digested globally, the response that we have seen from the United States and China does show the elevated tension between these two nations especially as Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans his first trip to China as secretary of State sometime in the very near future -- Eleni.",

We saw China's response to more military bases in the Philippines, for example, and now we have the big issue of this balloon. There are many briefings underway right now about this as the U.S. government is tracking it. I want you to take me through how this could be viewed as something that could spark even more uneasiness between China and the United States.",

So there was definitely a diplomatic push. I want like to relate this, though, to the upcoming visit of Secretary Blinken. I was talking to an analyst about this. Right now the lines of communication between the U.S. and China are so fractured, it is very difficult to maintain any kind of diplomatic dialogue. One goal of this upcoming visit maybe to establish a process where, if something like this happens, Secretary Blinken can without thought, without question, without hesitation, be able to reach his counterpart in China. That's relationship that we just don't see information right now. And that is perhaps a goal. So if there is an incident like this and there isn't perhaps a nefarious narrative to it, it can be quelled right away. So that's why for many reasons this upcoming visit is so important. This case may stress that.",

It has long held the reputation as one of the most corrupt countries in Europe. And in the last few weeks, as you sad, you know, we've seen the heads of institutions fired. In fact, the entire management team of the customs agency of Ukraine was let go in one fell swoop. We've had investigations into embezzlement, fraud, theft, you name it. Even just today, the police announced that there were charges being laid against the heads of two companies for defrauding the Ministry of Defense out of more than $3 million. So there is a lot of this kind of announcements coming out of Ukraine. But it's really a systemic very deep change that the E.U. is looking for evidence that Ukraine is able to do. And it's made all of the more tough by the fact that they are at war right now. And so President Zelenskyy in his remarks earlier today said Ukraine is completing the recommendations of the European Commission and they expect the commission's assessment to come this spring on their progress. And in the joint statement that just came out, Eleni, the E.U. and Ukraine, you know, made sure to point out in that that they acknowledge the progress that Ukraine has made. But, look, there are countries who are E.U. candidates for a decade or even more without actually joining the club and so nothing happens quickly on this front.",

That's the refugee camp that we're in back in 1948. So the family has been displaced since then. He's grown up there. His children have grown up. His grandchildren are going up there. And that point that he makes that there are more gunmen walking the streets of Jenin these days and inside that refugee camp is a reflection that the situation has become more extreme. More polarized. Israelis live in fear of Palestinians, Palestinians live in fear of Israelis. The polarization is growing greater. And this sense that with a really right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, this could be one of the things that helps make this situation, given the more gunmen as well even more prime to, if you will, sort of go off the rails before you could begin to get into meaningful talks. But because the talks aren't happening, because that process is essentially stalled, this is what raises that level of concern.

The Chinese balloon that has been hovering over the northern U.S. state of Montana, we're just hearing the U.S. secretary of State is postponing his planned trip to China. He was due to meet with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing after years of frayed relations between their two countries. That suspected surveillance balloon, you're seeing it right now on your screen, has been flying over the northern United States for days now. Right now U.S. officials say it poses no threat to anyone on the ground. The Chinese Foreign Ministry claimed Friday that the suspected Chinese high- altitude surveillance balloon flying over the continental United States is a civilian air ship used mainly for weather research that deviated from its planned course. Nevertheless, Antony Blinken is postponing that trip for now. Nic, this is playing out right now in the U.S. We're watching this balloon hovering over parts of the United States.

That there is a need to have this diplomatic reengagement with China. Relations have been on the downward slide for a number of years now. And I think the concept was that Secretary Blinken's visit would help, you know, bridge that growing golf between the United States and the rising superpower, China, and its regional aspirations. We've seen the U.S. secretary of Defense in Indonesia, in the Philippines, recently. We've seen him in South Korea, Japan. A big U.S. diplomatic outreach to firm up its military footing in Asia. And Secretary Blinken's visit to China, and there was rumor that he might have met with President Xi Jinping as well, would have been to try to sort of bring a better diplomatic understanding between the U.S. and China. But this balloon, and the contentious nature of what it's doing, and the concerns it's raised in the U.S., it's not clear if the administration, the White House yet believes what China is saying, that this is -- you know, that this is merely a mistake, and it's not spying on the United States at all, although some U.S. officials, military officials, have said very clearly that this is malfeasance by China. So in light of that, this balloon and the issue around it would wholly detract from a trip that might have been hoped -- that was hoped to at least bring better understanding and essentially would have off tracked those talks.",

But it seems to have paid off. Less than a month since announcing his retirement to the world, he's taken place in this pro-am, which means a professional plays with an amateur. Bale is an amateur in this, but he's a flipping good amateur I think it's fair to say. He surprised a few people. The former world number one Jon Rahm has said it's just unfair that somebody can be quite so good at two sports. He finished 10th out of 156 amateurs after his first round. But the good news for us mere mortals is he did admit despite his experience, despite his five Champions League titles, he was really nervous when he stepped up and hit that ball on the first tee.",
