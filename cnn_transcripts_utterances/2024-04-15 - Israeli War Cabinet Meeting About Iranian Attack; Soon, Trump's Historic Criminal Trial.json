Iran launched more than 300 drones, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles targeting Israel with minimal effect. Still, it was a huge attack. And while the U.S. was among the allies heavily involved in defending Israel, President Biden has made clear the U.S. will not help in any retaliatory strike against Iran.Let's get right to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what are you hearing from inside this meeting?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, I'm told that this war cabinet meeting has now begun, and there has been heated debate among the war cabinet members over the course of the last couple of days since Iran launched this unprecedented strike on Israeli soil about the scope of an Israeli response and the timing.One thing is clear is that Israel's war cabinet is united in the fact that a military response is required to respond to Iran's attack over the weekend. But now it's a question of how soon, how quickly they will respond, and how big that response will actually be. There's no question that Israel's war cabinet members are aware that Israel is enjoying considerable international goodwill at this moment, considerable support from some of its key allies, including, of course, the United States. And so they don't want to squander that goodwill with an over-the-top response. And there's also, of course, concern about sparking a bigger conflict between the two countries. But at the same time, the Israeli prime minister is coming under considerable pressure from his right flank to go with an over-the-top response, to change the paradigm, break all of the dishes, as one Israeli official told me. So, this is really going to be a question of which direction they decide to in. And, ultimately, if they go in the more measured direction, how do they thread the needle? How do they send a message to Iran that takes into account that this was the first Iranian attack on Israeli soil while also avoiding further escalation? That is the topic of this war cabinet meeting that is ongoing right now, and it's unclear how quickly they will actually reach a decision. I'm told that the war cabinet member, Benny Gantz, has been pushing for a quicker response than what we have seen so far. Up until now, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pumping the brakes on an immediate decision. John?",

First, I just want to tell you, we already are seeing supporters and protesters here at the courthouse and court isn't expected to start for another two and a half hours or so. And that's when we expect the former president to arrive. As you said it yourself, he has to be here for court every single day that this trial is in session.So, when it picks up today, jury selection, obviously a key part of this trial before it actually can get started. What we understand is that 500 jurors will be called in today. Now, not all of them are for the Trump trial. There's, of course, other trials happening inside this courthouse today, but 100 at a time will enter Judge Juan Merchan's courtroom and they have any issues with, you know, staying this entire trial, which is expected to last six to eight weeks, they can raise their hands, say it's for childcare or they have something coming up during that time. We're told the judge will immediately dismiss them. But those that are left in that, in that group will have to answer 42 questions. And there's a lot of different questions there that have to pertain, of course, to whether they attended a Trump rally. Do they have any certain affiliations with the Trump -- you know, with Trump or where do they get their news? Have they listened to Michael Cohen's podcast, as he will be a key witness in this trial? So, a number of questions that they have to answer out and that they will be weeded out for based on those answers. Then we also understand that both the prosecution side and Trump's defense have 10 strikes against these jurors. They can raise their hand and dismiss them ten times is the total. So 12 jurors, 6 alternates, that's the focus of getting that starts today. We expect that could happen -- or, I'm sorry, that could last for about a week, maybe even two weeks. So, here we go. It's a start of, as you just said it, a historic trial.",
