      "sentences": "Welcome to The lead. I'm Jake Tapper. This hour, the chaos on Capitol Hill. The Republican House dysfunction continues as the fight for a new speaker of the House continues to sputter after a Republican Representative Jim Jordan failed to get enough votes. The House has recessed at least for the time being.Leading right now, another tragic turn in the war in Israel in Gaza. Hundreds of people have been killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza according to the Palestinian health ministry. These images you're seeing show fires raging with an ambulance feet away inside the hospital. We see images of devastation with this blurred image of a dead body in a hallway. It's the Al-Ahli Baptist hospital in the center of Gaza City, which was reportedly housing hundreds of those already injured by airstrikes. Perhaps many more seeking shelter from those strikes. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank declared three days of mourning for the victims. As of right now, CNN cannot tell you definitively who is responsible for the strike. The Palestinian health ministry controlled by Hamas is saying that Israel was responsible. They're calling it a war crime. Israel is of course bombing the area and Israel's strikes have killed hundreds of civilians without question. But Israel also points out that Hamas has been known to blame its own misfiles -- missile misfires on Israel and the Israeli Defense Forces is saying unequivocally that this is the result of an Islamic Jihad missile misfire. We will bring you the facts of this incident and as soon as they can be established. Another grim number just in to our newsroom, at least 17 journalists have been killed during the Israel Hamas conflict. Seventeen, that's according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. All this on this eve of President Biden's expected visit to Israel, trying to calm any tensions in the region before an expected larger ground invasion by Israeli forces. We're going to start with CNN's Erin Burnett, who is live in Tel Aviv for us. Erin, as President Biden prepares to head to Israel, this would be his second visit to a war zone as president. Horror is unfolding in Gaza. Tell us what Israeli officials are saying about this attack, this hospital tragedy?",

They initially had heard 4,000 people were sheltering there, maybe 1,000 dead then 500 -- 300 to 500 now from the Hamas controlled government. As you point out, Jake, we simply don't know the scale of it. But the IDF says that this barrage of rockets fired from Gaza, that they had identified one, they know where they're coming from, they identified a barrage coming up, right, that's how they get their Iron Dome to calculate in order to intercept and that there was a group of these that passed over the hospital around the time the hospital was hit. And as you point out, and you use the words very specifically, they are actually not blaming Hamas, they're blaming Islamic Jihad, Palestinian Islamic Jihad is another Islamic radical group in Gaza.And that is who they are blaming for this particular horrific strike. They're saying they have intelligence from multiple sources, Jake, that point to that. And they are also saying the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here that the IDF at the time was not conducting operations around that hospital. So, that's what they're saying right now. We'll see as we get more information. But as you and I both know, even if one were to formally ascertain exactly what happened and who was to blame, in the court of global public opinion, it may not matter.",

Source familiar with the Biden administration says the president is likely to give the benefit of the doubt to Israel and who is responsible for this attack.

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, so far, it doesn't appear that the hospital attack is impacting the President's trip, at least not at this stage in the planning. At least one White House official has told CNN that the trip is expected to go ahead as planned, and at least half a dozen officials that are -- that were contacted by CNN's White House team were not responsive or did not know whether there would actually be an official U.S. response to this. Now CNN's Jenny Hansler at the State Department is reporting that that source familiar says that the Biden administration will give the benefit of the doubt to Israeli rationale for that attack over what Hamas is saying here. But certainly it comes at a very precarious time with the Palestinian Authority president canceling his meeting with President Biden and other regional leaders. The two had just spoken by phone three days ago, and talked about the need to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza to get some of these people out of that highly populated region and also to preserve stability in the West Bank and in the region writ large.And so not having a boss in that conversation will certainly dilute what President Biden is able to achieve as part of that. But even so, there are very high stakes and very clear objectives for Biden, as he goes on this very extraordinary wartime trip. You know, there were discussions behind the scenes about securing some sort of humanitarian aid package. That was something that Biden wanted very clearly before he signed off on this trip. And U.S. and Israeli officials wanted to know that the groundwork would be laid for that before any ground invasion into Gaza war to take place. He also wants to try to do what he can to secure the release of American hostages, and to keep this war from spilling over into the region.",

The Israeli government has posted some video on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. I mean, I'm looking at the video here. I don't really know what I'm looking at.

And it is -- as I said, it's a wholly owned Iranian subsidiary. And they are very dangerous. And in the past, they fired rockets into Israel. And as I said, in many cases, in -- 33 percent of the cases, their rockets malfunction and they land in the Gaza Strip. We had a documented case in the previous round of fighting, which I think was in 2022, if I remember correctly, where there was a case where a family was killed in a refugee camp. And of course, they were all saying, oh, terrible Israel. And then once again, it was proved conclusively that this was ordinates from Islamic Jihad that had failed and killed Palestinian civilians. And that's apparently exactly what's happened now. And most importantly, not only Israel knows this, I said for the third time, Hamas knows this too, and is deliberately lying to the international community. But I suppose, Jake, if we consider what Hamas has done over the last few days, yes, that massacres of innocent civilians, we should not be surprised that they have no problem in killing the truth.

He's headed to Joint Base Andrews where he will then aboard Air Force One and the plane will take off and he will depart on his trip to Israel. He is expected to arrive tomorrow.And fusion is of course playing out in Israel in Gaza over the cause of the hospital blast, horrific, hundreds are dead. Just moments ago, you heard a senior aid to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu telling me that the IDF is asserting unequivocally that the blast was not because of Israel, it was the result of a misfire rocket fired by the militant group Islamic Jihad. Let's go now to retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus, also the former director of the CIA. He has a brand new book titled \"Conflict, The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.\" General, always good to have you on. One of the things that struck me about the book, which is an area of expertise, which is something that I hope the Israelis are reading is about urban combat, and the 2004 battle of Fallujah, the largest of the Iraq War, bloody, costly, street by street. And we had General Kimod (ph) here not long ago. And he was saying that what Israel is going to face with the Israeli forces are going to face in Gaza will be probably even more grueling than Fallujah. What do you think? LT. GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, FORMER COMMANDER, U.S. CENTCOM: Oh, it'll be orders of magnitude more difficult. The enemy has had months to prepare the defenses, they'll undoubtedly employee improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers, car bombs, tunnels, a lot of infrastructure that they have, they know the territory very, very well. And it's many times the size of Fallujah. We did a number of urban operations over those years, and more recently, we watched one that might be more appropriate as an analogy, which was the Iraqi Security Forces supported by a U.S. led coalition clearing the Islamic State out of Mosul, a city about the same size as Gaza City. And again, it's very, very challenging fighting in this hospital bombing. And by the way, I'll take the side of the IDF spokesman any day over Hamas, needless to say. They're in a democracy, the truth is going to come out, they know it. And they've done apparently a very good and thorough investigation quite quickly. But in the case of urban combat, you're going to have tremendous damage to civilian infrastructure, you're going to have considerable civilian loss, you're going to take a lot of friendly casualties. You don't just have to clear every building floor or room basement tunnel, you have to leave substantial forces behind, or else the enemy will re infiltrate. You have to do this progressively sequentially. You have to clear and hold, and then continue farther, spread the oil spot. In fact, it really should be thought of as a counterinsurgency operation, not just a conventional military operation, because you're fighting among the people. And because of the importance of not overlooking what happens after Hamas is destroyed. And by the way, the spokesman today said they also intend to dismantle the Hamas political structure, the political wing that's different from the military wing, which is the Hamas terrorists and also the Islamic Jihad terrorists.",

So I think the big subject of discussion, I suspect already between the Israeli generals and the political authorities, is about what comes after. They're going to take enormous casualties to do this. I believe that it's right to destroy Hamas but you can't have that for not.

I think you saw that with our 9/11 response as well, I say the third thing that you learn is the importance of having allies and having a Western alliance.One of the challenges that we see with Hamas, their objective, as I said earlier, it's not just eliminate Israel or Jews. The third part of that tranche that they're looking at is the elimination of Western democracy as we know it today. And so the lessons that you can learn from 9/11 and apply it to today are the lessons that I think I feel coming out of Israel and certainly specifically out of the Prime Minister, as it relates to discipline, refrain from responding immediately. He's taken a couple of days. That's really important, as it sends a message throughout the world that the moral compass is intact in spite of seeing your peoples.
