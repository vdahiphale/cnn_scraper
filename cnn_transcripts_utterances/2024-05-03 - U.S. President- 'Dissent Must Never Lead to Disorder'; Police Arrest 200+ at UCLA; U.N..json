Republicans, though, have condemned his relative silence over the growing encampments. Police have now made arrests on at least 40 college campuses across at least 24 states. Biden acknowledged the right to free speech and peaceful protest, but stressed, \"We are not a lawless country, and order must prevail.\" He added that there is no place in the United States for antisemitism or Islamophobia.

In another words, what -- what happened was it was the vulnerability that -- the attacks that had happened the night before against the protesters that, at least the chancellor of UCLA said was the reason for the police coming in, that essentially, the whole system had -- had broken down. Before that, there were incidents of violence and -- and fears amongst the Jewish population there because of the protesters. But the protesters themselves, at least described by the chancellor, were peaceful. And that's the challenge right now as everyone's looking at different images and saying, well, they weren't really peaceful, or they were peaceful. So the most important thing at the end of this is -- is two-fold. One is, are there outlets for students to protest? I think we've seen a dozen instances now that, when schools tried to completely shut down a certain viewpoint, it only escalates the tensions. The second is if the police come in, they do so in a manner which gives students an ability to walk away. That's what happened at UCLA. About a couple hundred students understood what was going on and didn't want to get arrested. Or arrest them in a fashion that is nonviolent. And I think we are seeing that so far to a certain extent, although we've seen a couple images of police, I think, overuse of force, and those will be examined, I think, across the country.",

But overall, this is -- the peacefulness is sometimes forgotten about a lot of these protests, as well as the ability of some of these colleges and universities to simply de-escalate, or work with, or reach out to these groups. There's a couple dozen examples now of -- of colleges and universities allowing the protests, working with the protesters to listen, giving them a seat at the table. They have -- as I said, these are not outlier issues. And I think this idea by President Trump that you you simply can shut it down is -- is not only a recipe for disaster, but it's very un- American. Student protests is part of -- part of our history, as well. And -- and -- but I think it's a hint of, if he were president again, his relationship with the First Amendment by those who disagree with him. I think -- I think we can anticipate, as many of us have been predicting, if he were president again, the notion of dissent would be met with violence or the threat of violence.

So for example, in the 2014 Gaza war, the estimate was about 1.4 billion initially of the damages. But the actual estimate, which they put before donors was actually three times that. So the first thing to note is that it's going to be way more than what is being actually discussed right now. And then the second issue, which is the more important issue with rebuilding under whether the numbers are simply a good guess is that the numbers really kind of -- they -- they are based on an assumption that Israel actually would allow construction to go on.
