Now we've moved further north to continue assessing the damage which is what officials are going to be doing all day today. So let's take a walk and show you exactly what it looks like here in New Smyrna Beach as part of Volusia County.You can see how the water continues to rise which earlier today, emergency officials had said we -- they were really concerned about high tide and what was coming in in terms of the water here. And let's paint over and show you part of the reason why that's such a concern. The flooding that all of the officials warned about are now being -- is now really starting to add up and I can see it more as expected. Now as you mentioned, Jim, this is an area -- I know we focused a lot on the southwestern part of Florida when Hurricane Ian sort of decimated the state but this is an area that also had quite a bit of flooding. So it was already vulnerable from what happened six weeks ago until Nicole. So, now we have more rain, more water, more winds, wind gusts. I mean just take a look at this tree right above, you can see but this is far from over the wind gusts still coming in as the back end of Nicole makes this way through where we are right now. So as I mentioned, this is Volusia County. The other major concern here especially in Volusia County, coastal erosion. I mean, take a look at some of the images that we have from homes and structures that were deemed unsafe directly correlated to coastal erosion, homes that are just teetering right there on the edge and in danger of going in. So they are dealing with power outages as well across this state before the storm hit. They had 1600 linemen on standby ready to go. But the big portion of the storm right now, what's impacting people where we are right now is the potential power outages, the flooding as well as the coastal erosion.",

CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the news in a blog post, it comes less than a week of course after Twitter drastically reduced its workforce by half.So how could these troubles in the tech arena, potentially signal other concern? Sara Fischer joins us now, she's a Media Reporter with Axios and a CNN Media Analyst. We should point out its Facebook, its Twitter, but we also have Amazon, Lyft, Apple. I have to say parts of this bring me back to, I was a young reporter in San Francisco during dot-com boom, and then the bust and we remember the ripple effect that that had on the economy.

And so when you start to see these mass layoffs, mass cost cutting measures, it should be sending a big signal about where we are in the economy.But, of course, Meta is the latest of a string of tech giants that have announced measures. I don't think we're going to see many other major layoffs announced. However, we don't know where the economy's going.",

And so, there's a lot of sort of finger pointing out there in New York right now, because had things gone differently. Even Republicans are saying that Democrats could have likely kept the House. You saw Elise Stefanik saying that New York is the reason Republicans are going to flip the House and, you know, Democrats agree right now and it's causing a lot of internal turmoil.",

Georgia's Lieutenant Governor Duncan said this morning on CNN this morning, that the Republicans have a window of opportunity here.

I think, you know, a lot of insiders believe -- and I report this in Playbook this morning -- that he will eventually get the speaker's gavel.But because of the thin margin, and the fact that they could only have, say, you know, half a dozen seats more than Democrats, he's going to be really held captive to the far-right wing of his party, to the sort of Trump acolytes who are going to try to lord their votes over his head. There's currently discussion about running a candidate against him for speaker to try to get him to promise to put certain priorities on the floor and put people like these MAGA Republicans on powerful committee posts, to allow them to reinstate certain rules that basically would make sure that McCarthy listens to their every whim. And so even if McCarthy has like a certain agenda that he wants to start with, I mean, he's talked about the border, he's talked about getting rid of this influx of IRS agents that Democrats had put in place to try to crack down on the tax gap. If he wants to focus on that, the problem is, he's going to really be choked around by these members who, because of the slim number of Republicans in this majority, are really going to have an outsized sway over what they do.",

A lot of people as, as we've talked about many times, really don't feel safe right now.And Democrats never really had a good response to that. I think that's definitely a huge issue, and what we saw in Democrats losing a lot of those New York House seats.
