Interestingly, the Foreign Ministry spokesman was asked about the difference between TikTok being banned in the U.S. versus almost all of the American and Western social platforms being banned here in China for a long time. And he insisted this is a totally separate issue, because he claims as long as these American companies are willing to comply with Chinese laws, they're welcome to have a presence here. And of course, these laws, though, ironically, are the very laws that worries and concerns American politicians and officials, because they say under the leadership of strongman leader Xi Jinping, China has been passing these increasingly sweeping national security legislature that has given broad powers to its security apparatus to obtain, seize, or inspect any data from companies operating here in this country -- Paula.",

And then, of course, for the first time, they now have TikTok, a China-owned, China-developed platform to let them do so. So it's very difficult to see how they are going to give that up.

CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Meantime, an aid ship carrying 200 tons of desperately needed food is moving closer to Gaza, with an arrival expected on Thursday night. The World Central Kitchen says a temporary jetty being built ahead of the vessel's arrival is now almost 60 meters long and will be used for the ship to dock and to transport pallets of food. This will mark the first maritime shipment of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Assistance is also arriving from the air. The U.S. military conducted a ninth airdrop of humanitarian aid into northern Gaza Wednesday. And now Germany says it will begin its own airdrops possibly by week's end. This coming amid international calls for Israel to open additional land crossings so more aid can reach Gaza, especially in the north where fears of famine are growing. Now that sentiment was echoed by the EU's top diplomat in Washington as he thanked U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken for his personal efforts to get aid into Gaza.

Now we heard that just 24 hours ago, just over that, there was a food, a World Food Program, six aid trucks with them that was able to get through to northern Gaza.And it went through a pilot program, we understand, the Israeli military saying that they could open part of the security fence between Gaza and Israel and they were able to get the food and goods into northern Gaza that way, which is really key. It is exactly what many countries have been asking for, including the U.S. President Joe Biden, pushing for more land crossings to be opened by Israel. There are two at the bottom of Israel, at the southern parts, and the restrictions are significant going into Gaza through those land crossings. So there has been a push for more access. Now, as you mentioned, there's also access coming from the air and from the sea, showing the desperation trying to get food in and showing the frustrations of many countries wanting to donate food and seeing parts of northern Gaza on the brink of famine. The airdrops, for example, have been -- it's been widely reported by many aid groups, by the U.N., that they are insufficient, that they are not the most economical or safe way to be able to get aid to northern Gaza, certainly considering you don't know what happens to it once it hits the ground. But also this first potential maritime corridor opening up.
