On Friday, the Supreme Court issued a one sentence judgment bluntly rejecting Special Counsel Jack Smith's request to fast track arguments on the former president's immunity case. Now both sides get the option of appealing and eventual ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Something Trump is already praising on social media.

      "sentences": "Danny, Amara, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request by federal prosecutors to skip the appellate court and have the high court decide whether Donald Trump has immunity from prosecution in the election subversion charges. The decision deals a significant blow to Special Counsel Jack Smith's effort to keep a march for rack. It's a lot harder now that prosecutors will have to wait several weeks while the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals weighs the same consequential questions. Now, Trump is arguing that he has immunity for actions that he took while in office to pursue his claims of election fraud. He also claims that because he was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate, prosecuting him would violate the Constitution's double jeopardy clause.Trump's attorneys urged the Supreme Court to stay out of the dispute for now, saying that the special counsel was, \"trying to rush to decide the issues with reckless abandon\". The Justice Department had argued that the fact that this case deals with an unprecedented criminal trial of a former president required taking the unusual step of bypassing the appeals court. The special counsel said the public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors and immediate definitive decision by this court. Now the one sentence rejection by the Supreme Court on Friday didn't come with any additional explanation. There's no notice of dissent among the justices. But Trump's claim of immunity could make its way back to the High Court in the thick of the political calendar. The D.C. based appeals court has scheduled or oral arguments on the immunity question for January 9. And that is just days before the Iowa caucus on January 15. Danny, Amara.",

So Jack Smith in a filing, on Thursday, he reiterated his request for the court to immediately decide on presidential immunity. And in the filing, in part it reads, \"The public interest in a prompt resolution of this case favors and immediate definitive decision by this court. The charges here are of the utmost gravity. Here, the stakes are at least high, if not higher. The resolution of the question presented is pivotal -- pivotal to whether the former president himself will stand trial, which is scheduled to begin less than three months in the future.\"Trump's attorneys have filed an appeal saying, \"This in part, importance does not automatically necessitate speed. If anything, the opposite is usually true. Novel, complex, sensitive and historic issues such as the existence of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts call for more careful deliberation, not less.\" Why do you think the Supreme Court declined to take up this case?",

So knowing that January 9 is right around the corner for the circuit court out of D.C., which is that mid-level of the Appellate Court, the Supreme Court could have said, Hey, this is moving fairly quickly anyway. And it's going to come to us. And it'll come to us potentially in a couple of months, as opposed to months and months and months or next year. So there could be a timing issue.And then number two, you know, the Supreme Court also could have said, I understand Jack Smith, but you did not advocate and set forth enough why this should be expedited to that degree? Yes, we do do it recently did it with affirmative action years ago with the Watergate Nixon and even Nazi saboteurs coming out of World War II.

So first off, I mean, that the Supreme Court will likely take up -- take up this case at some point on whether or not Trump will be immune from prosecution. But the other cases on whether or not he will be eligible to run and as you saw this week, this unprecedented ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that basically removed President Trump from -- excuse me, former President Trump from being on the ballot in that state that will, of course have this Supreme Court. But I want to show you a graphic of other 14th amendment lawsuits thatare being -- that are playing out. In Minnesota, Michigan, in New Hampshire, those lawsuits have been rejected. Also, in Arizona appeals are underway in those states, a similar case was recently fired and filed in Oregon, which is also pending. How do you expect all these cases to play out?",

There's been some substantive issues. So for example, is there standing is it right? There's been issues about what officer at office means. You know, the Supreme Court has to really make an affirmative and straightforward response and give an answer, because otherwise, all these cases are going to percolate and go through the system and go through the process. And we could have Arizona and Michigan for example, saying one thing, and Colorado saying another thing in defining certain terms in different ways and -- and having different reasons. So I'd expect that the Supreme Court is going to give it hopefully, a not just a kicking the can down the road and giving it another procedural answer, but saying this is the definition of Officer. This is whether or not you have to wait for Congress to make a determination.So I think that -- that Supreme Court is going to give an answer that's going to then inform all of the state level courts the courts to make this decision because as of now, I think these other cases are going to end up not going anywhere and there's going to be a lot of constant appeals and -- and moving throughout the process throughout the nation.",

We're right next to the U.S. border with Mexico behind me you can see a holding area where Border Patrol agents take immigrants once they surrendered to authorities so that they can wait there before being processed. And this is happening only hours after Customs and Border Protection released the latest on the number of apprehensions here at the U.S. southern border. During the month of November, the U.S. Border Patrol recorded a totalof 191,113 of what they call encounters with immigrants, meaning either apprehensions or people who turn themselves in that compares to 189,000 or 4,000 more than the month of October. But these are only people who cross the border at sites other than a point of entry. If we add everybody else the figure is close to a quarter of a million and releasing the latest figures to top immigration official recognize that they're facing a serious challenge along the U.S. border. He also said that CBP and other federal agencies need more resources from Congress, turning out the border and the country as a whole. And the reality is that the impacted communities like Eagle Pass is brutal. This is in 30,000 people. Local officials say they're having to deal with this crisis with little or no help from the federal government.

And we have seen that ground offensive, deepening further south was as well we've seen a focus on Khan Yunis, the largest city in southern Gaza. And it is important to underscore here that we are talking about some 1.9 million Palestinians who are displaced across the Gaza Strip, many of them concentrated in that small portion of land in southern Gaza. And we've seen the images of those huge, enormous tent cities that have been established in order to house those that have been displaced.The UN has described the circumstances there as unlivable, particularly as winter looms, and as temperatures continue to drop across Gaza. And of course, this has raised concern. The Israeli military has said it will expand its operation focusing on Southern Gaza no clear details as to where exactly and when it comes to where they want Palestinians to then move to in order to avoid being caught up in the targeting.

Person familiar with the matter tells CNN that billionaire Len Blavatnik has suspended donations to Harvard in the wake of President Claudine Gay's disastrous testimony before Congress. The source says that Blavatnik, who is a master fortune that Forbes values at $32 billion, he's holding back donations until the university addresses anti-Semitism on campus. Now, he joins a growing list of frustrated Harvard donors, hitting the Ivy League school where it hurts the most. Now, Blavatnik who was born in Ukraine and raised in Russia, has been a prolific backer of Harvard. His family foundation donating at least $270 million to the school over the years. Now, a source says that Blavatnik hasn't made specific demands to Harvard, but he wants the university to make sure that Jewish students are protected the same way that other students are. Now, this comes as Harvard President Claudine Gay remains mired in a plagiarism controversy. Harvard announced that Gay will request additional corrections to her writings, this time to her 1997 PHD dissertation due to what the school described as inadequate citation. Now, this is clearly an embarrassing setback for Gay, and it comes just a week after she issued corrections to two of her scholarly writings in the 2000s. Harvard called these instances, quote, \"regrettable\". But university officials have determined that this does not constitute research misconduct, which is something that would be subject to punishment. Matters of plagiarism can be quite complex, and experts that CNN spoke to were split on how or even whether Gay should be punished. But none of them called for her to be fired. And they noted it's quite rare for academics to be fired for plagiarism or for students to be expelled for it for that matter. Now, according to a person who's familiar with the matter, just before announcing plans to issue these latest corrections, Gay held a virtual town hall meeting with hundreds of faculty members. Now, the source says that about a dozen Harvard faculty members spoke during this event, and all of them were supportive. The plagiarism controversy, that did not come up. Back to you.",

FSU claiming that the ACC's long-term TV media deal is grossly undervalued and that it puts the school at a disadvantage compared to rivals in the SEC and the Big 10.
