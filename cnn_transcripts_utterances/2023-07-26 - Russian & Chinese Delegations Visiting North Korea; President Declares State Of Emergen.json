ELINDA LABROPOULOU, CNN REPORTERSo, it's -- we're optimistic but on the cautious side. Right behind me is the island of Evia where the firefighter cert plane crashed yesterday. But you can see that the atmosphere is very hazy, you can maybe see a little bit of the smoke in the background as well. Of course, part of the haze is also to do with the very, very hot temperatures that we're experiencing right now. Today's expected it to be the hottest day of the year so far with temperatures reaching 46 degrees Celsius. So, about 115 Fahrenheit in parts of the country, including Athens as well. This means the country is on high alert for fires. However, the good news is that we have been hearing that we're reaching the end of this heatwave as of tomorrow, temperatures are expected to drop substantially. And this is likely to obviously help firefighting operations as well. All the same now the questions that have started entering the agenda after the initial shock, the initial panic of just trying to get people out. I mean, the authorities have luckily managed to get everyone out. And this has been a massive operation a huge evacuation of over 20,000 people just from the island of Rhodes alone. But now, you know, this is a peak tourist season. It's -- these islands are normally have hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, and now likely to remain empty for at least the weeks ahead. So the question is what is the future of tourism in this new normal, that's now developing as a result of climate change, Rosemary.",

The Ukrainian military has been trying to encircle the city but acknowledges the situation is more difficult north of Bakhmut.They have also made further gains on cities along the southern battlefront.

Analysts from the US Defense Intelligence Agency say Tehran is aiding in the construction of a new drone manufacturing facility near 1000 -- nearly 1000 kilometers east of Moscow. Iran, for its part denies providing drones for Russia during the war. Well, U.S. officials tell CNN they are concerned about negotiations with Moscow to free two detained Americans after revelations a previously released former Marine was fighting against Russia in Ukraine.

All we know that he has now been treating -- being treated at an American military hospital in Germany near the Ramstein Air Base. So, I think perhaps you can read into that, that it may be relatively severe if he had to be moved to Germany, but we just don't know at this point.And obviously, this comes just 15 months after he was freed. And that prisoner swap in April 2020 to the second month of the war in Ukraine, amid concerns from his family that his health was deteriorating. Since then, you know, he's been pretty active, pretty out there on social media, on television, talking about his experiences, the inhumane conditions that he was subjected to and advocating for the release of the Americans who are still detained in Russia. And obviously, that is where the focus shifts given this news. Paul Whelan, who has already spent more than four years in Russian detention on espionage charges. Now Evan Gershkovich who was detained in March could be facing up to 20 years on charges there. The concern and certainly this was voiced by one U.S. official to CNN is that it could complicate the negotiation process. We know that efforts are already underway to get both of those men freed, perhaps in a prisoner swap that Russia may now try to exact a higher price, may try to slow the negotiations. Efficiently U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken saying that it shouldn't affect things. Other officials saying that it should be viewed separately, but there is definitely a concern there. And of course, we're looking very closely to see how Russia is going to spin this. There hasn't been a lot of coverage yet, but they may also use this, Rosemary to try to sort of reinforce the rhetoric that the U.S. and NATO are playing an outsized role in this conflict in Ukraine.",

And was not -- and has not been seen since he has missed key meetings with the E.U. with leaders of the ASEAN, the Southeast Asian Nations.As well as Secretary -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen from the United States, John Kerry. And so, then this mystery has really prevailed. Where is he and why is he out of public view? It's something that the government clearly does not want to talk about. It came up yesterday during the briefing from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, even before his departure was announced. And the line that was given then was pretty simple, no information to provide, adding if the government was moving as usual, but then later that same day, we received word that Qin Gang indeed had been replaced by Wang Yi. So, what does this mean for global relations? What does this mean for the global outlook? Well, we did hear from a number of world leaders including the United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He acknowledged. This is China's prerogative to make any kind of changes in its leadership roster as it wants. He did express a strong working relationship with Qin Gang but also expressed some optimism about Wang Yi in the sense that they have worked together and, Rosemary, he feels at this point, the discussions that we have seen recently would likely continue into the future concerning the United States and China.
