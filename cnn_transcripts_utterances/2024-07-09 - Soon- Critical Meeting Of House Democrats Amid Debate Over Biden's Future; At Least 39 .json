So far, Jeffries has been sticking with Biden.CNN senior reporter Isaac Dovere joins us live now from Washington. You know, Jeffries plays a very big role in leadership. This is an important person who -- could he change things if he -- if he starts to change his mind as to who he's behind? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  He absolutely could. Look, Hakeem Jeffries is a figure that not a lot of people have gotten to know yet on the national stage, but he is beloved by his members -- the Democratic members in the House. They are looking to him to set the tone of where this goes. Obviously, a lot of divisions about what to do here. Some people saying stick with Biden. Some people saying get rid of him. Some people saying whatever we do let's just move on here. And they are looking for Jeffries to, from my reporting, either be the barricade against the revolution that is coming against Biden or to be the one to say to Biden essentially, these people who represent Democrats all across the country are saying there is not enough support for you. It's time to move on. And they believe that Jeffries could be that force. He has been playing it very close to the vest. He caught up with us a little bit yesterday. Let's just take a listen to what he had to say himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
