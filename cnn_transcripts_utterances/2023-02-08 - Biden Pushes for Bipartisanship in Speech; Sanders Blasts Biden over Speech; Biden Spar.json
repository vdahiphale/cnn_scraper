This was precisely the kind of contrast that they hoped to draw between Republicans and the president, sort of painting Republicans as being intransigent and engaging in partisan bickering, whereas the president, they wanted to come off as the adult in the room who was optimistic about the future.And, of course, all throughout the night we had this reminder, sitting behind the president in the form of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, of the divided Congress that the president now confronts. At moments McCarthy looked stoic as Democrats were cheering on the president. Other times we, of course, saw him trying to shush his colleagues. Obviously warnings that they didn't often heed. But the president really sort of tried to turn the page on the last two years of his presidency. He talked about the country turning a corner when it comes to the economy or the Covid pandemic, talking about his legislative accomplishments. And if you look at the amount of time that he spent talking about the various issues, you really get a good sense of what some of his top priorities were. Some of the issues that he talked about the most included health care, the economy and infrastructure and policing. And really the president wanted to send a political message to the members of Congress in front of him that just because Congress is divided now for the next two years doesn't mean that Democrats and Republicans can't continue to work together. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And it was an opportunity for Republicans and Republican leadership to really present a very different picture. That's pretty typical. What is less typical that we saw last night was a lot of the yelling from rank and file House GOP members, a handful of hardliners that were yelling, calling the president a liar, as you saw in those clips just a couple of minutes ago. And we even saw the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy shushing them at some points. We know that earlier in the day he had warned them to kind of be on their best behavior, that there were cameras everywhere. And he later said just this morning he doesn't want them to take the bait.

That is something that the House speaker has said will not be included in these cuts. But, again, it was really a unique moment watching that really play out, the back and forth, the president back and forth with the House GOP members who were yelling at him. And it's also worth noting that several years ago -- it just shows how far the decorum has eroded here. Several years ago, when Republican Joe Wilson called then President Obama a liar, you'll remember he was rebuked by the House for that. At this point, it was unexpected. We don't see that a lot.

We won't shout at each other, I promise that. I wonder, S.E. Cupp, you're a conservative. You and I and us together have watched a lot of State of the Union speeches, good moments and bad. That was a bad moment. It was -- it was just ugly, right? And, again, as Jessica said, some of this is just the nature of the way our political discourse is today. But there's a lot of shouting going at a sitting president that even the Republican speaker was uncomfortable with. Was it a good political look for Republicans? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think it was inside their base, right? I mean, I think this Republican Party, especially under Trump, really conditioned voters to want a politics of revenge where they are yelling out and breaking with the traditional rules. So, don't be surprised, Kevin McCarthy, when you invite disrupters into Congress that you get disruption. I thought his shushing of his own conference to be remarkable, both because I didn't expect it from him, he hasn't done much to discipline those rowdier members of the House. In fact, he's elevated them. But also because it's so symbolic, right, of his long journey ahead, maybe short journey ahead, as speaker, having to deal with this unruly faction inside his own house, a faction that might indeed get in the way of an agenda he has that by his own admission includes working with president Biden.",

They're now going to train Ukrainian fighter pilots on -- to use NATO standard aircraft for the future. No commitment on the aircraft. So, that's something that steps in the direction of what President Zelenskyy wants.But I think also he's trying to, if you will, future-proof the support, to thank for the support that he's had in the past and future-proof it by coming here and thanking people personally, thanking politicians on both sides of the aisle. It's been exceptional from the get-go. I have to say, the prime minister driving an hour outside of London to meet President Zelenskyy off his military aircraft when he landed, but then spending that hour talking as they drove in. I was outside 10 Downing Street when President Zelenskyy walked in. I stood outside there when a lot of leaders, U.S. presidents as well, have walked in the building. There was a thunderous applause from all those inside Downing Street as he walked in, thunderous applause when he spoke to all the parliamentarians here today. And I think he kind of hit this speech -- the tone of the speech as always with President Zelenskyy,, fine-tuned to the audience. But there were a couple of moments that stood out, evoking Winston Churchill, thanking Boris Johnson, the former prime minister there in the audience. But he said, in the U.K., your king is an air force pilot. In the Ukraine, our air force pilots are the king, he said, because there are so few of them and they do such a heroic job. And then he gave an air force fighter pilot's helmet to the parliamentary speaker here. And emblazed on it were the words of \"we have the freedom, give us the wings two protect it.\" Very powerful speech, very emotional, reaching to the core of sort of British identity.
