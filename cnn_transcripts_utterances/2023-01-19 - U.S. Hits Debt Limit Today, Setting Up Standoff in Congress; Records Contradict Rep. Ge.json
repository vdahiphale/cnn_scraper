If Congress does not raise that limit, the country risks default, which would have almost unmanageable consequences. Now, the Treasury Department is taking what are called extraordinary measures to push that date back a bit but they can't do it forever. This morning CNN has also learned that President Biden still plans to announce he is running for re-election. He does plan to announce that bid after the state of union address next month. Those are the plans that are in place. There are new details this morning about how the special counsel investigation into classified documents at his home and office may have impacted that timing.",

And that is because the Treasury Department has said they are going to use extraordinary measures to make sure that the U.S. doesn't actually hit that debt limit in terms of defaulting on the debt until likely more close to June. So, that is something to keep in mind here.The issue right now is that both sides are really retreating to their talking points. You have the White House saying that they are not going to negotiate on lowering spending as part of this discussion, that the U.S. has already spent this money, and this is simply just paying the bills that the U.S. has already committed that they were going to pay. So, that is where the White House stands today. Meanwhile, you have conservatives in the house arguing that they want to make sure that there are spending cuts if any discussion in this debt ceiling debate, and that is really something that is going to be important to watch, because McCarthy, as part of his bid to become the speaker, he promised them that he was not going to put a clean debt ceiling bill on the floor of the House of Representatives. So, right now, it is really not clear what the path forward is going to be and it is probably going to take weeks or even months for these discussions to really heat up. Meanwhile, you have Democratic leadership in the Senate saying they want to move quickly on this, that they want to try to advance a clean debt ceiling bill as soon as possible.

He has repeatedly said that his mother was in the south tower of the World Trade Center on 9/11. That led, he says, to her death later in 2016.Now, this newly obtained immigration records by CNN shows that his mother was actually in Brazil between the years 1999 and 2003, of course, during when 9/11 happened. And two finer points that are notable here, while she was in Brazil in 2003, his mother indicated in a forum that she had not been to the U.S. since 1999. Also on the forum, she filed paperwork in 2001, just months before September 11th, that her green card had been stolen in Brazil. So, that is notable there.

So, Francesca, let's start with you, and regarding Santos, still the majority of Republicans are either trying to avoid questions pertaining to whether he should resign or not or saying let the investigations continue before they make up their minds. But there are some Republicans, maybe not in the House, but you have New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu telling USA Today that he thinks Kevin McCarthy should call for George Santos' resignation, and he said, I can't wait to see what is on his resume says next week. I mean, the guy is just a joke at this point. Do you think this will resonate perhaps with other Republicans who may follow suit?",

And the impact of those lies, as we saw with that emotional interview this morning with the veteran, that is coming out and prompting more questions about Republican leadership action. But as long as Kevin McCarthy has the narrowest of majorities in the House and needs George Santos' vote, I don't think you can expect to see much action.You can see the agitation from New York Republicans clearly saying he is not fit to serve, that he should go. That tells me that they are hearing from their constituents about perhaps how embarrassing this is for their community, but that doesn't seem to be translating up to the leadership right now. Clearly, as you pointed out, he does have committee assignments. The leadership has indicated that they will let these ongoing investigations play out. And as long as those investigations play out, whether it is a New York state, or a potential federal investigations, leadership could point to those and kind of deflect questions about Santos' standing in Congress. We know that if there is a special election in that district, that is actually a Biden district. That is a seat that Republicans don't want to lose.",

It is interesting because you have the White House insisting that they're not going to budge on negotiations and you have a lot of the same actors, including the president, who was then vice president in 2011, the last time we came close to a real catastrophe and in the end of the day, President Obama did end up negotiating a bit to come to a resolution.

And to your point, at some point, there are questions about what it is that President Biden could do to step in on this matter. Now, the White House says that there are not currently any meetings set with leadership on Capitol Hill to discuss this but that doesn't necessarily rule out in the future that the president could call them to the White House either.",

They get along despite the forces in their parties. And they know how to make a deal. I think there was one great anecdote back from 2012 when we were on the verge of another fiscal crisis, where Mitch McConnell literally calls Joe Biden's office and says, does anyone down there want to make a deal? And I think with Kevin McCarthy's conference being what it is, pushing him to a lot of these hard line demands and maybe a Speaker McCarthy who can't get his ranks together, the White House is really looking -- going to be looking towards Mitch McConnell to see whether he can get something done.",

We want to show everyone. It looks -- you see a lot of forensic information here that they are exploring. There are cuttings. There are blood stains, right, the dark red cuttings, the part of a mattress, several hair strands, to see if that apartment has any evidence of those victims in that apartment right there, nitrate-type black gloves, store receipts, Dickies tag, which is a work wear clothing company. Now, let's look at what they wanted to find. This is what they asked for. They asked about things such as the clothing, such as the knife. They asked for things such as any drawings or indications of planning on that part. They did take, which is interesting, a computer tower, right? But I think it is fascinating to look at what they didn't take. Because, remember, this was committed on November 13th. This search was executed December 30th. That is about seven weeks later. So, as he was being arrested in Pennsylvania, the search a few hours later was going on. They didn't get clothing. They didn't get a mask. They didn't get a shoe with that diamond print. Remember, they found the shoe print with diamond -- like a Vans shoe. So, many things they didn't get, but, forensically, things that could be extremely important.

Is it his blood or if it tracks to any one of the four victims, that is going to be very damning evidence.But even if it's just his blood, why is he bleeding in his bed? There has been conjecture that he must have cut himself during the attack. So, they would have by now photographed his hands and looked for any scars. Even if it is his blood, it is interesting. But to me, the most important thing is that they believe, yet to be confirmed, that they found one animal hair. If that animal hair goes back and tracks and is consistent with the animal hair of Kaylee's dog, that again would be very damning. The computer tower, they're going to do a deep dive and find out if he were cyber stalking any of these victims, if he was on their social media, that, I think, the digital footprint is always really compelling. But one final thing, that Dickies tag, I'm going to predict that it goes back to a balaclava, the face mask that roommate D.M. said she saw him wearing. If it goes back to black technical gear, a kind of the black outfit, including the face mask, he had receipts from local clothing stores, I think that is going to really -- it is just going to triangulate.
