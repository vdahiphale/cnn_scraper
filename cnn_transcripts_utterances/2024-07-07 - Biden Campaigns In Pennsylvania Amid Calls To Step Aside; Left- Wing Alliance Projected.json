I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin this hour in Pennsylvania, where President Biden is fighting to save his reelection effort in the state where he was born. Today, he's making two campaign stops in the battleground state as he tries to stave off growing calls to drop out of the race. Right now Biden is holding a campaign event right there in Harrisburg. Biden's stepped up campaign push comes after his Friday interview with ABC News did little to calm the nerves of some members of his own party. This afternoon, the top Democrat in the House, Hakeem Jeffries, held a meeting with senior Democrats to talk about the president's future. And in the Senate, Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the chair of the Intelligence Committee, plans to gather senators tomorrow to discuss Biden's reelection bid. We have a team of correspondents covering today's developments. Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House and Danny Freeman is at that Biden campaign event in Harrisburg. Let's begin with you, Danny. What's he doing and how receptive are the supporters there?",

You can see behind me, you can see on the pool camera, I believe, he's doing what the campaign wants him to be doing. He's being Retail Joe. He's out there shaking hands.This is a fairly informal campaign event. He stopped at this union hall where we are. He made a few remarks, only spoke for about seven minutes or so, and then he gave the mic over to other surrogates who also came to this rally with him. Senator John Fetterman, Representative Madeline Dean from southeast Pennsylvania, and then of course lieutenant governor as well of the state. And the whole message was, A, yes, I'm a pro-union president. We've heard him say that before, but the real practical purpose was to really reassure voters here and supporters here that he's still in this race and also tried to rally these folks up. And we saw that not only just a few moments ago here in Harrisburg but also earlier today in Philadelphia, where he spoke directly to campaign workers at a campaign office. Take a listen to what he said to try and energize his core supporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

When the president arrived in Harrisburg, reporters asked him on the tarmac if the Democratic Party is behind him, and he forcefully responded yes. And we are seeing a bit of a shift in strategy here. While the president is on the campaign trail, he's seeking more of those unscripted, candid moments with voters and supporters. And that is something that his allies had requested in the days following his performance on the debate stage. Now, of course this morning the president also spoke with church goersin Pennsylvania and then, too, at a campaign event in Philadelphia, where one supporter said, we need Dark Brandon in reference to that meme, and he said, quote, \"Dark Brandon is coming back.\" That really captures where the president is at in all of this as he tries to show sort of that energized self on the campaign trail. But it hasn't yet put questions to rest as his campaign and his allies are trying to do. In fact, this morning we heard from Senator Chris Murphy, who said he still wants to see more. He thinks voters do, too. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Voters do have questions and personally I love Joe Biden. I don't know that the interview on Friday night did enough to answer those questions. And so I think this week is going to be absolutely critical. I think the president needs to do more.

Whose policies have and will benefit the vast majority of the people in this country? Who has the guts to take on corporate America, who is talking about expanding Medicare so we cover dental, hearing and vision? Who's talking about raising the cap on the taxes that people pay into Social Security so we can raise Social Security benefits and extend the life of Social Security for 75 years? Who's talking about a permanent child tax credit to cut childhood poverty in America by 50 percent? Those are the issues he's talked about. He's got to bring them up in the floor.

But behind the scenes, those conversations have divided the party much more than just those handful of people. You know, what you heard Senator Sanders there talking about is the idea that many Democrats share that they want to get back on the offensive and be going after Donald Trump's record and be showing a contrast between the Democratic Party and Donald Trump's plans, and that they can't do that while they're talking about Biden and is Biden, you know, too old and should someone replace him? And if so, who should that be? But the breakdown internally among these Democrats is that some say the best way to get back to talking about the policy and that contrast is to circle around President Biden and move forward, and then there are the others who say if President Biden remains in the race between now and November, the rest of the conversation is going to be about President Biden. So I think that's the strategic division inside the party. And while everyone has been away, it has been sort of boiling beneath the surface.

I mean, one of the things that happened I think it's important to stress is that between the two rounds in about 200 constituencies, there are 500 and the National Assembly. In 200 constituencies, there was a kind of tactical arrangement that went on between the center.That's Macron's bloc and the left-wing alliance to try to block the far-right. And what they did is they stood down, if they had a third- place candidate, they stood the down each of them in a way that it would avoid splitting that vote. And so in a run-off, you often had three candidates qualify. One stand down, in the end, one take on the far-right, and that is what seems to have made such a difference. Because ultimately what this vote shows is that there is not a majority in France in favor of the far-right. There's a majority against it. And that has come through in this second round. So, although we're facing huge uncertainty now about what the next government will look like, we do know that it will not be a far-right government.",

So it can't govern by itself unless it risks having a no confidence motion tabled against it and falling almost as soon as it's been constituted. This means it's got to seek partners. It needs to form a coalition. And the only coalition partners that it recently looked to are Macron centrists.But again, those are blocs that just really have very little in common. They don't trust each other. They don't like each other. And I think you're going to find an incredibly difficult series of weeks possibly longer of discussions trying to form a government. So we're not even at the level of policy and they policy will get in the way of forming those coalitions because if you look at the left-wing alliance, it's planned the minimum wage, to cap energy prices, to bring about the wealth tax, or a lot of things that Macron centrist will not like. And so although the best hope for the president is that some kind of a collision can be formed, it's not at all obvious how that's going to go come about.",

This could be one option to bring a bit of stability to reassure people that the same team in place, at least in a very technical capacity.It would just be literally signing the checks and keeping government ticking over, and not taking any big decisions.

We're in Port Lavaca, and we are overlooking the Bay of Port Lavaca.And this is -- this area is preparing itself for this oncoming tropical storm. And we know that it's got a dubious track record considering that it's already impacted several different countries made two different landfalls about to make a third landfall. And we know that its track history and its track record has been deadly as well. There are some positives working in our favor and that is the fact that is running out of time before it makes landfall. So it takes away the opportunity to strengthen significantly before so. And it's likely to make landfall around low tide as well, so that could help minimize some of his storm surge impacts and also the fact that this will be a quick moving system. So that will limit the potential of extremely heavy rainfall, although flash flooding is still a threat. So let's talk about the potential impacts tier across the central Texas coastline. Still a tropical storm, Beryl, what I'm noticing about this satellite imagery is that there is a distinctive eye, so it has closed off with that thunderstorm convection around the center, and it's tapping into the warm Gulf of Mexico waters which are three degrees Fahrenheit above average for this time of year. Now, look at the forecast cone, this is the official path from the National Hurricane Center. And this does not explicitly say a category two, although there are 12 hours separating that 7:00 p.m. a.m., and 7:00 a.m. forecast cone time frame. So the potential here for this to intensify to a cat-2 before making landfall, even though its not explicitly shown on our graphing thanks is definitely a possibility. So the wind threat will be greatest from west of I-10 and south of I-4 or -- excuse me, west of I-45 and south of I-10. That is just west of Houston. And, of course, the storm surge component here, four to six feet where the storm makes landfall, there could be, of course, tornadoes in the vicinity of the right quadrant of this storm, which is common during these types of landfalling tropical systems. But again, low tide will help minimize the greatest storm surge threat. And, of course, the flash flooding. We have the potential for five to ten inches of rain locally higher up to 15 inches. That's over a foot of rainfall. But this story form is different than previous storms. Listen to help people are preparing.

Now, we've reached out to the state department to see if it had any more information on this citizen. Nothing more on that for now, and obviously, were continuing to keep in touch with the hospital to ensure that we know if there's any change to the American citizens situation -- Fredricka.",

And we know that Bill Burns, CIA director, is heading to Doha this week. He'll be meeting with his counterparts from Egypt and Israel, also the Qatari Prime Minister as well, to try to progress further on these talks.Now, one of the main reasons for the optimism is Hamas's response, which took his time in coming, but from what? Hamas senior official telling CNN that it may be willing to no longer insist that there be a full cessation of hostilities, right up front before going into the first phase of the ceasefire. And that was a big red line for Israel. In fact, Prime Minister Netanyahu, his office putting out a statement on Sunday reiterating that that was one of his red lines adding three other red lines saying that there must also be no smuggling from Egypt to Hamas over the border into Gaza, saying that there should be no return of armed terrorists to the northern part of the Gaza Strip and saying that Israel will maximize the number of living hostages released by Hamas. Now it's barely there are still 116 hostages, about a third of whom believed to be dead, still being held in Gaza. And that is a statement from Netanyahu. And there are protests again, on Sunday, nine months on from when those hostages were abducted and taken to Gaza -- Fredricka.",
