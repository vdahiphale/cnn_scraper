And, a cousin remembers the tragic death and legacy of the civil rights martyr Emmett Till. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Afghanistan was facing a humanitarian crisis even before winter set in. But now the country is enduring its coldest weather in 15 years, freezing temperatures have killed well over 100 people. And as always, the crisis is hitting women and children the hardest, particularly after the Taliban prohibited women from working for aid organizations, effectively denying them critical assistance. So, in the past weeks, multiple delegations from the United Nations and other aid groups have traveled to Kabul to press for women's basic rights to work and to learn. I have been speaking with two of the United Nations most senior officials, who have just returned from a tough assignment trying to get the Taliban to change its mind. Amina Mohammed is deputy secretary-general of the U.N., and Sima Bahous is the executive director of U.N. Women. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's a clip from the trailer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL FRANK, AUTHOR, \"ONE HUNDRED SATURDAYS\":  One Saturday afternoon, seven years ago, I went to speak to a 92-year-old woman about her childhood and youth on the Island of Rhodes, where she grew up in a storage, Sephardic Jewish community. That until 1944, when the entire community was deported to Auschwitz, had lived on the island in relative peace for nearly half a millennia. Her name was Stella Levi, and I had no idea that this would turn out to be the first of 100 Saturdays I would spend in her company.",
