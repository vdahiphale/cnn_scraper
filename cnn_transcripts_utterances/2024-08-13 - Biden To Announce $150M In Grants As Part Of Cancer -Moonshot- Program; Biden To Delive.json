With one person involved in the planning noting that, four years ago, the country was in the middle of a pandemic. The convention itself was virtual. Schools were closed. Vaccines were barely in people's arms. And they want to shine a light on how much has changed in Biden's four years in office. But the purpose of him appearing on night one is for the programming then to evolve to support Vice President Harris' candidacy and bringing the country into the future. And President Biden will be going on vacation after that -- Boris?",

They've had 83 days above 95 degrees so far. That's 18 more than average over the past decade. Every day in July was above 105 degrees, topping out at 20. San Antonio is way up there, too, as well now, jumping from a median age, they have an extra 15 days now of this excessive heat. Nashville, Jacksonville are there. But this is just compared to the sort of the average of the last decade, Boris. But if we widen out to my lifetime, since the 1970s, mid '70s, a place like Nashville had maybe a weeks' worth of temperatures over the course of a scorching hot summer. Last year, they had -- or last year they had 13 weeks, a 1,200 percent increase. You can see the San Antonio line with a huge jump there. At the top of the list, you have Phoenix, Mason, Tucson, the three Arizona cities, which started as hot places but have seen even more dramatic pushes into survivable temperatures there as well. But it's more of a just a lesson that, while it seems like it's in our machination some days, boy, this summer seems worse than ever. The data shows it is, indisputably. So it's a product of an overheating planet.",

But then cities, in general, have this urban heat island effect, where all that concrete radiates heat throughout, not only the daytime blazing hours, but holds onto it like a big thermal battery in the overnight hours.It's why Phoenix had its first 24-hour cooling center. And it's why they're struggling with -- they have now fire trucks and ambulances all carrying body bags full of ice to cool people off. This is the trend line over the last 50 years or so. And you can see there's an extra 800 days or so above 95 degrees temperatures in those 50 biggest cities. So it's really about vulnerability. The older folks, younger folks we've seen fall victim to this, outdoor workers. You have the unhoused, of course, who are especially vulnerable. And those wrestling with addiction, who don't know better. They don't know when they need to cool themselves off.",
