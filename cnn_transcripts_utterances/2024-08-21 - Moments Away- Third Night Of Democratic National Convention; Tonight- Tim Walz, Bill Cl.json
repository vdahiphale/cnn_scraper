And this is the first major address to a Democratic Convention that Governor Tim Walz will make tonight. That bookend will be extraordinary, there is no doubt about it. But first the former president, I'm told that he is going to talk about the economy, and the words of one advisor in the way that only Bill Clinton can. Of course, the economy is front and center in this election for all of the other issues, for all of the other extraneous, sometimes distractions, as we talk to voters across the country, pocketbook issues, the economy is at the heart of the matter.That is what Bill Clinton, I'm told, will address tonight in a policy driven matter, as well as decency. I'm told that he will talk about the former president in ways that also perhaps only he can. He's known Donald Trump for a very long time, but his speech tonight is intended to reach out to some of the swaths of the country that supported Bill Clinton a couple times, including back here in 1996 when he was standing on this very stage accepting the nomination for his reelection. But it is the speech from Governor Tim Walz, no doubt, that will be the highlight of the evening. He is going to try and fill in some of the blanks around him. He's been thrust into the limelight, really, in the last couple weeks or so, you know, and most people do not know him. For Democrats, that's an opportunity, but it's also, of course, an opportunity for Republicans to try and define him as well. He will do so on his own terms here tonight. But Wolf, we're also keeping an eye on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She, of course, is the legendary Democratic leader whose fingerprints are also all over this entire new Democratic ticket behind the scenes, she worked, as we know, to urge President Biden to come to the realization that this was not the moment for his reelection. I'm told she is not going to address any of that this evening. But of course, she'll be lifting up Kamala Harris. But Wolf, a very big evening tonight.

The heavyweights have done their job. Now it's time for the candidates to speak for themselves. Governor Walz tonight, and Vice President Harris tomorrow night.I think, will do an excellent job of laying out their credentials, their background. You know, Governor Walz is the first time a public school teacher has ever been on a national campaign ticket in America, it's a very important job in the country. It's odd that no one has ever reached this high. He'll be speaking for teachers and families all over the country. I think people really connect with Tim Walz. He's a great leader, a great governor. He's delivered in the state of Minnesota. He brings a freshness to the ticket. And I'm really looking forward to the vice president tomorrow night. I think she's she is obviously very famous, but not as well-known as she should be. She's done a great job as vice president. She's ready to be president. I thought Mr. Emhoff, her husband's speech last night was excellent in terms of introducing her as a person, as a parent. Watching Ella Emhoff nod as her father went through how the vice president as a parent to the entire Emhoff family, was an incredibly moving moment. I think it's a nod that should change the country.

She's certainly not going to speak on Kamala Harris's night. And look, I think part of the reason is this book tour she's been on, right? Where she seems to have -- to be relishing this role she played as power broker, Nancy Pelosi likes to wield power. And even at 84 years old, she likes to wield power and not let go of that.

What they -- if you look at the two as a package, it's sort of a yin and a yang of the widest possible appeal to voters that they're trying to make to recognize themselves in these leaders. And that's why this ticket is one that is not just a base ticket and not just a narrow cast ticket. They sort of complement each other. And so I think we're going to get one version of that story, the white guy taco version today of the ticket, and then we're going to get a little more of the, what did she say in that video, Coltrane and Miles Davis and other music, while she kind of gave a dig to Tim Walz.

But you know, RFK Jr. is a complicated character, and getting his endorsement, as Kasie mentioned, done a lot of crazy conspiracy theories. I'm not sure in the end of the polls were very uncertain as to who we took more votes from Biden or Trump, and my guess is there are a lot of people who are attracted to the Kennedy name who would be Democrats who may now go to Kamala Harris not to Donald Trump. I'm not sure it's going to make a big difference. He was down to 4 percent, 5 percent in the polls. That's a big number, but I was going to diminish as this campaign became more of a two person race.

And I could see, because I was behind him, him reading the teleprompter, and at a certain point where the teleprompter would stop, he would then talk for 15 minutes in perfect syntax, clearly, he was taking the parts that they had cut out and he was just reciting them from heart.My feeling about the importance of both him and Tim Walz tonight is, I think this convention so far has done a better job of energizing the Democratic base than it has at reaching out to those persuadable swing voters, middle Americans, Independents, who still at this late date haven't made up their minds. I think it is really important for Bill Clinton, the big dog, as he's being called, to reach out to the people who helped put him over the top in 92 and 96. And Tim Walz as well, to reach out to middle Americans and say, you know, this is not a liberal party. It's not a party where it's all about identity racial politics. This is a party where a lot of white working class people who might go for Trump, there's a place for you here, and we're looking out for you, and it's going to particularly focus on the economy, Bill Clinton's speeches about economy and value.",

It's the opposite of the sadness that we've been feeling in these last months and last years about democracy. Is it peril?Now they're saying we can do something about it. We have to act.

What really strikes me when I think about 1968 and I think about Joe Biden coming to his convention where he was able to give a valedictory speech, President Johnson called me up. I was at the convention just as a spectator. I was there on vacation with my friends from the Hill, and we were in a hotel room, and he called me in the room. Somebody answered the phone and said, the President is calling. I thought it was a joke. And then he just said to me, I was -- he said I had some favor to ask you. And I thought he was going to ask me to do something official, but he simply said, when you were here at the ranch last week, you borrowed my flashlight, and I can't find it. Where is it?I was so embarrassed thinking what I was thinking. But then I said to him, how are you? And he said, how do you think I am? I never felt lower in my life. He was supposed to go to that convention, give a speech, much like Biden did, and he was working on it that morning, a valedictory speech, because he had withdrawn earlier. He was getting the same praise that Biden had for withdrawing. But then they told him that he couldn't come, that the divisions were too great, that he would create turmoil, and there'd be more cheers and boos than cheers. So he couldn't go. He stayed home that night. It was his birthday too. He was going to go celebrate his 60th birthday, and he stayed home. And Lady Bird simply got a series of people there to have dinner and watch the convention. So it was a very sad moment for him.",
