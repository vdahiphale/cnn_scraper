But we've got to give the moment to the firefighters here.We've got nearly 2,000 personnel still battling the Franklin Fire 24 hours a day, seven days a week since this fire started a couple of days ago. And this is just incredible visuals coming from the firefighting efforts here, with the rotor wing aircraft depositing water on some of these flames and some of the embers here that are just several stories high. Just incredible to see what the effort that is going on in southern California. There are making some progress: 7 percent containment; still about 4,000 acres burned. But as you mentioned, Kasie, there is the potential, at least, for some wet weather and higher humidity levels that will bring in some relief for the firefighting efforts. The winds have relaxed. Now we're noticing more of an onshore component to the winds here. So, that's going to bring in an increase to the humidity levels. And that, of course, means that firefighting efforts will become a little bit more easy and not so erratic with the Northeasterly Santa Ana winds. Now, speaking of the snow that you talked about, well, the lake-effect snow machine. Downwind in those favored areas across the Great Lakes could pick up 1 to 2 feet, especially in those favored regions from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. There's the snowstorm. And just a broader picture here. You can see we have cool weather dominating much of the Eastern two-thirds of the country. It is winter -- Kasie.",
