Yesterday, Governor Henry McMaster signed a law banning most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy before many women even know they're pregnant.

Now, of course, this, again, came just 24 hours after Republican Governor Henry McMaster signed that abortion bill that would have banned most abortions after six weeks into law.And for a lot of people in South Carolina, this sounds familiar. The judge said that he thought the state Supreme Court should review this legislation first. It would be up to them to determine whether they want to rule on it or take other judicial action, but this happened before on a very similar six-week ban that was signed into law earlier this year. The state Supreme Court ruled that violated the state constitution. Privacy guarantees in there. And in fact, lawmakers had been sent back by the governor to try and figure out a way to fix and tweak this bill so it would adhere to what the Supreme Court wanted. Now, there were discussions and debate during this. In fact, those five so-called sister senators, three Republicans, one independent, one Democrat, warned lawmakers that they thought that the language that had been tweaked did not address the Supreme Court's concerns. One of those, Bianna, you actually spoke with earlier today, who says this is exactly what she expected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STATE SEN. PENRY GUSTAFSON (R-SC): I'm not surprised at all that there is an injunction against this law, and it's just very unfortunate because we know -- we know those clauses were a problem, yet the House, you know, put them back in there, reinserted them, and that's -- that was one of the many reasons why I voted against it, because I don't think it can be upheld.

Now, local authorities are saying it's a miracle more people were not killed and injured, and the reason for that is that there was actually a handover of staff between, excuse me, two different shifts, which meant that the numbers of people in that clinic were less than might ordinarily have been the case in mid-morning. Nonetheless -- excuse me -- nonetheless, the effects have been absolutely devastating. Whatever hit this building and the local authorities have not worked that out yet, was significant in its size. In all probability, the local authorities believe quite likely to have been an S-300 guided missile, which would act with or rather be targeted, in other words, it's got mechanisms on board that actually fire it at targets, so this could be said to be a targeted attack, what the French have described as a war crime.",

I want to bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who just got a key update from the treasury secretary. Jeremy, what did she say? JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right. We have a very important update from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. In a letter to congressional leader, she now has an update on that x-date for when the U.S. could potentially default on its payments, and it is not just early June, but it is now a specific date of June 5th. She writes in this letter: Based on the most recent available data, we now estimate that treasury will have insufficient resources to satisfy the government's obligations if Congress has not raised or suspended the debt limit by June 5th. And she notes that there will already be a significant amount of strain on the Treasury's funds, beginning next week. She says that $130 billion of scheduled payments will be made in the first two days of June, including veterans payments, Social Security, and Medicare, and this is going to leave the Treasury Department with an extremely low level of resources. She then notes that during the week of June 5th, another $92 billion of payments and transfers are scheduled, and that based on the Treasury Department's current estimates, the government will not have enough money on June 5th to make those payments scheduled for that week. So, this gives us a clearer sense of the timeline here and the pressure that lawmakers are under and the White House is under to reach an agreement. A few more days, then that earliest expect date, but nonetheless, a very tight timeline still. Not this Monday, but the following Monday, June 5th, is when the Treasury Department is now estimating that they will run out of money to pay the government's bills. Warning signs starting to flash here very clearly for the White House and the congressional negotiators, who we know have been working around the clock to try and reach an agreement, making some progress but still we know that some major sticking points remain.

There's been a lot of news coverage about them, a lot of discussion about Stewart Rhodes and what he did and one of the things I wanted to point out is that they even apologized today to police that there was quite a distinguishing, in the sentencing hearing, about what these people did who believed they were keeping an oath and protecting people and what police inside the Capitol actually did that day, which was keeping the oath, the judge pointed out, that the police were the ones who were true heroes.",

A less than one-hour long flight from Jeju to Daegu in South Korea turned into a nightmare for 200 passengers and crew. JTBC PASSENGER (through translator): Maybe the man tried to get off the plane.

It found an antibiotic that seemed to be effective against a drug resistant superbug.So I want to bring in Jon Sarlin, host of CNN's digital show, \"NIGHTCAP\", for more on this. We've talked about skepticism and concern about A.I. This looks like it could really be beneficial. How does it work in lab experiments like this, Jon? JON SARLIN, HOST, CNN'S \"NIGHTCAP\": So, Acinetobacter baumannii is a drug resistant disease that is in hospital settings that comes on things like doorknobs that can cause skin infections and blood infections, and it can be deadly. And it is not -- you know, traditional antibiotics are becoming increasingly resistant against it. That's why the CDC in 2019 said it's urgent for researchers to develop new methods to combat this. Well, researchers at McMaster University, MIT and Harvard are doing exactly that using A.I. So, basically they're using A.I. to take the traditional R&amp;D development phase of a drug, but speed up certain processes within it. So, the traditional process, they took the disease in a laboratory setting and fed it different compounds, around 7,500 compounds, to see how it reacts to those. Now, around 480 had some kind of effect. That data was then input into an A.I., which basically learned everything about how this disease works. It knows the disease better than the disease itself. So, from that, understanding of how the disease works, scientists then took around 6,000 possible drugs and fed it into the A.I. to see which could work. This is a process that would have taken a long time. But the researchers told CNN it took a couple of hours. They went to lunch, and by the time they got back, there were around 240 possible drug candidates. They took those candidates, tested them, and one winner emerged.",
