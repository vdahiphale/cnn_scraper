G-7 nations have agreed to shut down all coal plants by 2035, a potential breakthrough in the fight against climate change. Ministers from each country have been meeting in Italy, where climate talks are expected to wrap Tuesday. Coal is the world's dirtiest fossil fuel. Ending its use has been a controversial topic at international talks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW BOWIE, U.K. MINISTER FOR NUCLEAR AND RENEWABLES: This, by the way, is an historic agreement, something that we weren't able to achieve at COP28 in Dubai last year. So to have the G-7 nations come around the table and send that signal to the world that we, the advanced economies of the world, are committing to phasing out coal by the early 2030s, is quite incredible.
