His message was that Democrats not only defied the odds from Arizona to Nevada to now last night in Georgia but that this is a moment that practically really matters in the U.S. Senate.The difference between a 50-50 Senate and 51-49 Senate is really significant for Democrats. There's a few reasons he outlined. One of them, the way committees will now do their work. No longer will the committees be evenly divided. Now Democrats will have the clear advantage in these committees, which means moving nominees more quickly through the process. Also passing legislation more easily, that's significant. Also, going ahead and issuing subpoenas without having to get a Republican to sign off. That's significant. Also, it gives majority leader Chuck Schumer a bit of breathing room. I want to emphasize there, Kate, just a bit of breathing room. Over the last several years, the political universe has centered around Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. That's going to change; Schumer could lose one of them. Now I did ask him how he plans to deal with the Republican-controlled House. If Kevin McCarthy is the Speaker and he's still working to get the votes on that, he said he is ready and willing to work with McCarthy. But Republicans will have to give a bit and Democrats will have to give a little. Kate.",

It will still be incredibly difficult to get legislation through.They were successful in passing legislation along straight party lines, in two key instances and they did that when they had the House and Senate. They no longer have the House. Legislating will be difficult. The Senate has to confirm nominees. And if there's a Supreme Court vacancy, that give them breathing room. They won't have to rely on senator Joe Manchin in particular to come their way. That's what Democrats are most harmed about. And when there's a possibility of a 50-50 Senate again or just the possibility of one vote on an individual issue, having that additional vote is hugely significant in the difference between legislation stalling or legislation failing.",

And, you know, you would think there would be more excitement around that. But you know, some of them were a little, I don't know, uncomfortable with the campaign and Walker's candidacy. They didn't feel like he was representing Black interests. Now of course, Black people tend to vote for Democrats at a pretty high rate. But you know, some of them talked about this embarrassment they felt at the way that Hershel Walker ran his campaign.

That's something that Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson expressed skepticism and concern about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  Mr. Thompson, just following up on what was just mentioned, I guess what I don't understand is how you can cut the state constitution out of the equation, when it is giving the state legislature the authority to exercise legislative power. It's the state constitution that's telling the legislature when and under what circumstances it can actually act as the legislature. So let me ask it this way. What if what is at issue is not any particular exercise of the state's legislative authority, such as its ability to make time, place and manner determinations, but whether the entity that is purporting to exercise that power qualifies as this particular state's legislature?

That has triggered some real excitement.For example, a surge in inquiries about plane tickets for internal travel. Why is it so important? Because look at some of the changes. For example, the government says no longer will people need to be required to get negative PCR tests to go into public places like shopping malls, for example. Previously, a lot of cities required people to line up and get tested every 48 hours, just to do things like travel on public transport or to go to public places. Asymptomatic COVID cases, people with mild symptoms, and close contacts of COVID cases are no longer going to be bundled off government quarantine, where there have been reports of poor accommodations, poor food, poor sanitary conditions. They can now do home quarantine. Another big change is a lifting of restrictions on travel between regions and provinces. So I spoke with a friend in Shanghai and told her about this for the first time. She said, this is wonderful, I can go travel to see my parents, who I haven't seen in another province in months now. There is a flipside to some of this excitement. That is that the Chinese government has been warning about the fears, the dangers of COVID for years now. And now suddenly, the narrative is changing. And it's saying hey, this new variant is milder. You can live with it. There are still prominent fears in the population. There is a run on over the counter medicines for fever and respiratory illnesses, for example, at pharmacies. But there are some real threats as well. Epidemiologists are warning that there are large numbers of Chinese that are very vulnerable to COVID. For example, 23 percent of citizens over 80 are completely unvaccinated. That is like 8.4 million people now at risk. China is trying to rush out vaccines to these vulnerable parts of the population right now -- Ivan Watson, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Essentially what this report, which Hannah Rabinowitz, my colleague, just got briefed on, essentially said 100 Bureau of Prison workers were made of his transfer prior to him coming there. If you think about that, that's a lot of people who knew about a notorious gangster coming to a prison that's notoriously violent. Essentially saying some people talked about his arrival among other inmates, which you can imagine is not good. There's 11 different recommendations that will go to the Bureau of Prisons, talking about better training amongst transfer staff and a list of others.",
