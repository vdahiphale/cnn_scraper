I'm sitting in my lawyer's office and there's a knock at the door and it's the FBI. And here's Smirnov, his lawyer, David Chesnoff. They're like, Alexander Smirnov, you're under arrest. We have an arrest warrant. We are commanded to arrest you. And they're like, yes, we know that, OK. He's already been arrested. Like, we're arresting him again. On new charges? Now, on the same charges. Guys, I know this is fun, but you just can't keep arresting somebody over and again. And they're like, we have a different warrant from a different judge on the same charges.So, what the FBI did was the magistrate set bail saying, look, he's not a danger to the community. He's not a mob hitman. He's not a gang leader. Yes, he's a political lightning rod, but that's a political problem, not a public safety one. So, I'm going to give him an ankle bracelet and we're going to, you know, secure some bond and let him out. They went to the trial judge in California and said, we want to bring him right to you and have a new bail hearing because you're the trial judge. You're the one he's going to have to show up for. So, they got this arrest warrant. His attorney has filed papers to hear all that out. But I can't remember quite seeing anything like this. And, you know, the government is very serious about it.

Although we're still waiting for those first few pictures.Now, this was really a tense final few moments for this mission. Just a few hours before landing, Intuitive Machines announced that there was an issue with Odysseus' navigation system. It wasn't working. But in a spectacular example of a public/private partnership, it just so happened that one of Odysseus' or Intuitive Machines' paying customers, NASA, had an experimental piece of equipment that did the exact same thing as this broken piece of navigation software. And so engineers on earth were able to patch up a fix and allow Odysseus to safely navigate that treacherous terrain on the south pole of the moon, dodging craters and boulders to find a safe space to land. And so that is what happened. It took a little bit longer than the company thought to communicate with the spacecraft, but it is sending back data now. And this is now the first time that any American spacecraft has landed on the surface of the moon since the end of the Apollo program back in 1972. So, it's a win for NASA as a sponsor of this mission, but certainly a win for this Texas-based company, Intuitive Machines. They were able to do for about $100 million what NASA was able to do with the Apollo program with a much larger budget. So, some big cheers from that mission control room when the landing happened, and now we get to see what Odysseus can do on the surface of the moon for the next week or so.

And that's part of why you'll see all eyes on the south pole of the moon. Theres these craters that are in shadow and in these cold tracks (ph), as we call them, are water and also the remnant of the origin story of the solar system. So, remnants of what probably will lead us to understand how the solar system formed. And so that's why we want to go to the south pole.

But you're seeing a company like Intuitive Machines get the job done.So, I was in this, watching with trepidation, probably with a lot of other people. Even if it had crashed, it would have been an amazing feat that had been done. But really what I was so excited to see happen was a private company get done what the big guns were doing prior to this from the United States perspective.

And the word privilege here I think is particularly appt because that's what it has been every day, and night, and very early morning to work with our extraordinary team here. To our directors, our producers, bookers, writers, editors, APs, PAs, you are the heart and soul of something for which we're both incredibly proud. Your immeasurable talents have infused every show. Your good humor, your smiles have filled every morning. And the fact that you are willing to share that with both of us while working let's charitably call them less than ideal hours, well, that's a testament to your character and explains our shared and unyielding belief in your limitless futures.",
