So if Harris can run up the margins in the big places enough, I'm not sure there are enough voters elsewhere in the states -- each -- any of these states to overcome it. And so I'm going to be watching not only whether she can sand down -- hold down the losses but whether she can really blow out the doors in these white collar, racially diverse, growing, prosperous places that have been trending toward Democrats in the Trump era.",

Certainly, college verses non is really important. Urban verses rural is really important. Age is really important as your citing.But there is kind of a pretty direct through line here, which is that women are a majority of the voters in all seven swing states and nationally. Women have cast the majority of votes in every election since 1980. And what that means across the swing states is that Donald Trump is going to have to win men by more than Kamala Harris wins women. It's kind of a very simple rule. Now, that's doable in some places, particularly in the South where a lot of white women are culturally conservative evangelicals, but this is fundamentally his challenge in -- particularly I think in the former blue wall states. Can he win men by more than she wins women? What we saw in 2022 was that Biden's advantages among women in the those states was not the ceiling for Democrats. Democratic gubernatorial candidates in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and for that matter, Arizona ran better among college-educated women and non- college-educated women than Biden had two years earlier. The non-college women still look like a problem for Democrats. They're economically squeezed and maybe less motivated by abortion. But you could see record support for Harris among college-educated women. And as you say, older women are -- you know, in many polls have been tilting more Democratic. So again, it is a -- it is a simple math equation. If women vote for Harris in sufficient numbers in those states it is going to be really hard for Trump to overcome that because women are somewhere between 52 to 56 percent of the voters in 2020 in all seven of the key battleground states.",

Donald Trump's July appearance with the National Association of Black Journalists could very well be one of them. Trump choosing to question Kamala Harris' racial identity marking a change in strategy from a campaign that had been relatively restrained up to that point.According to new reporting from The Atlantic's Tim Alberta, in the days after his NABJ appearance Trump began to lose confidence in his team and reportedly was pondering, for the first time, a shake-up craving the fun, freewheeling feel of his first campaign. What ensued, according to insiders, was a campaign so chaotic and rife with infighting that staffers began to question whether they would even want to work in a second Trump administration. As the chaos began to spill into the open Trump offered this assurance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's pretty remarkable.Tim, I also want to ask you about this -- what you wrote about the people that work for him. You said, \"The homestretch of the campaign hasn't just been hard and stressful, it's been disillusioning. Several campaign officials told me throughout the spring and summer how excited they were about working in the next Trump White House. But now those same people were saying they'd had a change of heart. The past three months have been the most unpleasant of their careers. Win or lose, they said, they were done with the chaos of Donald Trump even if the nation was not.\" What does it say to you that some of these people don't seem to want to continue working for him? I mean, will they vote for him?",

I know from talking with some folks just in the last 72 hours that several of the people who work for Donald Trump are sort of indifferent at this point. Like, just get this over with. And you can tell that they don't particularly care what the outcome is.And by the way, lest anybody be surprised by that. I know that obviously some people are reacting to that with the kind of bulging eye emoji, but this is not new. I mean, this fits - this fits with the pattern of what we've seen. Basically everyone who has worked for Trump, going back to his 2016 campaign and his presidency, of course -- by the end there were a whole bunch of people who were jumping ship and saying enough is enough. I can't do it anymore. What we see pretty consistently, Kasie, is that this kind of collective amnesia tends to set in for folks and they go back, or they enter for the first time thinking that it will be different, but it never winds up being different. I mean, working for Donald Trump in politics is sort of an elaborate Groundhog Day skit where folks continue to think that they can change the man, but he doesn't change. And in some cases, he changes them. But at the end of the day, Donald Trump is Donald Trump is Donald Trump. And this exasperation that we're seeing from some of his aides in the eleventh hour here would be sort of -- would be novel except that it's entirely predictable and we've seen it before.",
