The attending physician of Congress recommended the freshman Democrat get in-patient care at Walter Reid Medical Center. Fetterman's chief of staff released a statement saying, while John has experienced depression off and on throughout his life, it only became severe in recent weeks. John is getting the care he needs and will soon be back to himself.Now, last May, Fetterman had a debilitating stroke on the campaign trail. He recovered, and went on to win the election in November. Last week he checked into Walter Reid after feeling lightheaded, but his office said tests ruled out another stroke. Joining us now is physician and assistant professor of health policy at Will Cornell Medicine, Dr. Dhruv Khullar. Welcome to the program. DR. DHRUV KHULLAR, HEALTH POLICY PROFESSOR, WEILL CORNELL MEDICINE: Thanks so much for having me.",

They may get talk (ph) therapy or medications. In this case, it was serious enough that he felt that he had to check himself into the hospital. And so we know that there is a certain degree of severity here.What's important to note is that he felt comfortable doing that. And I think he brings himself into a larger conversation about mental health in the United States right now. And hopefully other people see that example.

That creates a lot of challenges with coping. And so this is a very common thing that we see after a stroke. You know, Senator Fetterman has a few things that are risk factors for it. His campaign has said that he's had issues with depression in the past as well. He had a pretty severe stroke. He has ongoing issues with auditory processing.

A real world testing program that is -- essentially navigates local roads, steering, braking, and accelerations, and requires the driver to be prepared to take over at any moment. But in this - this safety recall report from NHTSA, it outlines numerous instances where it doesn't seem to have worked. And Tesla itself saying there may be 18 warranty cases - no injuries or accidents, but maybe 18 warranty issues about this self-driving software. People pay $15,000 for this, you know. And people who are really aficionados of the whole self-driving AI movement in autos, they love this kind of stuff and want to be a part of this - of this beta. But the government's stepping in and saying there needs to be a recall. So, Elon Musk, he hasn't really addressed this at length, but he did, on Twitter, of course, which he is the CEO of, he mentioned that, you know, it's not really a recall. It's anachronistic to call it a recall because it's not like a Ford real with a steering column problem where you drive into the - into the dealership and it's fixed there. This is something that will be fixed - it's a software update, basically now a mandatory software update.
