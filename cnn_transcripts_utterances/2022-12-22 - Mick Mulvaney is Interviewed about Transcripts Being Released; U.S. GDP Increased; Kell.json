Most of them took the Fifth, refusing to answer questions. So we're still waiting on the committee to release more transcripts, though, given they ultimately spoke with more than a thousand witnesses. The committee is supposed to release its final report today.Joining us now is the former acting chief of staff during the Trump administration, Mick Mulvaney, who served until March 2020 when Trump replaced him with Mark Meadows. Mick, thank you so much for joining us this morning. You know, you sat down with the January 6th committee. We're going to see your transcript. What do you think we'll see in that?

Everybody asking the questions at the interviews was against Donald Trump. So what you sort of see in the January 6th hearing is the greatest hits of everything that's against Trump. If the witnesses said anything actually helpful to the president, or positive about the president, you'd find those in the transcripts. It may not be there. There may be no positive story to tell there. But at least by seeing the transcripts ourselves, getting a chance to look at them unfiltered, we get a chance to see a bigger part of the story, and I'm excited about that opportunity.",

I don't think there's anything here that's going to vindicate him because I don't think it's a vindicatable sort of circumstance.

That wasn't publicly available information. I didn't get that from Bill Barr. I didn't get that from CNN or the Washington news back then.

Those - one of those two things will have to happen. Liz Cheney doesn't get to wave a magic wand and say that Donald Trump doesn't get to run for office. I've already said that I don't think he's a very good candidate for office. I won't be supporting him. But that doesn't mean that you get to wave a magic wand and say this person or that person can't run for office. I think it's a very dangerous sort of place to be.
