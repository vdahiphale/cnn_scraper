We also had one in Utah between independent candidate Evan McMullin and the incumbent Republican Mike Lee. They actually agree on many issues, but one of the biggest flashpoints came over January 6. CNN reporting back in April revealed that Mike Lee did reach out to then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows about wanting to challenge the election results and McMullin said that that was indicative of Lee wanting to overturn the will of the people to which as you can imagine, Lee denied saying he accepted Joe Biden as president.But notably, this is the only Senate race in the country where Democrats didn't field a candidate. The other main - another interesting storyline here is that Senator Mitt Romney, also from Utah chose not to endorse either candidate saying he's friends with both, and that he is just going to watch how this plays out. Mike Lee, though has asked for that endorsement, still hasn't gotten it. Leaving Romney is the only GOP senator who hasn't endorsed Lee, and we'll see if that makes or at least contributes to the difference now, three weeks to election day.",

And with three weeks to go, President Biden is doing everything he can to try and put that issue back front and center, even as voters show that they are increasingly more concerned about other issues like the economy and inflation. But the President knows that this is a winning issue for Democrats. They believe that the public is on their side. And they also believe that this is a galvanizing issue for the base. But when you look at this latest polling from the New York Times, just yesterday, it shows, you put those two together the economy, the inflation, that's 44 percent of voters believing that that is the most important issue facing the country today. And that's part of why we've seen some of that momentum that Democrats had following the Supreme Court, striking down Roe V. Wade over the summer begin to wane, inflation has remained stubbornly high. Gas prices have also begun to rise in recent weeks. They've come down just slightly in the last week or so. But the President is also trying to show that he is focused on that issue as well. And that's why we've learned that the Biden administration is expected to announce more releases of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to try and counter that decision from OPEC plus as it relates to cutting the production of oil, which is expected to send oil prices and gas prices up in the coming months. 14 billion barrels - about 14 billion barrels expected to be released. And that will round out the promised 180 million barrels of oil that the President promised to release last spring amid concerns about rising - the rising price of oil, in part due to of course, the war between Russia and Ukraine. But of course now there's also this issue of OPEC and their production cut that the President is trying to counter, Bianna.",

But it's also an opportunity for Demings to reach out to top Democratic organizations that have largely sat out the race in Florida. Much like Ohio, Florida has been a pretty tough state for Democrats over the last few years. And that has been reflected in how much money has been spent to aid Demings.There aren't a lot of outside groups helping her she's had to really go it alone, spend a lot of the money that she has raised, she has raised significant money, but that has taken a toll on her campaign. She has entered the final weeks of the campaign with less money in the bank than Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican incumbent. So there was a time I think the Democrats thought this would be a reach date, a possible state where Demings who is a candidate who they cheered and applauded when she - when she got the nomination of former Chief of Police in Orlando, could mount in - have a chance to unseat Rubio. But I think as you've seen these polls close, as you've seen issues other than abortion rise to the top, I think they're even the most poignant Democrats acknowledged, this is going to be a tough one for Democrats to win in the final weeks of the campaign, Bianna.",

But that's not necessarily much relief for Ukrainians, given that we see where Russia has turned and that is to Iran. Iran has given them 1000s of these drones. And President Zelenskyy says more are anticipated, including as the Washington Post is reporting other ballistic missiles as well. What can the U.S. do?

There can be absolutely no technology of any kind allowed into Russia. Because most technology is dual use. It will be used in one manner or another to kill Ukrainians. As it relates to Iran, when we get back after the elections that has to be high on our list of things to accomplish. I know we want to do another Iran nuclear deal.

He says I think people are going to be sitting in a recession, and they're not going to write a blank check to Ukraine. They just won't do it. It's not a free blank check.
