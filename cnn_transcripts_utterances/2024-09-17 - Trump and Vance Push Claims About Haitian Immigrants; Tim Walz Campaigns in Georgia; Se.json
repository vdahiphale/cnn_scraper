And so, we're launching a 30 and 30 campus program. We've hit around 11 or 12 of those schools right now.

This is a fascinating number to me. This is in Iowa, which has been a solidly red state, but the Des Moines Register, which, as you know, always has very solid polling, as showing right now, Kamala Harris down just four points to Donald Trump in that state.And I was just asking you about the poll in North Carolina, some of the polling in North Carolina a few moments ago, to what do you attribute this change? Because, obviously, what we saw before when President Biden was in the race, things have changed dramatically when it comes to how Kamala Harris is stacking up against the former president. Is it among young voters? Is it minority voters? Is there -- what portion of the pie do you see as, OK, that's the one that's making a difference? Is it new voter registration? What do you think it is?",

When you've got a coalition that's as strong as folks from Liz Cheney to AOC, I think that you have one of the most powerful coalitions in the country right now that is all saying the same thing, that we would like to protect democracy.And what you're seeing state representative out of Iowa, J. D. Scholten, would tell you any day that we're seeing a campaign that even without the National Democratic Party really investing in Iowa right now, we are still seeing that sort of surge in her campaign and her candidacy because people are excited. They have hope for the first time in politics, for a really -- no, no, really long time, quite frankly. And I think that that comes from the fact that you have a surge of young people that are finally seeing and finally starting to see themselves represented in politics the first time. But you're also starting to see the surge of maybe new voters and folks that have felt disenfranchised or not engaged with politics too. Kamala Harris is building a coalition like none other throughout the United States, and that's what's going to help carry states like North Carolina and Georgia. She's prioritizing the south in general, which is something for a party where our base, 55 percent of black Americans live right now. It is the most important thing that we could be doing as a party and for her candidacy going forward.",

It's a federal indictment returned by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York, which includes Manhattan.There are three counts here. Racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and then transporting a person across state lines for illicit sexual purposes. What this indictment boils down to essentially is they charge that Sean Combs presided over a criminal organization. Prosecutors actually title that organization, The Combs Enterprise. They say the purpose was to satisfy Sean Combs' sexual desires, to promote and protect his career and to silence people who might have spoken out against him. And, Jim, to your point, there's a lot of graphic detail in here about physical assaults, about violence, about use of guns and drugs to threaten imply people. So, it appears to be a very serious indictment that Sean Combs is being processed for right now. Will make his first appearance in court fairly soon.",

Will prosecutors, first of all, agree to some sort of bail package, even if it's multimillions of dollars or other restrictions, or will prosecutors seek to detain him with no bail, which prosecutors do do quite often, especially in cases where the charges are as serious as this.Now, clearly, Sean Combs and his lawyers will ask for bail. That's why they brought him in last night to surrender. They want to be able to make the case to the judge, look, he's not fleeing. He's not a danger. He's not going to go anywhere. That determination should be made today by the judge. And that is such an important moment in the case because either Sean Combs is out and free while he's preparing to defend himself at trial, or there's a chance he could be locked up. He could be in federal custody from now until his trial. And these trials, as we know, Jim, from various experiences, it takes many months to get these trials. It's a crucial moment in a case where it's determined whether there will be bail or no bail. But the first thing to keep in mind, will the prosecution ask the judge to lock him up or will the prosecution agree to a bail package? If they want to lock him up, we're going to have an argument about it today.",

Chiles is taking her fight for the floor exercise bronze medal as high as it can go, appealing to Switzerland's Supreme Court for it to be reinstated with the support of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and USA Gymnastics. Chiles filed the appeal yesterday.She originally placed fifth, you remember, but was awarded the bronze after the American coaches challenged her score and the appeal was upheld. Then the Romanian team objected that decision to revise her incorrect score, claiming the appeal was filed four seconds after the one-minute deadline, even after USA Gymnastics provided video evidence their appeal was submitted on time. The Court of Arbitration for Sport, also known as the CAS, eventually upheld Romania's challenge, and the medal was given then to their gymnast, Ana Barbosu. In a statement. Chiles' attorney argues the CAS Violated Chiles' right to be heard, adding quote, \"From start to finish the procedures leading to the CAS panel's decision were fundamentally unfair, and it is no surprise that they resulted in an unjust decision,\" unquote. Now, CAS told CNN, Jim, that it cannot comment as it has not yet been notified of Chiles' appeal by the Swiss Federal Tribunal.
