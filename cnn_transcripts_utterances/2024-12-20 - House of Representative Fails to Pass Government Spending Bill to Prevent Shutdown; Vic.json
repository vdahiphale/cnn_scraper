This one is a little, there's more to it than this.But this raises once again, the Mike Johnson problem.

And we did have a seat at the table which got us to this bipartisan deal on Wednesday, that Elon Musk and Donald Trump blew up. But the notion, this kind of fantasy notion that they're going to be able to pass a bill that has no, that Democrats are not consulted on, they are not negotiating, that's being shoved down their throats, is a recipe for keeping the government shut down. It's just reckless. It's wasting all of our time. The Democrats have to have a seat at the table here because of our political system.

They are primarily there to fight ISIS.One would imagine that troops were surged in there, given all the uncertainty the past few weeks. But this is a very important day in US-Syrian relations. We have this delegation that is in Damascus as we speak. We are waiting to hear from them momentarily. The US has not had diplomatic ties with a Syrian government for the past 12 years. And so, this is the first high level delegation to go back into Damascus in years. It is being led by senior members of the State Department, and we believe that they are meeting with HTS, this group that led the charge to overthrow the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. One big question is whether they'll be meeting with its head, Ahmed al-Sharaa who is designated by the US to be a terrorist. There's a $10 million bounty on his head. HTS is a designated terrorist group. So, in these meetings, the US is certainly going to be pushing for its vision of what it hopes Syria will be, an inclusive, representative government, one that does not allow terrorists to be harbored inside Syria, one that doesn't have chemical weapons. But you can be sure that this transitional government is also going to be pushing for US sanctions to be lifted on Syria and for that terrorist designation to be dropped. And, Sara, one major focus of these meetings, we're told, is going to be the location of Austin Tice, the American journalist who disappeared some 12 years ago. The US has been frantically looking for any sign of Tice. So, a lot to discuss.

Remember at the end of the day, he'll have a jury of his peers and people are celebrating this, calling him Saint Luigi and everything else.So is that a factor? This is the unfair government going against the little person et cetera. But from a legal perspective, I see no basis. Why? Number one, when you look at double jeopardy, it means accused of the same offense and tried twice for it. The federal government has a different theory. What is that? In a state crime, murder is you've committed the murder, right? If you intended to do it and of course, in the state case, they're saying that terrorism was a component. But the federal government's theory is that you crossed state lines to do so. That in and of itself, makes it a separate offense. Federal government also charging stalking as it relates to the use of the internet, as it relates to travel and of course, carrying a firearm across state lines. So to the extent that there are different theories and different charges, there is no double jeopardy bar.
