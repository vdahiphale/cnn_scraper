      "sentences": "New evidence that the economy is bouncing back. It grew at a 2.8 percent rate in the second quarter, despite high interest rates. President Biden took a moment to tout the news saying, quote, \"When I took office, we were in the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Today's GDP report makes clear we now have the strongest economy in the world.\"CNN's Matt Egan is here to break this all down. And Matt, you know, I said, despite the high interest rates. But you tell me, I think maybe the best way to say it is because of the high interest rates. Even though a lot of people who want to buy houses don't really love that, and that's an understatement.",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, look, there's a lot to celebrate in this report. The economy just continues to chug along and continues to prove naysayers wrong. We're talking about GDP. It's the broadest measure of the economy. And it shows that the economy grew at twice the pace of the first quarter. A lot of good news in this report.If my four-year-old brought home a report card like this, I'd take him to go get ice cream and to the toy store, stimulating the economy along the way. As far as why this is happening, well, two big factors. One, Americans continue to spend money, not like they were a few years ago, but they're still shopping. They're still going out to eat. They're still traveling. And you know what? Businesses are spending too. They are investing in technology and they're investing in artificial intelligence. Now, I do think it's worth taking a step back and thinking about where we are and where we could have been. Because remember, two years ago, investors and CEOs and economists were freaking out about a potential recession. And a recession, it would have been disastrous for millions of Americans. It would have been politically disastrous for Democrats in Washington. Thankfully, we are not in a recession, but it is worth remembering the economy is not just what these national statistics show. It's how people are feeling. We had a CNN poll out earlier this week showing that 39 percent of adults say they worry some or all of the time that their income will not meet expenses. That's up from late 2021, right in line with what people were saying in mid-2008. So, Dana, hopefully this economy continues to grow and wages keep going up and inflation cools so people start to feel better about this economy.",

Young people, black voters, Hispanic voters, where Biden was really collapsing.She'll earn them back, I think. And she's driving distinctions. You know, an election's a choice, and she's driving three key distinctions. First, most importantly, for the people versus for himself. Second, prosecutor versus a perpetrator. And then third, future versus a past. Those are three dynamics that really play well to her, that frame up the race in the eyes of voters. And look, let's face it, even Trump's most ardent supporters would admit he sometimes can be a little self- interested. He kind of is in it for himself.

They feel like they don't have a sense of what she does.But that's where all the upside is, because it means right now in this moment, she gets to reintroduce herself to the American people. And I think for a lot of the swing voters that I've been listening to, they're open to her making a pitch to them. I mean, the fact is, these voters, they were this double haters, right, the people who didn't want to vote for Trump or Biden. And now they've got a new choice, and they're interested. And so I think for her, she's just got to come out now, prosecute a case against Trump, but also show people that she is capable of running the country because people are giving her a fresh look.
