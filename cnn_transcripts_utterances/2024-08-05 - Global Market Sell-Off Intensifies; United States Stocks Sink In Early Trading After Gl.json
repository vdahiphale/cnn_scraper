Here are the headlines this hour, with tensions heating up, with Hezbollah. Israel bracing for Iranian retaliation as international diplomacy moves into full gear. The prime minister of Bangladesh has resigned, and the military says it will form an interim government. And Keir Starmer chairs an emergency meeting following a series of riots in the U.K. over this weekend. Well, it's 3:00 p.m. here in London. 10:00 as I say, in New York, after three weeks of losses, it is a brutal start to the new trading day and the new week on Wall Street. It's not only U.S. stocks. This is the story there. This follows indices around the world that have been tumbling as fears of a U.S. economic slowdown send shockwaves through the global markets. These were prompted by Friday's disappointing U.S. jobs report, and everyone's got their eye now on the Federal Reserve, wondering whether the U.S. central bank has waited too long to begin cutting interest rates to avoid a recession. Of course, the Fed has been trying to slow this market down for some time. Have they left it too late? Let's get Richard Quest on this market meltdown. I mean, there's an awful lot going on here. And you can argue that this sell off, off the back of the jobs report Friday, which was weaker than expected, just sort of pricing in a whole load of other stuff on the tech market, et cetera.

But perhaps the more significant thing is, of course, what's happening in the wider and the underlying economics. And here, there is the realization that the medicine that the Fed has been giving the patient, i.e., the U.S. economy is working, the economy is slowing down exactly as it was intended to. The leading, if you will, inflation has fallen down exactly as it was intended to. And the opposite side of that same equation, unemployment has risen. You asked exactly the right question, have the Fed been too late to adjust its policy? Well, they really had no choice, at one level, Becky, because they had to prove their interest, their inflation, cutting credentials. Their credibility was on the line, having allowed inflation to rise so dramatically, they had to prove they were serious. And so, they took a risk on the opposite side of the scales, with unemployment and with slowdown leading to recession. Bear in mind, there is still only 25 percent says Goldman, of a recession -- of a likelihood of a recession, far more likely sluggish growth.",

This was the -- this was the worry back in 2020, 2022. There was nowhere to go if you suddenly needed to cut rates. You had to use quantitative easing to stimulate growth if you were in trouble. Now, they've got 500 basis points. They can cut, they can cut, they can cut. Now, have they left it too late to do it? It's a moot point. In the rear- view mirror, in a year or two, you and I will be saying they did leave it too late. We won't. know. We have still got growth of 2.2. percent in the U.S. economy. So, to kill off that and go negative for two percent -- for two quarters of GDP would be quite something. It's an interesting -- I don't think they've left it too late.

Everybody wants to make the most possible, because you're managing your own retirement in a sense. And that's a real worry for a lot of people in this country, and indeed in Europe, where they have these -- where everybody now has money purchase pension schemes. So, you take a look at the market, and we -- and then, we've got the Dow 30, or we've got the S&amp;P or we can show some individual stocks, but you see stocks that have been beaten up by 30 percent -- 20, 30 percent until we had last week. And you start to ask yourself, well, if I'm taking a five-year view, and by the way, I've just been looking back dot-com boom and bust share prices. Take Cisco at the -- at the fall -- at the fall of the dot-com boom and bust, Cisco came in at $18, $19 a share. On an inflation basis, it should be about $30 a share. It's $45 a share today. So, on a longer-term basis, this is still where the action is, if you will. And there will be -- the question, of course, is timing it. Look at this. Right. What was Nvidia down when you -- Nvidia. When we spoke an hour ago, it was off 13 percent, it's come back to 6-1/2. My guess is, pure guess, Becky. Do not take it to the bank.

Several countries, including the US, UK and France, are urging their citizens to leave Lebanon. Well. Ben Wedeman is in the Lebanese capital of Beirut.

And they claimed that several of them were killed or wounded. The Israeli military is saying that most of those drones or projectiles were intercepted, that one fell, but only two members of the military were slightly, moderately injured, a soldier and an officer. But it's important to keep in mind that this sort of daily back and forth between the Israelis and Hezbollah is -- has become really the background noise in Lebanon. Every day, Hezbollah, for instance, yesterday, they claimed six strikes on Israeli targets, five so far today. So far today, the Israelis have carried out a variety of airstrikes, artillery barrages and drone strikes as well. What we are seeing here is growing concern about the possibility of a regional war. For instance, here in Beirut this morning, there were two large bangs, and people rushed to their windows and saw fire on the edge of Beirut. It turned out, that was just a brush fire, and the bangs were Israeli war planes breaking the sound barrier overhead. That scene really is just psychological warfare by the Israelis. It's frequent in southern Lebanon, but less frequent here in Beirut, that they break the sound barrier. Now, what we are seeing is that Turkey is the latest country to add itself to the list of those countries that are calling on their nationals to leave the country as quickly as possible. It's getting extremely difficult to find a place on a plane flying out of Beirut. We know that, for instance, the American embassy has advised us, nationals in the country, just book any flight just to get out of Beirut at the moment, although, despite this concern, what we are seeing is people are going about their lives as best they can. There doesn't seem to be a run-on petrol stations for fuel or stores for food. Of course, keep in mind Becky, that for 10 months now, tensions in Lebanon have skyrocketed with fears like now of a regional war, and then, there is been a calming of the situation, this time is particularly much worse. But I think most Lebanese, at this point, even though they are afraid of what might come, have become used to this up and down of tensions, and are just hoping that this time, it doesn't actually come to pass.",

The Israeli prime minister over the weekend, saying several times that Iran will pay a \"very heavy\" price, should it choose to carry out attacks against Israel, making clear that Israel is determined, as he said, to stand against Iran on every front and in every arena. He also said that the Israeli military is prepared for any scenario. We have also heard from the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, saying that Israel is very prepared to quickly defend itself, but then also to move from defensive mode into offensive mode. And the Israeli military has told us this weekend that it was in the process of reviewing potential retaliatory actions, should Iran and its proxies attack Israel. So, not only a heightened state of alert to defend Israel against potential attacks from Iran and its proxies in the region, but also clearly preparations underway for a swift counter attack should it come to that. And that is, of course, why there is such a serious risk, why there are so many concerns at this moment of very dangerous escalations as we could very quickly see a domino effect that carries this entire region into war. We know that there are frantic diplomatic efforts at this hour to try and prevent that from happening. Messages being delivered to Iran to try and measure its response. And clearly that rhetoric from the Israeli prime minister and other Israeli officials intended to try and get Iran to perhaps recalculate as it, you know, seeks to determine what its next moves will be. And we don't yet know how imminent a potential Iranian attack against Israel will be. For now, Israeli civilians have not been told by the Israeli military to do anything differently in their day to day lives that home front command guidance, which is issued to tell Israelis to stock up on supplies, to be -- you know, limit large gatherings, be close to a bomb shelter, that has not been issued yet. But there are local guidelines here in Haifa, as well as in the -- in Jerusalem, urging residents there to begin to make some preparation. So, clearly, different tack, depending on which city in Israel you are. But certainly, we are at a moment of tension. And amid all of this, General Kurilla, the top U.S. general in the Middle East, visiting the region here, expected to meet with Israeli officials, as well as others in the region, as there is also this effort underway to try and strike that international coalition once again, that defended Israel from that Iranian attack in April, that enormous air defense effort that was orchestrated across the region. General Kurilla certainly seeing if he can bring that coalition back together again to defend against yet another potential Iranian attack. Becky.",

This was exacerbated by the far-right spreading disinformation including claims the attacker was an immigrant. Well, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has condemned the riots. He's also chaired an emergency meeting to deal with the unrest. Well, joining me now is Milo Comerford, the Director of Policy and Research for counter extremism at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. It's good to have you.

Because of reporting restrictions in the U.K., there was very little information about the individual who carried out this attack, leading to a huge online vacuum of information which was filled as you mentioned with missing disinformation about the attacker's identity, claims that this was a Muslim who was on a security watch list that they were an illegal immigrant, facts that have been since proven or disproven. But this was really seized upon by those who were looking to spread an anti-migrant, anti-Muslim agenda. And this has bubbled out into real world violence up and down the U.K. over the past week.",

Certainly the nature of authority extremism in the U.K. is a very decentralized, sort of online organized phenomena where we see these huge sprawling Telegram channels being used to organize offline violence. You see the spread of viral content on TikTok, and you see on X the proliferation of the sort of disinformation which has led to direct violence.
