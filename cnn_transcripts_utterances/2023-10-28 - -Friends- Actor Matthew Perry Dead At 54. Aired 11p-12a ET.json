Times\" reports that sources, and, of course, we also reporting here at CNN, we do not know yet the cause of his death and the investigation is ongoing. There appears to be no sign of foul play but robbery homicide detectives from the L.A. Police Department are also investigating and looking into this issue. Perry appeared in countless other TV shows in addition to \"Friends\". But, of course, he is perhaps best known for the role of Chandler Bing in \"Friends\". The sitcom ran for 10 seasons, 10 seasons, and he appeared in every single episode. You know him so well it's hard to even separate Chandler Bing from Matthew Perry. But he wrote a great deal about the distinction between the two. He battled with alcohol and drugs and painkillers, and that was very well-known. He wrote about his addiction in his memoir that he titled \"Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,\" including that he went to rehab more than 60 times to try to get the help he needed. CNN's Camila Bernal is in Los Angeles. Camila, what more do we know about the loss of what feels like a friend to everyone, Matthew Perry?",

I mean, who can forget, every time you try to move a couch up some stairs, the pivot, pivot discussion, everything, and there's so many points, and you just can't help but smile when you think about how quintessential as he would say, can he be any more, Chandler.Camila Bernal, stay with us please. Perry was one of the stars of the hit sitcom, \"Friends,\" which was produced by Warner Bros. We want to share that statement we just got from the Warner Bros. Television Group. It says: We are devastated by the passing of our dear friend, Matthew Perry. Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family. The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heart-breaking day. We send our love to his family, his loved ones and all of his devoted fans. And tonight, there is reaction from the official \"Friends\" social media account, quote: We are devastated to learn of Matthew Perry's passing. He was a true gift to us all. Our heart goes out to his family, loved ones and all of his fans. There is reaction from Hollywood as well. Melissa Rivers, actress and TV host, posting on X, a high school classmate died today, so sad, gone too soon, RIP. Actress Mira Sorvino wrote on X tonight: Oh, no! Matthew Perry, you sweet troubled soul. May you find peace and happiness in heaven, making everyone laugh with your singular wit. She followed that with three broken hearts. There are tributes that are coming in to Matthew Perry with some of the regulars who also appeared on \"Friends\". That includes Maggie Wheeler who played Chandler's on again, off again girlfriend, Janice, who could forget that relationship? Wheeler writing on Instagram: What a loss. The world will miss you, Matthew Perry, the joy you brought to so many in your too short lifetime will live on. I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared. I want to bring in entertainment reporter, Elizabeth Wagmeister, as well. Elizabeth, when you're looking at this, what is your reaction here to what you are seeing and the enormous support and memories that are flowing in?",

I'm reading that he had asked out Jennifer Aniston three years before \"Friends\" happened, she declined and then said, they want to be friends, and, of course, how prescient with that, that they, of course, not only were they the friends, they were friends going forward.I myself had a chance to meet him just almost a year to the day last year I had the privilege of doing a show with Bill Maher and he came to promote his book and he was giving it back to Bill Maher as much as Bill Maher was giving it to him. He was self-deprecating. He was kind. He actually introduced himself to me and said, hi, I'm Matt. After he was interviewed and talked all the different things, he was so humble and I remember him turning and saying, is that okay? And I remember, yeah, Matt, it was great, you done well, kid. And it was just a moment, I thought, how many people you've been watching 30 years of our lives, would you look at him and think that he still he was kind enough to introduce himself, wasn't into all the Hollywood, you know, aura around him, just seemed like the kind of person you could sit down maybe at a central perk coffee shop and just talk, you know?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. I have to tell you, I have interviewed just about everybody in this business and that isn't typical. You would think to introduce yourself would just happen but it really doesn't all the time. When these stars are on these press junkets as we call them, when they're doing 30 interviews in a day, a lot of it is very cut and dry.I think from your experience what I would take away from that how human he was. He never got too big. He always thought of himself as a normal person who happened to be on television. You bring up some of his dating history, I think it's fun to bring up some of these memories he has spoken about. I was going back and reading some of his book, in his memoir, by the way, Laura, so eerie just about one year ago to the day, it's October 28th right now. His memoir came out November 1st, so tragic he is gone now just a year after he wrote that. But I was going back and he spoke about how he dated Julia Roberts for a bit. There is a quote in there I want to read to you, if that's all right, something that Matthew Perry wrote, he spoke about he broke up with her, nothing was wrong but he basically preemptively broke up with Julia Roberts. This is what he wrote. Quote: I was not enough, I can never be enough. I was broken, bent, unlovable. So, instead of facing the inevitable agony of losing her, I broke up with the brilliant and beautiful Julia Roberts, end quote. That shows you also the demons that he was facing. This is the height of his fame. He's starring on \"Friends\". He's dating Julia Roberts but he himself felt so broken inside, had issues with his confidence. And the fact he came out to say this in his memoir I think shows he was just a human being. Again, rich and famous, sure, but I think a lot of people can relate to him he didn't always feel all that.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And that's such a great point that you bring up, Laura, because you do hear people talk about being typecast or how they felt stuck in this role and nobody could ever see them any other way. You never really heard him say that. In fact, if you look at the entire cast of \"Friends\" they really embraced that show. They know what this means to viewers around the world. They know what it means to them and their careers.We just saw them get together for that major reunion, seeing them come together was such a big deal, something that every entertainment reporter including myself, had been reporting on for years and years. When is there going to be a reboot? When is there going to be a reunion? And when you saw them get together, you could really tell. It jumped off the screen. This camaraderie, they were a family, not just on- screen, but off screen, too. And Matthew Perry, he was grateful for this role. He wrote in his book the reason why he was coming forward with all of his struggles was really to help people. He knows how much he and the charts of Chandler Bing that he played reached people, came into their homes. We're talking multiple generations have watched this show. Kids today are discovering the show on streaming. This is a series that will go on forever. His legacy will continue forever, people will continue to discover his talent around the world. That is not something you can say for really any star or any television show. Matthew Perry is in a different category and different stratosphere when it comes to television icons, really.",

The sitcom world is very different today. It doesn't exist where people are tuning in every single week to watch, a single group of friends gathered together and 20 million people turning on their TVs and welcome him into their living room. It's an important thing to act, to note as well, he was, of course, on film. He was a really, really big TV actor. And a thing that comes along with being a TV star you really are welcomed into people's homes. So, people fell in love with him. Of course, they fell in love with Chandler Bing, but they also fell in love with his character, Joe, on \"The West Wing\". They fell in love with him on \"Go On\", a short-lived series he was on, the many, many things that he popped up in, \"The Odd Couple\" revival, the list goes on and on. And that really goes back to what an incredible actor he was with such amazing comedic timing. I mean, it's really -- it goes to show that the most famous lines of \"Friends\" were a lot of his, and that's because of his line, the way his cadence in delivering those lines of, could I be more excited? That is what, you know, what Matthew Perry brought to Chandler. That wasn't written in. He created that, and that's something that is really, really nice thing to think about.",

It was just binge watching and streaming?No. We actually had to wait and you were willing to wait, whoever was the Thursday night, Friday night lineup. You were waiting to watch it, and it's because of the cast and crew they were talking about there. And he used that. You heard him talking to Diane Sawyer. He used the fact he knew how much his role and platform was really understood and, of course, relatable and used it to open up about addiction.

He goes on to share how hard it was for him and how much he suffered time and time again for many, many years. Yet he still was able to go to work and make niece amazing shows and films and was really, really able to do that because of his friends and family, including the \"Friends\" cast.
