It says Hamas was detected in the area trying to rebuild its operational capabilities. The IDF says it's working to stop that from happening. And we're also getting word of an Israeli strike on a mosque in Gaza overnight, which reportedly killed at least 21 people. Now, that's happening as the IDF is on high alert for Monday's anniversary of the October 7th attack, and as the region braces for the IDF's expected retaliation against Iran for its strikes on Israel this week. Now, in Beirut, CNN crews reported near constant explosions this morning as Israeli strikes pounded the city. Israel's military says it struck Hezbollah weapons facilities overnight and suggested there will be more, but Hezbollah is fighting back. Israel says about 30 projectiles crossed into Israel this morning on top of about 130 that came in on Saturday. Now, some of them were shot down, but others got through. Salma Abdelaziz is keeping an eye on all those developments, and she joins us from London with more. So, Salma, first, on the Israeli strikes, what's the latest?",

Again, showing the scope and reach of its offensive on Lebanon. Israel continues to maintain that these are precision strikes, but absolutely civilians are caught in the middle. So, far, this assault -- these three weeks of intensive bombardment, including that ground incursion has cost 1,400 people to be killed across Lebanon. One million displaced.

Of course, they told reporters, we simply don't know. It's unclear at this time. But there's two things that Israel needs to play at here. Are they going to respond to the intention of Iran's attack? This was the largest ballistic missile attack, the largest attack by Iran on Israel. So, its scope and scale is extremely large, but its impact was small, minimal damage one person killed. So, does Israel respond to the actual result of that attack and respond in a more limited way? And then, of course, there's a response to the response, because Iran has already vowed that however Israel retaliates Iran could retaliate even further.

Now, one thing of note is they held it in the exact same rally as it was back in July, but some things were different. There was definitely heightened security. You could see more agents on the ground.But the rally on Saturday was really about the honoring the victims, especially the man who had died in July. His name was Corey Comperatore. And Donald Trump spoke at length about him on stage. He actually paused his remarks at 6:11 p.m., the exact time 12 weeks earlier that the gunman had fired those shots for a moment of silence. Donald Trump also spoke about the victims who were injured that day and thanked local law enforcement on the ground. However, part of this speech in Butler actually reminded me of the speech Donald Trump delivered at the Republican National Convention just days after that assassination attempt, when he had promised a message of unity and gave one for roughly 30 minutes, but then segued into a kind of the typical Donald Trump we know, by using a harsh rhetoric and attacking his political opponents. He did the same thing on Saturday, as did his running mate, J.D. Vance. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me. SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  First, they tried to silence him. When that didn't work, they tried to bankrupt him. When that didn't work, they tried to jail him.

It seems like a lock that he was going to be the next president. And then, a few weeks later, you have Biden dropping out of the race, and none of the attention was on this assassination attempt, this incredibly momentous event. So, they were trying to portray him both as this human person and trying to humanize him with some of the speeches talking about the way that he responded to the assassination attempt, but also portraying him as this hero, this invincible figure that could face down assassins, and as Vance said, while Harris was afraid of taking interviews.",

And I think it's important to also draw a contrast of what happened when Trump was president back in 2018, and he didn't want to provide federal aid to the State of California because it hadn't voted for him, he said, even though they had been ravaged by wildfires. And it wasn't until someone let him know, well, actually, there were more Californians that voted for you in the election than the entire State of Iowa that aid was to be provided. I think the Harris campaign is trying to draw a contrast between someone who is very personalistic, very focused on loyalty tests and a president who can offer supporting aid to all Americans.

The Israeli military says its troops have surrounded the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza, saying Hamas is trying to rebuild its operations there. The statement says the troops will stay there until the Hamas infrastructure is dismantled. CNN crews also reported near-constant explosions in Beirut this morning as Israeli strikes kept pounding the city. Now, this is new video showing the destruction in Beirut's southern suburbs.

The IDF says about 30 projectiles came from Lebanon this morning on top of more than 130 launched yesterday. All right. For more on this, I want to bring in Miri Eisen, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Terrorism at Reichman University, and she's also a retired IDF reserve colonel. Thanks so much for being here with us again. So, I want to start with this, part of Israel's aim in opening this new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah is to allow eventually the return of some 90,000 Israelis who've been ordered or who have chosen to leave the north because of Hezbollah rocket and missile attacks. So, what is the situation there in northern Israel? Give us some context here. COL. MIRI EISIN (RET.), SENIOR FOLLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM, REICHMAN UNIVERSITY AND ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES (RET.):  So, it's not a new front. Hezbollah started to attack Israel from October 8th, but Hezbollah Redwan Forces, and I wish that we would show more, some of those Hezbollah clips that they're so, so -- what's the word I'm going to use -- proud of is that they were planning to do an October 7th type attack. Only they are much stronger than Hamas. They have way more weapons, much more diverse, and they were deployed on the border on the Lebanese side. So, what the Israeli troops are doing right now is going into the area that the Redwan Forces were deployed in. They are Lebanese. They are Shiites. It's in the towns. It's in the villages. It's also subterranean, underground. It's cache of weapons. It's command and control. But what they were doing there was amassing these weapons to do a cross-border multi-pronged attack against Israel. They didn't do so. And we have been acting now to make sure that they can't do so to allow, as you said before, Israelis who were both told to leave October 8th because of that impending attack and who left because rockets and missiles have been targeting their homes in Israel every single day since, and they were told to leave to allow them to come back to their homes.",

The world has turned against us and we kind of sit here and go, so when Hamas attacks and Hezbollah attacks and the Houthi Yemenites attacks, when Iran attacks, it's turned around and seen as Israel, the aggressor that perhaps, for me, personally is the worst part, but right now, I just like to mourn all of the people that were murdered and massacred on October 7th, and to tell the people who have not seen their loved ones, who have been in Hamas captivity from October 7th, that Hamas is the bad guy, that Hezbollah is the bad guy, that what we're trying to do is to bring them home.",

But on that same to Tuesday evening, there was a terror attack, which means the two terrorists came in, opened fire with hard arms with Kalashnikovs against Israelis in the heart of Tel Aviv on the light rail, people that were on their way home. Seven Israelis were killed. It's as if nobody notices that anymore. So, we're on high alert for those kinds of attacks.We're, in addition, at the end. It's to me the worst part, as you say, they're on high alert, synagogues worldwide. It's the Day of Atonement this coming weekend, a very important Jewish holiday. We just went through a Jewish holiday, he new year, the attack that Hamas did in the first place was on a Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. So, what we do is we act as we can in accordance with both the law. We listen to Homeland Security, the Israeli one. We try to keep on living. The best thing for terror is if we stand frozen. So, for me, my resilience against terror is that I keep on working and I keep on having my daily life and I stand strong and I continue to feel that where I live right now, the fact that the bad guys -- and I put it in those really, you know, juvenile type terms, since when are Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, or the Islamic regime of Iran, something that should be glorified? They are celebrating October 7th. Don't allow that inside the United States or Canada or around the world. Call it out for what it is, and it didn't end on October 7th for us, and we're all on high alert.",

They're demanding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu act quickly and decisively to free the hostages still in Gaza. Huge crowds rallied in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities, blocking traffic and handing out ribbons to motorists.Now, their anger is focused not only on Hamas for carrying out the gruesome attacks last year, but also on Netanyahu. Protesters blame him for letting an entire year go by without securing the release of all of the hostages. After striking a deal with police, a pro-Palestinian group gathered for a demonstration in Sydney, Australia. Police wanted to block protests on October 6th and 7th, citing safety concerns, but organizers agreed to change the location and route of their demonstration. The group also withdrew a request for protest on October 7th, the first anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel. The group says it will hold a vigil instead. Similar marches happened in cities around the world on Saturday. And as we mentioned, New York City is on high alert following multiple bomb threats targeting synagogues. None were deemed credible, but this comes ahead of the grim anniversary of the October 7th attacks. And as Jews around the world prepare for Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar. CNN Correspondent Gloria Pazmino has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

None of the threats were deemed credible. But as a result of the upcoming Jewish holidays, as well as the first-year anniversary of the October 7th attacks, the governor said that she was deploying a state police force to partner with local law enforcement agencies to make sure that communities across the state are safe.Now, we are here in front of Temple Emanu-El in New York City, one of the biggest temples in the city and a really important symbol for Jewish people here in New York, but also outside of the city. New York is home to the largest Jewish population outside of Israel. And we heard from the FBI as well as the Department of Homeland Security last week that the combination of the upcoming October 7th anniversary as well as the ongoing tensions in the Middle East could be a reason for extremists to commit acts of violence. Again, important to highlight that there have been no credible threats at this time, but the NYPD will continue their presence here and at other houses of worship across the city for the next two weeks as we approach the anniversary of October 7th on Monday, but also the Jewish holidays later in the week.

It's expected to rapidly intensify in the coming days before hitting the west coast of Florida as a hurricane.We're going to go straight to CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar. I mean, really the last thing that folks in Florida need, right, and we just got an update on the wind speeds. What's the latest?",

It's not much more, but it's showing the gradual progression of this thing continuing to intensify.So, let's take a look at the map so we can show you exactly what we're dealing with here. The sustained winds are 50 miles an hour, it's gusting up to 65, moving east at about five miles per hour. But that forward speed is expected to pick up here in about the next 24 to 36 hours. Still sitting over the Western Gulf of Mexico, but it's going to start that eastward trek here as we go through the rest of the day today and really into the upcoming week. And it's going to go -- continue to make its way and strengthen possibly up to a Category 3, which is a major hurricane. The real question is, does it weaken back down to a Category 2 at the time of landfall, or is it strong enough to maintain that major hurricane strength when it makes landfall? Lots of question here as to exactly where it makes landfall. Still could be the Big Bend, which was just hit by Helene now about 11 days ago, or it could go all the way as far south to say Naples. So, a lot of areas. Still here. The point is, for all of these areas, they are expecting a tremendous amount of rain regardless of where the landfall point is. It's also going to be headed into very warm waters, despite having Helene in there recently, which usually kind of churns it up and cools the water down a little bit, it's really not going to be the case. It's been able to warm back up pretty quickly. Now, one thing to note is all of those spaghetti plot models that kind of go through that area, most of them still have it kind of going into that similar region. Here you can take a look again at what we're dealing with in terms of the rain, most of it's going to be focused across Central Florida, but really from Gainesville all the way down to Key West, you're looking at widespread totals of four to six inches of rain. But notice that area in the middle here, now you're talking six to 10. There's even a little bit of a pink shaded area in and around Tampa St. Pete region. Now, you're talking maybe a foot or more of rain from now all the way until Thursday. Now, part of that is we have a precursor event, Kim, which is rain out ahead of the event. So, you've got the flood watch that's in effect for now all the way until Thursday.",
