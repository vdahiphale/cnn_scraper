Those are pictures right there where are you can see police, in fact, in the last few hours, have arrested at least six pro-Palestinian protesters there. Officers in riot gear have been surrounding a group of demonstrators. Plenty of other schools though, are also in a similar position at this hour. Pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University are refusing to leave their encampment two hours after the school's deadline for them to disband. Now, the demonstrators voted to defy the order even though Columbia says it will suspend students who do not leave. And at UCLA, opposing protest groups clashed over the weekend after crossing a barrier meant to separate them. Omar Jimenez is at Columbia University for us here in New York and Nick Watt is at UCLA in Los Angeles. I want to go first to you though, Omar, as we just said, there was this deadline just passed about two hours ago. Give us the latest kind of what's been the reaction there on campus and also off-campus.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so that deadline came and went and in the initial minutes of that deadline, many of those who are inside theencampment and others that joined in essentially started marching in a circle around the encampment, in essence, to protect the encampment as well. And we've seen that for the most part over the course of the entire afternoon. Now, that particular activity just slowed down a little bit in last few minutes. But to give you an idea of some of the dynamics, they were marching around in a circle. We began seeing some pro-Israeli counter protesters as well. I was talking to one of those Jewish students there who told me that they want it to be there and represent the Israeli flag because they wanted it known that Jewish people can also be on this campus and that they are not going anywhere. And so that was the reason that they stood up there and started waving that flag, which at that point was right over where the pro-Palestinian protesters were coming in. And to give you an idea of where I am right now, so that is a lot of where they were marching in circles to protect the encampment. This is the entrance to the encampment right here as well. What you see in these orange and yellow construction vests of sorts, these are all faculty and they have faculty listed on the himself. And at points, they've linked arms at the entrance of this encampment to really show support for these students, too. As I spoke to one of them, they told me that they believed what the students were doing as far as protests goes was in what they are supposed to do as students in questioning authority. And one of them believed that the university was criminalizing protest here. And so that is why part of why the professors here, at least some of the faculty here have decided to support these students. But you mentioned the critical portion here, the university promised or said that once we get past 2:00 PM, if students have not vacated the encampment, which there are still some in there at this point, they would face suspension, to the very least, would not be able to finish the semester in good standing. We have not seen suspensions actually given out publicly as far as we know at this point, but the university did just give notice that they are going to give a briefing a little bit later this afternoon, so we are going to try and listen in at that point, see if maybe they are giving an update on what is going to happen here. But bottom line, students, many of them did not listen to that deadline, are remaining defiant, and even beforehand voted to remain defiant of this deadline and they say they want the university to divest from Israel, which the university made clear this morning, they are not going to divest from Israel and that is the standoff where we currently are.",

But we are seeing them actually pulling protestors off the lawn there and trying to disband them. Omar, what I want to know from you is what kind of numbers are we dealing with there?

I will justgive you an idea of what is happening right now and then I will explain how we got here. So right now, you've got this pro-Palestinian encampment there. We are not allowed into it. The entrance is marshaled by the protesters. They decide who comes and goes. We now have this sort of buffer zone established by the college security where we are also not allowed in, and then across here, Tom, if you pan across here, we have a pro-Israel demonstration that is aboard, loud music playing, showing pictures, playing testimony of the victims from October 7th with a \"Free the Hostages\" banner. Now, Tom if you come back here, Royce Hall, which is one of the iconic buildings on campus right now, there is also a mobile pro-Palestinian protest right now that has just gone in there. The college here trying desperately to balance three things, they say: The right of free expression, the right of safety for the students, and also they are trying to protect their core mission, this is a university of after all. They want to try and minimize disruption to teaching and learning. Now, this has been here since Thursday. We were here on Thursday, it has grown a lot since then. Friday through the weekend, we started seeing some real scuffles between pro-Palestinian counter protesters and the pro- Palestinian protesters inside. Lots of pushing, shoving, lots of pretty horrendous things being said by both sides and also on both sides, there are students, but there are also people from the wider community who have come here to try to make their point. So I would call this right now an uneasy peace, and it is unclear where it is going to go. I mean, as Omar was just saying from Columbia, the demand here is also divest the UC system because by the way, UCLA doesn't make decisions on divestment, it is a broader college system. So they are demanding divestment and the UC system is saying, no, we won't divest because that would impinge on the academic freedoms of some of the other students. So it is this terrible balancing act with no end in sight and as I say, a very uneasy peace. The only way that they are able to keep the peace here is two layers of barriers and they are really trying to keep the police out of this. They saw what happened at USC, the other college here in LA, middle of last week. The LAPD went in there along with campus security pretty hard and fast. There were nearly a hundred arrests and it got very ugly, running sort of skirmishes between pro-Palestinian protesters and the campus security. It was ugly. UCLA does not want to repeat that, so they have just done their very best to keep both sides apart and to keep the police present as sort of unobtrusive and as unoppressive as possible -- Paula.",

I will point out as well that President Biden is scheduled later in May to have a commencement address at Morehouse College in the State of Georgia. We will see if that tends to stay in place or if other arrangements have to be made. Nick, standby for us as we want to check-in in the region now. Now, as everybody knows, the campus protests are just the latest political headache for President Biden. A new CNN poll shows 71 percent -- seventy-one percent of Americans disapprove of his handling of the Israel-Hamas War. Clearly, that's not just down political lines. And this is also interesting, it includes 81 percent of people under the age of 35. President Biden will likely need to carry those young voters, the ones we see at those universities and elsewhere, if he wants to win in November. Now his renewed push for a ceasefire, then should be no surprise to anyone. Mr. Biden's Secretary of State met the Saudi Crown Prince in Riyadh earlier. Antony Blinken is pushing a new ceasefire proposal that Israel helped craft. Now, it has two phases. First, at least 20 hostages would be freed in return for a number of Palestinian prisoners. The remaining hostages would be released during phase two, and that would be in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. Now, officials its hope that the deal would lead hopefully to a sustainable peace and Blinken is urging Hamas to accept. Becky Anderson is here for us. Becky, listen, you've been watching everything going on in the region really since October, since this whole crisis began. I am sure you're watching what is going on in the United States with interest. We want to get back to what the connective tissue is between all of this right now. We have a ceasefire on the table. At least one university spokesperson said today that a ceasefire would help them a lot on those campus protests. What are you learning today? And what is the view from there?",

We've all been reporting on it and are well-aware of the sort of humanitarian catastrophe that that would suggest, and one Israeli source has told CNN that this deal could stop that incursion although Israeli officials are not going that far. So, this is really important and what it will do, Paula, intention here. This is what Blinken, he is talking about here in Amman and in Tel Aviv, this would pull the trigger on a much longer term post-conflict Gaza plan, and indeed Saudi-Israeli normalization. That is potentially on the table here. But the Saudis have been absolutely indignant about where they stand on this. They say the bilateral part of that deal is done with the US. They need to work now through what the irreversible path to Palestinian statehood would look like, and that is what is important at this point, because otherwise that normalization deal isn't going to happen -- Paula.",

But now, what we have seen is, they would take one person into custody, wait several minutes and then do another person. Now the pace of the arrest is happening much faster. This crowd is really starting -- or this protest, is really starting to dwindle. We should point out that this is what university officials have said since last week is that they were very concerned about. They saw what has happened and transpired on other campuses like Columbia, and the university officials here were simply saying that they were not going to allow any kind of encampment to take root on the campus and then have to negotiate with the protesters later.

But back to the original point that university officials have been making that they were just not going to allow any kind of camp, if you will, and the moment tents started going up and the protesters using the tables as a barricade and locking arms to take over even a small area here on this campus, that was something that university officials were not going to tolerate in any way. In fact, as soon as that happened, the law enforcement presence in this capacity arrived within the hour. So they were holding back a little bit, trying to take the assessment of what was happening, but when it was clear that the protesters were not going to leave, that is when they moved in very quickly.",

As you mentioned there at U.T. Austin, just in a matter of about an hour and a half ago, we saw police officers go in and encircle this makeshift camp of protesters that were set up on the South Mall of U.T. Austin. And this is a range of law enforcement, including the local campus police, as well as Texas state troopers that are there in their crowd control gear. And they methodically went in and started pulling out people one by one. Even at this hour, they continue to do just that. Again, as you mentioned, that's much different than what we've seen, for example, at Columbia today, where authorities issued this 2:00 p.m. deadline saying that the encampment there needed to disperse or there would be some type of academic penalty. But that's far we haven't seen law enforcement go in. So certainly, different departments are approaching this differently. To your point, I think the message that they're trying to send there in Texas is, although this makeshift camp today was small, they didn't want that to then grow, to become a larger campus, particularly because -- and just not long from now, that same area where this camp is is the same location where graduation will be.

Today, although that looks like, you know, obviously troubling use of force, you're seeing they're pulling people out. This is much different than what we saw last week. Again, it appears that they're trying to do this more methodically. You see in the background there, this encircling of officers, we didn't see that last week, trying to push people out so they don't come in while authorities are trying to take these individuals into custody. Of course, the big question that people have, why are police going on to college campuses and arresting peaceful protesters? Here in the United States, although there is the First Amendment, you know, under the Constitution that protects freedom of speech, regardless of where one comes down on this issue of the Israeli-Hamas war, there is no First Amendment protection to protest on private property. And that is what's happening here. Universities themselves have been saying, we want these camps disassembled, and that's when they call on the police to do just that.

So, you know, it's a tough decision too. Are these protests furthering the cause? Are people in the United States watching this and saying, oh, those young people have it right? I think the more angry, the more violent, certainly when they cross the line into anti-Semitism, which a small minority have done, you're going to have a hard time persuading Americans that this is the right way to go to turn against our longtime ally and support Hamas and Gaza. So, you know, these are very difficult questions. I don't envy university presidents trying to find that line between two contrasting rights.",

Juliette Kayyem is a CNN senior national security analyst and she is with me now. And very good to see you. Boy, we're glad to have you hold our hand through this as we try and really parse everything we're seeing because, you know, different tenor and tone on every campus.

So, we're looking at a few distinct ones. I will tell you the universal rule for all of them is that law enforcement as your first sort of line of interaction, right? Your first salvo with students has backfire for every university that has done it. It is backfire because it's not appropriate. These students are protesting, they don't seem to be breaking any laws and it animates lots more people, including people that might not view the Palestinian cause as one that they would get out into the yard for. I mean, as we're seeing at some of these colleges and universities, you have a broad constituency which includes faculty. The faculty are turning against their presidents, which is only making it worse. So, I know what not to do. In terms of what to do, I am advising, I've been saying on air the last week, you have to provide outlets for protests. It's lawful, it's legitimate, and it's what students do and should do -- if they feel that there is something to get them out and protesting. You have to provide what I call off ramps. You know, you let them rant -- let them rant, you know, give them options, discussion ways for them to -- or those who want to, to off ramp. And then third, and you're starting to see this, then you enforce some outcomes. It doesn't have to be police action, suspension, academic discipline. You don't get to walk a graduation. You know, parents care about that as well. And so, I think there's -- I think what you're starting to see at the end of this week is just a little bit more creativity than this sort of, well, these students have to be shut up. As if -- as if honestly, let's just be honest, you know, the vast majority of Americans do not support Israel's war anymore. They're not outliers.",

And I don't want, you know, my pathway through the quad to be obstructed.

It is the easiest thing to do, you demand anyone who is in the quad in a space, whatever that they have to show their identification. I can be pretty hardcore about this step that's a legitimate right for a college and university. For students who feel unsafe, the university and college have to provide alternatives to them as well as any others who may feel unsafe to ensure that this is isolated within the university campuses, these are large campuses. It's not -- look, protest isn't like protest is meant to disrupt right we have to recognize that.
