      "sentences": "I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington. Thanks so much for joining me today on CNN NEWSROOM. And let's get right to the news.We begin with breaking news in Los Angeles, where four major wildfires are ravaging the area. The scene is just apocalyptic. At least two people are dead. Tens of thousands of people have evacuated. Homes are burning like kindling, smoke blanketing the city. The Palisades Fire, which is the largest of the four. Look at that view from the air, has burned through almost 11,000 acres so far. It is zero percent contained. The Eaton Fire has now exploded to over 10,000 acres. You can see in this video embers, which are one of the biggest threats in a wildfire flying around as the flames grew. Those of course, can go on to set other fires. Those fires being pushed now by hurricane-strength winds. People are attempting to save their homes using buckets of water and garden hoses. The video here, recorded on a flight as it landed in Los Angeles. Goodness, what a scene. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has deployed the states National Guard as firefighters work in 48-hour shifts. CNN's Stephanie Elam, she is at the Pacific Palisades fire. Stephanie, just looking at that scene behind you, there, it looks practically apocalyptic. Tell us what you've witnessed and how authorities are responding.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Jim, I have to tell you, just getting to this location overnight was treacherous. That alone was something just to get here. I've driven to a lot of wildfires, but that experience was different with the fire burning on parts of it. Power lines down. Also, obviously, all the fire -- first responders who were out there as well to get out here.And then when I did get out here, parts of this area back here were on fire. We watched one part of a building, some structure burned down overnight over here. And you can still maybe I don't know if you can hear it over the wind, but there still an alarm going off in this building. And then you see that deep, dark smoke coming out from over there. Something else is still burning along that building. And at one point, the fire officials, law enforcement came and shut down Sunset Boulevard and did not want anyone to go in there. We've seen other spot fires wake up as the winds, which are just astounding. Like right now I'm even having a hard time looking at you. Those winds just made some of these blazes even bigger overnight, and we can see that they're pushing the wind this way, which is weird, because that's the Pacific Ocean that way. And the Pacific Ocean, normally, we would feel those gentle breezes coming off the ocean. So this is a completely different experience. It is densely populated in there. So, you know, we've talked about other wildfires, Jim, that are 10,000, 11,000 acres. The difference is how densely populated this is here in Los Angeles County and why there is such fear and such a move to get people out. What we know is that this fire so far, no one has been found dead. But they do say that the people who stayed have had some injuries. We do know that was the Eaton Fire. Two people have lost their lives. Throughout the county, schools are closed. Firefighters have been asked to give back their time off and to report to work. We see fire trucks coming from all around the state to respond to these fires because it is taxing the system. Same thing with water. Some people have their water off right now because they need to get as much water as they can to firefighters. So -- so this is a very active roadway. Obviously, this is why they want people to stay out of here, because the fire is still very much intense. And these winds, as you can see by looking at me, have not died down. And that means that more fire could be spread on these winds, on those embers and light fires in other places, just a very dangerous situation. And I got to tell you, Jim, one last thing. The sky has been bizarre because there's one point when it all swirled and we were in a clear little bubble of clean air, and then it just got dark, as if it was overnight, when it was after 8:00 in the morning. I've never seen anything like this -- never, ever.",

Well, the fuel in the area is like many of southern California, hasn't burned in a long time. And so, there's a lot of extra fuel on the ground. Sometimes when the houses catch on fire, they become part of the fuel.Then we have the winds. We spoke about the weather and then the topography with the undulating canyons both in the Pacific Palisades and the Altadena area. It leads to where wind moves in an erratic direction. And when it's going 60 to 100 miles an hour, there's just no stopping it.",

And for the firefighters that are out literally on the front lines of this -- I mean, you're talking about some truly significant work for them.But the biggest issue here, climatologically, is that you normally in this part of California, see rain, some of it from November until about January, but so far here in the late 2024 into early 2025, there's been none of it. So the fuel that's already on the ground and the overgrowth of that vegetation there just continues to be more of it.

So control right now is going to be next to impossible just when you're talking about winds potentially as strong as upwards of 80, 90 miles per hour, we're talking hurricane force winds just ripping through the mountain valleys. Of course, right now you have a very large center of low pressure right over top of southern California, bringing in the cold, dry air from the Northeast.As that air comes up and over the mountains, it warms as it begins to sink, increasing its speed. And, of course, kind of funneling down the mountain valleys. Of course, Santa Ana winds is what I'm talking about here. Unfortunately, as that low pressure exits eastward, now looking likely to bring some snow to the Texas area. But unfortunately, as that trough begins to dig eastward, you have a ridge of high pressure setting up over top of the Pacific Northwest area and sinking toward California. So, unfortunately, it looks like conditions are likely to continue through the weekend and potentially into as early as next week. So control again, as I mentioned, an issue, and unfortunately it does not seem weather wise that there will be any reprieve coming soon from the changes in the pressure.",

The report is the latter.The report is the comprehensive view of Jack Smith and his team of everything they found, decisions they made, why maybe particular things were not charged. For example, why was insurrection not one of the charges in the January 6th case? You know, we're going to learn a heck of a lot, at least from that January 6th report.

Of course, you know, at that point, President- elect Trump could go to the Supreme Court. I think the Supreme Court would move pretty quickly. So I think, at least with regard to the January 6th report to volume one, that's going to be resolved one way or the other before January 20th. The trickier piece of this is the classified documents case, because if DOJ wins its current appeal, that case is still very much alive, at least as applied to the two co-defendants to Walt Nauta, to De Oliveira, and perhaps even as applied to President-elect Trump.

And we've seen that some firefighters have had difficulties trying to put out some fires.For example, this building behind me here, we had firefighters come here around four times trying to put it out. They -- they thought they put it out. But then there's also little flames of fires with the winds trying to, you know, ignite those fires and that -- that's the scenery that we've been seeing so far. And let me show you around here as well to my right, there's other residences here. Manchester, as you can see, there have been, you know, devastated by this, this Palisades Fire. This is one of four fires, Jim, in L.A. County that have obligated or affected about 100,000 people. Evacuations just here in this area on around 37,000 of them have been evacuated. And the gusty winds has made it difficult for authorities to try to fight this fire by air. And its just recently right now, a few hours ago, a few minutes ago, we got note that, you know, now they're going to start, you know, fighting the fires through the air. But the firefighters have worked up to 36 to 48 hour shifts, Jim. That tells you the intensity of these fires. Now, the evacuations took were sent out as quick as possible, and many residents didn't have the -- the freedom to, you know, leave their homes right away. It was so intense that this winds have made it very, very challenging for these firefighters. They're up to 1,400 firefighters trying to put out these four fires. The Palisades here, just to give you an update on them. It has consumed more than 11,800 acres. And the one Eden, which is on the northeast of L.A. County that has grown up to 10,600 acres. Two people have died there, according to L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna and also Governor Gavin Newsom. He said on his X account that the California national guard have been deployed to these areas to try to assist in any way possible. Now, firefighters are battling as they're fighting, you know, at all costs. These fires, Jim, and let me tell you something, I've covered many fires, but nothing like this. And this fire here, the Palisades has been categorized. You know, one of the biggest and destructive fires just in L.A. County, and also one of the biggest and biggest fires, the fifth biggest fire in throughout California. So the winds are supposedly, according to the weather service, they're going to try to slow down as we, you know, progress in the day. So hopefully, that's going to be of, you know, of great impact for the firefighters to try to put it out. But right now, its zero percent containment on the four fires here in L.A. County.",

That is what mobilized these evangelical leaders against Jimmy Carter, had nothing to do with abortion, and they decided to turn against him and blame him, in effect, for that IRS ruling, even though, in fact, he had nothing to do with it.",

They honored and worked for equality for women, including voting rights, back in the 19th century. Considered a rather radical idea at that time, they were very much interested in public education as a way of trying to improve the fortunes of those on the lower rungs of society, and all or most of that has been lost, I'm afraid, with the ascendance of the religious right since the late 1970s.",

Obviously, something was on fire, except that the smoke was going up.Okay, Jim, that makes a big difference because it isn't blowing at a right angle to the fire. It's not just getting blown straight down the street because the winds have died off an awful lot, like maybe by two thirds in some spots, but someone's home right there. Yes, we did have winds to 100 mile per hour gusts. We did. And here's why. After dark in the L.A. basin, something very strange happens. It doesn't happen like this in Nebraska or Alabama or whatever. At night when the sun sets in those areas, 95 percent of America, the winds die off. Well, here, because of the cold desert air. Think about this. The desert gets very cold at night. That air wants to sink. Hot air balloon wants to go up. Cold air wants to sink, like opening the freezer door. You see that air hit the ground. Well, when the air sinks, it can't go any farther than the dirt. And so it has to splash out. Like you just dumped a bucket of water on the ground. Well, that splash out comes right through the canyons. So there's this extra push of air because of that cold air in the desert. Now the deserts are warming up with the sunshine, so that air is not splashing down. It's rising. So, now, the difference. The wind speed coming down, because the difference between the warm and the cold, the warm going up kind of relaxes that pressure difference. But here are the fires we have now, the Eaton, Hurst, obviously the Woodley and the Palisades. Winds are somewhere still around 20 to 30, even 40 in the higher elevations. So it is still windy and it will still be this type of wind for the next few hours. But look at what happens tonight. It does relax. We don't have that same type of situation happening tonight that we did last night. Now we will have it tomorrow night down near San Diego. We're going to have to watch that for a different place. Now if we don't have any sparks, don't have any ignition. There won't be any problem. The wind will blow. But we still have that wind here in places that are still on fire. We're not going to get 100 percent containment, Jim, for weeks or maybe a month. There's so many sparks out there, so many hotspots.",
