There are just now 16 days until election day and the campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are hitting a feverish pace. Both candidates are aiming to boost support today in key battleground states where the margins are razor- thin. Trump is set to hold a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in the next several hours, a day after holding a rally in Latrobe, where he hurled vulgar insults at the vice president. And Harris, well she is hitting the trail in Georgia today, meeting with voters at churches, this morning as the state is already seeing record breaking early voting totals. CNN's Eva McKend is at the service or was at the service earlier at Stone Crest, Georgia. So Eva, what was the vice president's message today?",

But listen, the campaign are not treating anything -- taking anything for granted. They have long described black voters as persuadable voters. I spoke to the pastor of this church, Jamal Bryant, about this. DR. JAMAL BRYANT, SENIOR PASTOR, NEW BIRTH MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH: I think \"I'm voting for the vice president because she's black\" is immature. Is that a part of our responsibility to shift from personality to policy? What is best for your black children in terms of their education? Will the books be banned? Will they be able to get scholarships? Will your son be able to get access to capital for entrepreneurship. And so I think that we've got to go beyond symbolic elections to substantive voting.

And the reason that the former president is at the stop is because he's trying to challenge that Vice President Kamala Harris, who has said multiple times that she is a younger person, as a college student, worked at McDonald's former President Trump without evidence has said that that is not true. The Harris campaign not directly responding to this stop today, but saying that Harris worked at a McDonald's in Alameda, California in 1983 during the summer when she was still a student at Howard University. So again, just a bit of stunning video right there to kick off the day. But that's not the only visit that former President Donald Trump has had in Pennsylvania this whole weekend. Yesterday, he was in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. That's on the western part of the state. It was at times a rambling speech. It was also at times a vulgar speech. Take a listen to how he decided to define Vice President Harris' experience in the Biden administration.

And that's why Kamala Harris herself avoids the question. Look, I've been traveling the country nonstop, Jake. I've been in over 230 cities and 40 states right now. And I'm spending these final closing weeks in the swing states, in blue states, in toss up districts for the House. I'm absolutely convinced, there's an energy out there right now. I'm convinced that we're going to win the White House, the Senate and the House. And we're going to have a very aggressive agenda to get the economy going again, to help everyone. Look, everywhere I go, Jake, everybody has the same concerns. They're fed up and they're fired up about the cost of living that's unaffordable now, and the rising crime rates everywhere, and the weakness on the world stage, and the wide-open border. And they know that Kamala Harris is responsible for those things. And they know that President Trump is offering alternatives. So put the rhetoric aside, look at the record of these two candidates.

They looked at his speeches from 2015 and 2016 and looked at his speeches today and said, quote, \"With the passage of time, the 78-year-old former president's speeches have grown darker, harsher, longer, angrier, less focused, more profane, and increasingly fixated on the past. I know you want to talk about policy and I respect that, but the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity, and his stability.

But listening to Trump say that, you know, what -- what Netanyahu has been advised by President Biden in recent days has been in this response to Iran's attack on Israel, which we know is expected to happen soon, they're saying don't go after the nuclear facilities, don't go after the oil and gas facilities because the White House is concerned it's going to only escalate this war further if they do that. And then Iran will respond to Israel and it will continue. That is obviously some nuance there. They're not saying they shouldn't respond at all, but to hear Trump say that they're not helping at all, I should note that the White House has just announced it's sending a very sophisticated missile defense system, the THAAD system to Israel. Actually they've requested a second one now. That comes with 100 U.S. troops to operate it.

Yoni's father was telling me -- Yoni, Naama's father was telling me though that he hoped this moment could be one of opportunity, that Prime Minister Netanyahu would take this and try to use this leverage to get the hostages home.

So you have Hamas, this brutal terrorist organization that's keeping bodies simply for leverage in a negotiation. But to your question, Fredricka, should they have hope? I think so, but we won't know until we understand who Hamas appoints has its new political leader. Of course, as you know, a couple of months ago, a few months ago, Ismail Haniyeh was killed in Tehran by the IDF and he was replaced by Yahya Sinwar, who then wore two hats. One, the political leader, and secondly, the military leader in Gaza. And he was a hardliner and he really was willing to sacrifice how many innocent Palestinians it took to get what he wanted. So the question now, who will step into that role or will it be his brother who is left surviving in Gaza playing both? And then depending on who that is, but somebody from outside Gaza, they may be more moderates, so-called moderate for Hamas, and be willing to negotiate a deal that gives back the hostages.
