We begin this hour though in the U.S. state of New Mexico whereactor Alec Baldwin will be charged with involuntary manslaughter this month over the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of his film \"Rust\" in 2021. Now, that is according to the local district attorney, who is also announcing charges against the film's armorer. Halyna Hutchins, if you remember, died after being struck by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun being held by Baldwin. He maintains he did not pull the trigger. In a statement just hours ago, Baldwin's attorney called the charges a terrible miscarriage of justice. And went on to say we will fight these charges, we will win. Well, earlier, CNN's Josh Campbell spoke to the district attorney who he announced these charges, who condemned the safety standards on the film set. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY, NEW MEXICO:  There were live rounds on set, they were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those or at least, they weren't checking them consistently. And then they somehow got loaded into a gun, handed off to Alec Baldwin. He didn't check it. He didn't do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make sure that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe. And then he pointed the gun at Halyna Hutchins and he pulled the trigger.",

Our involuntary manslaughter statute covers unintentional killings, unintentional homicides. The rest of our homicide statutes cover intentional. But unintentional means they didn't mean to do it. They didn't have the intent to kill. But it happened anyway. And it happened because of more than mere negligence. Because they didn't exercise due caution or circumspection.

But if you have an actor with what he/she thinks is a prop gun, not a real gun, is that actual negligence if it turns out that, that gun can actually shoot? CARMACK-ALTWIES:  It's more than that. Every person that handles a gun has a duty to make sure that if they're going to handle that gun, pointed at someone and pull the trigger, that it is not going to fire a projectile and kill someone. And this is really about justice for Halyna Hutchins. We've talked to many actors, A-list and otherwise, that have said that they always check their guns or they have someone check it in front of them. So it's not -- an actor doesn't get a free pass just because they're an actor. And that's what's so important.

But also, as a producer, he also had a duty to make sure that the set was safe. And we know from our investigation that there had been accidental misfires prior to this, that there were people that were complaining about safety on set.

Those are nimble, fast, lighter armored vehicles than the Bradley fighting vehicles that have already been committed to Ukraine by the U.S. But taken together, the Bradleys and the strikers really are offering a really new -- a new capacity, mechanized capacity to Ukrainians to claw back territory. To go on the offensive, particularly at what the U.S. and NATO allies believe is a critical time when the frontline has been relatively stagnant, and the Ukrainians are warning of a potential spring offensive in the coming weeks and months by the Russians. Isa, we should also note what is not expected to be in this U.S. package, that is long-range missiles, known as A -- excuse me, ATACMS. Which have a range of some 300 kilometers. That, it seems like it's a nonstarter. That the Pentagon yesterday saying that we have to agree to disagree with Ukraine on those because the U.S. sees those as too provocative in the eyes of the Russians.

Alec's attitude is that there was a chain of command on that movie set. There was an armorer, Hannah Gutierrez Reed. She's also facing the same charges as Alec Baldwin. And you also have the assistant director, Dave Halls, who's taken a plea deal. So there's three people here. Alec saying, although I was a producer on the set of the film, it's not my job to know if there live bullets on the set. I had no idea there were live bullets on the set.
