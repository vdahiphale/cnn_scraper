He believes in giving them the space to conduct a thorough review and to conduct that review efficiently. That's why he's moving quickly to give them access to his home in Wilmington, to get access to his home in Rehoboth so they can do a full search so that they are able to get access to the information so that they can move ahead in their review.

And President Biden's personal attorney released a statement after the search saying that it was conducted in coordination and cooperation with the president's attorneys. And in an earlier statement he said that the FBI and the DOJ had the president's full support and cooperation.And of course that cooperation has really been a constant theme from the White House. They've repeatedly sought to differentiate the ongoing investigation into President Biden's handling of classified information from that obstruction investigation that's going into former President Trump and his team because of documents found down at Mar-a-Lago. Notably though at the same time this FBI search was underway, the special counsel handling Biden's case had just started on Wednesday. It's Robert Hur, he will be leading that investigation. But there is still a lot of questions as to what exactly has been found from Biden's homes and even his former office. Our team has learned that dozens of classified documents in all have been found. No details though on what exactly the documents contain. And Biden's team on Wednesday did say that even though no classified documents were found, DOJ did take some handwritten notes that were from Biden's time as vice president from the Rehoboth home. So, that's the second instance where handwritten notes have been taken. The last time was during that search about two weeks ago that lasted 13 hours at the Wilmington house. So now the question is will there be any more searches by the FBI and it really is still a possibility as this investigation moves forward. Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

His expected appearance comes as prosecutors ramp up their probe into the scheme to stop adult film star Stormy Daniels from going public about a past alleged affair with Trump just before the 2016 presidential election. Trump has denied the affair. Now there's no tangible progress in talks over raising the U.S. debt limit. But top House Republican Kevin McCarthy sounded hopeful that he and President Joe Biden can reach an agreement long before the deadline that would trigger a default, possibly as early as June. REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA) U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: I thought the meeting today was a good first start. That doesn't mean that it all comes to fruition, but walking out I can see that it could come together.

Said it was a good meeting. Said markets that are concerned about the potential for a U.S. default, the first in the history of the country, should feel better about things.Why? Well, that still remains an open question. I think the fact that they had a conversation at all seems to be viewed as progress from McCarthy's side of things. However, the two prospectives which are wildly divergent in terms of what the outcome should be. When it comes to the debt limit, they're still wildly divergent. And while McCarthy said it was a positive meeting, Biden in a statement after the meeting said it was a productive discussion. There is no clear way to lay out a path toward avoiding default at this point in time. And still White House officials make it abundantly clear the president is dead set on the idea that there will be no negotiations despite what Republicans insist. Take a listen.",

This 25 basis point rate increase from the Fed is the smallest since this fight against inflation began back in March. But the Fed is still trying to slow this economy down, to knock inflation down. But it's gone from slamming the brakes on the economy to tapping the brakes. And that is an important shift because it lowers the risk that the Fed ends up causing an accident either in financial markets or in the real economy or in both.And the Fed is changing its tune on inflation a bit. The statement says that inflation remains elevated, but it also concedes that it has eased. And during the press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he declared that the disinflation process has begun and he said he's pleased to see the prices are cooling off. Also during the press conference Powell didn't really seem bothered by the January boom in financial markets even though soaring stock prices actually makes the job harder for the Fed to cool off inflation. Markets seemed to like what Powell had to say with stocks rally during the press conference. But I would note that Powell did still talk tough about inflation. He said that it is way too premature to declare victory. And listen to this clip. JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR: It is very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. Inflation springs back and we have go back in. And now you really do worry about expectations getting inadequate and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage.",

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is no stranger to closures though. Since last February its announced the closure of more than 200 stores. A rescue operation is ongoing in eastern Ukraine in the city Kramatorsk where officials say a Russian missile hit a residential area killing at least three people. Eight others were wounded in the attack and one official says that at least two people may still be trapped under the rubble. At least eight apartment buildings were damaged and one of them completely destroyed. Meantime in a nearby Bakhmut, Ukraine reports heavy fighting while pro-Russian forces claim to be close to encircling the key Ukrainian city. And all of this, as Ukraine is also stepping up its fight against what it calls its internal enemy, corruption. Security forces raided locations across the country on Wednesday. And to discuss this Scott McLean is joining us now. Scott, this has been a story that's ramping up of late. Zelenskyy's very visible fight against internal corruption.
