The year started off a little rough for him, but the State of the Union Address, of all things, even though it typically is one of those kind of anodyne Washington moments seemed to give him a little pep in his step. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, one thing we've been talking about is the White House has been looking for a foe, a way to contrast their economic policies. In the absence really of Donald Trump being in the void, he founded with these economic proposals, limited economic reversals from some Republicans. But really, you saw him try to contrast that, and when Republicans came out in bantered with him, even heckled him, he took advantage of that.

And no doubt, Barack Obama used a lot of similar messaging in terms of the protection of these benefits against the Republicans, as you said, sort of a foil and a foe.So, yes, perhaps history repeats itself but I think Margaret's point is a key one because this serves both the short term and the long term for Joe Biden. A year ago, when Rick Scott, the Florida senator, rolled up the plan to sunset these federal programs every five years, two things happened. The White House immediately grabbed onto it and said, we are going to run on this. Not just in '22, in '24, and this is going to become the Republican plan.

He knows that body. He was able to message in a way that put Republicans in the corner and, you know, made them clap at things that maybe they weren't prepared to clap on, and made for a bad look if they did not agree with him. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK TIMES: Let's be honest. One other thing the state of the Union did, to, he seemed agile.

The other part of the equation is just the contrast of the Republicans are doing.

The \"Post and Courier\" in Charleston, South Carolina, took a closer look at all of that and their senior political correspondent Caitlin Byrd joins me now. Caitlin, really fascinating story. You guys dug really deep into her biography. Tell us about her early years. She grew up a child of immigrants, a first generation American. Her family was Sikh (ph) in a very small town of Bamberg -- that I've actually been to in South Carolina. How did that shape who she is today?",

I think especially about an example that we included in that piece about her entering the Little Miss Bamberg beauty contest with her older sister. At the time she enters it, she wears this white, ruffly dress, she sings a song. And then the pageant organizers in Haley's retelling split the children up into white children and black children and Nikki and her older sister are standing there in the middle, totally out of place, and Nikki Haley is left holding a beach ball. But she's also left with this indelible impression about how the organizers thought, as she put it, in categories. And that sticks with her for the rest of her life. And it's very challenging, as she says, being a brown girl in a black and white world. I expect we'll hear that, as well, when she officially launches her bid on Wednesday. But her mother gives her a piece of advice that I think really tells us a lot about her as a person and a politician. She tells Nikki, your job is not to show them how you are different. Your job is to show them how you are similar. And we see that in her messaging as a conservative.",
