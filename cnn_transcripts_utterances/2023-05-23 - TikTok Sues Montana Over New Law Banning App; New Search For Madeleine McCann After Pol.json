So much so that U.S. CBP Air and Marine Operations responded via helicopter to provide cover while this child was being tended to.Now, all of this is under investigation on both sides of the border, from the Mexican side and the U.S. side.

That suspect is a German man in his mid-40s, who is a convicted sex offender already, who lived only about a mile from the resort that Madeleine McCann was taken from some 16 years ago.But remember, we're talking about a crime that took place 16 years ago, and the search area that they're focusing on is quite vast. It's a reservoir area. There's a mountainous scrubland on either side. The -- it's also an area that's been searched before at least the water itself back in 2008, so 15 years ago. This time around, there are boats, there are divers on the site, but most of the activity that we can tell thus far is actually taking place on the land around the reservoir. So, why are they searching there now? The prosecutor in this case -- the German prosecutor, in this case, won't say exactly, but he insists that this effort is not in vain. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HANS CHRISTIAN WOLTERS, GERMAN PROSECUTOR (through translator): The measures in Portugal are related to the Madeleine McCann case. This means that we are investigating there in Portugal on the basis of certain indications. I cannot disclose the background at the moment why we are searching there and what we hope to find. That is to remain our secret for the moment. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Also, the fact that he tried to reregister his vehicle just a day later. Plus, Brueckner's story has also changed.But under German law, prosecutors need to be able to convince a judge that they have enough evidence to secure a conviction before they can lay any kind of charges. And also remember that the clock is ticking in this case. Brueckner is currently in a German prison serving a seven-year sentence for the rape of an American woman, but he's already halfway through that term.",

Evan Gershkovich's parents who fled the Soviet Union in 1979, came to the United States, worked in New York City, settled in New Jersey where they raised Evan and the rest of their family, they actually went to the court today for this pre-trial detention hearing.And what we will watch to learn more about is what informed this decision of theirs to actually travel to Russia, presumably just for this hearing. It's a really interesting decision on their behalf. You don't typically see Americans who are wrongfully detained in Russia, their family members traveling into the country to see them because it can be potentially dangerous. One other thing we should note is that we do have the ruling of this pre-detention trial. And what it did is the court actually extended the time that he's going to be in pre-detention -- pre-trial detention, excuse me, from the end of this month through the end of August, at least. And so essentially, what that means is that the investigators -- the Russian investigators, who are trying to build their case against Evan, simply have more time that they requested from the court to do so. So, we're probably not going to see him back in court until at least the end of August. Of course, the Russian court system is a little bit unpredictable, so we never know for certain.",
