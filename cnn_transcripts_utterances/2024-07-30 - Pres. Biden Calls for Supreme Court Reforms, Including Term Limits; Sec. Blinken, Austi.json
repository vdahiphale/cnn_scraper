Here are some of today's top stories.Rescue and relief operations are underway this hour in southern India, after a massive landslide left at least 57 people dead. Emergency responders say hundreds of people could be trapped or stranded there. The landslide also destroyed a key bridge. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited special forces in the border region of Kharkiv on Monday. Russian troops launched a surprise ground offensive there in May, but Ukraine's military thwarted that attempt. President Zelenskyy said Kharkiv's air defenses are being strengthened and that there have been fewer Russian air attacks in the region. And the man arrested in connection with California's Park Fire has been charged with arson. Ronnie Dean Stout was arrested just hours after the fire began. Park blaze is now the sixth largest fire in California history.",

It's a very dire situation.We know that at least 57 people have died and several hundred more are feared trapped or stranded because of these massive landslides that took place earlier Tuesday morning. Now, we also know that at least 250 people have been rescued, and we're now getting some details about the status of some of those rescued survivors. They've sustained lacerations, fractured bones, and they also have mud in their lungs. Doctors are having to use ventilators to keep those survivors alive because they've spent so much time under debris that they now have mud in their lungs. Now, rescue operations are still underway to try to find those remaining survivors, but they're facing a number of hurdles. One is the fact that a very crucial bridge that connects to a couple of remote villages has completely collapsed, meaning those villagers are now isolated and stranded. Electricity is also down, so they cannot physically call for any help. I want you to take a look at this video that shows just the extent of devastation near this collapsed bridge. Take a look. (Video of area near collapsed bridge) I mean, really frightening images for these locals, Christina and Max. And we also know that emergency workers are trying to use a couple of helicopters to airlift some of those survivors. But because the weather in Wayanad, where these landslides took place, continues to be very bad, they cannot physically fly these helicopters, meaning they can't get access to those remaining survivors. Now, I also want to note that it's currently monsoon season in India right now. It lasts until about September. So for hilly places like Wayanad, which are particularly prone to landslides, they're completely devastated right now due to this most recent emergency. But for the entire country of India, for India as a whole, they're going to have to grapple with several more weeks of this sort of devastating and very fatal extreme weather -- Christina.",

He doesn't do any of the other disciplines. But if you've only got 40 seconds to nail your event at an Olympic Games, you've got to make sure you do exactly that. He sat on the sidelines mentally preparing. He said he went through his routine 100 times whilst his teammates did their thing in the other disciplines. And, boy, did it pay off.

She said to me, this is what we have to deal with in our sport, particularly in this current era of climate change.But I have to say, I was speaking to Jo Rowsell, a former British cyclist, a little bit earlier on. She said, I cannot believe it. As an athlete, you've trained, well, in this cycle, three years, but most of the time your entire life for this, the pinnacle, to compete, to represent your country at an Olympic Games. And the men's triathletes have woken up this morning to be told that their event isn't taking place because of the pollution. It's ironic, with this heatwave, with the gorgeous sunshine, it's the rain that we saw on Friday and Saturday that has seen the pollution levels rise. There is the hope that the event will take place tomorrow, Wednesday, in line with the women's event. But the contingency, as he rightly mentioned, is that the triathlon becomes essentially a duathlon, which is really unfair, you have to say, for those whose favorite of the three disciplines is the swimming. Apparently, the course is meant to be insane as a triathlon track. The problem we've got is that, at the moment, the athletes are not being allowed in the River Seine.",
