So, I'm going out of the country with my family, and I'm not having turkey, I'm not having pie, but I want to make sure that the people who work with me get their delicious pies.And some of them come from my original \"Pies &amp; Tarts\" book. Some of them come from My new 100th book, which is number one this week on The New York Times bestseller list. I'm so excited. And this one, oh, this is the pumpkin pie in a phyllo crust. It's delicious and unusual and absolutely says Thanksgiving. And some of the ingredients, the pie dishes, I love using glass. This is a really nice old glass Pyrex. I put a little more of name on the bottom, say, please return to Martha. If you want pie next year, you have to return the pie dishes. The pumpkin pie and filo is made in a springform pan. The best nuts. I bought 20 pounds of whole halves of pecans, or pecans, whichever way you say it, for chocolate pecan pie, as well as regular pecan pie. And I'm also making an apple crumb pie. The recipe's in this book. Delicious. And I'm also making the pumpkin filo pie, and I'm also making the cranberry tart in a nut crust for some people who love cranberries. And here's the cranberries right here, ready to cook up for the delicious gelatinous filling for the cranberry tart. This is what I do. This is a nice way to celebrate one of my very favorite holidays. It's time to give thanks. It's time to hope for peace and wellbeing for everybody in this whole world and I certainly hope that each and every one of you has a lovely day.
