More, of course, found in his home in Wilmington. The White House Counsel Office saying this weekend that additional five pages of classified material has also been found in Wilmington.So just how is the White House reacting to all of this? Here to talk about it, Republican strategist Doug Heye is back, CNN political commentator Ashley Allison, and Tia Mitchell is also here, Washington correspondent for the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\" Let me begin with you, Ashley, because we do have the reporting that Biden is growing -- well, frustrated is the word, about how this is being handled internally. Some would say about it is about time because it is not a good look. What is your take?",

And so, it sounds what they're doing today is they're making a statement that we are searching as many places as possible to identify any remaining classified documents, turn them over to the Archives and the DOJ. It is not great politically. I still stand by the fact that there are two very different cases with former President Trump and Biden. But I can understand, even though as his lawyers handled this legally correctly, with the communication's lens, it seems like there has been a few stumbles.",

For 68 days, it looks like, 68 days about they didn't say anything about the document discovery.Now, I know full well, of course, DOJ has their rules about what they will disclose. Obviously, there is PR discussion about that very point. But I wonder, the idea of explanations, the idea of trying to be differential DOJ, is that connecting with voters or is the concern that it will not? TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION: I think what is connecting with voters is kind of on that granular level, President Biden had classified documents after criticizing former President Trump of being careless with classified documents. I think that is the main takeaway from voters, and a lot of that nuance, yes, it is true, it is not the same. The obstruction that was perceived from former President Trump is not the same. The refusal to cooperate is not perceived as the same. But I don't know how closely voters are following that. The timeline, I also think, I'm not sure voters are really following that even. You know, the PR kind of concerns that we are hearing get to this on a more specific level that I don't think voters really care about, that voters are really following. I think the general discussion is that why does President Biden have classified documents the same way that former President Trump was criticized for having classified documents.",

There was good economic news and that's what they wanted to drive home. And instead, we saw Biden had a press conference that didn't go well for him and a press briefing that didn't go well for Karine because they were explaining. So, they were losing and they lost out on driving a core message for them which is a strong economy. That is the problem here politically. You don't look at this and say, well, no, it is not as bad as Trump, and I would agree, it is not as bad as Trump. But, you know, the core Biden promises is that me and my pro of teams won't make the mistakes of Donald Trump and his Adams family staff. Well, that is the problem.

If they are the two names at the top of the ticket, I think it crosses them out.If on the Dem side, for some reason, President Biden decides not to run for reelection, I don't think these classified documents will play any role in any of the democratic bench on whether or not they're going to announce on how successful they will be. It will just be something of the past and a good four years for Biden. But, if some of the democratic side, which it doesn't seem to be and I don't think it should be, decides to try and get out ahead of this before President Biden were to announce, they could really use these documents against Joe Biden to dry and take him. But again, I think because the Biden administration, the Biden lawyers, and thought it might not be as smooth as everyone would like it to be, I think because they are cooperation with the Department of Justice, cooperating with the National Archives, they will get past this. The question is, how many more announcements will the special counsel have and how long does that story last?

So, he can be pretty sure that he won't have this issue like Trump or Biden.That being said, it is still a long way away. I think there is a risk of overplaying your hand, especially when it comes to President Biden, because in the grand scope of things, we are talking about a relatively small number of documents that -- it was -- even when President Trump got issues with the documents, it wasn't that he had them, it's that when the repeated request to turn them over, it was appearing that he was not cooperative. It's always been said that former presidents, sometimes, things get -- you know, there are a lot of documents in their papers that they turn over. Sometimes, classified record gets lost in there. So, I think it's easy to overplay and that's the risk that opponents of Trump or Biden have.

The turnout is a percentage of the 2020 general election. In the majority Black counties, it was 92%. That is that their proportion was very close to the proportion that they made up in the general electorate. Right? In all other counties, it was 89%.So, black leaders actually made a large percentage in the runoff than they did in the general election. That is very unusual. But it is not just that they made up a large percentage. It was also that the voters who turned out, the African-American voters who turned out, were even more democratic than those who voted in the 2020 general elections. Look at this. Raphael Warnock in the 2021 Senate special runoff, look at that, won by 86 points, Ossoff won by 84 points, considerably larger than Biden's win in the 2020 presidential election of just 77 points. And then, of course, in the 2022 Senate runoff, look at that, Warnock overall one by three. Among Black voters, he won by 93 points. Among all other voters, look at that, Herschel Walker won by 33.

The thing about Georgia that I think people continue to forget is that it didn't happen overnight. There was a vision, mostly led by Stacey Abrams, the people on the ground in Georgia, they believe in Black voters. And something that the Democratic Party often gets reprimanded about, particularly by Black voters, is to show up four days before the election. Instead, four years or 10 years in Georgia. There are states like Mississippi that have 36% Black population. And when you really think about the Democratic Party in Mississippi, it is not that large. It is not like they have a huge investment. A state like Alabama, we get a democratic senator, Doug Jones, from Alabama in a special action. Why? Because of Black voters, 25% of the voters -- 25% Black voter population. So, if the party were really to look at the math and see pockets where they could really turn out voters by small investments, because when you haven't been spoken to for 20 years, two minutes goes a long way in an election cycle. I think that you can really see more Georgia, but it can't happen overnight. You have to do an investment.

Now, Hamlin is making a remarkable recovery.CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta got a special look this weekend at what the NFL does before games to prepare for any number of medical emergencies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  When Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamliin went into cardiac arrest, the game stopped.",

They can run a 40-yard dash in five seconds.If you get hit by somebody that that's big at that speed, it could be like 1,700 pounds of force, I was told. Literally like a ton of bricks falling on somebody.

They educate millions of people every year. They do their very best to take care of their animals, which are ambassadors for the species. This was an event that was the result of a crime.

This was a leopard at a reserve in Southeast Asia that needed a medical treatment. We had to sedate this animal. They are that powerful. I know people keep saying that it has the weight of 40 pounds, a small dog. This is a creature that can climb up at 200-foot tall tree, jumped down 100 feet, and dispatch a deer. They are incredibly powerful animals with powerful teeth and powerful claws. So, it was someone who was truly misinformed. Laura, there are many examples of where people -- I would not say many. There is a number of examples where people tried to steal animals from zoos. Often, it ends up badly both for the animal and for the people. Just a decade or two ago, two young men stole a Gaboon viper from the Bronx Zoo, and they ended up in the emergency room. So, these are powerful creatures.",
