First, let's deal with the breaking news out of Iran. State media there reporting more than 100 people killed and 140 wounded in explosions here near the burial site of slain Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. They were visiting the site on the fourth anniversary of his assassination in Iraq in an airstrike ordered by Donald Trump. Nada Bashir joined us a short time ago from Lebanon's capital for more on these explosions in Iran. Iran calling these terror blasts in what is a growing death toll there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Today marks four years since he was killed at Baghdad International Airport in a U.S. strike targeting Soleimani, carried out of course, under the orders of then president, U.S. President Donald Trump. There has been some concern around the potential for violence in Iran around the anniversary of Qasem Soleimani's death but we haven't necessarily seen that on past occasions. We are still waiting for more details. But state media citing Iranian officials is now characterizing this as a terrorist attack. But no clear details just yet as to what caused the explosion or who caused explosion or what the motives may have been. But, of course, this will send reverberations across the region. We know of course, that Hezbollah, the Iran backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon, their secretary general Hassan Nasrallah is expected to make a speech later today. That speech was scheduled at some time ago to mark the anniversary of Qasem Soleimani's killing. It will remain to be seen what Nasrallah has to say later this evening with regards to that.

He was also deputy head of thepolitical bureau and was seen to be the leader of Hamas in the occupied West Bank. And as a leader of Hamas, as far as Israel is concerned, his days were numbered in the wake of October the 7th and those Hamas terrorist attacks that killed at least 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 200. And indeed, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in the government have said that Hamas leaders, wherever they are in the world, should know that Israel will get to them and will take them out. They've also said, of course, that they will be going after specifically the leaders of Hamas in the Gaza Strip, such as Yahya Sinwar and others who they deemed to be masterminds of those October 7th attacks. So Israel certainly has made threats against the leadership of Hamas. It certainly has the means and the motivation to go after them. And although its official line right now is the kind of strategic ambiguity that I suppose was -- seemed quite quaint almost these days, neither confirming or denying, officially at least, that it was responsible, the cat is kind of been let out of the bag by the likes of Danny Danon, a former Israeli envoy to the United Nations. He's from prime minister Netanyahu's own Likud Party, posting on X last night his congratulations to the Israeli security services for the targeted assassination and saying that everyone who was involved in the massacre of October the 7th needs to know that we will get them and close accounts with them. Those sentiments kind of echoed by the Mossad chief, David Barnea, today. The funeral of the previous Mossad head. And I think that it is despite the lack of official admission that this was Israel. We've heard from U.S. officials, we've heard from Israeli officials, we've heard from people close to the government. It seems almost like an open secret that this was Israel. And I suppose everyone now is bracing to see if there is repercussions in terms -- especially not so much from Hamas because I suppose the thought there is, what more can Hamas do after October the 7th? But really for Hezbollah, this targeted killing was in southern Lebanon -- excuse me; in southern Beirut. This is a kind of a bastion of Hezbollah. And the one thing that Mark Regev, one of the prime minister's spokesmen, said last night. He was, despite not accepting responsibility was noting that this wasn't against Hezbollah. In other words, a message to Hezbollah, this is between us and Hamas. This doesn't require you to get involved. Whether Hezbollah will escalate the situation -- and tensions, of course, have been simmering with daily attacks. We've had attacks today from Hezbollah in Syria, launches toward Israel, Israel firing back toward Hezbollah positions and cells from Hezbollah as well. Nothing out of the ordinary there. So it doesn't seem there's been any additional retaliation or escalation as a result of this killing. But the IDF does say, Becky, that it is on high alert.",

Then we just put a piece up on the Stimson Center that how Iran has not been retaliating in a timely fashion for these assassinations and even its response to the killing of Qasem Soleimani was not particularly robust. Which raises the question of whether Iran thinks history is on its side and it does not have to engage in tit-for-tat strikes or whether there is real concern about internal stability in the country. The fact that these kinds of explosions could take place at a commemoration for Qasem Soleimani suggests at a minimum that Iranian security has some major problems and major (INAUDIBLE). And I was thinking, you know, it could be Israel; it could be the mujahidin hub, it could be ISIS, which has carried out strikes in Iran in the past and, of course, Qasem Soleimani fought against ISIS and was instrumental in kicking ISIS out of Iraq and defeating it in Syria. So he had a lot of enemies, not just Israel. And we should look there.

Now you can say that Iran has some responsibility as a longtime exporter of Hamas. But I think it is a way of deflecting attention from the real problem, which is between Israel and the Palestinians and also deflecting attention from the horrific devastation that Israel has wrought on Gaza in retaliation for October 7th. And so perhaps by widening the war, the Israelis think that the world will stop paying attention to 20,000-plus Palestinians dead. I think it is a grave miscalculation. I think it will widen the division between Israel and the United States, which as you mentioned, has been trying desperately to prevent this war from widening.",

If you lookat everything he has been saying for the last year, almost on a weekly basis, Iran is increasing its support for Hamas and for the Islamic Jihad, both in the West Bank and in Gaza. And the Iranians actually did it. A big part of Hamas' military wing budget comes from Iran. A lot of the training that Hamas operatives and Islamic Jihad operatives get is from Iran. A lot of the support, the diplomatic support and the military support that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad get is from Iran and from Hezbollah and Lebanon. And those are not secrets. Those are things that both Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad everyone are saying publicly. So I think that Iran is very much involved, even if it was not involved in the exact timing and plans for the October 7th attack. There's a lot more than that. And the Iranians, on the other hand, did not get their hands dirty directly. And they continue what they've been doing for many, many years and this is fighting the wars through other people, either through Hezbollah or through Hamas and Islamic Jihad, working through pro Iranian militias in Syria. Or through the Houthis in Yemen or through the militias in Iraq. It's a very well-known Iranian MO (ph) and they continue to do this since October 7th.",

I do agree with the author that Iran will not want to play Israel's game and wants to play it on its own. But 100 dead is a fact itself. And I don't think it will delegitimize the regime. I think this number could potentially also give some legitimacy to Iran's claim that it is under attack. It can create a rally to the flag domestically. And in fact it is at the rally to the flag that puts pressure on the regime to actually do something. You know, it's one thing if you had a bomb i Iran that nobody got killed.

When he gets three treble 20s, 180, they're so grouped together, the darts,they're not just all around the treble 20 bed, which is always good. But they're just so grouped, I mean, I think he -- I don't know, 15 or 16 180s last night. His finishing is unbelievable. And when I spoke to him beforehand, because I said it went on my mind 41 years ago, I was 101 outsider, not supposed to win, beat the best three. But all I thought to meself is just you got five or six games to play and each player is going to try and take you out. Have to make sure they don't. And that is the way he is looking at it. Everyone is in front of him. They're going to go home. And that's unbelievable. (CROSSTALK)",

I have been doing pitches with the trophy at the world championships for the world trophy. And 24 percent, 25 percent of the crowd are from Germany. But it's been from Asia coming over. It's just so big. This is going to make the darts grow even bigger. The arenas are sold out wherever you go. And a younger audience now is going to see Luke and go, wow, he's 16.

He has a higher average last night. He is really playing well. And I just feel that -- it's really not -- I wouldn't be surprised if Luke Littler wins it because of the way he is playing. But I just think that Luke Humphries has got that winner mentality at the moment. He's winning the big finals. And I know he's not going to have the crowd, we must be sure, because they're all going to want Luke to win it but it's going to be an unbelievable final. Atmosphere is going to be fantastic. Worldwide viewing figures are going to go through the roof. And it's only playing for our games. So I'm really looking forward to watching the final and may the best player win. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
