And, Will, we were talking earlier. You said, look, this is such a shock. You were focusing your energy today on reporting out what's going on in North Korea, not what's happening in South Korea. And now, obviously, our attention has pivoted to this extraordinary situation. Will's going to try to connect with us. He's having some audio issues. So, Beth Sanner, on that note, just set the scene for us. How significant is this situation unfolding in South Korea right now?",

And I think that it's going to go down as just a huge error on the part of South Korean President Yoon. He has been struggling since he was elected with a 0.7 percent margin of victory 2.5 years ago. And now I think that the likelihood of him being impeached is -- that's where I'm going to put my bets, that this is all going to end very badly, but in a very, very messy way. And so this is not good for stability and it's not good for the United States' interests in this region at all.",

And we have troops on the ground, as Cedric was explaining in the last segment, tens of thousands. [11:35:03] And so our relationship -- the Biden administration has put a lot into this personal relationship between South Korean President Yoon and Biden and the then-Prime Minister Kishida of Japan to have a trilateral relationship, because we see, as the United States, a real interest in having these two powers in East Asia who have been at loggerheads since World War II, having these two countries being united and part of our alliance to stand up to China and to manage the North Korean crisis. And now all of that is potentially really up in the air, because the opposition leader of South Korea has actually come down very hard on President Yoon being too close to the United States.",

      "sentences": "Hi, Pam.Yes, I have just been on the phone kind of ever since we last talked trying to make sense of this, trying to figure out what could happen next. And one thing to consider is the possibility that, yes, under South Korean law, if Parliament overturns the impeachment, theoretically, then the president should comply. But the president's Cabinet, which presumably would have approved the martial law, they also have to rubber-stamp the Parliament vote. If they don't do that, then you have got a stalemate. So it's not clear at this stage if this thing is even close to being over yet. There's so many complexities when you're talking about the entire democratic process unexpectedly on a random now early Wednesday morning, but late Tuesday evening, when this announcement was made in South Korea, all of a sudden democracy is out the window for the time being, the media supposedly taken under state control, all political gatherings banned. And then you have the Parliament forcing their way in, possibly unanimously voting to overturn this, but will the president comply? These are questions that none of us thought we would be asking about South Korea a couple of hours ago, Pamela. That is how quickly and just astoundingly this is moving, this situation here, as we get later and later into the evening with no real clear answers or clarity about what the path forward is going to be in South Korea to get the government functioning and whether or not this martial law is going to continue or whether it will be overturned, as was voted in Parliament.",

You talked about President Biden and his cultivating the relationship of South Korea's president over the years and also just how much the president has touted the importance of democracy abroad. So far, at last check, we have not heard from President Biden yet. We have heard -- we have got a very short statement from the White House. Are you surprised by that?",

So that could be part of the reason that -- but I think also, look, everybody's just completely stunned, and the idea that the democratically elected head of a key U.S. ally is doing such an undemocratic thing.And we have so much at stake with North Korea, as well as with China and Taiwan and the entire region. I think that they probably don't know what to say. I mean, I don't know what to say. But, look, President Yoon is someone who, domestically, let's remember, he's unpopular. He has a popularity rating, I think in the 20s right now. I mean, very -- he's the most unpopular president, I think, in the history of South Korea. And so people are not going to support this in South Korea. They have a problem. (CROSSTALK)",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, President Biden is set to deliver a speech in the coming hour at the National Museum of Slavery here in Angola, but it's unclear whether he will directly address this developing situation in South Korea.A National Security Council spokesperson tells me that the U.S. government has been in contact with the South Korean government and is monitoring the situation closely. President Biden was arriving at his hotel here in Angola after meeting with the country's president around the time that this news first started to trickle in relating to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declaring martial law in his country. So far, the White House has not answered whether President Biden was directly briefed on it, but it does come as Biden has worked over the years to really try to foster deeper relations with South Korea and specifically with President Yoon. President Biden had hosted him at the White House for a state visit a few years ago. He also hosted him and the then-Prime Minister of Japan Kishida at Camp David for the first ever trilateral summit between the three countries. And Biden last saw President Yoon down in South America when they attended the APEC and G20 summit. During a meeting with him, he had said that the U.S. relationship with Japan and South Korea would be the foundation of peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific going forward. So, President Biden has staked a lot on developing that relationship. And then there's also other factors to consider as well about the alliance. There are more than 28,000 troops who are stationed in South Korea, so questions about whether this is impacting them in any way. But, certainly, we will be waiting to see whether President Biden speaks out, especially as he has staked so much of his presidency on the need to preserve democracy both at home and abroad.",

CNN's Mike Valerio is live in Seoul. You were just a few blocks away from the National Assembly. Mike, we were just talking during the break and you were saying what a shock it was to get the phone call in the middle of the night there about martial law. And your first thought was not that it was happening in South Korea, right?",
