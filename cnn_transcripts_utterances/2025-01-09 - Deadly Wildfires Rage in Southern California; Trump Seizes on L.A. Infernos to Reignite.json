We do want to start with the scenes of total devastation that are unfolding across Los Angeles County at this hour, as tens of thousands of residents are fleeing from the most destructive wildfire outbreak in L.A.'s history. Dramatic images out of the Studio City neighborhood overnight, where a home caught fire and then collapsed, sending embers flying. But thanks to the quick action of Los Angeles firefighters, that fire was contained before the nearby hillside could be engulfed in flames. There are now several major fires burning across L.A. County, most of them 0 percent contained, and they're being fueled by powerful hurricane-force wind gusts. More than 130,000 residents are under evacuation orders or advisories, many getting out with just moments to spare. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm sure you have many, many friends who are out there on the front lines. What have you heard from crews about the challenges they're dealing with right now? And do they have what they need to keep going? MIKE LOPEZ, SECRETARY TREASURER, CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS: The challenges right now have been -- you know, is the wind. Obviously, if the wind slows down, the men and women of the fire service can get in there and put lines in place and start doing some active firefighting and trying to corral this. So, that's our biggest hurdle, is really -- is just trying -- is to get the firefighters around the working edges of the fire while the wind has slowed down to minimal before it kicks back up in the afternoon.",

And so, when you have everyone draining the system all at one time, the firefighters -0 and unfortunately we -- you know, our citizens are trying to do the best also by, you know -- they think that -- that they're using their garden hoses and pre-wetting their -- their homes, that helps out. It does to an extent. But the firefighters need the water to come in and extinguish that.

There's a lot of that.But firefighter -- fire is -- gets put out by firefighters. If you lack firefighters, that is one of the issues that -- that really contributes to this. California has the best mutual aid system in the world, where we can move resources up and down the state. So, the governor did pre- position over 100 fire engines before this, before the first fire started down in Southern California. So, we have in motion a great system to -- to predetermine and -- and to get our resources available. So, they use CAL FIRE. They use local government. They use federal resources. So, firefighters moved down there. And you know, the question is, is it always enough or is it enough? And we can -- we can send a -- you know, an extra 500 firefighter engines down there at the very beginning. But when you have 40-, 50-, 60-mile-an-hour winds come all at once with fires behind it. You know, the firefighters are now into rescue, life safety and they're -- and trying to extinguish all at once. So, that becomes very difficult.",

I think if I lived out there, I would have these questions right now, too.

His instinct is to point the finger, and that's what he's doing. Scott's right. There are legitimate questions to be asked about -- about management, about budget cuts. I mean, it's -- the nuance of this is a little more complicated than the way Trump is presenting it. The budget cuts in Los Angeles, $17 million to the firefighters' budget. Those were pushed for by Republicans, as well, who wanted her to cut the budget. There are consequences to all these policy decisions. They're playing out in real time.
