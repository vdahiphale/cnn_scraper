I'm Lynda Kinkade.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, a global tech outage, airlines, stock exchanges, banks and hospitals, all feeling the impact. CNN has a team across the latest. Plus, less than a week after an attempt on his life, Donald Trump was back on center stage, his message of unity that quickly veered into old habits. And American journalist Evan Gershkovich has been found guilty of spying by a Russian court. We'll look at the reaction coming in from his sentencing. Well, the good news, if you can call it that, is we're told it's not a cyberattack. The bad news is, well, everything else. A massive IT outage has scuttled the industries right around the globe today. Airlines are among the worst hit, scrambling to respond. Computer apps have also been affected and the source appears to be an error in a software update for Windows operating systems. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike is apologizing and it says it's working with customers to resolve the issues. Well, the company says a fix has now been deployed. And it comes as many international banks and stock markets struggle to get back online. They include the London Stock Exchange website. We're also tracking reports of a public transportation issue right across major cities here in the U.S. and abroad. And shipping giant UPS is warning customers that they should expect delays. City governments and healthcare systems are also reporting issues. But, the big focus remains airports and airlines. Delta had to pause its schedule, but it does say that flights are resuming. American Airlines, Ryanair, and Spirit, were also impacted, and Charles de Gaulle Airport in France is among the largest airport facing problems. And from Paris to Pittsburgh, customers are furious.

The bad news is, the number of flights canceled today, this is globally, is more than 3,300 at that -- at this stage, which means it's actually tripled in just the last four hours. Those are the flights that are cancelled. Of course, many, many more are severely delayed, with passengers waiting in airports, struggling to check in. That seems to be one of the sort of big issues regarding this outage.The good news, though, is that some of the airlines and some of the airports are actually rebooting their services. We've had an update from Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport. It was one of the worst impacted airports in Europe. They're saying that their systems are currently being restarted and they're working really hard to get passengers away as soon as possible. Also, Spanish Airport Authority, AENA, saying they are restoring their main systems. So, it does look like many of these airports and airlines are able to get things going again. Passengers hopefully will be taking off in planes, just the one that is about to go past behind me, extremely loudly. But, the question remains, how long will it take for those peoples whose flights were actually completely canceled to get flying again? This is one of the busiest days of the whole year when it comes to air travel, particularly in Europe, particularly for the UK. It's the beginning of the summer holidays. Capacity will be a bit thin. It will be hard to get everyone to where they want to be at over the coming days.",

ZELENYSo, I am told by people close to the situation that the coming days, over the weekend hours, are very critical, as the President sits with his family and other advisors. He wants to stay in this race. We will see if they believe that's a tenable position. But, time is basically running short here. One month from today, Democrats meet in Chicago for their convention of their own, and this has to be a wrapped up by then. So, Democrats believe that they can sort of push back on this Trump rhetoric. But, the question is, who is the best candidate to do it? Is it President Biden? A lot of Democrats aren't so sure.

And I want to just highlight some of the newspaper articles reviewing his speech. We saw The New York Times say that this speech started solemn, turned rambling and showcased his all-encompassing power over his party. The Washington Post said \"The speech wrapped a fresh gesture towards unity around his usual dark view of American decline and loathing for political opponents and immigrants.\"Chuck, as CNN political commentator Van Jones said, Trump dodged a bullet on Saturday and the Democrats dodged a bullet last night, because it did seem like Trump had the whole world in his hands after that assassination attempt. He could have just stopped to script. But, it was the same old Trump. Is that good news for the Democrats? CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, &amp; SR. ADVISOR, BERNIE SANDERS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 2016 &amp; 2020: That's what I'm hearing from people. And I've been to every convention for the last 30 years on the Democratic side. I understand the production, and you get an opportunity, and Maura knows this, and I think she was speaking to it, is that you get an opportunity to talk to all of America. Every news channel will cut to him. It was his first big speech. He had an opportunity to show a softer side, and I'll give him credit. In the beginning, he did. He was reading from the teleprompter. Even though he seemed very subdued, only after about 16 minutes that he went back into the same Donald Trump that we all knew. But, he had a unique opportunity to put this whole race to bed last night if he could have done it in a different way, because he may not get the opportunity with every camera on him, all the attention on him to do that again. He is going to Michigan with J.D. today. We'll see what the speeches are like there. But, I think we're going to revert back to the samo samo (ph), and I think that's what keeps making this race anybody's ballgame. I think there is a lot of turmoil going on within my own party. I think there was a lot of turmoil going on within different parts of the Republican Party. But, conventions are different. Democrats were prepared for Republicans to come out of this with a bump, just like Democrats will come out of their convention with a bump, and then will go back to Labor Day and fighting this thing out till Election Day.",

And so, he knows -- and we were talking about this moment that he had, the whole world in his hand, essentially, and he knows he has it and floats these theories, and he still refuses to acknowledge the results in the 2020 election, and things of that nature, because he knows it excites those 2016 voters that he galvanized in the first place. And so, he is really speaking to them.And to Chuck's point, what we're talking about here is that there was an opportunity to speak to the broader coalition of Republicans, the broader nation, truly, the world essentially is watching. And he again chose to focus on just those base voters and to share with them things that he knows will galvanize them. It's an unfortunate use of the power that he really has and the podium that he had to use, and instead of doing it in a way that was respectful and opening up to others, he kept it really just in the MAGA world.",

You're seeing more calls for more influential Democrats. I think everything is up for grabs. I still don't think the President will step down. But now, I'm seeing more and more echoes to where, in my mind, it seems like it could be possible, but I will literally believe it when I see it.To your second point, obviously, Kamala Harris is the natural pick.

      "sentences": "Well, the meeting is essentially to get the process underway. What had occurred prior to this meeting had essentially been a debate about whether or not the virtual roll call should start earlier or later, ahead of the Democratic National Convention. Now, what we learned this week in a letter is that there will not be a virtual roll call before August 1. This is important because, as you've been mentioning, there has been a growing call for -- from Democrats for the President to step aside.So, the drama there had been that there had been some pushing allies, in particular, for this virtual roll call to happen faster than had originally been expected or anticipated. But, the meeting today and the meeting that will follow on Sunday had already been previously scheduled, and again will sort of lay out this virtual roll call process. But, we should note that when we were talking about these growing calls, just within the last hour, four more House Democratic lawmakers have called for the President to step aside. So, while the Biden campaign is maintaining that the President is staying in the race, this is also the reality that they are grappling with. Earlier this morning, we heard directly from the Biden campaign chair and a pretty rare TV appearance where in an interview with MSNBC, she acknowledged that there has been party turmoil, that there has been some slipping in the polls, when you look at those head-to- heads between President Biden and former President Donald Trump, but also made the case that it is important for the President to continue to get out there and engage with his allies and his voters directly, something that is much harder at this stage simply because he has been diagnosed with COVID. What we're also learning is that behind the scenes, his inner circle is getting tighter. And so, while there are some who say the walls are closing in and that it is becoming untenable for him to stay in the race, there is certainly those loyal aides who believe that he should say in and that he is the best candidate to go up against former President Donald Trump. And so, there are -- there is a lot that is continuing to unfold and developments almost minute by minute within the Democratic Party and how they are wrestling with this very moment. But, the campaign again says that he is staying in the race. They also note that he will have campaign travel next week, assuming that he recovers well from COVID. The White House up until this point have said his symptoms are mild and that he is getting Paxlovid. So, the expectation at this point is that he may be able to hit the campaign trail again after being sidelined following this diagnosis.",

So, we actually have a terrific team. We've got a President that has proven himself putting together the most important legislative agenda perhaps in the last 60, 70 years. And in addition to that, we have a great backup quarterback, and that would be a Vice President Harris.So, going forward, we're in good shape, and particularly given Trump who cannot be anything except what he is which is a very dangerous, dangerous person who is filled with revenge and anger, and has policies that are serious to our national security. He has said repeatedly, and his Vice President now -- Vice President candidate has said repeatedly that they're going to abandon Ukraine. They're going to end the war in one day. To what terms? Basically turning over Ukraine to Putin. He has all but said that. So, we've got some very, very serious problems, this nation does, in fact, this world does, with Donald Trump ever becoming President again. Climate change. Oh, my goodness, the answer is to get more oil? That's the answer to climate change? And he said very clearly last night that he would take all of the green money in the Inflation Reduction Act, billions upon billions or hundreds of billions of dollars, and simply terminate it. And so, where are we going to go on climate change? Nowhere with Trump. And it is an existential risk to this planet. So, it goes on and on and on.

We've also have heard from a spokesperson for the airport that they've brought an extra manpower to help out these airlines. We've seen people coming out with bottles of water, giving them out to passengers who are understandably frustrated by the situation.Earlier, I spoke to a woman who has a time-sensitive situation. She is trying to make a funeral that's happening tomorrow. I've spoken with other passengers too, trying to make weddings, including one who is a bridesmaid and has the bride's jewelry in her luggage. So, clearly, people need to make these flights.

Airlines staff have to manually check them and yelling for that. And even when people make it past TSA and security, they're confused. They don't know what concourse to go into the information boards, I'm told from the inside, wiped out with a lack of information.

And this is the balance between making sure that that security update is safe and going to work.

So, cyber criminals, of course, know this, and they do take advantage of this. That's why some viruses will only work on Windows machines that won't then work on Apple products. And this is just a numbers game for them, and they go for the vast majority to get those effects.But, this isn't a financially motivated attack. It's not even seen to be a cyberattack. It may mean that we get threat actors looking at this as a potential in the future.

Recently, I've been using AI a lot, because it's available and it'swhat's coming in the future. These days, you can actually copy people's voices. And so, recently, I did copy someone's voice and sent a voice note to the financial director of a company asking to move money into account, which was my account. This is all with permission, of course. And that money was sent into my personal account, because the financial director believed they were speaking to the CEO of the company. Even though they had procedures in place, they cut the corner and thought, well, it must be them. I'd looked online to see where they were and I added that all into it.

I mean, he has been in detention for the 15 months before that, simply to prolong his period in -- behind bars on remand. And so, that does raise questions about the politicized nature of the Russian legal system. There is a sort of sense amongst critics that, was due process given to consider and to weigh the evidence, before the court made this very serious guilty verdict and handed down a prison sentence of 16 years. And I don't think there were many people that really expected there to be anything other than a guilty verdict in this case, because it's become such a political issue between Russia and the United States.I suppose, on the positive side, if you can draw some positivity from this, it's that a bureaucratic obstacle to him being swapped, Evan Gershkovich going back home, has potentially been removed, because the Russians made it quite clear they wouldn't consider a prisoner exchange, even though behind-the-scenes conversations have been underway about that, but they wouldn't consider actually making that happen until a verdict have been handed down. Now, it has been. It sort potentially opens the gates to that. But, I mean, that deal, if one has ever agreed, could take months or even years to come to fruition. And so, this is still a very stressful time for Evan Gershkovich, of course, and his family. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
