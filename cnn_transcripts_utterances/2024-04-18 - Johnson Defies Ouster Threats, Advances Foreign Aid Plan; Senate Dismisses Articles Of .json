House Speaker Mike Johnson is moving ahead with his plan to bring separate aid bills for Israel and Ukraine to the House floor -- a decision that could cost him his job. Hardline Republicans opposed to Ukraine aid are outraged. Marjorie Taylor Greene telling CNN that support for her motion to oust Johnson is growing. But the speaker is not bowing to her threats. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  My philosophy is you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may. I don't -- if I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate I would never be able to do my job. I can make a selfish decision and do something that -- that's different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing. I think providing lethal aid to Ukraine right now is critically important. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
