Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The emotional celebrations continue in Kherson today. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, visited the embattled region as liberation after nearly nine months of Russian occupation ushers in a new stage of the war. Fueled by the success of U.S. and NATO support for Ukraine so far and election success at home in the midterms, President Joe Biden meets Chinese President Xi Jinping face to face for the first time as leaders. Now, after the two spoke for more than three hours at the G20 summit in Bali, the White House said the conversation was candid about issues like human rights, climate, Taiwan, and, of course, Russian aggression in Ukraine. And in a press conference following the talks, President Biden detailed new efforts to defuse the tensions between their two nations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  We were very blunt with one another about places where we disagreed or where we were uncertain of each other's position. And we agreed we would set up, in which we did, mechanisms whereby we would meet with detail with our -- with key people in each of our administrations to discuss how we could resolve them.

MICHAEL BECKLEY, CO-AUTHOR, \"DANGER ZONE: THE COMING CONFLICT WITH CHINA\" AND FORMER U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFFICIAL:  I think, for right now it's all that can be obtained. And there were some notable things that came out of this. First of all, it's the -- it shows that these kinds of talks can happen. Not just between Biden and Xi, but now between lower-level officials up and down across every issue. It also allowed Biden to clarify his position on Taiwan, which had been, sort of, muddled in recent years. It also led to this agreement on the idea that we need to avoid a nuclear war with Russia and Ukraine.",

You really need to think about a bigger, larger unit of analysis. That is, for example, relative to each other. As well as relative to mankind as a whole. This means that both President Biden and President Xi Jinping should really look upward and see a higher purpose of what they are doing. That is, they cannot just try to destroy the other country or the other people. They need to find a way to get along with each other and to overcome the differences for mutual benefit. I think President Xi Jinping set the tone for China-U.S. relations going forward. China-U.S. relations are not just for China or the United States. It is for mankind as a whole.

Because, you know, President Xi's statements have looked increasingly aggressive at the famous Congress just last month. This phrase, that they resolutely reject into stem Taiwan independence forces.

I think President Xi Jinping has not made any major changes towards the consistent policy of China, towards seeking peaceful reunification between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. However, the China's persistent policy has always been that they were never going to renounce the use of force because there is a danger that separatists in Taiwan really want to take measures to break away from China, aided and abetted by some foreign power. And if that happens, then China will be driven to a corner with no other option but to use force to solve its issue. Therefore, I think the key is not whether China wants to use force or not. The key is whether the separatists in Taiwan should not be aided and abetted to go beyond the point of no return to force a confrontation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. If President Biden really means what he says, and he says he means what he says, then I think there will be clarity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. So long as there is no push beyond the point of no return for Taiwan separatism, so long as foreign powers do not really get involved in aiding and abetting Taiwan separatist movements, then why should Mainland China use force? After all, people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait's our brothers and sisters. Why should we launch a war, killing each other? We should embrace each other. We should really nurture the relations leading up to better (INAUDIBLE) and better understanding and eventually peaceful reunification.",

But I want to ask you, Michael, what about the unbelievably important issue of the global economy, particularly between the United States and China? As we know. President Biden maintained President Trump's, I think, it's $300 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods. As you know also, there is concern about Xi and China's economic policies amid the whole zero-COVID issue. And even at the Congress, President Xi, kind of, broke with tradition or recent tradition, spent less time on the economy, more time on national security.

He did the best of any incumbent president in living memory. He wasn't shlacked (ph), to use the word that President Obama did during his midterms. In fact, far from it. His backing of Democratic and independent loving forces, as they say, in Ukraine is proving to be successful. More successful than your president's friend, Putin.

On the other hand, I think we do need to give President Biden a lot of credit for displaying pragmatism and realism in dealing with China as he did in the summit meeting. And also, in emphasizing of all these very important points for these two largest countries in the world. I just hope President Biden will do the decent work for the American people by telling them who is paying all these billions of dollars of tariffs imposed by the United States government on exports from China to the United States. China doesn't pay any tariff. Chinese government does not pay any tariff. The tariffs are paid by the American consumers. And now, the United States has faced with this inflation. Do something to lower inflation, lower the cost for the American people, American consumers. Let's call this tariff as a tax imposed by the U.S. government, not on China but on American people. So, I hope President Biden really will demonstrate greater realism and pragmatism in dealing with these hot issues in China U.S. relations. You talked about the war in Ukraine, China has been consistent in urging and calling for peaceful resolution through diplomacy. And I still believe this is the only right way going forward to solve the problem between Russia and Ukraine and to end the war in Ukraine. The longer the war protracts, the worse it will be for mankind as a whole. And major countries, including the United States and all European countries, will be more and more dragged into this quagmire. And war is not a solution at all. We need to promote peace.

Hasna Ait Boulahcen was killed, along with her cousin, who is the suspected terrorist ringleader. It's a painfully relevant story, as terrorism strikes Istanbul just this weekend.

So, I was like, wait, so, is the resistance because she's a woman and because she's Muslim and she's, you know, tied into this like \"Islamic terror headline\"? And thankfully, Christiane, we've proven them all wrong and the film has sold out in New York and in L.A. and has been extended.

And it sets gold standards. Of course, it doesn't dictate outcomes in these sorts of custody proceedings or adoption cases, but it simply says that if an Indian child is going to be taken from his or her home, the very first place we should look to place that child should be with his or her family. And if you talk to any child welfare advocate, that is the gold standard for any child. But it's critically important for Indian children because when Congress passed this law in the 1970s, our children were being removed from our families and our nations at alarmingly high rates. Higher than any other population in the entire United States. In some cases, up to 40 or almost 50 percent. And so, really, it was just another round and continues to be today of attempting to end tribal nations by taking our children from us. And so, the Indian Child Welfare Act affirms the inherent right of our tribes to protect our own citizens and our own children.",

My ancestors were citizens of the Cherokee nation long before that United States came into existence. The fact the United States came into existence does not change that. And in fact, the constitution itself calls us Indian tribes, and gives Congress the exclusive duty and obligation of effectuating the promises the United States has made to our tribal nations in the hundreds of treaties signed with tribes. But if Congress can't use the word Indian to identify who is a citizen of those tribal nations, Congress will never be able to fulfill its constitutional duty and obligation to honor the promises made to our nations and our nations' citizens, in the hundreds of treaties that created the United States today.

General Custer had been killed by Lakota, Cheyenne warriors. He told Congress, it's going to be more cost-effective to take their children from them under the guise of civilization and education than fighting them on the battlefield. If we take your children and wipe out their language, their culture and the sovereignty of their nations, that they will no longer have nations to govern. They will no longer have lands to govern. And then, we won't have to fight these expensive wars in the West. And so, Congress said, yes, and that's how boarding schools came to be. Now, to us, we were told, this is to help you. You are not civilized. This is to help your children. This is about to the Indian children we are trying to help. We are trying to give them a good home, a better future, access to a good college, right? All of these resources that come with affluent white families.

If that's really the standard, then we have millions of children living in lower class homes right now that apparently can just be scooped up and taken from their loving parents where they're not -- I'm not talking about homes where there is abuse or drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Obviously, children need to be taken out of those homes. And ECOA requires that as well, right? ECOA doesn't preclude that.

It was debated, and the senators who drafted and passed that amendment and said, no, Indians are -- that's a political classification, it's not a racial classification, they are citizens of separate tribal nations. When a citizen of the Omaha Tribe tried to vote in Nebraska in the late 1800s, his case went all the way to the Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court said no, you're a citizen of a separate nation. Indian is a political classification. The 14th Amendment doesn't apply to you. You can't vote. We had to fight in Congress for that right to vote, and we got that right in 1924.
