He is going to make clear that that decision came from the belief that he believes that it was best for the country for him to drop out. He will say the defense of democracy he is more important than any title, clearly, a reference to his own title. And while all of this comes after a really remarkable sequence of political events, one name that we do not expect the president to mention tonight is that of Donald Trump's. I've spoken to a senior official who saw a draft of the president's remarks and they say that they should expect the contents of the speech to be really high level in other words, to really meet the moment that the president is in, and that the country is in right now. But however, a different person whose name we do expect the president to talk about is, of course, Kamala Harris, his vice president. He will say the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation and of course, Anderson, Vice President Kamala Harris is the person that he is hoping to successfully pass the presidential torch to now.",

So a lot of people just certainly were not expecting that decision.But just putting the politics aside, too, for a lot of these people, they feel like they have sacrificed a lot to work in this administration or for the campaign. And you do just sort of get the sense talking to folks up behind the scenes that tonight's speech from the president could end up having a bit of a cliff starting influence. Now, standing here at the South Lawn, just moments ago, we did see a big procession of folks that work at the EOB, walking towards the White House where we are expecting that there's going to be a watch party of sorts. They're going to have pizza and beer and wine and watch the president deliver these important remarks together. But of course, a celebratory event is usually what a watch party is.

A lot of people were not hearing a lot of what he had to say because of the challenges he was facing.But this idea that it's about the country and not about you. They have been trying to argue that Donald Trump is obsessed with himself. He is out for himself. That is a campaign message that they were trying to push. And you saw it, for example, in the letter that Jamie Raskin wrote, urging the president to step down, that you actually should live this idea that its not about you.

His approval rating was a drag on him, made him simply non competitive in this race. After the debate, it just did. Now, as he's free to being candidate and he gets to be president again. Oddly, if the American people start to view him more favorably, Kamala Harris will benefit from that. And so, he has a chance now to be president. Of course, there'll be involved in the campaign.

If you think back to when he called in when she went to the Delaware headquarters, he was -- it was very warm exchange, right? He said, love you, he called her kid endearingly several times. There is some worry among some Democrats that this narrative that is out there that Kamala Harris sort of pushed him over -- you hear Donald Trump talking about there was some worry that maybe some Democrats think that. I think his presence tonight saying that this is his decision, saying that he thinks it's in the best interests of the country to pass the torch.

And here he is making the exceedingly rare decision in American politics at, let's face it, a fairly narcissistic time in politics where you see people, elected officials, who put but themselves ahead of the country, making this rare choice.I think this is a chance also for the reasons John said is now the issue of age is off the table. There is a moment of relief. He can go back full-circle to the issues that got him into this race, which was about standing up to authoritarianism at home and abroad. So in a way, I think you're starting to hear him say the things he was saying in the inauguration, which is about we are at a country in a winter of peril, in a sense, we are at a moment when it is up to us to defend our democracy and the goal will be if he can make it less about him and make it about us.",

And again, again, if he's standing up for America and the world, domestically, there's nothing that can be done. The Congress isn't going to do anything. Are there things he can do through executive action? He will look for those opportunities, but you're absolutely right. One of the issues, one of the reasons voters were way ahead of Washington in saying, is he up to the job? Is because he has been such a less visible president, way less visible than Donald Trump, but even less visible than past, even if you go before Trump who is ever present.

They said that they felt like the speech was beautiful, that he really has given his heart and soul, and that he really is a good man is what one White House official said.

We already know that there were some scheduling changes that were made to the end of this week when he was expected to do some political events and travel, that had been wiped clean from his political calendar.But I think the two spaces to watch really are, what role does he have to play as he is now hoping that Vice President Kamala Harris will become the Democratic nominee and eventually defeat Donald Trump. He is now the most senior Democratic surrogate for the vice president, so will he really get out there and travel? And what kind of message will he have?

I was listening, rapt listening to all of you and I was thinking like, there will be books and movies written about these last few months, maybe some of you will write them. But in the end, what the president did today is remind us of why America voted for him in the first place. He started by taking on the defense of our democracy. I was there on that inaugural stage when he got sworn in. I was there on January 6 and made that walk over the broken glass at three in the morning. That's where we were when he took over and he has defended and cherished that democracy. And what he talked about tonight is that we, once again, are now passing the torch to Kamala Harris, yes, but also to the American people because he quoted Benjamin Franklin and said, it's a Republic if you can keep it. And I thought it was actually a beautiful speech because he did sum on his accomplishments, of which there are many. The Infrastructure Bill, the incredible work he's done in bringing back the rule of law, Ketanji Brown Jackson. The work he has done in uniting and building on NATO, but he also really focused on one thing and that was our democracy and the risk to our democracy. I didn't find it one bit divisive. I thought that was funny to hear, that's what the Republicans were attacking him on. It wasn't divisive.
