I'm John Berman with Kate Bolduan. Sara is out this morning. And this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. And we are standing by for what could be some of the most emotional testimony in the federal gun case against Hunter Biden. The first of several witnesses that could be uncomfortable for Biden, to say the least, starting with his former wife. At issue, if he was abusing and addicted to drugs when he filled out a form to purchase a handgun in 2018. Prosecutors have already shown jurors photos of drugs taken from his electronic devices. CNN's Evan Perez joins us from outside the courthouse this morning. What are we expecting to hear, Evan?",

We saw Hunter Biden's current wife, Melissa, choke up and get emotional as you saw prosecutors play hours of his audio book, his memoir. They showed pictures. They showed the infamous laptop. They displayed it in the courtroom.They also showed pictures and text messages of his interactions with people who were selling him drugs to drive home the point prosecution is trying to make, which is that Hunter Biden knew he was an addict. He knew that he should not be able to buy a gun and that he lied when he bought the gun back in October of 2018. Prosecutor Derek Hines trying to say that no one is above the law and that Hunter Biden made the choice to break the law. For about an hour, though, it was a Hunter Bidens own voice that filled that courtroom. Jurors were paying attention. They were taking notes. Again, a lot of emotion that came from that. Listen to one excerpt that was played in court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SON:  I possessed a new superpower -- the ability to find crack in any town at any time, no matter how unfamiliar the terrain. It was easy.

He goes with the gun store, he buys a gun, he lies on the forum. Case closed, right?The defense is like, wait a minute, you have to prove that he knowingly made those false statements. He had just been in rehab. They don't explain what it means to be an addict or a user. Users are often in denial about what they're doing. He may not have had the requisite mental intent. And by the way, they say that the gun store employee actually, he goes in there for something else and the guy takes him over, shows him a gun, and doesn't say he talks him into it, but that's kind of the suggestion. So really different takes on what happened. They're all designed to say, if you're the defense, what are we doing here? You all on the jury know about addiction, and so on. This man has a disease.

We know that several jurors from jury selection, that they have experiences with people in their lives suffering from battling addiction. What does this do or not do for prosecutors? What does this do or not do for the defense? From a layman, I feel like it can cut both ways.",

So they're using these autobiography excerpts read by Hunter Biden to do that. But the problem is, I think he's not going to testify, right. It's too fraught with risk. But he's effectively testifying through them hearing, in his own voice two, by the way -- celebrities often do their own memoirs, right, for the audio book. So he gets to tell them about that experience. And as you said, that really resonates with a lot of people on the jury. I also think that prosecutors, of course, are playing the clips thatthey want to play about when he was using and how he was getting drugs and so on. Defense will probably be allowed to put in excerpts to complete that story that are more favorable to a Hunter Biden about how he was suffering and so on that will resonate even further with those jurors.",

The real question to me is, how far did they try to suggest the political prosecution piece of this. They are not supposed to do it. So if they do it, it'll have to be subtle.

He's joining world leaders there to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D- Day. The trip also offering him an opportunity his White House is no doubt looking to capitalize on, which is drawing an even sharper contrast, once again, between him as commander in chief and his opponent, Donald Trump, at home as a convicted criminal.

We have focused on maintaining order, protecting public safety, and treating people with compassion.  Now, I will tell you that in cities, we have to operate balanced budgets and we have limited resources to do the things that we need to do for our local communities. We have had the federal assistance from FEMA to operate the Migrant Resource Center as my colleagues in other cities have had, which is fantastic. But those resources are limited, too. Obviously, if we were allowed to choose between basic services like streets and infrastructure and then treating people with compassion, we would choose compassion in every sense every single day, but that shouldn't be this way. And so what I am seeing is a lack of action and doing nothing is not an option.
