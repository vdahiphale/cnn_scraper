By skipping California, going to Detroit, he's essentially telling voters his only focus is President Biden. But there's still a recognition he has to compete in the early states. He's far out ahead in every poll, but his margin not as wide in state level polls. The electorates are small in these states, like New Hampshire and Iowa. We know that those voters appreciate an aggressive ground game. And hearing from these candidates over and over again that they really want the job. So, after that Detroit speech Wednesday, he'll be in Iowa over the weekend and he made a stop in South Carolina just yesterday. MATTINGLY: Eva, I do have a question. You know, the former president was in South Carolina. He made a stop at a gun store yesterday.

He's, as you mentioned, under indictment, facing criminal charges. The spokesperson deleted that post, clarified he did not purchase or take possession of the firearm.

His attack on outgoing chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Mark Milley, comes days after a new report of Milley's distrust of Trump's leadership. He said Milley's dealings with China at the end of Trump's presidency, where were allowed by his administration, should be, quote, \"punishable by death.\" He also suggested NBC's parent company, Comcast, should be investigated for treason for their political coverage. He called on Republicans to push back on Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's automatic voter registration policy, and in the same post referred to his former U.N. ambassador, and current campaign rival, Nikki Haley as bird brain.",

As you go into an election where the front-runner in the Republican Party literally tried to overturn the election in 2020, and people seem to be able to brush by that and most Republican primary candidates and challengers are not challenging him on that, and you run through that list of things that are just positively bonkers and everybody just kind of wonders by. Why? MICHELLE PRICE, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, \"ASSOCIATED PRESS\": I mean that has been the question since Donald Trump came down the escalator. And bonkers I mean among the other things, he claimed he could design a better fighter jet than the military. You know, that -- that list ranged from, you know, violent to just bizarre. But, you know, you're right, we are not seeing anybody in that field, besides Chris Christie, challenge him on these things.

I think we, in the media, also have a complicated push and pull because I think there was a lot of fear that we gave Trump too much airtime, that we spent too much time talking about him. And so I think there's also that fear in the media and then also the candidates might have some of those same concerns. And so now we're saying, OK, we have to address these awful, terrible things that he said, but also, how do we not then just constantly get his message in front of people who maybe aren't on Truth Social.

And there have just been this array of stories over the past month, really drawing attention to the fact that there is no code of conduct, no ethics rules that apply directly to the justices themselves. Nothing that's binding.And the court, over the summer, in various appearances in the spring and summer, they have talked about it a little bit. We heard Chief Justice John Roberts last spring, and he said he wanted to assure the public that they're taking this seriously. We heard from Justice Brett Kavanaugh over the summer who said he hoped the court would take concrete measures, whatever that is. But Justice Elena Kagan, the liberal, Poppy, on the court, she went further than anybody else last week. And she said, look, maybe we can adapt the code of conduct that is in effect for lower court justices for the Supreme Court. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
