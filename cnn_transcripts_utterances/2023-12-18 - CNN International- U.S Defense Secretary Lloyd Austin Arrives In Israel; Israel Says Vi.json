      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, the U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in Tel Aviv as the U.S. toughens its tone towards Israel. The latest on his talks with top Israeli officials. A new week in negotiations in the U.S. over the southern border policy begins in Washington, and many fear there won't be a deal before the New Year. Plus, pro-democracy activist and former media tycoon, Jimmy, Lai goes on trial in Hong Kong. He could spend the rest of his life in prison. We'll tell you why.U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has arrived in Israel then for talks about the war in Gaza. He is expected to step up the pressure for Israel to rein in its relentless bombing campaign that's taking so many civilian lives. The U.S. is eager for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move to the next phase of the conflict. Washington says that means a more targeted approach against Hamas leadership. On the battlefield, Israel has unveiled a video that it says shows a massive Hamas tunnel discovered near Gaza's northern border. It says the four- kilometer tunnel is large enough to drive vehicles through. Let's bring in Journalist Elliott Gotkine, because these meetings, the Defense Secretary having, very important. They very much play into Israeli strategy, but it could become quite contentious as well.",

      "sentences": "There clearly is some difference of opinion over what happens after this war, and what's happening on the battlefield, and obviously the humanitarian situation as well. I suppose the biggest gulf between the U.S. and Israel is the Netanyahu government's assertion that there can't be a Palestinian state, and that they're not going to allow the Palestinian Authority to take control of the Gaza Strip unless it's completely reconstituted. So, that's the main kind of area of difference.But, we've heard even President Biden talking about the need for Israel to take much more care when it comes to civilians in the Gaza Strip, talking about indiscriminate bombing, and the like. So, I think there were a number of things that Secretary Austin and his counterpart Yoav Gallant, who have been meeting in Israel's equivalent of the Pentagon, known as the carrier in Kirya in Tel Aviv, what they're going to be discussing, what they have discussed, because that meeting is now over. So, obviously, the military strategy, how Israel is prosecuting its war, getting some metrics and milestones of Israel's achievements to date, and where it goes from here to perhaps in the next phase, maybe a lower intensity phase of the war. There is the humanitarian issue, and we saw the crossing from Kerem Shalom into the Gaza Strip opening for aid to go directly from Israel into the enclave on Sunday. That will be seen as a step in the right direction, but still falling way short of what is required inside of the Gaza Strip. And of course, it's also the regional issues which has been thrown into focus even more so. Just in the last few minutes, we've heard from BP, the British oil giant, suspending shipping through the Red Sea. We've heard from a shipping company called Evergreen. There was a call, a distress call, from a ship called the Swan Atlantic, which a U.S. warship went to assist because they are coming under attack from Yemeni-based Houthi rebels, which of course are backed by Iran, and that is causing some major concerns about how to protect one of the most important shipping routes in the world.",

      "sentences": "OK. Elliott, thank you. We will have updates from Austin's visit throughout the day.An American warship has responded to a distress call from a commercial ship in the Red Sea. A U.S. Military official says the destroyer Carney received the call after a merchant vessel was attacked by multiple projectiles Monday. It's not clear where they were launched from, but it follows a string of attacks in recent days by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. As Elliott mentioned, companies that sail in these waters are increasingly taking precautions. The British oil giant BP is the latest to say it's suspending shipping through the Red Sea. CNN's National Security Reporter Elliott has the latest from the Pentagon. This is having a direct impact, isn't it, on countries much further afield from this region.",

Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon, thank you so much.And in Texas, nearly 4,300 migrants were apprehended on Sunday, prompting border authorities to redirect personnel to deal with the ongoing surge. Later today, Texas Governor Greg Abbott is expected to sign a new immigration bill that would make it a new state crime to enter Texas illegally from Mexico. As these moves play out on the border, U.S. senators are struggling to reach a deal on immigration reform in Washington, D.C., and the immigration impasse means aid for Israel and Ukraine remains stalled on Capitol Hill as well. It's all linked up. Lauren Fox is trying to make sense of it all. If this isn't agreed by the end of the year, then we're going into next year in a situation where Ukraine won't be getting the money it needs.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. That's exactly right, Max. And right now, what is clear is that negotiators are making progress. They met repeatedly over the weekend. They'll meet again today. And they continue to try and find a path forward. But also, they are coming up against the realities of what is a complex political issue, which is dealing with immigration, and border policy changes with Republicans and Democrats who have long been entrenched in these issues.One of the things that became very clear over the weekend is that they did not have a framework to announce. They didn't have an agreement in principle. And what that means is that putting something into legislative text, getting it voted on out of the Senate, and getting it passed before the New Year is really unlikely at this point, especially given the fact that the House of Representatives has already left home, or already left Washington for home for the season. But, it's also true that this could continue to be a major issue that lawmakers discuss when they return in January. The issue with that, of course, is that they are going to be coming back to a very real spending deadline come January 19. So, that means that if they don't find a path forward now, when they come back in January, they're going to be dealing with this issue of Ukraine funding and immigration policy at the same time when they're trying to ensure that the United States's government continues to be funded. So, a very messy January if lawmakers can't find a way forward in the next couple of days.",

This massive storm that originally started in the southern United States made its way towards the north, and overnight, experienced a combination of heavy rains and also heavy winds. Now, finally, after a very busy night, a break in the clouds off in the distance, the coast, Max, just beyond what we're reporting from right now, that is a promising sign that things are getting back to normal, as those heavy winds caused some power outages, at last check, nearly a quarter million customers in and around the New England area still in the dark.So, even though there is that break in the clouds, those effects are still being effect -- still being felt, I should say. But, nonetheless, there seems to be that the storm is moving very quickly through the area, things improving very quickly from one hour to the next. So, there is hope that that normalcy will be restored throughout the Northeast very quickly. But, again, millions of Americans, flights also affected to a certain extent, not just from Florida, but all the way up to the state of Maine. Back to you.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. No question about it. I think the pressure coming from domestically and the pressure coming from abroad are two different types of pressure and focus on different things. Certainly, from the United States' standpoint, it is urging the Israeli government to transition to a new phase of fighting, a phase that would see less intensive bombing of the Gaza Strip, more targeted special operations raids that rather than this kind of all-out ground offensive that we are seeing in both northern and southern Gaza. And of course, the United States wants to see that transition happen a lot sooner than Israeli officials do themselves.But, nonetheless, Israeli officials are listening to the United States. They are having these meetings. Secretary Austin is here today with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, just days after the National Security Advisor was here. And the question is, how quickly will that pressure come to bear, and will it actually accelerate a timeline for transition from Israeli officials? Now, the pressure that Netanyahu is facing domestically is far more focused on the issue of the hostages. We watched as those two kind of collided on Friday as Israeli military operations resulted in the killing by an Israeli soldier of three Israeli hostages who were being held in the Gaza Strip. And over the weekend, we saw spontaneous demonstrations of hundreds of people who came out in Tel Aviv, demanding that the Israeli government reach a deal as soon as possible for the release of the other hostages. Now, the extent to which those two issues kind of come together in terms of the military campaign and a hostage deal, it kind of remains uncertain at this point. Support in Israel for the war effort is still very, very high, despite this pressure on the hostage release. But, there is no question that Netanyahu is getting a lot of different pressure that he is having to deal with. And he is also very unpopular in Israel at the moment, and a lot of Israelis are wondering, after this war, whether or not he will still remain Prime Minister.",

We know that the U.S. has been kind of spitballing ideas with the Israelis and with the Qataris to see what kind of deal would be acceptable to Israel first, and then to try and bring those ideas to Hamas, via the Qatari government, to see if there is something that can be worked out here. I mean, it does appear like there is some movement beginning once again. The head of the Mossad, David Barnea, he was in Qatar over the weekend, meeting with the Qatari Prime Minister to discuss a potential resumption of the talks.I mean, from the Israeli vantage, it's clear that they need to see all women, who still remain in custody in Hamas, released as part of any kind of deal to move forward. They're not going to move towards men and Israeli soldiers until they get all the women out. Now, there is the possibility of the remaining women being wrapped up in kind of a broader deal. But, again, there are questions about the extent to which the military pressure is working on Hamas, if indeed, that will drive them back to the table, or if instead, it's perhaps making them kind of retreat and be more recalcitrant to the idea of negotiations and of forming a deal going forward.",
