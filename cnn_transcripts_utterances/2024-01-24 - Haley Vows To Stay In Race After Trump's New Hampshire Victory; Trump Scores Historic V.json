Republic bookings have insisted that if they move forward, any new aid Ukraine, which is calling for aid immediately, that there must be a deal on the border, something to their satisfaction. But there is no agreement on either, leaving deep divisions within the ranks, some demanding that the free of senators trying to cut a deal on immigration, release more information about those talks and others openly questioning the Senate Republican leader and his handling of all of this.

He says that they should they should reject it if it is not to the -- exactly to their liking.And that does have influence within the ranks particularly among on the fence Republicans, some of them say, let's just wait until the New Year.

While Russia swears Ukrainian prisoners of war were all onboard. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in eastern Ukraine for us as the White House is attempting to get more information on what actually happened.

After the impact, the jet explodes in a giant fireball. I heard only two explosions, this eyewitness says, the first one was adult bang, then an explosion, then big flames. Russian media showing debris scattered across a large area at the crash site. Authorities say, no one onboard survived including 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war set to be exchanged the same day. Moscow blaming Kyiv for the incident, (AUDIO GAP) side launched an air defense missile from the Kharkiv side, Russia's foreign minister said it targeted the airplane and was a fatal strike. The Ukrainians haven't denied shooting the plane down, but Kyiv says, the Russians never told them they'd be flying the Ukrainian POWs to Belgorod, holding Moscow responsible for the loss of life and the failed exchange. Landing a transport plane in a 30 kilometer combat zone cannot be safe. And in any case, should be discussed by both sides, because otherwise, it jeopardizes the entire exchange process, a military intelligence statement says. Based on this, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions of the Russian Federation to destabilize the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our country. Ukraine says Russia often uses the IL-76 cargo jets to transport missiles used to target Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure. A recent attack killing and wounding scores in Kharkiv in Ukraine's northeast. When the missile attack started, I kneel down near the washing machine, this woman says, look, something hit me here, glass, glass, but I'm alive. Some people died and my flat is gone. The Ukrainians have vowed revenge for missile attacks like these and say, they consider Russian cargo planes transporting missiles to be legitimate targets. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
