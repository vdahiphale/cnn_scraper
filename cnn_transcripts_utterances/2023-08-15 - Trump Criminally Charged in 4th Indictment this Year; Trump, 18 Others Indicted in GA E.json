The chronicle, the conspiracies, the phone calls, the emails, the oval office meetings and the videotape lies that follow.Plus Trump's aid team. The Co-conspirators in the former president's election heights featured two movie poster names. Mark Meadows is the one time Trump White House Chief of Staff and Rudy Giuliani, the Mayor who built his brand on locking up the mob and a pivot point or a shrug at the surreal. Indictment number four will test Donald Trump's theory that another set of criminal charges will clinch the Republican nomination. I'm Phil Mattingly in for Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines on Inside Politics. Up first for us today what Georgia Prosecutors say they can prove against Donald Trump? Forgery, intimidation, fraud, perjury, hacking, all in furtherance of a racketeering scheme is helmed by the former president. The Atlanta Journal Constitution on the front page laying out the sprawling scope of the new charges with Trump at its center. The Drudge Report captures the law and order like drama, prosecutors painting the former president as a 21st century Corleone, the Head of let's call it La Cosa Trump. Last night America watched the indictments make its way in and then back out of a Fulton County courtroom. A choreography that previews what could be a rolling spectacle, potentially live televised trial of the former president. The next important date on the calendar, August 25, that's the deadline for Mr. Trump to surrender. We start our coverage outside the courthouse with CNN's Paula Reid. Paula, you've been covering this so closely, along with the other indictments as well. What stood out to you in these 98 pages?",

Now, these are laws that were designed to dismantle organized crime. So here she is alleging a conspiracy and charging not only former President Trump but 18 of his allies, even if each of them were not involved in each of the alleged acts.She's charging them as a unit. Now, it's also notable that she is charging other people, not just former President Trump, which is what we've seen so far with the special counsel. And here are two of the names that stick out of course, Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows. Rudy Giuliani was mentioned in the federal indictment, but he was a co- conspirator, he wasn't charged. Mark Meadows, the man at the January 6 committee said was at the center of this entire conspiracy was conspicuously absent from the federal indictment, so notable that she chose to charge so many co- defendants, including these big names. Now, Phil, of course, there are some logistical questions about exactly how she was going to prosecute a case like this, given the time constraints with the election. Let's take a listen to what you said last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Election interference, this election interference has been charged by Jack Smith, I would have less of a problem with this if she decided OK, and I'm not going to charge Donald Trump here because he's been charged for essentially this conduct by Jack Smith.

So there is going to probably have to be some kind of workout between the special counsel and the state. But I think, you know, the former governor's criticism is kind of an odd one. Because, you know, this does happen all the time. And sometimes, especially when there's a major crime, you see this all the time, that state charges and the feds charge, and sometimes the feds decide to go first. And then the state comes in afterwards. One of the things that happen often is, in case of a case that, for example, one of the prosecutions fails, you have another one that backs it up. And in this case, for instance, there's a concern that if Donald Trump wins election, he's going to pardon himself, right or Republican wins the election, they'll pardon him. And so the state charge could be a way for Donald Trump to face some consequence. That is not at the mercy of a Republican president.",

And they believe it is working and so they're going to continue to use it his team tells me. But one thing that I found really interesting is what Donald Trump posted this morning on true social.He said that he was, \"Hosting a major news conference at 11 a.m. on Monday of next week in Bedminster, New Jersey\". And Phil, he said that he's going to use those public remarks to present a report that his team has been working on, riddled really with the false claims that the election results in Georgia in 2020 were rife with fraud. Now, of course, we know Donald Trump has been peddling these claims for years now. And we know they're just simply not true. There were two recounts in Georgia that show Joe Biden won the majority of votes in the state. But this is clearly what Donald Trump and his team are using to deploy as their strategy to defend him. But one thing that I found really interesting about this is they're not just going to be arguing that this is election interference, and that Donald Trump is a victim of political persecution. Of course, they will argue that, but they're also going to be disputing the facts of the case. And that is a bit different here. And one thing, Phil, that I'm really watching for is how Donald Trump's allies will react to that report.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: Every time they file an indictment, we go way up in the polls.

But in this case, while I don't think that each indictment has caused him to have a massive spike, or however he defined it, it certainly has caused a bit of a rally around him effect. And it has made it harder for his opponents who are trying to introduce themselves to the Republican field, to be able to get oxygen airtime and to be able to differentiate themselves. Of course, so many Republicans, even those who aren't necessarily planning to vote for Trump, nevertheless, are sympathetic to his arguments that he's being prosecuted because he is a political opponent, because he is who he is that the charges are too sweeping that they're unfair. And because Republicans are sympathetic to this, it's put his opponents in the primary in a box, where they are unable to really say, hey, Donald Trump could be facing prison time, we cannot nominate this guy. It winds up meaning that folks like Ron DeSantis are in a very tough spot. They can't differentiate themselves effectively. And it's made it harder for them to gain traction. So while these indictments, I wouldn't expect Trump to bounce 15 points in the polls, per se, it does further solidify, I think his larger gains that he's seen over the last couple of months.",

David -- I do want to ask you, the thing I've been thinking about all day, and I definitely don't have an answer to yet is, we have been talking about the cash crunch based on the legal issues that the former president has been having over the course of the last couple of weeks. The FEC filings really kind of laid that bear to some degree. This is the former president another indictment 18 co-conspirators, he's been helping or financing all of the legal fees for his allies here.
