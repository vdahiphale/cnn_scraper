It is already 2025, of course in much of Asia. And CNN has taken you from the fireworks in Sydney harbor and will be with you all the way to the ball dropping in New York.And Abu Dhabi has a record setting firework plan. They've been launching fireworks every hour leading up to midnight. That is all part of an attempt to set six Guinness World records during the celebrations at the Sheikh Zayed Festival about 45 minutes from where we are here in Dubai. And then in less than an hour when midnight strikes, there will be an hour long presentation of fireworks in the Abu Dhabi Al Wathba desert. You will not want to miss that. Well, back, -- well, back to Dubai where the excitement is also building towards the start of the New Year at the top of the hour. Here joining us now, Malaysian entrepreneur, motivational speaker and businessman Vishen Lakhiani, the CEO, founder, mind behind Mindvalley, which is a global.

Here, let me just explain what we're going to do here, because we're at Expo City. This is where the Expo was held back in 2021. And this Al Wasl Dome is the sort of centerpiece of what is this remarkable new part of Dubai.So you're going to see the fireworks here. You're also going to see the fireworks at the Burj Khalifa. And they will be impressive, let me tell you. They always are. Always absolutely fantastic. But as I said a little bit earlier on, you also are going to get to experience the desert in Abu Dhabi this year, Al Wathba, where the Sheikh Zayed Festival is being held. And they are hoping to break a whole load of records tonight with fireworks and leisure shows and drone shows. So we're going to see those. You'll see them on your screens just, what, 90 seconds or so from now. This is going to be us ringing in. And what you'll see around this dome here, just moments from now is the countdown clock. And that countdown clock will begin at about 30 seconds to go. And you'll hear the countdown happening in languages from all over the world. Look, there's more than 200 nationalities here in Dubai. And that will be reflected at least in part tonight by a countdown in multiple languages. We'll get to 10. That'll be in English. And that is where I know you will hear this crowd go absolutely wild. In fact, I think they're beginning. You can feel it coming. Feel it coming, guys. They're getting the projections ready to go. As we leave 24 behind you. Say goodbye. Good riddance. Oh, that wasn't bad, but it's going to be better in 25.",
