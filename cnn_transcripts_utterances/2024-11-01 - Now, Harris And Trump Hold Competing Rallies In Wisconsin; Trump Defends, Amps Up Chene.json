So, when he has that imagery of shots to the face, regardless of how his MAGA supporters want to slice it, he used that very, very strategically in that moment.

You know, Kamala Harris said, this is disqualifying. The voters are going to decide that. And what we saw in previous elections is that they didn't disqualify him.
