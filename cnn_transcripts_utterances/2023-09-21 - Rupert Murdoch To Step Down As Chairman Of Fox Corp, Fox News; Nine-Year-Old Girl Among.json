They are going inside and they are going to have a bilateral meeting going on there.And then after that meeting, they are all expected to go and lay a wreath at the 9/11 Memorial. These are significant moments as Ukraine is still in the midst of a terribly deadly war. And Zelenskyy is asking the United States for more help to try to push Russia out of his country. Over to, Kate. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, we'll continue to follow those developments over the Pentagon. We're also taking -- we're also watching very closely this, a possible breakthrough in Hollywood after nearly five months of a standoff. The studios in the Writers Union, they seem to be making strides in contract negotiations. This morning, writers and executives from four major studios are planning a second day of talks. Yesterday ended with people feeling -- \"feeling encouraged\" is how it's described to a person familiar with the discussions. And they also issued a joint statement to say that they would be meeting again today which -- that in and of itself at this point is a sign of progress. CNN's Natasha Chen is live in Los Angeles for us. She's got more on this. How -- at this point, I mean, this strike has dragged on for that -- has gone on for months now.

It's a good sign that they are back at the table this week after more than four and a half months of being on strike for the writers. Of course, the actors joined them for the last two months.Just to remind folks because it has been several months what the writers are fighting for. Let's take a look at those bullet points. They would like to see better residuals when it comes to streaming content. So, right now, one of the problems is when you see -- watch a Netflix show or watch a show on any streaming platform, there's very little information about how many times that is being viewed versus a traditional network show where that -- those residuals were very carefully calculated, and people would get a bigger check for that. They also want protections as far as artificial intelligence is concerned in terms of AI, perhaps taking over a lot of the writing that's happening. And they would like to see minimum staffing levels and duration of employment instead of what are you know trending as what's called mini rooms. So, there are a lot of issues that they have to go through. There were CEOs of major studios in the room yesterday, the CEOs of Disney, of Warner Brothers Discovery, of Netflix, and the head of NBC Universal. And so yes, the description was that they were feeling encouraged by this. But there's still a lot of skepticism as well among rank-and-file writers and actors. Our crew met up with an actor, Noah Wyle, whom you might remember from ER on the picket line. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You miss that window and there's a de facto push to the after the holidays because nobody's going to want to work or put anything to you know green light before then.

I've been wanting to get you on the show and I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. You were recently -- you recently submitted just this week, a report from your findings of being on the ground in Ukraine and what you have learned. And to summarize for everyone some of what came out of your report, two lines really stuck out to me from your report. I'll read them for everyone. Russia's armed aggression is becoming synonymous with torture and other inhumane -- inhuman cruelty. And even worse was this. These grievous acts appear to neither to be -- to be neither random nor incidental but rather orchestrated as part of a state policy. What did you find? What did you see and hear when you were there to lead you to what is really a horrific and brutal conclusion? DR. ALICE EDWARDS, UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON TORTURE: Thanks so much for having me on and for continuing to broadcast these important issues. Look. It's a very grim situation and seems to be getting worse as the conflict continues. I met with a number of victims and survivors of detention by Russian forces in the occupied areas, both men and women. Their stories are quite harrowing, brutal, torture, orchestrated, in my opinion, at the highest levels. I've called on the Russian authorities to send a signal to their soldiers and to the military command that any form of abuse and torture is unacceptable. They haven't done it.",

They had 60 days to reply. They haven't done so.This letter that I sent is part of the procedures that I'm part of which is to advise the Human Rights Council of the United Nations. And I've put them on notice essentially that they are required now. They have a duty to investigate and prosecute their own forces who may have been engaged in this conduct. According to the Ukrainian authorities, they have opened 103,000 proceedings into different types of criminal behavior. And of those -- of the detention cases, they report that 90 percent of their soldiers, as well as civilians, are reporting torture and other forms of inhuman treatment. The people I spoke to back that up both victims and survivors, but also their advocates and lawyers. I found the information to be credible, I found a pattern of abuse and a system of abuse. It's -- you can't turn a blind eye once you're on notice. And if you don't do anything about it, it is also part of state policy. [11:45:01] BOLDUAN: I mean I think no one would ever want to be excused to have very little confidence that the Russian president would be changing tactics at this point if they have little confidence or hope that that would happen, and so because as Vladimir Putin is currently himself facing war crimes at the ICC. Short of making the war end if you will, I mean, do you think anything is going to stop this behavior as this drags on? I mean, how do you hold these people accountable?",

What I was impressed about in this conflict compared to many others is that this documentation and investigation of such war crimes is being undertaken in real-time. They are conducting as best as possible with the resources that they have, which is increasing all the time, forensic documentation, as well as taking testimonies, as well as providing support to victims and survivors.But short of the end of the war, there are also challenges to the investigations and prosecutions, not least the Ukrainians do not have control over much of the territory in which such crimes are being committed. I also heard worries now amongst the Ukrainian authorities that in fact, after prisoner swaps, those that are left behind are being treated far worse than those that have been released. Kind of as an intimidation and threat to all of us in the international community not to speak up and to speak out. So, it's a very worrying trend. And peace really is the only way to solve it.",

They did not see this coming.This is an embarrassing defeat for Kevin McCarthy and his leadership team. It is the second time that a procedural vote on a defense bill has failed on the House floor this week. Usually, you don't see those things fail at all. They typically have party-line votes for these procedural votes. Typically, they do not put stuff on the floor if leadership thinks it's going to fail. And after it failed the first time this week, they went back to the drawing board. They tried to get conservatives on board. They had this two-hour meeting yesterday, where they worked out their differences. And they thought they finally had a path ahead. But it turns out they did it. In fact, two Republicans who had initially voted for that same vote earlier this week, they flipped and voted against it. So, their problems -- their math problems are getting worse And I think the big picture here, John, is that the House is paralyzed right now. They can't move forward. They're trying to do spending bills in the long term. They can't do that. They're trying to do a short-term funding bill, but they're not going to be able to do that either. We're hearing they won't have the votes. And so, this strategy for Kevin McCarthy of trying to just work within his own ranks and only do things with the votes of his Republican Party is clearly not working. He may have to start looking towards Democrats to actually start getting things done. And there is this growing frustration in the party right now in the GOP with each other -- with each other's colleagues, and you might actually start to see that happen. The problem, of course, is if McCarthy worked with Democrats, he could face a motion to make -- a motion to vacate the speaker's chair. That would be a vote to remove him. So, it's all very complicated, but the big picture here, the House is paralyzed, John.",
