The Israeli military has ordered more than a million people in northern Gaza to move south. They have given them a six-hour safe passage window today which we are now halfway through.The Israel Defense Forces, the IDF, is accusing Hamas of actively trying to stop people from leaving so that they can use them as quote, human shields. But Hamas says that Israel is still carrying out airstrikes killing 70 people after warning them to move out. The Palestinian health ministry posted dramatic video showing the moment and ambulance was rocked by an explosion in Gaza during those evacuations.

There were at least three intelligence reports to American, one Israeli, in the days leading up to the horrific events of October 7th.On September 28th and October 5th, the U.S. intelligence community issued warnings of potential cross border airstrikes by Hamas with rocket fire and then the growing possibility of violence around Gaza. Then on October 6th, there was a third report from Israel that was the day before the attacks, saying that there was unusual activity by Hamas. Sources are now telling CNN that these reports looked nothing like what ended up unfolding in terms of the scope and the barbarity. A Biden administration official tells CNN quote, there was no information warning about the terrorist attack in advance. Instead, sources tell us that the sense was that if something happened that it would look more like it had in the past, perhaps rocket fire from Gaza, interceptions, then by the Israeli Iron Dome and possible responses into Gaza by Israel. But more profoundly, U.S. sources say there was a general complacency that had taken hold in Israel underestimating what Hamas could pull off. And given that Gaza and Hamas are in Israel's backyard. American sources say the onus is primarily on Israeli intelligence to have detected the looming plot still, with regular warnings from the U.S. intelligence community and Middle Eastern allies as well about a buildup of Hamas weapons and growing Palestinian anger. This is also raising questions about whether the Biden administration was taking the Hamas threat seriously enough. Alex Marquardt, CNN, Washington.",
