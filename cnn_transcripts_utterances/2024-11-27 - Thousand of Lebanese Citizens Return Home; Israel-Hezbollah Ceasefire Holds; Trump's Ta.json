They are expected to play a stepped-up role during this implementation phase, but also beyond as well in terms of monitoring ceasefire violations by both sides. The Israeli military, for its part, is still very much in Southern Lebanon. And today, we saw videos of Lebanese civilians who are returning to some of these Southern Lebanese towns, very close to those Israeli positions. The Israeli military now warning Lebanese residents not to approach its military positions, telling civilians not to move south of the Litani River. That is the area now, some 25 miles north of the Israeli border where Hezbollah operatives are meant to move north, from which south of that point, Hezbollah is not meant to operate. We saw scenes of joy on the Lebanese side as people celebrated what they hope and believe to be the end of this war and as they began packing into cars and moving south. It was a very different picture though on the southern side of that border, in Northern Israel, where we spent much of our day today and where residents are still very skeptical about the ceasefire.

Now, President-Elect Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have spoken about migration and security. President Sheinbaum described it as a quote, \"excellent conversation,\" which included migrant caravans and moves being made to prevent fentanyl consumption. Mexico is under threat of new U.S. tariffs, along with Canada and China, and a growing number of business leaders, companies and lobbyists are sounding the alarm. IKEA, among the latest to warn that customers risk bearing the brunt of rising prices. Most of its goods are made in Europe, with the remaining 30 percent coming from Asia, mainly China, the U.S. is its second biggest market, by the way. The Consumer Brands Association, which represents Coca- Cola, General Mills, and many others, is warning of a, quote, \"clear and present danger to its members.\" Richard Quest joins us now. Richard, they could almost be lobbyists for the government. Some might call this a stroke of genius. In the space of three days, not one tariff applied, but the president-elect has managed to have direct phone calls with Prime Minister Trudeau and the president of Mexico. RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  He's negotiating. He's not even president yet until January the 20th. He is negotiating. And, Julia, we don't know what the success of that negotiation would even look like. For instance, he says if they have not reduced -- judging by the tweet alone, if they have not reduced the flow of migrants or illegal drugs, fentanyl and the like, by certain amounts by January the 20th, these tariffs will apply. But there is nowhere in this the barometer by which that can be achieved or success monitored, which leads one to the assumption that it is merely a raft of promises before then from Canada and Mexico that he will take on board.",

Concerning threats across the United States, the FBI says bomb threats since swatting targetedsome of Donald Trump's cabinet picks and administration appointees. Several people tapped by Trump have said they were threatened, and they include Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, the president-elect's choice to serve as U.N. ambassador, and Lee Zeldin, the nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency. Swatting, by the way, is a hoax that involves falsely reporting a crime to send police to a certain location. Jeff Zeleny joins us now. Jeff, it's not the first time we've heard of either of these kind of threats in the political sphere. What are we hearing about who might have been carrying this out and what are the individuals concerned saying? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Julia, these threats are quite common, actually, for people who are in the news, talking to law enforcement officials. They tell CNN that it often follows names in the news, often if they're controversial or whatnot, they receive bomb threats or swatting incidents. But as you said, the different part about this is that many of them are Trump administration officials, people who he has appointed or intends to appoint to be in his cabinet. Everyone from the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, to as you said, Elise Stefanik, a member of Congress who is tapped to be the U.N. ambassador to the United Nations to the AG secretary, to the labor secretary, on and on. So, there are several examples of them. But the FBI said it is working with local law enforcement officials because that is the curious thing. These threats happened at individuals' homes, which are across the United States, not simply just here in Washington. The Trump transition, an official is telling us it's un-American and they believe that this is indeed a threat. The FBI is taking this seriously and is looking into this. The White House was briefed on this. We're told that President Biden was briefed on this, and he condemns this in all forms. The question is how real were these threats?

So, last week, in the flurry of posts that Elon Musk makes every day on X, he reposted a couple posts froman anonymous account that was taking screen grabs of a publicly available database of federal workers. But in these screen grabs were the names, the titles, and the city of some federal workers who all do different jobs around climate change. Now, some of the titles are, you know, rather obscure titles like director of climate diversification, senior adviser on environmental justice and climate change. And Musk reposting some of these made comments such as so many fake jobs. And this is, of course, goes into all the effort that he is heading up along with Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency, trying to slash the size of the federal government. Now, I've been speaking to federal employees, some of them who are actually of the idea of trying to make government more efficient, but not only are they preparing themselves for likely job losses, but now, they are also concerned, after these posts by Elon Musk, that they are also going to be somehow personally targeted, because what we're seeing after Elon Musk made these posts, keep in mind he has hundreds of millions of followers, is a torrent of negative comments specifically about some of these people calling them out by name. Now, the four women who were listed, they have not responded to requests for comment or have declined to comment, but we also don't know what sort of threats or otherwise they might be getting in their, you know, personal inboxes, because in the past, when Elon Musk has targeted other people by name, those people, I've spoken to some of them, they were getting death threats. They had to move from their homes temporarily. So, now there's a real fear among federal employees that as part of this effort to cut down on the size of the government, that some private individuals may be caught up in this as well, because all of those people that were mentioned in those posts, these are, you know, more private government employees. These are not public facing roles. This is not the spokesperson for a government agency. Somebody who is facing the public on a daily basis. We do have a statement for the union that represents these federal employees. They say these tactics are aimed at sowing terror and fear in federal employees. It's intended to make them fearful that we will be -- that they will become too afraid to speak up. Now, Julia, while I was reporting out the story, I tried to reach out to some experts on cyber harassment, on doxing to get their point of view. And I was stunned when several of them declined to comment on the record using their names because they themselves were afraid of becoming one of Elon Musk's latest targets. Now, we reached out to X, trying to get a comment from them, trying to get a comment from Elon Musk. We did, our colleague, Rene Marsh, did speak to Vivek Ramaswamy, and he said, our opponent is not any particular individual. Our opponent is the bureaucracy. Of course, that's of little comfort to those four women who were listed in those screen grabs that Elon Musk amplified.",

That rain is now stretching into Indianapolis and Cincinnati. So, it's been a wet go of it on the roads if you're doing any traveling by car in the Midwest. As we get towards tomorrow, the storm system is really going to flourish. We'll have cold air pummel itself in behind it. And then you've got soaked turkeys there up and down the East Coast. So, it does include some of those cities with the parades like New York and Philadelphia. But we are also looking at some snow on the top side of this. So, major travel impacts likely across New England, where several inches of snow is possible. So, you could see this storm really blow up as we go into Thanksgiving.

They also help in the building process and day-to-day operations. The U.S. Navy and Air Force are customers, as well as Mitsubishi and power giant Siemens Energy. All of us here in New York owe them a debt of gratitude too. Gecko Robots have inspected many of our state's roughly 17,000 bridges to see if they need repair. It's an area of tech that may not grab a lot of headlines, but it's incredibly important nonetheless. Gecko Robotics say its devices can decrease maintenance costs by up to 80 percent Jake Loosararian is CEO and co-founder of Gecko Robotics and he joins us now. Jake, fantastic to have you on the show. This is very fun. Just start by explaining how these robots work and how much and what kind of data is collected. JAKE LOOSARARIAN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, GECKO ROBOTICS:  Absolutely. Well, it's great to be on. Thanks so much. Gecko is making robots and software that help diagnose the health of the built world, and we do that with robots that's -- you know, it comes in all shapes and sizes, whether they fly or they're climbing up walls or they're walking around. What they're doing is they're gathering structural integrity data, health data of the built world all around us, whether it's on a bridge, whether it's on a pipeline, ICBM missile silo, a ship, all the different kinds of physical structures that we rely on every single day. And what we're doing is we're creating all this information and data set that never existed before about the health of all these things, combining that with advanced software and artificial intelligence to help drive better decisions about how to deploy capital, how to reduce risk and also environmental impact as well as how do you make more with less, which is the big name of the game right now in the U.S. for manufacturing.",

But we all know that, you know, artificial intelligence is only as good as the data you put into it. And so, our robots are going out into the real world every single day. We've got now over 500,000 assets that we manage inside of our software, our artificial intelligence driven software called Cantilever. And what it's doing is it's using artificial intelligence to understand take all the information from those 500,000 assets and help inform what's going to fail into the future, especially when you begin to incorporate operational variables that change and you begin to predict and understand how to deploy capital most efficiently to ensure that you get longer life of these manufacturing facilities that we're all supposed to not last as long and we need them to last twice as long and we need them to produce way more. And so, all the data that we're collecting about the health and the operational variables at these facilities and manufacturing, for example, you know, help them produce as well as ensure catastrophic failures like explosions or oil leaking into rivers, these are things that just never happen. And do it in a way that we can collect data in a way that's safe and also, of highest fidelity. Because right now, we're relying on the bridges in New York to be safe based on a guy on a rope with a handheld sensor camera. And it's -- yes. So, anyway, it's a real existential crisis right now.",
