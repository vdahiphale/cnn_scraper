Pay attention to how the candidates talk about people. The second one was try to see through the bluster and focus on the fundamentals at stake. And third, when you see these two men in the race side-by-side, think about the real choice in this election. Who is right because she doesn't seem to be saying attack Donald Trump? She seems to be saying something very different. JESSE HUNT, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER, TIM SCOTT'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL SUPER PAC:  Well, I find it ironic that Hillary Clinton is giving debate advice seeing as she is the one who ultimately lost in 2016 to Donald Trump, and the debates were a big reason for that. You know, look, these are two of the most experienced presidential debaters that we have. Joe Biden has run for president four times; Donald Trump now three times. The American voters really know who these people are. So I think both candidates are going to be hunting moments. These are moments that will then be picked up in earned media, on social media, and live for days after the event. I think that's certainly what the Biden campaign is looking for. They're going to try to bait Trump into litigating the past. But right now, Trump is successful in this race because he's talking about the future. And I think that's what he needs to stay focused on. Ultimately, I think he's a little bit quicker on his feet. And the Biden campaign certainly concerned about falling into the trap of feeding into the existing narrative that he's not up to the task. So is that a moment that he shows kind of a lapse of focus? That he misstates a name. That he gets lost on stage a little bit. I think those are the sorts of moments that have the potential to go viral and capture these less engaged voters' attention.",

It can possibly be that Biden is the competent person that some of us know Joe Biden to be. And so, it's just a game and it's a level set for his own base. But it's not -- you know, he's not really appealing to anybody beyond that MAGA base, and that's the problem for Trump as to how you expand that appeal to people who obviously understand the president is not on drugs and understand that CNN is not rigging the debate against him -- a debate, by the way, that he agreed to do.",

It's the voters who care that inflation under Joe Biden is now at a cumulative rate of almost 20 percent.It's a lot of those voters who actually have lived through a Donald Trump presidency and a Joe Biden presidency and ultimately, prefer the policies under Donald Trump. And it's reminding those voters what he can -- what he can give back to when it -- when it -- when it comes to dealing with the crisis at the southern border and host of other issues. It's remaining focused on the future, and I think that's where Trump will have his most success. And it's also trying to knock Biden off his game a little bit. We know that Biden struggles when he has to operate quickly. And I think if Trump's able to exploit that a little bit a lot of these Independent voters -- these low -- less engaged voters, I'd say, that consume a lot of information on social media -- this has a chance to penetrate their kind of -- their thought bubble and have an impact -- a lasting impact on this race.",

So if Bowman's successful here I think that causes the Biden campaign a lot of heartburn, particularly when you know that a lot of these college kids are due to come back to campus this fall. And if the Israel-Hamas war is still continuing, as we expect it to, that's going to create a whole lot more turmoil at a time when they can least afford it. And not to mention there's going to be another test case with Cori Bush, another anti-Israel Democrat. She's facing a competitive primary later this year. So I don't this this conversation is going away after today. And ultimately, we'll see which direction it turns in. But, you know, a Bowman win would be a nightmare for Democrats.",
