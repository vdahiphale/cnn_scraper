Now, a year ago in June of 2022, DOJ sent a subpoena to Trump's legal team saying we need you to give us all classified and sensitive government documents that you may have at Mar-a-Lago. Now Corcoran was directed by people within the Trump team to this very important storage room where there are boxes of documents.Corcoran goes through those documents, pulls out 38 documents, hands them over to DOJ with a sworn certification that says we did our due diligence. This is all we have at Mar-a-Lago. Turned out two months later, DOJ does a search and finds over 100 more classified documents. So, prosecutors are going to be asking about that. And Poppy, as you noted, DOJ actually has Evan Corcoran's written notes and his recorded notes, even though he was the attorney for Donald Trump. Normally that would be protected, of course, by the attorney-client privilege. But in this case, prosecutors were able to pierce through that privilege using something called the crime fraud exception, which means prosecutors convinced the judge that there could be evidence of a crime not necessarily that Evan Corcoran himself participated in but there could be evidence of a crime in those notes. It's very rare the prosecutors get them.",

And while nada originally told investigators that well, I don't know anything about classified documents. Turned out later, he sort of took that back and said, actually, because he was caught on surveillance, I did move boxes into and out of this storage room. We know that in part because of surveillance video.Also, helping out Mr. Nauta was an unknown maintenance worker whose surveillance video captures also moving boxes into and out of that storage room. Also, that same maintenance worker is the person who our reporting tells us drained this pool, the water then ran into a room that housed the servers that housed the surveillance video. Now, we don't know prosecutors surely are trying to figure out whether that was on purpose or whether that was unintentional. So, that is the unknown maintenance worker. And then finally, we know that Matthew Calamari Senior and Junior who were in charge of security for the Trump Organization, they too have testified about the surveillance video. As the heads of security, they were in charge of maintaining it. And we have reporting that they were asked about how surveillance video was maintained, whether any of it might be missing, whether any of it could have been tampered with. So, we're getting a sense now and I guess given Evan Perez's very interesting to reporting, we can add Mark Meadows to this list, but we're getting a sense of what the witness list might look like.",

Well, first of all, if we look at the actual evidence in this case, as opposed to some of the leak public narrative, what happened was a subpoena was issued, a certain period of time was given for compliance, although additional time was requested. The additional time needed was not granted. Evan did the search that he was able to within the period of time that he was given.He gave a certification saying this is what I found during that diligent search, actually signed by Christina Bobb. And then, whereas normally, you would have conversations with DOJ about continuing searches, you know, they would, you know, anytime I talk with a U.S. attorney, they would say, OK, give us what you can within that period of time, but we'd like you to keep searching. That didn't happen here. Jay Brandt kind of cut it off and said, no, do everything by this date. He gave everything that he could by that date. And then there was no continued conversations as they would normally be with any professional U.S. Attorney's Office. And so, any of the subsequent searches that were after the time period in which Evan had, you know, to search. A lot of that could have been avoided through, you know, normal interactions. You know, this is something that we do all the time. You know, Elie Hoenig and I had a case years ago. We've worked well together on these types of things.
