Wow, Daniels replied with a pause. That's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real. Just like what happened to me in that room. Necheles asked Daniels if she made up the story with Trump. If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better, Daniels shot back.

Daniels in a raised voice replied, no, you're trying to make me say that it changed but it hasn't changed. And then they questioned Daniels' earlier testimony that she felt powerless in Trump's hotel room you acted and had sex and over 200 porn movies, Necheles said. But according to you seeing a man sitting on a bed and a T-shirt and boxer shorts was so upsetting that you got lightheaded. This wasn't the first time in your life someone made a pass at you. Daniels replied no, but it's the first time they had a bodyguard standing outside the door adding Trump was twice her age and bigger than her. When pressed, Daniels explained, my own insecurities made me feel that way. He did not put his hands on me. He did not give me any sort of drugs or alcohol and he did not hold a weapon or hold me or threatened me. Necheles also highly critical of how Daniels' profited off the encounter, even calling out her strip club tour, Make America Horny Again. Daniels responded, I did not name that tour and I fought it tooth and nail. But Necheles said Daniels has made nearly $1 million from a book deal, documentary and selling products on her website. You're celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store, right, Necheles pressed. Daniels quipped, not unlike Mr. Trump.

Their position is we can control the song, we can control the lyrics, we can, you know, we can create barriers to stop political messaging being used in that way. The challenge they have is you're quite right. Historically, it's incredibly inconsistently applied. You know, Russia obviously was asked not to participate in the wake of what happened in -- is happening in the Ukraine and Belarus was expelled in the same year because there was a perception that -- and a lot of this is driven by national broadcasters -- there was a perception that Belarus's national broadcaster was not reporting that war objectively. So you know, they make these decisions and that brings politics to their door. I think they're sort of -- they're not even really winnable situation. I think it's kind of -- it's kind of no-win for them if they do nothing, particularly in this case, to expel Israel would have been an overtly political act. To let them stay in the competition has been seen as an overtly political act. And so I think their position is that it's kind of lose-lose, and they're trying to navigate it as best they can. I mean, in the arena last night, there was --- there was booing. I mean, there's a ticketed guests who have purchased tickets to come in and watch the Eurovision semifinals and final. And when Israel took to the stage, there was a lot of applause, but there was booing. There was free Palestine chants.

The Israel Defense Forces puts the number higher though at 150,000. The IDF warning people to evacuate eastern Rafah earlier this week. On Thursday, Israel sent more tanks and troops to the Gaza border. And U.S. President Joe Biden earlier threatened to withhold some us weapons if Israel continues on with this plan for a major offensive on Rafah. The IDF says it already has all it needs in terms of weapons and material for the Rafah operation. Joining us now from Tel Aviv is Israel's former New York Consul General, Alon Pinkas. Mr. Ambassador, thank you for being with us, Sir. ALON PINKAS, ISRAEL'S FORMER NEW YORK CONSUL GENERAL YORK: Thank you, John. Good to be with you. Good morning.",

You'd written an op-ed for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz with the headline, \"King Midas in Reverse\"; the sub-headline, \"Diplomatically, Israel had everything going for it in its war in Gaza against Hamas after October 7 then Netanyahu's hubris, mismanagement and disingenuous incompetence took over.\" That seems just as relevant now when talking about the harm done to the relationship between Israel and its most important ally, the United States.

Listen I have to add one -- well, from a different article, but that'snot the issue. Since November; since in fact later October, Mr. Netanyahu has been actively and deliberately seeking confrontation with Mr. Biden. He thinks it's good for his narrative that this is a Palestinian state trying to be super imposed on Israel but more importantly, he's trying to project ineptness and failure on Biden. So now he has the almost perfect opportunity to say I was on the precipice. I was on the verge of a major victory, topping Hamas, but look what stopped me -- Joe Biden. Now back to your question. How could these be fixed? The short answer, John is, it cannot be. In the last year relations between Netanyahu and Joe Biden -- President Joe Biden have become untenable and unfixable. So yes, you know, it could be mitigated. We could iron out some differences. The arms shipments may resume, provided that there's no large-scale attack in Rafah. But the basic, the fundamental differences of approach will remain and Mr. Netanyahu's credibility that is in Washington is only growing.",

But practically this is the same president that two weeks ago approved over $40 billion in aid to Israel. This is a president who just four days ago signed a special $827 million worth of arms, of munitions shipments to Israel. So yes, in terms of the rhetoric and the public policy, this is dramatic, but practically Israel is quite safe, is still getting arms from the us and quite capable of defending itself. So all this, you know, pontification and righteous indignation that you see come on, this is -- this is -- this is cynical politics, no one should take this seriously. That is a good point to finish.
