And you're going to see it for yourself, even when they got him, putting his head to the ground and stuff, he said do you all really have to do all of this?

It goes against everything a police officer should stand for. I mean, you know, using excessive force is just unacceptable under any circumstances. And the whole point of this duty to intervene, which police departments are across the country are starting to adopt into policy and train on is that if an officer does lose it and does go too far, that someone stops it before more harm can be committed. One of the things I want to look for tonight, I know those five were involved in beating Tyre, but were there other officers there? Were they just standing around watching? I mean, what was going on? I mean, those are the kinds of things that you have to look for. It is just unacceptable. We'll know in about an hour or so exactly what it looks like because we'll have seen the video.

But I think back to yesterday and the decision not to charge first-degree murder. I'll be looking extremely closely at the why, but knowing, of course, that prosecutors have a very difficult time trying to prove that premeditated state, that decision to kill especially for officers with the bias often in favor of police officers in this country.So, I'll be looking to see particularly who chose not to act. Who chose not to intervene, given that Memphis in 2020, about a month after George Floyd was killed, like many other jurisdictions, changed their rules to ensure that officers would intervene and not just see something, say something, but do something.

There are some jurisdictions where because of civil service regulations or union contracts, you cannot immediately fire an individual. They have a due process clause in these contracts. You can suspend them with pay for a period of time with intent to dismiss and so forth but it won't be immediate.So, she was fortunate that she had the ability to do that. I think swift action is more than appropriate in this case and other cases that I have seen. So, one of the things that has to change are the restrictions that police chiefs face across the country. It is not easy to fire a police officer.",

Police initially said officers pulled Nichols over on January 7th for reckless driving. Police claimed he fled. And when officers caught up to him, it sparked a, quote, confrontation. Well, we do know the fact is, Nichols was taken to the hospital and he died three days later. According to a private autopsy, he suffered extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating.

And, Don, of course, you have been here these days, and you have some new reporting about the Scorpion Unit, which these officers involved here were a part of. DON LEMON, CNN CO-ANCHOR, CNN THIS MORNING:  I do, Erin. And I do want to say that the video has been embargoed -- embargoed before we go to that. Some members of the media have seen some excerpts of the video. We were able to get that, and we've been able to view it, and it is horrific. It starts off with the body-worn camera video. But yes, we have been able to see some of it. Regarding the Scorpion Unit, I'm getting information now as we're speaking from the police department that had -- that is just coming in, and they've been talking about what's happening here. What they're saying is there's been -- you know these calls from the family and from others about disbanding this unit, the police department is saying there will be a review over all specialized units. Currently, the Scorpion Unit is inactivated during this review process, but it has not disbanded. You have to remember that we have about 10 specialized units that work similar to the Scorpion Unit. If not the unit, they are necessary -- it is not the unit, they are necessary. Meaning the unit is necessary. The officers who -- and their training, that may be the problem. In this case, it's the officers who by chance were assigned to the Scorpion Unit. So, that's that information that I'm getting about that. But again, we've had a chance to see some of the video, but it is embargoed until the top of the hour, and it does start off with the body-worn camera video, and then it will go to the aerial video, the skycam video, which is silent. The body-worn camera video, you'll get to hear the full audio of that and see the takedown from police officers of this young man, the language and everything. I have to -- it is riddled with expletives, Erin, which you're going to see. So, it's going to be very disturbing and it should be coming in at any moment. But it will go back and forth, four different videos, we are told. The skycams -- according to our Sara Sidner's reporting -- those skycams are constantly on. There's no sound on some of them. The body-worn cameras have to be turned on when officers are on a stop and when they're actively engaged or involved with citizens.",
