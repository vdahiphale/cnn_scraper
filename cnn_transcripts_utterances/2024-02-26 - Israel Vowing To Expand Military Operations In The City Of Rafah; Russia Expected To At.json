Today's working level talks will likely focus on ironing out technical details. This comes as the Israeli military has presented the country's war cabinet with an operational plan as it's been called to evacuate civilians from fighting areas in the south of Gaza. But that plan announced by the Israeli Prime Minister's Office a short time ago, does not specifically mentioned Rafah where Israel has been planning that potential ground offensive. CNN has not seen a copy of the plan as of yet. More than a million perhaps a million and a half people are believed to be sheltering in the rougher area, most of them displaced from other parts of Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has been following the developments and has more from Tel Aviv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We have heard from other members of the Israeli government that that offensive could come as soon as the beginning of Ramadan, which is the second week of March and the Israeli prime minister also making clear that he's in the process of reviewing plans for that offensive as well as for the potential evacuation of civilians from that city. And that's a critical issue. Of course, we have heard American officials talking about that abundantly. One and a half million Palestinians are currently sheltering in that southernmost city of Gaza. So far, the Israeli government has yet to present any of its plans for how it will evacuate so many people from that area, how it will provide for them shelter, food, et cetera, in other parts of the Gaza Strip.

Thanks for having me. I think the first thing that is worth noting when it comes to heritage and cultural heritage is that there's two strands to it and they both kind of work together. So there's the tangible parts which this thing that we can see that includes buildings, places, and even urban squares. But there are things that we cannot see that includes the informality of things, what people, the places that people meet and speak to each other, the foods that they eat, the languages that they speak. All of these things kind of work together in a way, the tangible kind of facilitates the intangible. It makes us able to undertake this intangible aspect of it. And therefore, it becomes really difficult to determine what has been lost and the cost of cultural heritage because we have to first understand what has been lost in the architectural side.

It's a long list.What do you see is the greatest loss in terms of the tangible? What do you think when you see the images? AL-DAFFAIE: Well, obviously the (INAUDIBLE) thing they're too distracted (ph) to be to fathom how big of a loss it must have been for the Palestinian people. I think when it comes to pinpointing kind of these greatest lost, I think it's for me it's the places that have contributed the most to the daily life of the Palestinians. For example, when we talk about the Omari Mosque and yes, it is. It has undergone a lot of changes as a symbol for the coexistence of religions. It has been there for a very, very long time. However, there are places like the Palestine Square or Omar Mokhtar street, which held a very massive importance when it comes to the informality of everyday life. And it's where people made their memory is going shopping or going and meeting their friends. So these places that hold interactions that are hidden are cases that we need to shed more light than during the reconstruction moving forward because they are very important for the cultural heritage, but also they made people's childhoods and they made people's lives before, before they were completely wiped.",

However, when it comes to things like this, it's important to remember that these contribute to the sense of identity and the sense of history, and the sense of place with what people have with their cities so it's a way that you remember your own place, you remember your own -- your own country. And when you lose these manuscripts that identify you to your past in addition to your ancestors, it starts to have this impact on people's lives, but not through the everyday life.
