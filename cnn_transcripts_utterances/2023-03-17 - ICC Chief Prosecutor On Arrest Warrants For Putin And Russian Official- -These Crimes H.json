And that would essentially allow, for the evidence to be preserved, in a judicial setting, in a timely way, paving the way, for some potential future trial. What they have seen traditionally, the ICC, is that very rarely do people charged with war crimes, actually come to face justice, until those wars have reached an end. And whichever side is victorious gets to choose, who ends up facing trial, at the ICC. So, what they want to do, at least with this possibility, of the confirmation hearing, is ensure that that evidence is put out there, in a timely manner that victims of these alleged atrocities are able to still have their day in court, even if it might be quite some time, before you would potentially see President Vladimir Putin, appearing on trial.

Take a listen to what the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had to say about this, which he calls an historic decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Separating children, from their families? Depriving them of any opportunity, to contact their relatives? Hiding children, in Russia, dispersing them, to remote regions? All this is obvious Russian state policy, state decisions, and state evil, which begins with the first official of the state.

While the ICC move is important, it's also important, I think, to understand that the Ukrainian judicial system, that police here, on the ground, that investigators and prosecutors that they are also separately, actively, gathering evidence, for their own cases, to accuse Russian military commanders, and individual Russian soldiers, of alleged war crimes. That after every kind of rocket strike, or artillery strike, on a Ukrainian city or town, after every death of a civilian, you have police coming in later, if it's at all safe, in an area, gathering evidence, and putting their own cases, together, to try to prosecute Russian military units.

And just over a year, after the war began, you have the first two arrest warrants being issued. And the idea is that this will continue apace now that you will see more arrest warrants, potentially, more investigations, as all the different allegations that have been made, are researched. Now, obviously, this takes a huge amount of resources, John, right? There is no shortage of war crimes, as we've mentioned before, taking place, in Ukraine. In fact, to use Khan's own words, he said, \"Ukraine is basically a crime scene.\" And so, there's now an inordinate amount of work that needs to be done, to go, to try to verify, and to build up solid cases, in this instance, and in future investigations taking place.",

We've seen the Balkans. I was a junior prosecutor, many decades ago, with the Rwandan Tribunal, as well as Yugoslav Tribunal, and Cambodia. So, you know very well about the banality of evil, and you also know very well about the kind of crimes that have afflicted humanity, from time immemorial, but also since the Holocaust. And unfortunately, despite the promises of never-again, and despite the publicity, the understanding that the law is out there, there is this still a very prevalent proclivity, of people, with power, to believe that they can subject weaker people, to that power, and do what they want.

He's also the Author of \"Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped.\" Garry, you've been a longtime critic, of Vladimir Putin. So, what is your reaction, to these arrest warrants, today? GARRY KASPAROV, RUSSIAN PRO-DEMOCRACY LEADER, CHAIRMAN, THE HUMAN RIGHTS FOUNDATION, AUTHOR, \"WINTER IS COMING,\" TWITTER: @KASPAROV63: It's a great joy. It's very important first step, as we heard today, because this war, and the crimes, committed by Russian troops, on the Ukrainian soil, is quite unique. We saw many genocides before. But we learned of them afterwards. Holocaust, Cambodia, Rwanda, we didn't see them live. Yes, we had to accumulate evidence, and then recognize the horrors of these crimes. These crimes committed virtually online. And I think that what's happened, today. It's a very strong message, for Russians, for Russian elites, that there is no way back. It's no one is going to close their eyes, and sort of turn a blind eye, on these crimes. And somehow, I think, Putin probably was shocked, because he's spilled rivers of blood. But now he's being charged with kidnapping. It's like Al Capone, being charged with tax evasion, because they could actually get him, on tax evasion. And it's not being mentioned. But Putin bragged about this crime, kidnapping kids, on television. Actually, they recorded it, so which gets you - it's you don't even have to prove it. Because, you have Putin's personal confession, about the program that he authorized, and his subordinate, the so-called Commissioner on Children's Rights, she has been executing the program, which by the way, was a part of Putin's long-term strategy, of destroying Ukrainian statehood, and eradicating Ukrainians, as a nation. It's not me saying. Putin said it many times. And it has been repeated by Russian propaganda. That's the goal of the war. No matter what DeSantis talked about, about territorial dispute, this is a genocidal war that has been planning, for a long time.",

But this one, again, you have his personal confession.I think it's every prosecutor could dream about personal confession, recorded by major TV station. But I hope it's just, as they have been saying, first step, because crimes are endless there. And it's not just war crimes. It's a genocide. And actually, Europe is ahead of America because part of this program is not only to convict these criminals, and by issuing warrants, as a first step, but also to remove the state immunity, from Russian frozen funds. Europe is working now very aggressively, to confiscate hundreds of billions of dollars, of frozen funds, to pay Ukraine, for reconstruction. It doesn't have to be paid by American taxpayers, or German taxpayers, or French taxpayers. There's money, stolen by Putin's cronies, from Russia, and kept abroad that could be actually transferred, to Ukraine. [21:35:00] BERMAN: So Clarissa, we talk about the idea of other possible charges, and you did, with Karim Khan, right there.

But what Karim Khan did say is that essentially, Ukraine is a crime scene, right now.And whether it's the massacre of Bucha, whether it's some of the atrocities that we've seen, in Mariupol, where civilians, taking shelter, in a theater, were killed, in the hundreds, by airstrikes, where a maternity hospital, was also bombed. There are multiple avenues that they can pursue. Now, obviously, there's always the constraint of time and resources. Because what I do think prosecutor Khan feels, very intensely is the pressure of getting it right. If you're going to build the case, it's got to be rock-solid. It's got to be iron-clad. And that's, as you just heard, Mr. Kasparov, kind of elucidating there, why it was important, to start with this forced deportation, of Ukrainian children, is because this was done flagrantly, basically, vocally, by the Russian state, by Vladimir Putin, in conjunction, of course, with Ms. Lvova-Belova. And so, it makes sense as a starting point. But there are many other lines of inquiry, and investigation, and allegations that they are looking into. And the hope is that this is just the beginning that they're building momentum, and we will see more, like this, to come.",
