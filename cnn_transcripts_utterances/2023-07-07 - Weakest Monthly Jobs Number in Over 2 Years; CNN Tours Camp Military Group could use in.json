Great to have you with us this Friday, TGIF and no matter how you slice it,we've got a real pickle of a program for you today beginning with sour pickles on Wall Street after a Thursday thud and a sharp move higher for Treasury yields. Fed Chair Jay Powell in a policy pickle has persistently strong economic data complicates his fight against inflation, and a pickle barrel full of peak in social media too, and Elon Musk's battle with Mark Zuckerberg, Musk now threatening Meta with legal action after the successful rollout of Threads. And last but not least, the \"Pickleball Pickle\" later in the show, we'll discuss these sports explosive growth here in the United States. Millions of people are having a ball but lots of Pickleball pain too as injury skyrocket. Mike Neely the CEO of USA Pickleball will join us later. And the ball in the meantime well and truly in the U.S. labor markets caught today brand new numbers showing 209,000 net new jobs added that's solid, but it is lower than expected then comes the complications. We actually lost some jobs due to lower revisions on the numbers from prior months. So you have to deduct around 110,000 jobs. So I call it a strong labor market. But it's certainly slowing. Here's the market reaction. In the meantime, U.S. Futures turning positive initially, but trading is volatile. We're tilted back down to the downside Europe mixed after a 1 percent plus sell off over in Asia too. Plenty on the line there as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen holds talks in Beijing criticizing China's export controls and its treatment of U.S. firms, China's Premier, however, saying he sees a rainbow in U.S. China ties, plenty to get to as always this hour. But up first that milestone for the U.S. jobs market in June 30 consecutive months of jobs growth this month's numbers however, the smallest increase in well over two years. Mark Zandi joins us now. He's Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics. Mark, great to have you with us your take on this! MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Good report, Julia. I mean, you know, not too hot, not too cold. I think it's exactly what the Federal Reserve would be looking for, you know, anything over 300,000, which is kind of the monthly job gains we've been getting over the past several months would have I think, been too hot, anything less than 100k probably too cold. So, you know, 200,200 25,000? Let's just write down the strikes on so it feels pretty good to me.",

So but you know, you had to put it into some context, we go back a little over a year ago, at the peak of the very strong wage growth, we're probably, you know, well over five, close to five and a half percent. So we're moving in the right direction. And my sense is we will continue to do so you know, with job growth slowing and the economy more broadly starting to pull back a bit, I think wage growth will continue to moderate. So it's still high. It's still not happy with that number, but it's moving in the right direction. I think all the trend lines look pretty good.",

And that's consistent with the stable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is low 3.6 percent. And that's exactly where it's been since last March.

Now, my sense is they've largely made up their minds that they're going to raise interest rates, another quarter percentage point when they meet again in a few weeks. So I think we can kind of count on that. That's what's expected. That's what the stock market expects. That's what the bond market expects is embedded in market prices. So I don't think they're going to rock the boat there. But you know, these numbers and the trend lines, if you like, to me as saying, you know, the Feds pretty close to being done here. I don't think they need to continue to raise rates, meaningfully more from where we are today, given what's happening with the job market and broader economic growth. But then we're going to get another number on inflation next week. Obviously, that's also very key consumer price inflation, that too, is still not exactly where the Fed wants it, but it too, is moving in the right direction. So I you know, if we're not at the end of the rate hikes, probably got one more to go here. We're pretty darn close, I think.",

In the meantime, Janet Yellen making some moves in Beijing, the U.S. Treasury Secretary met with Chinese Premier Li Chang earlier, saying the U.S. is seeking healthy competition with the world's second largest economy, but doesn't see this as winners take all. In a meeting with American business leaders so she also raised concerns about certain Chinese behavior listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I've been particularly troubled by punitive actions that have been taken against U.S. firms in recent months.

      "sentences": "Well, a couple things. First of all, if we look at this economic relationship, the trade relationship between theUnited States and China, it adds up to nearly $700 billion. Both economies have a stake in all of this. So there has to be a little bit of gingerly walking in all of this. But she was very pointed when she talked to this business roundtable. I was looking at who was on the invite list. It was representatives from Boeing, Bank of America, Medtronic, I mean many others. So it certainly was influential group of business leaders there. There has been this pattern. And Julia, you are well aware of this. If China is unhappy with something the United States does, well, then they do something back. China has been unhappy with some of the tech restrictions from the United States. So therefore, we have this punitive punishment as described by the Secretary of Treasury concerning access to minerals. It's interesting. I was listening to a commentator we had on CNN earlier this week. And he was saying that if you look at this relationship between the United States and China when it comes to diplomacy, very strained right now, when it comes to military non-existent. But if there is a portal, if there is one area where there can be some common ground, it is on these economic and business issues. So I think that is why we've heard tempered responses from both the Chinese government including the premier, as well as from Secretary Yellen. I mean looking at these different readouts today these meetings have been described as productive, yet casual but conciliatory. And the other point I think to make about this trip by Janet Yellen, is that sure she is here as a Secretary of the Treasury. She's an accomplished economist, but she also is someone who can help turn the temperature down, cool things down and perhaps lead to other discussions on other topics that are also very pressing between the United States and China.",

I've been going to Bakhmut or the area around Bakhmut since January, on and off. And today the amount of rumbling we heard of artillery in the direction of Bakhmut, I have never heard before the Ukrainian soldiers we spoke to were fairly confident that they are pummeling a Russian forces in and around that town. And they're focusing essentially, on the trenches the defenses around it. We've heard time and time again from Ukrainian officials that the Russians are dug in deep. The Ukrainians have said that as many as 50,000 Russian troops have been sent to that area to defend Bakhmut. Now also we know that as you said, the Ukrainians are claiming that they've advanced a kilometer but the statement doesn't make clear whether the kilometer where it is? We know that they're pressuring the city from the north and from the south. The strategic goal is to eventually encircle the town to force the Russians either to simply surrender or to leave the area.

It's allowed Ukraine to export around 30 million tons of wheat and other foodstuffs. Now the Russians are saying they're not going to renew the deal, because they feel that as a result of sanctions imposed upon Russia by Western nations, they can't export their grants, so they want more equity in the arrangement. So Zelenskyy is going to be pressing President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, to try to convince the Russians to come to some sort of agreement or arrangement so that the deal is renewed. Also important on the agenda, as Zelenskyy wants to convince the Turks that they should not object to the membership of Sweden in NATO. Now, the Turks are very unhappy with Sweden because they feel that they have not been very restrictive, so to speak, on Kurdish militants, who are living in Sweden and of course, who are agitating for the creation of a Kurdish State within Turkey. So it's a little complicated, but certainly Zelenskyy is hoping that both of these issues he can make progress on however, President Erdogan is not somebody who is easily convinced, Julia.",

And then there's a perception here in the United States across the political spectrum, that China is essentially has weaponized the open trade relationship. And that, for example, advanced U.S. computer chips were being used in military technologies that were being excuse me, increasingly targeted against us. And so the old idea was, well, we can just think of trade as its own thing as technology as its own thing, even as science as its own thing. And now we're realizing that everything is interconnected, and we can't shut down all of our engagement and interactions with China.

But in that, as Janet Yellen was saying, we have an enormous amount of trade, and we have that is mutually beneficial. So we need to keep pushing forward where we can.

Forthe past couple of days, we've been searching for some balance; let's call it that in the debate around the use of artificial intelligence and data. Helping present the brighter side, the AI for good summit is taking place in Geneva. And I had the opportunity to speak to a keynote speaker and Amazon's Chief Technology Officer to get his take. WERNER VOGELS, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER, AMAZON.COM: Artificial intelligence, as we call it is a field of computer science. It has existed for probably 50 years already. You know things like natural language processing, text to speech, speech to text, translation, summarization, all these kinds of things. You know, video analytics, image analytics, forecasting, all these kinds of areas of artificial intelligence, are quite mature. Now, the recent launch of some of the newer AI technologies, like generative AI is things that we don't know exactly what role that is going to play in the future. It will definitely play a role in that. But when I talk mostly about today is what all a large number of companies in and around the world have already been doing in using the current state of AI for good. And whether that is helping, for example, we're thinking about sort of how we make sure that we can feed a growing population across the world where, you know, protein is lacking and where it's hard to actually grow rice for so many people. And AI, you know, natural language processing, computer vision, things like that play a crucial role in that food and companies.",

You also discussed the importance of access to data and actually, without smart, accurate, efficiently labeled, for example, data, the tools that we have for artificial intelligence in many ways that are worthless. This is a key fundamental part of the future uses of artificial intelligence. It's also key to democratize access, I think to that data to ensure that everybody benefits from this not just a few.",

Now, if you look at the past data, what was called a structure that means on forehand, we already knew what kind of questions we wanted to ask? And then we started to collect that kind of data.

It's apparently thefastest growing sport now in America with some industry estimates suggesting over 36 million people played last year. OK, so that gives you a sense it's a hybrid of tennis, badminton and ping pong. The game has actually been around since the mid-1960s. But it's exploded in recent years with millions of people picking up the paddle following the pandemic. Pickleball's growth has meant a need for more places to play. And former department stores and abandoned strip malls have quickly become venues for organizations to set up new courts. The spike in game's popularity might be coming though at a slight cost for some. UBS estimates Pickleball injuries could be responsible for up to half a billion dollars in medical bills this year. Whilst it's joining us now is Mike Nealy. He's the CEO of USA Pickleball, Mike, fantastic to have you on the show for those and I confess -- I may be one of them. I've not yet tried it.

The planet as we've already discussed this week has been hotter than well, perhaps at any other time in the past 100,000 years. The Earth's average daily temperature reached yet another record high on Thursday climbing further above 17 Celsius. According to initial data, remember huge parts of the world are in winter two. That's the fourth straight day of record temperatures. Scientists say those rising temperatures are driving more people to the beach, just as shark populations are recovering and possibly swimming closer to shore to feed. Officials are ramping up shark patrols of a beach in Long Island after a spike in incidence of people being bitten in the water. CNN's Polo Sandoval has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
