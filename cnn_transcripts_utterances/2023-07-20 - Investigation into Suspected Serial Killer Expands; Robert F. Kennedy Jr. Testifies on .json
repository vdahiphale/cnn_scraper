And in New York authorities are reinterviewing women who had Heuermann contact them to solicit sex years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHERIFF ERROL D. TOULON JR., SUFFOLK COUNTY, NEW YORK: So, we were able to match up the phone numbers that are attributed to him to these females. We were able to actually realize that he had reached out to two individuals. The phone calls are just like any other John that just wanted to get together. And for some reason they did not want to meet with him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
