Tonight, a Donald Trump comparison that crumbles when confronted with common sense. The former president believes he is being persecuted by prosecutors, and for that reason, he's claiming that there are similarities between Nelson Mandela's plight and his own. Trump wrote this on Truth Social. If this partisan hack wants to put me in the clink for speaking the open and obvious truth, I will gladly become a modern day Nelson Mandela. Well, for starters, I'm really not sure anyone has asked that of him, but you might also recall that this is not the first time that Trump has made this very comparison. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They hound them and they scare them and they -- but we don't get scared. We don't get scared. I'll tell you what, I don't mind being Nelson Mandela because I'm doing it for a reason. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As they are today, Trump is not a prisoner unless you consider Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster or Seven Springs or Trump Tower or a penthouse suite, very, very expensive luxury cells. Mandela spent 27 years in Robben Island alone in an eight by eight cell. He referred to his incarceration as unpleasant, which is a master class in understatement. Life there left Mandela's eyes damaged. It's why he wore sunglasses and photographers were warned against using flash photography around him. Mandela lived nearly three decades there serving time for high treason and all for protesting the racist apartheid system. Meanwhile, Trump, he's facing 88 counts in four separate jurisdictions for trying to steal a presidential election or for trying to buy the silence of Stormy Daniels. Mandela was released in 1990 and he won the presidency in 1994. He was freed and he freed his nation from institutionalized racism. Meanwhile, Donald Trump wants to win the White House by stoking racial division. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if need be, it's an ideal for which I am prepared to die.Now, that passage is the core of Mandela's legacy as a bridge builder.

Like, if this young thug trial keeps going, he'll start using him.Like, normally, when people do things like this, you ask yourself the question, who is like, who does he think he is? Who does Donald Trump think he is? And in this case, the question is, who exactly does he think Nelson Mandela is? Because I think the most fascinating part of this is imagining Ronald Reagan spinning around in his grave at the thought that a Republican nominee for president would think that comparing himself to Nelson Mandela, of all people, who Reagan all the way until the end told us was a very, very scary man would be the person that Trump would associate himself with.

Now, everything from where they get their news to whether or not they have any links to fringe groups. So, just listen to some of these examples.

Another question, do you have feelings about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case? Have you ever attended a rally or a campaign event for Donald Trump? Do you currently follow any anti-Trump group on social media? Now, this comes as an appeals court judge just rejected Trump's last minute latest appeal to change the venue of this trial. Joining me now to discuss all of this is CNN Legal Analyst, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, and she's also the former chief assistant district attorney for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.

There is an explicit exception for protecting the life of a mother when her life is at risk during pregnancy. And we talk often about that in the pro-life movement, when there is a tragic case, when fetal maternal separation is needed. We don't even consider that to be an abortion, because the intention is to save life, not to be directly ending human life.We've also been very clear in the pro-life movement that the circumstances of your conception do not define your worth and should not dictate whether or not you get to live or die. And so, that's been our position in the pro-life movement. That's been our position for the 50-some years that we saw Roe versus Wade. But like I said, I'm not exactly in agreement with everything Donald Trump says on many issues, but I would say today his position that he outlines, I think, was a smart position of saying that states still should be involved and they should be very much involved protecting women and children from the abortion industry, and not undercutting so many of our state legislators who have acted with courage since the Dobbs decision to pass life-at-conception laws, heartbeat abortion prevention laws, chemical abortion bans. But that's not to say there's not going to be a role for him. And what the pro-life movement is going to be requiring the President to do while we wait for those 60 votes, he needs to get to start day one, stopping the proliferation of chemical abortion pills, which now has chemically tainted human remains entering our waterways with known endocrine disruptors.",

That's eugenics. Children like mine who have cystic fibrosis are routinely thrown away in IVF clinics or discarded for life-ending research. So, I would say there's a conversation. But what we do know in our own polling in our Institute for Pro-Life Advancement Students for Life that I put into the field immediately after the Alabama Supreme Court ruling was that the vast majority of Americans say they support IVF. But then when you educate them just in 30 seconds about what happens inside of an IVF clinic, we see dramatic, mind-changing results. So, I would like to have a personal conversation with him about IVF, because I think ultimately when we talk in the pro-life movement, we want more babies and we want more families.
