      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.The indictment this week of former President Donald Trump marks the first time in history a president has faced federal charges. This is now the second indictment for the former president who is criminally charged by a Manhattan grand jury in March on 30 counts of business fraud. He's pleaded not guilty. Now he is facing 37 federal charges relating to classified documents from his time in office that were uncovered by federal agents. A special counsel has been investigating this case since November of last year. But what makes this situation even more extraordinary is that Mr. Trump is also the current frontrunner in the Republican Party for the 2024 election. This means he could be taking on President Joe Biden while a special counsel appointed by the attorney general is working to convict him. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Over the next hour, CNN's Pamela Brown lays out everything we know about this case and takes us through the twists and turns that brought us to this moment. We'll also explore what this means for the former president as he faces his first court appearance this week and what implications this may have for the presidential race. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
