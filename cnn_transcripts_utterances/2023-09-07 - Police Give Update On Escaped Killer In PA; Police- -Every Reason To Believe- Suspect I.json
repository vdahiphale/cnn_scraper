      "sentences": "Let's listen to officials in Pennsylvania. They are giving an update right now on their search for escaped inmate and convicted murderer, Danelo Cavalcante.LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE:     The search of that area has been underway for the past few hours and continues at this time. Our search perimeter remains unchanged with the exception that we have thoroughly searched the area around two elementary schools previously contained within the perimeter and have adjusted the perimeter to exclude both schools from the perimeter area. We've done this in an effort to minimize the impact on students and their families while we continue with our search efforts. The District Attorney and I have an ongoing dialogue with school districts in the area and are committed to providing them the most up-to-date information so they can make informed decisions about school operations. I have told you all previously that we're utilizing hundreds of state, local and federal law enforcement officers, K-9s, aviation assets and various types of technology in an effort to keep the community safe and to bring this to as swift of a conclusion as possible. I'd like to provide the media and the public an opportunity for some insight of the scope of the operation that we've put in place. Following the press conference today, I'll provide you all details of how we can make that happen. As a reminder, we're asking the public's help by familiarizing themselves with the photograph and description of Cavalcante, to check security cameras they have and to call us immediately if they believe they may have seen him. Again, we ask residents to please secure homes, outbuildings and vehicles. Cavalcante has clearly already obtained some clothing and other unknown supplies and we want to minimize any opportunity that he might have to get anything more. It is very important we keep the pressure on him as we continue this hunt. Cavalcante is considered extremely dangerous and there were - is a reward - excuse me - of up to $20,000 offered for information leading to the capture of Cavalcante. Anyone with information is asked to call our tip line at 717-562-2987 - 717-562-2987. I continue to thank the community for their support and for allowing us the latitude to do our jobs while they deal with what I know are extremely stressful circumstances. We appreciate you all more than you know. I wanted to also - because we've had a number of inquiries - I mentioned an injury to one of our tactical dogs the other day, Loki (ph), and I wanted to provide you all just a brief update. He is doing well, has been released from the hospital earlier today and is expected to make a full recovery and return to work within the next week. And with that, we will be happy to take any questions that you might have.",
