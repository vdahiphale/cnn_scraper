And the same thing happened here behind the scenes, behind closed doors, you know, whether the powers that be, whether those are donors or brokers or former presidents said, hey, you know, Biden's out and Kamala is going to be in.

The second most expensive Democratic primary in the country after that spending that we saw against Jamaal Bowman in New York. He lost earlier this year by 15 points and he was also a member of the squad.This race, this victory by Wesley Bell came after there were a lot of issues that Cori Bush was fighting against in the first congressional district in Missouri. One of them was the fact that she was an early and fervent caller for a ceasefire in Gaza and as a result the Super PAC affiliated with AIPAC actually got involved in this race spending nine million dollars on ads against her including ads that highlighted the fact that Bush was one of six Democrats in the House to vote against President Joe Biden's infrastructure bill back in 2021. Now, she voted against it because she believed that it didn't have enough climate provisions in the legislation but what she was painted as is being a thorn in the side of the President in a very strongly held Democratic district, that really went on to hurt her. The other attacks against her were that she was more focused on national issues than local issues. And obviously this is a huge moment for progressives in the House of Representatives because she is seen as a member of the squad. She is seen as someone who has close ties to progressives. She was also facing an FBI investigation into the misuse of campaign funds something that she has denied. But there were just so many issues going into this primary that were stacked against her.

KEN MARTIN, CHAIRMAN, MINNESOTA DEMOCRATIC-FARMER-LABOR (DFL) PARTY: Well look they're going to say whatever they're going to say. The reality is his record speaks for himself and itself. Look crime is down in Minnesota. We have record job growth. Minnesota is the economic engine for the upper Midwest. We have the best GDP, the lowest unemployment rate, more people working than ever before. We have real job growth and wage growth in this state. The reality is, is that, you know, I think folks like Doug Burgum, North Dakota, South Dakota governors are jealous what Governor Walz has been able to do here in Minnesota and his record is one of success. And you know, look when he came into being governor and into office he sat down and he said he was going to build one Minnesota, one that worked for people throughout the state and that's what he's done.

Governor Walz was trying to solve one of the worst crises we've seen in our state and he mobilized as I said the National Guard. He made sure we restored law and order.And, you know, I think post the riots I think the Governor did exactly what a governor should do which is to bring communities together to help rebuild and to help the healing process and to make sure that we addressed, you know, some of the real challenges with policing in this state but also with racism and what we saw.

For example, yesterday, a Fox anchor said that conversations were happening about a debate in September. And a Harris campaign official pushed back, telling me, no, that's not true. The Harris camp was not actively talking to Fox about a debate. Now, maybe that's changed. Maybe there will be one. But I think what's more likely is that Trump is going to agree to that original ABC plan sometime in September. The date was September 10th on ABC.

General, great to see you this morning. Look, we haven't seen an Iranian response yet or a large-scale Hezbollah response over the last few days. And Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the anticipation is part of the attack in a way. What does he mean there? What's happening during this period? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING, (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah. It is surprising, John, that we haven't seen an attack yet. I mean, a lot of people anticipated that as early as last week. And I know there were a lot of folks getting spun up about the potential. And the United States has pushed a lot of weapons systems, aircraft, to the region, as well as attempting to get the USS Lincoln carrier battle group into the region. But what I would say is the anticipation is interesting, but it tells you what Iran might be trying to do. There were indicators that they were going to attack from multiple directions, both from Iranian launch sites in western Iran, but also in coordination with Hezbollah firing rockets and missiles from northern Israel. So all of those things are factors. There's still, you know, a lot of debate about the potential courses of action that the Iranians will use and how they will coordinate that with all of these groups that are in the region. They're trying to control not only their own launch sites from western Iran, but also control truthfully what I call free- floating electrons of independent groups, Hezbollah, Hamas, PMF in -- PMF in Iraq and Syria, Houthis in Yemen. So they've got a bevy of folks they're trying to put together for this kind of strike.",
