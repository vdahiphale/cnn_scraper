      "sentences": "Like the overarching takeaway is that they are still very much focused on the rescue, the recovery efforts that they're trying very hard not to impede anything that would get in the way of those.We have CNN's Danny Freeman there on the scene along with Brian Todd. We also have Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation. Gabe, let's start with you. You've been there for several hours this morning - I believe it's actually Danny - you've been there for several hours this morning, Danny. And I know you've talked to family members of those six people who are still missing you were describing just how understandably emotional they are with so many questions. Not a lot of information, in fact really none, out of that press conference. What are they saying to you now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you're not wrong Jessica especially about the still lack of information from the press conference that just concluded. But Boris highlighted that line that the main focus is still on the family and the people. And they did emphasize that while it's not the NTSB's priority, we are hearing and seeing the Coast Guard helicopters up there, they're still at this point searching for some of those people believed to be missing in the area behind me.But you're right, Jessica, I had a chance to speak with a number of people who say that they had immediate family members on that bridge behind me earlier this morning when it ultimately collapsed. Those family members very distressed, very upset as you can imagine and still hoping for more information. Let me tell you a little bit about what they told me. They said that their family members worked at Brawner Builders. That's a local construction company. It's only about five miles down the road from where we are at this spot. And before I go on, I want to note that Brawner Builders, they did not comment. They decline to comment I should say when we reached out to them. Now the first woman I spoke with said that she has at least two family members still missing who are working on that bridge behind me. Obviously, she's incredibly worried she did not want to reveal her name or her family members name at this time. But she said that her uncle had worked at this construction company for many, many years. Loved the job, loved being out there with the team. I also spoke with two other women who said that one of their family members actually was one of the people who survived the collapse and was able to get out of the hospital. But frankly they told me that he's still not doing well. You can imagine just the emotional and mental stress after witnessing and being a part of something like that. His wife was actually sitting in the car when I was having the conversation with these family members and she, as I described to you the other hour, Jessica, just sat really stone-faced, tears in her eyes, clearly this is just tremendously difficult for this entire family. And the one last thing I'll note, Jessica, is the Secretary of Transportation for Maryland noted that these workers were out here not doing major repairs not doing major infrastructure changes on this bridge they were just doing normal maintenance filling potholes to make drivers rides on this bridge easier day in and day out. So again, a tremendously difficult day for this particular community and for the family members still hoping for some answers here. Jessica? Boris?",

She was asked why they didn't drop anchor as soon as they started having power issues. As you saw in that footage, the lights were flickering on and off. She was unable to give an answer, obviously, still very early in the investigation. Let's ask Mary Schiavo about the process of investigating an incident like this.As Jennifer Homendy said, Mary, she said, \"The NTSB doesn't speculate. We provide facts.\" This is an enormous scene with a lot of folks that they have to interview. A lot of information to process. What is that going to be like?",

Mary, I just want to ask you too, while we have you, she said that they have not talked with the people on that ship, on that vessel. Her explanation was we didn't want to get out there and again impede anything about this rescue effort. But does it surprise you they haven't spoken to them yet because they're going to have so much information to fill in a lot of these holes.",

      "speaker": "SCHIAVO",
      "sentences": "They are, because the NTSB has pretty powerful investigative strength and the NTSB goes to hospital beds, they go to - wherever they have to, to get their witness statements. And so, I mean, her explanation of they do not want to get in the way of the Coast Guard, which is still a rescue operation it has not been switched to what they call a recovery operation and that is when they don't think anyone could survive. So no one would ever want to get in the way where there's a hope of bringing people back alive. So that was a reasonable explanation, but there was someone who is - was on the bridge, was on the shore and there's someone in the hospital. But so much would be answered by talking to those harbor pilots.And I understand the crew is international but sometimes, depending upon your work group, your union, your insurer, this vessel is insured by a group out of London. They do sometimes bring their counsel or their lawyers in and they insist that their lawyers be present, so there are a lot of moving parts here. And maritime law is extremely complicated, there are so many interests here that it's possible they want representatives present. But the NTSB is pretty powerful when it comes to getting their person, they will get their interviews.",

      "sentences": "Yes, a lot to consider when you look at a scenario like this. Let's go to CNN's Brian Todd.Because, Brian, you have a unique vantage point into this crash. And one of the things that we've heard from officials over and over again is just how challenging a search-and-rescue like this is going to be. You have frigid waters, you have the tide and then you have what I imagine are just massive amounts of gnarled steel in the water potentially impeding divers from getting to where they need to go.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, Boris. And we can actually show you that gnarled steel, that twisted metal and the concrete there. We have two cameras that we can - with which we can zoom in and you can see the point of impact. This is really where we have a unique angle on this accident.You can see the point of impact from here. We're a few hundred yards away, but you can see the twisted metal and the concrete from the bridge support that was that was just basically crushed and collapsed underneath the weight of this vessel. You can also see the twisted metal on top that's part of the stanchion of the bridge that is still lying over the bow of this ship. And you can see again that with the force with which this hit, this is a ship that's a little under a thousand feet long, about a hundred and forty feet wide, about a hundred and sixteen thousand tons. And you can literally see the force of impact there, look at that. Look at the twisted metal and the devastation there. And the fact that more than half of this bridge in the entire middle section is gone. We can also kind of illustrate for you with this visual, it's about a hundred and eighty-five foot drop from the top part of the bridge into the water. We do know that they are searching for, of course, six people unaccounted for. [15:10:04] We were told by officials that they tracked a few vehicles that were on top of the bridge that may have gone into the water, but it's unclear whether there were any people inside those vehicles. We were told also that one of the vehicles was observed with its lights on in the water but again not clear whether there were any people inside those vehicles that plummeted into the water. And again, we can just - again giving you this visual here, you can see rescue boats helicopters other vehicles in the water, moving around again searching for any sign of life, any people that might still be in the water. But we have told you all day about the conditions here, between 46 and 48 degrees Fahrenheit in the water, very dangerously cold conditions for anyone to survive more than a couple of hours. Those conditions I have to say also make it dangerous for the dive teams that are in here, about 50 divers have been in and out of the water all day long and of course they're alternating in and out of the water there. But again just the angle of this and you can see it much better now with the angle of the sun now hitting the Dali, this - that's the name of this vessel that that crashed into the bridge here on its way out of Baltimore harbor, it was fully loaded with containers that are still there and you can see just the devastation of this bridge. As we kind of pan over to your left and my right, our photojournalist Andrew Crispin (ph) can kind of show you the fact that everything is shut down here in the Port of Baltimore. These are some of the terminals over there that green vessel is called the Carmen (ph). It's a vessel that brings cars in and out of the Port of Baltimore and that has been completely stranded as have other vehicles, other vessels that have come in and out of the - usually come in and out of the harbor/ Everything is now trapped inside the harbor. You cannot get out it's a major, major economic disruption. Boris?",
