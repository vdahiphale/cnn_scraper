That's how the House GOP are arguing that -- what needs to happen in the United States Senate after leaders there unveiled the most substantial bipartisan border bill that we have seen in decades. Now the Republicans who negotiated that deal is calling out his own party for trying to torpedo it, even before reading it. And replacing George Santos. Early voting is underway in the special election that could have major implications for the balance of power in the House. We're going to bring you the latest from the campaign trail. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First up, our CNN exclusive poll, CNN's David Chalian is at the wall to reveal the latest results. David, what are we seeing?",

They know a verdict in this case before the election. 16 percent said yes, not essential.So, a majority of Americans want to see a verdict here in the federal election case before the election. 25 percent, a quarter of Americans say it doesn't matter. And look at this by party, Dana. 75 percent of Democrats, of course, say it's essential, 52 percent of independents say it is essential. They have a verdict.

We asked this a year and a half ago. You see Democrats are consistently overwhelmingly saying it was illegal independence about. 45 percent say it's illegal.

Imagine if that was being used to set up Donald Trump to run against Joe Biden. They're frustrated with Ronna McDaniel who -- just two weeks ago was saying primaries over Trump should be the nominee. They're frustrated her for not doing more to cancel the opposition to Donald Trump and get in line with Republican face, which is baked in that Donald Trump is going to be in legal trouble.
