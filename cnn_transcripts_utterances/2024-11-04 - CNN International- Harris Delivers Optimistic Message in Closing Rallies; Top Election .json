Keepin mind at this time tomorrow, voting will be well underway in the United States on the East Coast. Of course, a number of measures on the ballot, but that presidential election getting a lot of the attention in 2024. Thanks for being with us on this Monday. It's 09:00 a.m. here in New York. I'm Erica Hill. This is CONNECT THE WORLD. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump now making their final pitches to voters as a former president really leans into election denialism as part of his. Plus, an insight into the issues younger voters are prioritizing in 2024 we'll take a look at what is bringing them to the polls. And an entertainment industry legend, Quincy Jones, has died. He, of course, produced moments for some of the biggest artists in the world, from Michael Jackson to Frank Sinatra. We're going to take a look back at his life and his legacy. Well, with one day to go here, happy election eve to all those who celebrate. This has been a tense, exhausting campaign, and at this point, the polls show this election remains in a dead heat. The candidates really using these final hours to make their final pitches to voters, offering sharply different messages and in starkly different tones. Vice President Kamala Harris telling supporters in Michigan she is ready to lead through cooperation and consensus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have momentum. It is on our side. Can you feel it? America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward, where we see our fellow American not as an enemy, but as a neighbor. We are ready for a president who knows that the true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down. It is based on who you lift up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Both candidates today will be making stops in Pennsylvania. Donald Trump will also make his way to North Carolina and Michigan. Eva McKend is following the Harris campaign; she is in Pennsylvania for us. So, Eva, the Vice President, crisscrossing the keystone state today. We know here's a lot of attention on this state. Is this sort of all in on this final day, because they believe that it is Pennsylvania which is the key to those 270 electoral votes for Kamala Harris. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Erica, I can tell you that they have always put a high priority on this state. You'll remember several weeks ago when they had that debate prep camp here where she was essentially camped out here for a week. So, they have always seen Pennsylvania as crucial to the path to victory here. And I can tell you what's interesting about her closing message, she didn't even mention the former president by name last night. She's really trying to, at this stage, consolidate coalitions, now that Trump has been well litigated, and focusing instead on unity. So, she begins today with some good old-fashioned door knocking over in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that, of course, is the hometown of President Joe Biden. Then she heads here to where I am in Allentown, Pennsylvania. We are on the campus of Muhlenberg College. The campaign noting that Allentown has a very heavy Latino population, more than 30,000 Puerto Ricans. And she's going over to Reading where she will campaign with Governor Josh Shapiro and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. She does a big rally over in Pittsburgh, and then another big, star-studded affair over in Philadelphia, where she will be joined by the roots Jasmine, Sullivan, Oprah Winfrey. And core to this message is telling her supporters, listen, don't sit on the sidelines. We want to wake up the day after the election feeling as though that they put it all on the line and did everything that they could, Erica.",

You know, we're talking about those seven keybattleground states, four in the Sun Belt, three in the Great Lakes. Look, the widest lead in any of these states is Trump plus three in Arizona, but you got them plus one in Georgia, less than a point in North Carolina, less than a point Nevada. You jump over the Great Lakes; you get blue on your screen. But again, when I'm putting in this less than symbol, you know it's tight, less than a point lead in Pennsylvania, less than a point lead in Wisconsin, less than a point lead in Michigan for Kamala Harris. Let's put that onto the electoral map, and what do we get? Well, you can't get any closer than this. Kamala Harris at 270 electoral votes, when the race is to 270 and you're exactly there, that's how tight it is. It's because, of course, she carries these Great Lake battleground states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. But you know, Erica, I'm a big fan of history. I like going back, so I decided to look back at the final polls of each election over the last 52 years, and project those final polls on the electoral map. If the polls were perfect right now, in 2024 the leader gets 270 electoral votes. That is the tightest, the tightest the polls have ever been going into a presidential election the last 50 years. The next closest was back in 2000 when Al Gore was projected to get 281 electoral votes. Of course, he did not ultimately reach the White House because he lost Florida, which the final polls had him winning, but by just a smidgen, Erica.",

You know, if you look at an aggregation of forecast models, you put them together, willthe 2024 winner get 300 plus electoral votes, which, in my mind, is a relative blowout. There's a majority chance, 60 percent yes, compared to the minority shot 40 percent no. What the heck is going on here? Because I just showed you all these close polls. Here's what's going on here. If you look back through history, polls are not perfect. The average error in a swing state aggregate is 3.4 points since 19,172 that is larger than all of the seven closest battleground states which are all within three points. So, what does that mean? What does that mean for the electoral map? Well, if the average error benefits Kamala Harris, what happens? She gets all the way up to 319 electoral votes, because she carries those Great Lake battleground states. She carries North Carolina and Georgia and the Southeast and Nevada and Arizona and the Southwest. Of course, the error could go the other way, and if it goes the other way, and benefits Donald Trump, he gets all the way up to 312 electoral votes because he carries those southeast battleground states. He carries those in the southwest. And more importantly, he blocks Kamala Harris' path to 270 electoral votes by winning Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The bottom line is this, Erica Hill, we've been together once. We've been together twice. We've been together thrice. Even more than that, I still have no idea what's going to happen. It's the one time I've had into a presidential election where I don't even have a gut.

      "sentences": "Well Erica, this is actually Donald Trump's fourth visit, I believe, to North Carolina in just the last three days. Hehas been hitting the state aggressively in this final stretch, which I think should tell you all you need to know. That there are concerns about his performance in North Carolina, and that in itself, is notable just given both in 2016 and 2020 Donald Trump won North Carolina sure last cycle, it was by a narrow margin. But keep in mind that we haven't seen a Democrat win North Carolina since 2008 when Barack Obama was successful here. So, very notable that he's been hitting this so much. But yes, today he is starting here in North Carolina. We're about to see him take the stage at least he's scheduled to take the stage in roughly under an hour. Then he'll have two stops in Pennsylvania and finish his day in Michigan. But I think the key thing to keep in mind is what will his closing message look like? And there is a question about that. I can tell you from my conversations with Trump's advisers, with those close to the former president, what they want the closing message to be is three key things. One, they want him to really focus on encouraging his supporters to get out and vote, to turn out tomorrow. Do not sit this out. Do not be complacent. That is the message they are trying to drill into the minds of his supporters, because, again, this is expected to be an incredibly close election. But also, they want to be talking about the policy areas where they know that he polls better than Kamala Harris, that includes the economy, that includes immigration. Now I say all this, and these are things that we've talked about Erica for months now that people have been telling Donald Trump to do this, but we did not actually see him do that yesterday. Instead, a lot of his remarks were off script. He kind of went off the rails at times where he took -- you know a series of minutes talking about, at one point, criticizing these polls that showed Kamala Harris gaining ground on Donald Trump. He talked about believing he said, I don't think I should have left to the White House back in 2020. He sowed seeds of doubt on the integrity of this upcoming election. And he also made a comment about, he was talking about the former assassination attempt on his life and the bullet proof glass that surrounded him. And said -- you know if someone wanted to get to me, they would have to shoot through the press first, and then he said, I don't mind. Now, it's that kind of inflammatory rhetoric that people are very worried about. I can tell you, behind the scenes, when I talk to Donald Trump's team, they're exhausted, but they were also exasperated. I had one ally who told us that they didn't understand why he couldn't just stay on message and say -- you know, Kamala broke this country. I will fix it. That is what they want him to be saying. But sometimes Donald Trump was unable to do that. So, I think today keep a very close eye on whether or not he is going to be able to stay on message and kind of give that rallying rhetoric that -- use that rallying language that they want him to be delivering with just one day left to go until voters take to the polls, Erica.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Erica, it's no coincidence that in the final days of the election, there are these fake viral videosthat are popping up in battle ground states. We had Pennsylvania a week or two ago. In this particular case, we're talking about Georgia, where there was a fake video. And we have to say fake every time, because it is utter fiction, purporting to show Haitian immigrants claiming they voted multiple times in Georgia. And this is utterly false. And in fact, the video was created out of thin air. I don't even think these are real people. And the Secretary of State of Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, was quick to call it out as likely Russian disinformation. And in fact, perhaps less than 24 hours later, the intelligence agencies, the FBI, DHS, all said it was Russian -- a Russian group, if you will, that created this video. Now we actually know a lot about this Russian network of fake accounts. CNN did an investigative story about this just last week where we trace some of these accounts to the remnants of the notorious Russian troll farm run by Yevgeny Prigozhin that interfered in the 2016 election. So, these aren't new characters for the intelligence community or for reporters who have followed it. However, the difference now, Erica, is in 2024 they're able to rapidly generate these videos, sometimes using AI, spread them on X, formerly known as Twitter, where they're often circulate freely for a while, at least. And it's hard to tell how much impact it's having on voters, but it's very concerning for U.S. officials who are trying to reinforce that, yes, the elections are free and fair, a devoid of meaningful fraud that would impact any outcome.

They use the word irreplaceable, the fact that this is a U.N. agency which has been on the ground for decades, which has the infrastructure to be able to help Palestinian refugees. And certainly, Palestinians who are in desperate need of food, water, shelter, humanitarian aid and medicine, the absolute basics at this point. So, there is grave concern among many countries that this is going to make it extremely difficult for those Palestinians to get the aid that they need. Now, what it means is, in about three months' time, it will be enacted, and it means that UNRWA will not be able to operate inside of Israel. It means no Israeli authority or official will be able to contact the U.N. agency, which effectively makes it almost impossible for this agency to work inside Gaza or the occupied West Bank. So, we've even heard from the U.S. State Department saying that they want this. First of all, they wanted it not to go through, but then, when it was approved in the parliament, they said they wanted the implementation to be delayed, because at this time in Gaza, there is no one else who can take over the needs of the people and the civilians who are desperately trying to survive there. Israel has long wanted this to happen. They accuse the agency of being affiliated with Hamas, something which UNRWA denies. They have also said that they believe a small handful were part of the October 7th attacks against Israel. A U.N. investigation found that nine may have had links to that attack, and they were fired immediately. But the U.N. has said that there are 13,000 employees from this group that are desperately trying to help those on the ground. In fact, more than 230 of this agency's workers have been killed during the war in Gaza. So, there is some very significant concern humanitarian aid groups on the ground as well saying they cannot pick up the slack. This is an infrastructure that UNRWA has, and it is not something, especially in the middle of a war that can be lost, Erica.",

There have been some changes since 2020 and we're not going through a global pandemic right now. So, there are going to be a lot fewer people casting ballots by mail and the mail-in ballots just literally take longer to process. States like Georgia, they're opening those ballots early. Most states do this to get them ready, so that relatively early on election night, they hope to have most of their ballots counted. Georgia is one of the first battleground states where polls close. North Carolina, they close at 07:30 Eastern. If those two states are relatively quick, maybe we'll have an idea of what's going on with the day sort of early. But the state that you referenced 2020 when it took four days. The state that put President Joe Biden over the edge in four years ago, Pennsylvania, they're not opening those mail in ballots early. So, it could take a very long time again in Pennsylvania, when they start opening the ballots tomorrow on Election Day and then wait to count them. And of course, in Georgia and North Carolina, those states, even if it's very close, having those ballots open early might not help us find out until a day or later, when we start counting things like provisional ballots, ballots from overseas further west in Nevada, they will accept mail-in ballots until November 9, as long as they were postmarked on Election Day.

There's a little bit for both sides in the early voting data. If you're a Republican, you take comfort from the fact that there is significantly higher Republican turnout early. This cycle, President Trump and all of his surrogates and the party have been encouraging Republican voters to actually vote early this time. So, you do take some comfort from that, but if you're on the Democratic side, you're taking, I'd say, a lot more comfort from the fact that we're seeing much higher turnout by women.

So, if anything, the surprise this time is probably not the silent Trump voter that turns out. It's actually more silent Harris voters, which I think again, are going to be independent. And some Republican women that vote Harris, that are not getting picked up in the polls, but if anything, pulls over corrected for Trump.",

And the importing company has to pay those tariffs, and then they can either eat the cost, or often what happens is they pass the cost along to consumers. And some companies that make stuff that we all buy. They're already warning about the inflationary impact here. The CEO of Auto Zone said during a recent earnings call that if we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer, and that they won't wait for that to happen. There's also over 300 economists who signed a recent letter opposing Trump, and they wrote just as Mexico didn't pay for a wall in his first term, China will not pay for Trump's tariffs if he's given a second term. You will. One other company out there that is warning about the inflationary impact of Trump's potential tariffs. The CEO of Columbia Sportswear told \"The Washington Post\" that they are already buying stuff today for next fall, and that if needed, they'll just raise prices. They say it's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans if there are these tariffs out there.
