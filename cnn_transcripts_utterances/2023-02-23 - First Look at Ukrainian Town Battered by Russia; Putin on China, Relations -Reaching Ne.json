Vuhledar is unique and that it sits at the intersection of two main active fronts in Ukraine, the southern and the eastern front. That is why Russia wants to try to push through here to launch an offense into Donbas. It is believed that this is one of their shaping operations, the beginning of a larger offensive to come in the next few weeks. But they are struggling very badly right now. They have lost a huge amount of men and armored vehicles as they try to cross fields, including minefields, where the Ukrainians have been able to inflict a huge amount of damage on their troops. At the same time, the Russians are absolutely pummeling this town.

All of the windows have been blown out. Craters here in the ground where children used to play. Ukrainians have the benefit of the higher ground here and these buildings to use in the fighting.

Of course, the picture is vastly different from the east and the southern area, where Alex just reported from, and from here because this city, this capital was one of the first targets. If you remember a year ago, when Russia sent in tanks and armored personnel carriers and troops from the north via Belarus, when it landed paratroopers in an airport not so far from Kyiv, when it really believed that it would capture this capital and decapitate the leadership, none of that happened. The Ukrainian forces pushed and forced the Russian forces back from here. But as we all described back then, then the Russians were regrouping and putting all their attention onto the east. That is where this war has mostly been grinding on for the last 11 months at least. And that is what everyone now is focused on in terms of whether there will be this highly vaunted, much touted Russian offensive. So far, there is no evidence of a full-scale, new Russian spring offensive. But as Alex said and others have, whether it's Bakhmut or Vuhledar, there is this ongoing war of attrition. It's almost World War I style. There are, as you know, trench warfare going on in some of this area. It's really, really basic. It's really difficult, it's really hard. Hundreds of thousands of Russians have been killed or wounded, according to the U.S.; about half of that on the Ukrainian side. Huge amounts of artillery and ammunition being used that NATO, anyway, is rushing to try to replenish and resupply the Ukrainians for the second year of war. But I will say this. The spirit of the Ukrainian people remains as strong, if not stronger. When asked, these few days and throughout this past year, whether there was any chance of surrender or bowing to the Russian pressure, including the illegal missile strikes on civilian energy and other missile structure, they say no. And they are optimistic. They just hope the West has the staying power, their friends have the staying power to outlast whatever Putin has in mind -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "Yes, first of all, Becky, you're absolutely right, it's unusual. It's certainly somethingthat really, we've been monitoring for the last couple of months. There has been, I'm not sure if you should call it a power struggle but there has been a rivalry going on between Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner private military company and the Russian defense ministry. We've seen that over the past couple of months, as the defense ministry, for instance, where the Russian military was struggling in the south, in the Kherson region. Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose forces are more active in the Bakhmut area, in the eastern part of the country, he would come out and say, look, I don't know how things are going in Kherson. But in Bakhmut everything is fine. So he has long essentially sold himself to Vladimir Putin as the guy who can produce results for Vladimir Putin. That is certainly something that the defense ministry didn't like. Now what's been going on since then is that, around the Bakhmut area, the defense ministry has also joined the fight. This was supposed to be the place that the Russian forces were going to win before the one year anniversary. Now we know that so far hasn't happened but that appears to have been the plan. So you sort of have these two dueling forces in that area, the Wagner private military company and the actual Russian military, who are both fighting on the same side, while their leaders seem to be feuding in the backdrop. And so Yevgeny Prigozhin at some point said that he simply wasn't getting any ammunition anymore from the Russian defense ministry. And he posted that picture; he accused them of being treasonous, as you said. The Russian defense ministry actually refuted that, saying, look, there are still very much assault operations going on, on the Russian side, in the Bakhmut area. And so therefore anyone claiming that there is not enough ammunition available there, simply isn't telling the truth. So that was something that was really boiling up here in Russia, certainly very much on social media in that sphere. Today, Yevgeny Prigozhin said that ammunition was on its way. In fact, there was a measure that he released from the battlefield today, greeting everybody on Defenders of the Fatherland Day for Russia, Becky.",

You will know, from your spot in the Middle East, China has been a big customer of Russian oil and gas.

He said he's continuing his engagement with all of the parties involved. This statement came out before we heard about his trip to Gaza. We're still looking at the details. But it appears as though he was there for a few hours. Most likely, he was meeting with the top echelon there of Hamas after those rockets were fired last night. We were very much expecting some sort of response from Gaza because, among the militants killed during the operation in Nablus was a member of Hamas as well as two commanders from Islamic Jihad. And the militant factions in Gaza did say essentially that there was going to be a response. But I do have to say that, so far, it didn't spiral into something potentially bigger than it could have; just six rockets. The Israeli military responding with airstrikes on what it said was a weapons manufacturing depot belonging to Hamas. But no injuries or casualties on either side. Much of the attention here is still very much on Nablus and what happened there yesterday because we just look at the sheer numbers, the timing of all of this:  11 killed; among those, militants but also there is likely to be unarmed civilians, bystanders, who were killed as a result. And some 500 injuries, 100 of them at least by live ammunition, according to Palestinian officials. We're looking at some images from the aftermath. You know, we have a team there right now, who is saying that it just looks like a war zone in parts. Bullet holes riddling storefronts, doors; this raid took place in the Old City of Nablus.

There are some 900,000 people currently living in tents across southeastern Turkiye. We're in the city of Iskander; in fact, we're at the port of Iskander and, right now, where another noble form of providing shelter for those who've been displaced has been developed with volunteers here, working around the clock. On this ship, this is the Gemini, currently housing a number of those who have been displaced in this region. More than 1,000 people currently on board. There are more than 400 cabins. This, of course, is an important new development. There will be another ship coming on soon to help house people. But look, this is just one way of helping these people. This is a temporary measure. What we've heard, of course, from the Turkish government is that they're planning to send more tents and containers and more permanent structures for families to stay in.

Launched in the late 1990s, it set out tostudy and map our DNA, to help us understand ourselves effectively. Almost 30 years later, scientists are pushing at the barriers of gene editing, as it is known. This could hold the cure to diseases like leukemia and Alzheimer's, as my colleague, Anna Stewart, found out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  I've sent my DNA here to find out all about my genome. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  This is why we do the first quality control step. A. STEWART (voice-over):  I'm hoping my sample wasn't disqualified. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  Oh, it was perfect. A. STEWART (voice-over):  I did it right? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over):  You did it right. A. STEWART (voice-over):  A couple decades ago, labs like this did not exist. It was impossible for people to get information about their genome. That all changed in the early 2000s.",

FRANCIS COLLINS, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH:  All of us working on the Human Genome Project realized this was historic. This was something we would only do once as a human species, to read our own instruction book. And we were doing it. A. STEWART (voice-over):  Dr. Francis Collins and his team spent 13 years and $2.7 billion to complete the task. The Human Genome Project gave us the tools to read and decipher our genetic code. It was a good start but what came next changed everything.
