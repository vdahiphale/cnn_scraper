Now to this, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger died last night at the age of 100. Almost as polarizing figure in death as he was in life, Kissinger was born in Germany, he and his Jewish family fled Nazi persecution and came to the U.S. in 1938. He served in World War II, earned a doctorate and taught at Harvard, eventually joining the Nixon administration. Kissinger dominated American foreign policy in the 1970s, building U.S. relations with Russia and China, negotiating importing nuclear arms agreement. But no issue complicates his legacy like Vietnam. Critics accuse Kissinger and Nixon of needlessly expanding the war which ended for the U.S. with the fall of Saigon at the cost of nearly 60,000 American lives, along with the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese civilians. Here's Kissinger view of those events 35 years later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But this is what I've been hearing in terms of the conversation around this.And Schumer says a Jewish Americans are alarmed to see some of our fellow citizens characterize a brutal terrorist attack as justified because of the actions of the Israeli government. They feel lonely. They show support for other groups, but those other groups aren't necessarily showing support for them, that has echoes of the past for them. We're seeing similar conversations in other countries, I'll point out Germany for obvious reasons, but also, yesterday, we were hearing from the head of domestic intelligence in Germany really warning about the rise in antisemitic language there. It's happened there a again, he's stretching back to the same period in history. And he saying there is a specific problem that he's worried about in that is the fact that there are extremist groups and desperate groups in Germany that are coming together off the back of what happened in Israel because they are seeing antisemitism the Jewish population in Israel perhaps as a common enemy. He's now worried that these extremist groups that don't have much in common otherwise are coming together and may cooperate in the future in the face of antisemitism, off the back of antisemitism. These things are very complex. They go back decades as you suggested. We don't all understand them, but there is a stream there, very senior people like Schumer and the head of intelligence in Germany are seeing.",

A big debate on social media amongst young people, for example, from what I've seen, you know, what Israel is doing is disproportionate to what, you know, Hamas did to Israel. I mean, these are very simplistic arguments. And that's what's frustrating so many Jewish people around the world.And so, I think people like Schumer stepping up and really explaining how Jewish people are feeling, or at least inform that debate to some extent, when there's sympathy on all sides here for the civilians who've really suffered on a horrific way on all sides.",

It is late fall, heading into winter, we're getting kind of the opposite but this collision of colder and warmer air mass is creating this potential for severe weather. And this time, it is right over a population density that is over 4 million. So, just incredible and it encompasses about 20 million. But look at Houston incorporated within the highest probability with that risk for tornadoes from the Storm Prediction Center, very clever meteorologists, they're recognizing some of the ingredients there for severe thunderstorm development in and around the Houston area. At the lowest level of the atmosphere, winds coming out of the due south off of the Gulf of Mexico, lots of moisture there. Few thousand feet above that, the winds are moving in the south to south -- or north to northeasterly direction. So, that's going to provide the spin necessary for potential thunderstorms that could start to rotate, that means tornadoes. You can see the sporadic nature to the thunderstorm development later today, and then another round of showers and thunderstorms tomorrow. All in all, a very wet weekend across the Deep South and into the Southeast. So, be prepared, plan accordingly -- Kasie.",
