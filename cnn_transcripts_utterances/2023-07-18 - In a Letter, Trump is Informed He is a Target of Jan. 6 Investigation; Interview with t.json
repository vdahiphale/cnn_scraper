      "sentences": "Kate, what this indicates with Donald Trump now saying publicly that he has received a target letter and that he's invited to the grand jury to testify in Washington, it indicates that this investigation is in its final throes. We have been getting a lot of intelligence on that for some time now. We've put out several stories about all of the aspects of this various investigation, legs about looking into the fake electors, looking into pressure at the Justice Department, looking into what Donald Trump was doing and what his campaign was doing in battleground states, looking into the pressure around Mike Pence on January 6th, itself, and as well as financial aspects.There are so many pieces of this investigation that had appeared to be coming together, wrapping up with the special counsel's office, nailing down testimony from some of the most sought-after people inside of the White House, the Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the Vice President Mike Pence. All of them being asked questions about Donald Trump himself and their interactions with him. And so now, what we have is the most assured indication that we have had so far that the Justice Department is looking at charging the former president of the United States with what he was doing at the end of his presidency to hold on to power and potentially block the transfer of power to the rightful winner of the 2020 election Joe Biden. And so, that is now out there because Trump is saying, himself, he received this target letter on Sunday, that he was being given four days to potentially come into the grand jury and testify. He did not go into the grand jury and testify in the Southern District of Florida when he got a similar target letter in the case related to his retention of national secrets after the presidency. And he was indeed charged with a crime there. And so now, Kate, we wait to see what happens in these coming days. What will this grand jury do? And we do know they are meeting today. They continue to work with the prosecutors from the special counsel's office.",

One of the biggest problems here is that the former president recently lost three of the key lawyers who were representing him in most of the special counsel matters. They have all departed his team over the past month or so. So, right now, he is represented by Chris Kise, the Former Florida Solicitor General. Also, Todd Blanche. His other people who are actively working as part of his legal defense on the variety of different legal issues that he is facing.But if he was to be charged in Washington, D.C., with another criminal case on January 6th, he would likely need a new lawyer whose sole job would be focusing on that prosecution. Someone with expertise in that area. Someone who is, of course, licensed. So, it's really just not clear what the division of labor would be across the lawyers he already has and lawyers who would at least try to bring on to help him. He's clearly facing, I mean, multiple ongoing criminal investigations. In the State of New York, right, he's been charged there criminally in the hush money probe. He's been charged federally by the special counsel for allegedly mishandling classified documents. He's looking at possible charges in Georgia. And now, likely charges -- federal charges in Washington, D.C. So, suffice it to say he's going to needs more lawyers.",

Look, judges have busy calendars, lawyers have busy calendars, both prosecutors and defense attorneys. And when we appear in front of a judge, the judge is not concerned about what's going on outside of their district. They want to know, what are you doing to get ready for this case here.

      "sentences": "Always with these things, there are multiple motivations going into it, especially when you're talking about Donald Trump. I mean, first thing's first, I mean, he says he received this target letter on Sunday night, it's now Tuesday, and that means that he made a decision to make that pronouncement today. Some of it, I think, has to do with Trump's genuine anger about this.I mean, he uses his \"Truth Social\" platform in the same way that he used Twitter just to vent. And he said before, he does not want to be indicted. He has told people that he's gone his entire adult life without being indicted until now. Now, he has faced two indictments and is possibly facing a third. So, that is real. But I think it allows him, in his view, to get ahead of the narrative. To really shape how this is talked about in the media and how it's talked about among Republican voters. The -- when he was last indicted, Trump benefited from a huge fundraising boost. He benefitted from basically wall-to-wall coverage of his own making before the special counsel had an opportunity to put out a statement. And that's, I think, what part of the strategy here is, is to just get ahead of this, set the narrative, set the tone, especially among Republican voters. Trump is really focused right now on getting through this Republican primary. And doing so really, by any means necessary, including really swarming the zone even with bad news about the potential that he could be charged yet again in another case.",

Command, which is essentially in charge of the stabilization of this area between North Korea and South Korea.And we can read that tweet to you that alerted all of us to the situation unfolding right now saying, a U.S. national on a JSA Orientation Tour, that's a Joint Security Area Orientation Tour, without authorization, that's a key, crossed into the demarcation line into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We believe he is currently in DPRK custody and are working with our KPA partners to resolve this incident. Very clear that the United States is now engaged in this effort. Behind the scenes, U.S. officials working closely with their South Korean counterparts, of course, that is a close ally of the United States. And we're learning bits and pieces about what happened here. We have learned from the colleagues at the Pentagon that as you were saying, this is a soldier who is enlisted in the U.S. forces South Korea. We should note that there are about 28,000 U.S. soldiers who are based in South Korea. But he wasn't in uniform when he -- when this occurred. He was out of uniform. He was on this tour of this area that Marc just described to you. And we should note that, you know, this area is shown off to people as an effort to try and demonstrate what kind of control and what kind of stability there is, even though there's tense relations between North and South Korea. The point of the tour is just to show people that they have a capability to maintain what is a peaceful outcome at this moment in time. Now, the backdrop to all of this, guys, as you know is the Biden administration has not had regular back and forth communication with North Korea throughout its two and a half years in office. The Biden administration has reached out to North Korea on multiple instances to try and engage. Said that there wouldn't have to be preconditions for those conversations. But North Korea has not substantively engaged. So, now, what we're trying to find out is exactly how the United States is in touch with North Koreans, potentially through the South Koreans, through their Chinese counterparts, as they try and resolve what is a really dramatic incident that has occurred. And we are trying to learn more about, you know, how this all went down.",
