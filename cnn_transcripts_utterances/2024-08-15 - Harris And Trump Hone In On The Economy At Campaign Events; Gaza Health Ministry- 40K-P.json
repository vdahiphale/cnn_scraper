Stephen, these efforts by both sides to put the cost of living crisis and providing further support to voters across America front-and-center in their campaigns. Is the former president going to be successful in defining Kamalanomics as we are now calling it, as really an extension of what we saw under the Biden administration, and can she separate herself from this criticism that President Biden has received as a result?",

I have been speaking to some Democrats recently and they believe that althoughKamala Harris is an integral part of the Biden administration, polling shows that she is not necessarily blamed by voters for some of the more controversial aspects of the administration in terms of the failure to get inflation more under control. You might wonder, that event today was very interesting. You might wonder why the vice president, a day after she was tied to the Biden administration and high prices that have angered consumers over the last few years, why she would appear next to the president? Well, the answer is the substance there. This push to lower prescription drug prices has been going on for years. They finally won. It is a big deal. A lot of seniors are going to see their drug costs go down substantially and seniors are a very important part of the electorate and one that Kamala Harris has had less success so far courting than the president. So she wants to claim a share of the credit for the successes of the Biden administration and I think tomorrow in her big speech in North Carolina, she will start to move a little bit away from the president. She is going to talk about price gouging that she says is going on by supermarket owners. So a more populist tone than Biden has adopted so far.",

That needs to stay the case. That was not the case, or at least that was not what Trump tried to do when he was president before. He tried to interfere with the Fed's actions and called the Fed chair an enemy of the people, among other things. And he has made clear that if he were granted the presidency, again, he would be even more interventionist, which causes all sorts of problems. Beyond that, I think there are things here and there that the president can do. They, unfortunately, don't have a dial on their desk that allows them to turn the price level up or down, but for example, the president could repeal some tariffs. Biden had correctly talked about how Trumps tariffs back in 2020 were increasing prices for consumers, as well as putting American jobs at risk than when Biden got into office. Of course, he kept almost all of those tariffs in place. Trump now wants to escalate those trade wars even further, which would make things worse. But at the very least, you could repeal some of those things now. Other things like immigration, frankly normalizing immigration and making more legal or relief channels available for people to come here and legally work here has been helpful. Biden has done it. There has been a lot of attention to the unlawful border crossings, but Biden has also unwound some of the bureaucratic knots that the Trump administration tied to make it harder for skilled workers or for agricultural workers for that matter, to come here. So keeping that going, maybe adding more lawful pathways would also be helpful particularly in industries they are very heavily reliant on immigrant labor that have had problems in recent years with supply chain issues and prices because of those labor shortages.

Pretty much every country that has ever tried a form of price controls has found that they do not work in the sense that they lead to shortages. They lead to pricing uncertainty, they lead to black markets et cetera. We don't really know what Kamala Harris' version of this policy would be. She doesn't define any of her terms. She says she would get rid of excessive pricing and excessive corporate profits. Who decides what is excessive? That is to be determined. The likely template for this policy is a bill that already exists that was introduced by Elizabeth Warren in the Senate, as well as I think seven or eight other Democratic senators and that Kamala Harris had actually signed onto a version of when she herself was a senator and that essentially says that the FTC can use whatever metric it wants to, to decide that a company has made too much money, which is really not a great way to have a functioning free market economy, and to have a dynamic economy. It would also require companies, public companies, to disclose their pricing strategy, their costs, their internal profit margins on various goods, things like that in their ten-case, which among other things is actually likely to facilitate collusion. There has been research on this as well, that when you force companies or when you -- when the government asks companies to publicly explain their pricing strategies and their internal costs, it makes it easier for them to coordinate and to raise costs more.

Now, it is important to remember, Palestinian authorities do not distinguish between combatants and civilians and CNN cannot independently verify the casualty numbers. We can confirm though the human suffering in Gaza, especially among children. Jomana Karadsheh has more, and a warning, her report contains graphic video, but it is important to see it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Everything we are about to show you was filmed over the course of four hours in a single day, a snapshot of 10 months of war for Gaza's children. Nothing can erase what these little eyes have seen, but they've come here to try to forget, even if just for a little while. Most of these children were on their way to queue up for water, one of the newfound hardships of this miserable life when they stop for a makeshift puppet show. Cans, cardboard and string, it's a distraction, but kids have to relate to their make believe friends with stories just like theirs. (UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE speaking in foreign language.",

Among them, a severely injured toddler. He clings on to the stranger who brought him here. There's no room left. They leave him on the floor. His cries, his pain, drowned out by the chaos. Outside, another ambulance pulls up with another boy, here for the morgue. \"It wasn't the bombs that killed him. He starved to death,\" his father says.

Will they go through so successfully or at least go through so far on one day that they -- the parties -- intend to continue the next, they would have said, look, that's a long stretch. And I think one of the sort of better indications, because remembering that this has come about for multiple reasons, not just because of the death and suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza, not just because of the longing of the heartache of all the families of the hostages that are still being held by Hamas in Gaza, but in part as well because Israel, it is believed and certainly that's the contention of the Iranians, murdered Ismail Haniyeh, one of the top Hamas negotiators while he was in Tehran and their threat was, and they said they were going to strike back. So this has all been about Gaza, but it has been about preventing or giving Iran a reason not to retaliate and strike against Israel. So, this evening, we understand that one of the principal interlocutors, the mediation team inside of Doha, the foreign minister -- well, he is the prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar has called his Iranian counterpart, the acting foreign minister in Tehran to brief him on the talks, and I think that gives you a sense that there is something to say, whether or not there are positive things to say, one wouldn't expect him to call up with a list of the negative. But clearly, there is a diplomatic dimension to this that has traction tonight. The acid test is going to be what happens tomorrow, and then whether the mediators then meet with Hamas which there is a very high likelihood they will. And then what Hamas is reaction is, and one of the other things were hearing from the White House today was don't expect quick answers because Hamas' representative in Doha will then have to reference back to the leadership in Gaza and that always takes time.",

I think that is perhaps a stretch too far given how difficult it has been to get to this moment. But look, in diplomatic terms, people are talking it was Churchill who said jaw-jaw is better than war-war. Well, right now, were in the midst of jaw- jaw. So, I think it would be a surprise if the Iranians, they are summing tonight, but nothing has been taken off the table and as you said before, the White House assessment is that Iran absolutely still could and maybe will strike back at Israel.

Never mind about the distortionary effects. Is sticking to those in keeping the details light perhaps the best plan for Kamala Harris?",

Now, you know, whether that is a central factor in why inflation spiked so much in the U.S. and spike so much around the world, you know, after the pandemic is another question, but certainly I think she's going to lean into that identity, get it today, and the statements about negotiating lower prices with drug companies, tied it to a work in California, certainly she's going to do it tomorrow in her economic speech talking about consolidation in the meatpacking industry and the effect on prices, you know, people feel it at the grocery store. But it's also worth noting that in the analysis that has been done, economists, again, this question of looking back or looking forward, economists have consistently said such as Mark Zandi of Moody's that Trump's agenda going forward is more inflationary than anything that Biden or Harris is proposing at this point. The combination of mass deportation and across-the-board, 10 percent tariffs, which this week he floated with Elon Musk, he might raise to 20 percent across-the-board tariffs plus massive tax cuts and threatening the independence of the Fed, you know, Moody's has calculated that that would add a full point of inflation more to the forecast than what you could expect under the Biden policies. So we'll see how hard Harris pushes back, but mostly I think she wants to kind of shift again this debate forward to what will she do, and economists may say, you know, tackling corporations is a prominent part problem --",
