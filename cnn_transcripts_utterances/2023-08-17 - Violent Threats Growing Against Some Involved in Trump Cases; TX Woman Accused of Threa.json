There are new chilling details about the threats both are now facing. In Texas, a woman is in custody after threatening to kill the federal judge in special counsel Jack Smith's 2020 election probe.In Georgia, there's violent chatter on far right websites that is escalating against grand jury members who voted to indict Donald Trump. Their names were published as part of the indictment and now their photos and purported addresses are being circulated online. And we have just learned when Donald Trump is likely to surrender in Georgia, it will be next week, according to sources. CNN's Nick Valencia is outside the jail in Georgia. Nick, what are police saying about these threats against those grand jurors? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: While they are clearly disturbed by this, as is everyone who's hearing the news, safety and security clearly being an issue here, still a very big issue related to those connected to this legal process with a woman now in Texas in custody for threatening to kill the Texas judge that's overseeing the federal election case tied to the former president. A judge receiving a phone call in her chambers on August 5th with part of that phone call reportedly saying, \"you are in our sights, we want to kill you.\" That call reportedly also included some racist language. The judge we should mention is black. Meanwhile, here in Georgia, some far right anonymous users online are calling for violence against the Fulton County grand jurors. Overnight, social media profiles, photos, and even in some cases home addresses purportedly belonging to some of these grand jurors finding their way online. CNN cannot independently verify the posts, and we're not naming the websites, but it appears as though some of those names matched the names that were made public as part of Georgia law under the indictment that Fulton County indictment that was issued earlier this week. Fulton County grand jurors still have not made any comments publicly. Meanwhile, here, outside of the Fulton County jail, we're still waiting for those 19 defendants to turn themselves in, including the former president. Our Alayna Treene tells us that sources is familiar with the matter understand that the Trump team is still negotiating with the Fulton County District Attorney's office. They don't only have to negotiate with Trump's team, but also the Secret Service, the conditions of his surrender. Sara.",

Giuliani faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees, also sanctions amid numerous lawsuits. And now of course, he faces criminal charges in Georgia. CNN Senior Legal Affairs correspondent Paula Reid broke the story right along with Kaitlan Collins. Paula joins us now, this again, I see it as a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago by Giuliani to, you know, beg Trump for money. Paula, what happened here?",

They didn't agree on a timeline or an amount, but about a month later, a Trump aligned political action committee, Save America, paid $320,000 for Rudy Giuliani to settle one of his many bills.But outside of that, he hasn't received any money. And John, going forward, there's two big issues here. The first is Rudy Giuliani and keeping him in the fold, spoken with multiple advisors close to the former president who say there is an effort to keep people who could be a little too helpful to prosecutors in the fold. They don't want another Michael Cohen situation. So, advisors close to the former president believe there is a reason, there is an incentive for him to help Rudy Giuliani out here, because of course he is named as a co-conspirator in the federal case, from the special counsel. But he hasn't been charged. We also know he sat down with investigators at length, and his attorney is pretty confident he's not going to be charged. The other big problem though, is for Rudy Giuliani. He needs an attorney in Georgia and it's not easy to get an attorney when one of your other lawyers you've already hired is in court saying, \"this guy can't pay his legal bills.\" So, we're watching closely to see how this impacts his representation in Georgia.",

And the grim reality of it is, is that the process of putting names to the rest of those who have been killed might take months and maybe even years. Also, we now have more of an idea on how many people are still missing at this point.Hawaii's governor has confirmed to CNN that that over a thousand people are still unaccounted for, and the total could be as high as 1300. An unfathomable number to consider. But the governor is warning, many people still have not been reunited with family members because of very poor cell signals, and survivors were sort of split up among shelters as families face an agonizing weight to find out if their loved ones actually made it out of that disaster alive.

JEAN-PIERRE:  Well, Sara, thank you so much for that reporting. I think it's really important for the entire nation to see what the people of Maui, what the people of Hawaii are seeing. And, as you just stated, on Monday, the president of first lady are going to be visiting Maui. They will see firsthand the impact of the wildfires, the devastation of loss, the devastation of land, the devastation of culture. Let's not forget that as well. And he will hear directly from local -- local officials, state officials and survivors what it's going to take to recover. Look, the president's message and the first lady's message is going to be very clear. It's going to be, we are here for you today, tomorrow, for as long as it takes. To those who have lost loved ones, to those who are in agony waiting to hear, you are not alone. The entire nation is grieving with you and is going to be with you as you rebuild and recover. We are not going to go anywhere until that occurs, that happens. The president is going to continue to marshal a whole-of-government effort, approach, as he has done from day one, with having dozens of federal agencies and -- agencies and departments on the ground helping local partners and state partners get the assistance, the federal assistance, that these survivors need. And this is incredibly important. This is something that the president takes very seriously. You have heard from the FEMA administrator there's more than 600 personnel, staffers on the ground. They have already provided $2.3 million of family assistance. And for those in Maui, in Hawaii who are still looking to get that federal assistance, please go call 1-800-621-FEMA. Go to disasterassistance.gov. We are here to help. The federal government is here to assist, to make sure that they get everything that they need to rebuild and recover.",

One, there are records that we have found that show Hawaii's state government really underestimated the deadly threat of these fires and were under-resourced, that they didn't spend enough to try and make sure that people were safe. The White House has said that the president has had frequent contact with Hawaii's congressional delegation and the governor, Governor Green. So I want to know if there -- I know it's a delicate time, but has there been discussion from the president about some of these issues that have come up where there wasn't good preparation and there weren't good resources put in place before this that may have been able to prevent at least some of this disaster? JEAN-PIERRE:  So, Sara, those are incredibly important questions to ask, and they should be asked. We are -- certainly want to make sure that we get to the bottom of what happened here and understand what happened. I understand that -- we have seen the reports, obviously. I understand the state attorney general has opened up an investigation. And we want to make sure that we get to the bottom of exactly what happened leading -- leading to these devastating wildfires. Obviously, that's important. And we got to make sure that doesn't happen again. What our focus is -- and you are correct -- the president has spoken to the governor multiple times. He spoke to him yesterday. It was the fourth time that they connected over the past several days. He's been in touch with congressional members in Hawaii. Obviously, he and the first lady are going to be there on Monday to see directly the impacts of the wildfires. What we are going to focus on right now -- and we're going to let the investigation happen, because, as I said, we have got to get to the bottom of that. What we are going to focus on right now is to make sure the survivors in Hawaii, in Maui, have everything that they need to rebuild. One more thing that I failed to mention is that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, is on the ground. There's about 30 folks on the ground to help survivors and businesses make sure that they apply who are eligible for those low-interest disaster funds, so that they can rebuild. That's going to be incredibly important as well. Again, this is a whole-of-government approach that the president was very clear that he wanted to make sure happens. And this is going to be -- this is going to be a long road ahead. It's going to be a difficult road ahead, but we are going to be there for the people of Maui.",
