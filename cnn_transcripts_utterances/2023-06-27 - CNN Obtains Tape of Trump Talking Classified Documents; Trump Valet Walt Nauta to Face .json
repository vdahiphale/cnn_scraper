And then there's this sort of rustling sound, again, where he appears to be referring to this document about a potential attack on Iran.And he's in this meeting, we know, with autobiographers who are working on a Mark Meadows autobiography with two staffers, none of whom have clearance. And he also acknowledges that this is not a declassified document and that he no longer has the power, because he is no longer the president of the United States to declassify it. And he's sort of callous in how he's discussing this. Everyone's laughing. He's talking about, bring me some Cokes in.

Putin is giving the Wagner mercenaries a choice, join the Russian military, go home, or go to Belarus. The Russian Defense Ministry says the fighters are preparing to turn over their heavy equipment to Russian troops. Let's go to Fred Pleitgen, our senior international correspondent, who joins us this morning. What stood out to you from what we just heard from Putin?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think it's remarkable that Vladimir Putin went out and gave that speech in the first place. I think one of the things that we can discern from that is he's sort of trying to calm down the situation and show actually that he is still in charge of things.I thought what's really interesting about that speech is that there was no criticism or any sort of critique, gets to the reaction from the security forces when that Wagner convoy was rolling towards Moscow. Because, of course, yesterday, Poppy, we heard from Yevgreny Prigozhin himself, we haven't seen him, but we've heard from him, saying -- justifying himself and saying that if he had wanted to, he could have rolled all the way to Moscow. He said that people who were there on the side of the roads were cheering the Wagner mercenaries on. He said they were able to block air bases and military bases along the way. Now, here's Vladimir Putin coming out and praising the Russian security forces. I think that's one of the things that he's trying to show that he's in charge, that he's in control. But also the other thing that I think is really important for him right now is to show that there is still unity within Russia, that everybody is on the same page. Yevgeny Prigozhin is out of the way now. However, they still want to make sure that these Wagner fighters will remain part of the Russian security forces. And one of the things that we heard last night from Vladimir Putin, I think, was also very important as well, a very late night address where he said, look, they could have stopped this rebellion, but it would have led to bloodshed, Russian on Russian bloodshed, and that's why they did things the way that they did. Whether or not that is fully true is obviously something that we don't know. But it's certainly what Vladimir Putin is trying to portray at this point in time. The big winner in all of this seems to be Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian strong man. We heard from him earlier today as well. He, of course, brokered that agreement with Yevgeny Prigozhin to make him back off there. He was saying that it was painful for him to watch that situation. But I think one of the other things, Poppy, that also shows just how dramatic that situation was and how concerned the leaders there were about the situation, he also said that he had put the forces of Belarus onto combat readiness. So, that shows that they were extremely concerned about the situation, Poppy.",

You have no political opposition. So, when he's speaking to the security forces, this is a message to his local population, the domestic Russian audience, that, hey, everything is okay.The thing is that six months ago, he never would have had to have done that. He wouldn't have cared about what the Russian population thought because he's got the ability to repress them very easily.

But they will have taken note of the fact that one of their member, Prigozhin, came close.
