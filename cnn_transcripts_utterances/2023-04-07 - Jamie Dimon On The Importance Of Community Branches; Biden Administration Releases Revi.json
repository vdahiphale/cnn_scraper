So, you have a branch manager traditional, with a community manager gets to know all the local businesses not-for-profits, religious institutions, we invite people in to learn about mortgages and saving money and starting a business.And it's been unbelievable, I've been to like 14 of the 16 or so. We've also taken the community manager, we have 120. That's work so well, we're putting them in a lot of different communities. So, that's just part of what we try to do when we enter a town we have 30 percent of our branches, and so in lower income neighborhoods, and we just try to lift all the neighborhoods and bring in all the things that JPMorgan Chase can do to help.",

The Biden Administration had really been working for some time to try to offer some clarity as many states across the country have implemented laws on transgender athletes. Now this would be an update to Title 9. that federal law which bars schools from discriminating on the basis of sex.And for the most part, kids who are in elementary - transgender kids in elementary school will generally still be able to participate in sports that align with their gender identity. But it is when these kids get into more competitive levels like high school and college where there could be some restrictions. The rule would provide schools with flexibility to identify their own educational objectives. They say that could include ensuring fairness or trying to prevent a sports related injuries. It would also require schools to take into consideration, the nature of the sports when they're enacting any types of restrictions. Now, this is a hot button issue with many Republican-led states across the country implementing outright bans on transgender students in sports. The White House has said that that amounts to legislative bullying and that they stand with transgender kids. Now there has been that mixed reaction. LGBTQ advocacy groups are concerned that this could pave the way for more discrimination, while Republicans don't want the federal government to get involved on this matter.",

They said that they were severely limited by the decisions that the Trump Administration made, namely, that agreement between the former President Trump and the Taliban, whereby U.S. troops would be forced to withdraw by May 2021.So, the Biden Administration says they were really left with very limited options here for how to handle this withdrawal. That being said, they did acknowledge that there are certain things that moving forward, they have learned from that episode, namely, they are going to prioritize earlier evacuations, that was the one big thing that they have gotten criticized, arguably the most about, which is that they did not begin those evacuations of American personnel, U.S. citizens in Afghanistan, and of course, Afghans who had helped the military over 20 years, much sooner. Now, their argument for not doing so is that they did not want to erode competence in the Afghan government at the time, but they now say they're going to air on the side of earlier evacuations, warning American sooner to get out of these security - these environments where the security situation is rapidly deteriorating, Kaitlan.",

But this time, Richard Glossip now has the support of the state's attorney general who says that he can no longer stand behind this murder conviction. And the attorney general of Oklahoma goes on to say that this is not to say that I believe Glossip is innocent. However, it is critical that Oklahomans have absolute faith that the death penalty is administered fairly and with certainty considering everything I know about this case. I do not believe that justice is served by executing a man based on the testimony of a compromised witness. And what the attorney general is referring to there is that another man convicted in this case Justin Sneed, who was the man who confessed to actually murdering their boss where the two men worked at the time, and he had - Sneed has since kind of started to recant his confession and pinpointing Richard Glossip as the man who hired him to carry out this murder. That has come out in new investigations. So, all of this information now going to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals and obviously Glossip side is hoping that this saves his life.",
