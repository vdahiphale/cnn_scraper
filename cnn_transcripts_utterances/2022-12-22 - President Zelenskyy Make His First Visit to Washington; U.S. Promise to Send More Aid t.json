Those powerful words from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he delivered an inspiring and historic address to a joint meeting of the U.S. Congress on Wednesday evening. The Ukrainian leader was greeted by cheers and a standing ovation from lawmakers. And in a remarkable moment just coming 300 days after Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of his country. Mr. Zelenskyy's visit to Washington lasted just hours when marked his first trip outside Ukraine since the war began. He went before Congress to express his gratitude for critical U.S. support, but also to ask for more assistance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

How they're going to do that though, remains somewhat unclear. You talk to U.S. officials they see this now more as a stalemate when it comes to the battle space than any type of progression forward on one side or the other. And that underscores another critical component, Zelenskyy making clear they would be asking for more assistance pretty much daily from here on out.

They'll have some technical know-how that they'll have to implement to make that work on their Soviet era fighters. But they've done that before and I think there's no doubt they'll do it again. One final note on this package. There's a lot of non-NATO standard artillery ammunition in here. Why is that significant? The U.S. doesn't produce that, so that's being sourced from elsewhere.

Our drone cameras capturing a similar scene, a large group of migrants on the Mexican side, a large law enforcement presence on the U.S. side, and our cameras were rolling as a group of migrants, including a child crossed into the United States and turned themselves into authorities. All this contributing to what one law enforcement source says is up to 1,200 migrants turning themselves into border authorities every day in this part of south Texas. Border Patrol is dropping off hundreds of them in respite centers say advocates. Most of them travel out the same day, but local shelters are starting to see an uptick of migrants who can't afford to. So, migrants from all over the world.",
