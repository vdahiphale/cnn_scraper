And it could be weeks before Luigi Mangione is in New York to face the charges that he allegedly assassinated UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Right now, Mangione is in a Pennsylvania prison fighting extradition to New York and the judge has given him two weeks to file paperwork as his attorney stresses the 26-year-old son of a wealthy Maryland family is presumed innocent.Now, CNN is learning of the first pieces of forensic evidence that allegedly tie Mangione to the crime scene. Sources say that his fingerprints match ones that were found on a burner phone that the gunman tossed or dropped as he was fleeing the scene in midtown Manhattan.",

Sources say in the pages Mangione reasons against using explosives because they could, quote, \"kill innocents\".Sources add that Mangione concludes that a shooting would be more precise, musing what could be better than to, quote, \"kill the CEO at his own bean counting conference\". It's those final sentiments that have corporate America scrambling to protect their senior executives and reevaluating just how prepared they are for a serious threat that just last week seemed unimaginable.",

Now, the Median S&amp;P 500 company disclosed spending almost $100,000 to protect their CEOs last year, and that was up more than double from two years prior. But that's just the Median company. There's financial companies and media firms that have disclosed spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to protect their CEOs. Some of the big technology companies, they say they're spending millions of dollars to protect their CEOs and the family of their CEOs. And again, the thinking is that that tight security is probably going to have to get expanded to even more senior executives, given what just happened here in New York a week ago. So you got to believe that these expenses that companies are putting forth to try to protect their CEOs and their other executives, all of that spending is going to have to go much higher.

Look, Chris Wray is actually pretty popular inside the -- inside the bureau because, you know, he -- one of the things he has done is he has tried to lower the temperature for the FBI. There's a lot of criticism from -- from the previous leadership of the FBI, James Comey, and the way how he handled the office, especially when Donald Trump first took office in the first-term.So inside the FBI, Chris Wray has been seen actually a very -- as a -- as a very thoughtful, as a very quiet leader, someone who is trying to restore the reputation of the -- of the FBI. That has obviously not worked out that well for, especially among Republicans who have been very critical of a number of things, including of course, investigations of Donald Trump. The Mar-a-Lago search is something that Donald Trump himself raised in his interview over the weekend with -- with NBC. So there's a lot of concern because you have heard from Kash Patel, who is the incoming president's pick to run the FBI next. You've heard that they are planning to try to -- they want to go after the former -- the President's political enemies And so inside the FBI, there's a lot of concern that the bureau is going to be turned essentially to go after Trump's enemies and take its eye off the ball on things that are actually a threat to this country, including, of course, the threat from -- from China, from Russia, from Iran, the national security threats, terrorism, all of those things that really are the bread and butter and the vast majority of what the FBI does. So a lot of concern right now. I think I just talked to FBI employees who are a bit shocked that is happening right now. They were anticipating perhaps that Donald Trump would actually do the firing once he takes office on January 20th.",

There was a precedent set after Hoover where directors served for 10 years absent any kind of malfeasance or problems or something like that. And that -- the purpose of that was to theoretically make them not products of an administration so much as products of a justice system, kind of semi, you know, a shorter term version of a judge, something like that.So I'm a little bit surprised. But after hearing what the President Elect has been saying for so long and the fact that he's nominated somebody to be the next director, on that side, you know, it shouldn't have come as a surprise. I just didn't know how he would navigate around Wray being in office and Wray having a pretty good reputation within the bureau.",

There is a perception among a large population of America that the January 6th involved people were actually singled out and for higher punishment than other people were. And of course, that involved the FBI.The president -- the President Elect had the problems with the documents retained in his possession and he, not ridiculed, but he blamed the FBI for what he thought was heavy handedness during this. And I'm paraphrasing, obviously. So among Trump supporters. Obviously, he took -- he took a position that the FBI had been weaponized or politicized. And I think the director's, Director Wray's credentials have not changed. It's just that he has not done certain things that President Trump would have wanted him to do. And I think even in the agent population, they feel that the bureau has been somewhat politicized since, say, Director Comey's comments on Hillary Clinton's emails. And the agent population wanted a more -- wanted a stronger reaction to the politicization of the bureau. And they didn't see that either. So maybe for different reasons, both the agents and the Trump person -- Trump supporters, are both along the same lines there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. And that term is not over yet. Wray still has three years on it. But Donald Trump is recently a Sunday said that he wasn't thrilled with Wray. And as you noted, he had already said his intent to nominate Kash Patel to run the organization. Now, he was asked directly if he was going to fire Wray during this interview. And he said, seems kind of obvious that if I want Patel to run the organization, he'd have to take over someone's job.Now, in the past two years, he has accused Wray of invading his home, talking about that search in 2022 for classified documents that ultimately led to the indictment of Donald Trump in that case in 2023. He has also indicated he believes that the agency and the FBI has become part of what they call the deep state. So he wanted somebody to come in, shake things up and completely gut the organization, which they believe that Kash Patel will do. Also notable, we know Kash Patel has been on the Hill every day this week. They are trying to work on his nomination. But I will tell you that speaking to a few Trump people just now as this news was coming in, they are very happy that it worked out this way. Again, Donald Trump did not quite say directly that he was going to come in and fire him on day one, but it was very clear he was going to have to get rid of Wray in order to install Kash Patel. And we were told that it was very critical to him to get Patel into that role. So unsurprising on that end that they are happy that it's not Donald Trump firing yet another head of the FBI. I will remind you of this unprecedented move that we would have seen had Wray stayed in as the Donald Trump transition administration took over, would be the second FBI Director that Donald Trump would have had to fire or would have fired because he fired James Comey his first time around to install Wray into office. But it was very clear that Donald Trump was incredibly unhappy with the FBI, that he wanted to see changes in there over the last several years, particularly since he left office, since he lost the election. You can think the FBI did enough work to try and prove that he had won the election. Just obviously, as we know, he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. But he wanted his law enforcement agencies to be rallying around him, and they did not at that time under Wray's leadership. So, again, unsurprising that this was the end result, particularly given what we had heard Donald Trump say as recently as Sunday, that he was likely to get rid of Wray, that he was unhappy with Wray. He again accused him of invading his home. But the Trump people are happy that this is how it's playing out because it paves the way for Kash Patel requires them to do less work and means the job is technically open or will be at the beginning of his administration.",

Donald Trump thinks that he's above the law. But if I took classified documents home to my house, I would expect the FBI to raid my home, too. That's the right thing for the FBI to do.
