Israel says Hamas infrastructure is now being targeted by limited airstrikes. These images are from the Egyptian side of the border. According to Palestinian officials residential homes have been hit. And there are casualties but precise numbers remain unknown.On Monday, Israel's war cabinet unanimously agreed to move ahead with a major offensive on Rafah but one which would certainly increase in intensity in order to continue to pressure Hamas, which announced on Monday it actually agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release proposal. But later word came that what Hamas had agreed to, was not part of the framework negotiated by Israel and Egypt. It was more of a counteroffer. Here's what Hamas did agree to a three phase plan. First, Hamas would release 33 hostages, specifically women, children, the elderly and sick. Israel would gradually withdraw forces from parts of Gaza, release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, halt reconnaissance flights for 10 hours a day and allow increased humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. The second phase would include a sustainable period of calm in Gaza. Hamas would release the remaining hostages, including civilian men and IDF male soldiers. The third phase would involve a three to five-year rebuilding plan for Gaza. CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman has spent decades covering Gaza. He joins us now live from Rome. So what do you know about these Israeli airstrikes? Are they continuing and what are they hitting?",

And according to Palestinian officials working at that crossing, the crossing is now closed to personnel trying to leave or enter the Gaza Strip, as well as humanitarian aid.Now, the Israelis yesterday issued orders to approximately 100,000 people living in the south eastern corner of Rafah on the border on the southeastern corner of Gaza itself, telling them to leave that area to head to the Mawasi area, which is on the Mediterranean. And it does appear that the Israelis are coming or doing what they said they would do so far is a limited military operation in the southeastern part of Rafah. So we understand that there have been more than a dozen fatalities as a result of Israeli airstrikes in that area. This according to hospitals in the Rafah area, and it does appear that Israel is conducting this operation so far in a limited manner. The United States administration and others have warned Israel against a major military operation in the area saying that the Israelis simply have not made the necessary preparations in the event that hundreds of thousands of people have to move elsewhere in terms of providing them with adequate shelter, sanitation, and other basic necessities of life.

On the one hand, Israel has said that it wants to continue to work on these negotiations to result in the release of Israeli hostages being held in Gaza.On the other hand, it's going ahead with this military operation. And in fact, we heard last week from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that Israel would go ahead with its Rafah offensive with or without a deal. The problem is, of course, in a deal, the one that sort of the basic broad outlines that had been, you know, the focus of efforts of American, Qatari, Egyptian diplomats for quite some time, a talk about, you know, a deal involves a ceasefire temporary at best. But if Israel goes ahead with a military operation in Rafah, which it is doing right now, then that sort of contradicts that. So the question is, OK, we know that we understand, John, that Israel is sending a delegation to Cairo to continue negotiations on a deal. The question is, you know, how far are they going to get. Now yesterday, Hamas declared that it accepted an Egyptian modified proposal, the Israeli said that's not the proposal they agreed upon. And so we're basically in this situation where Israel's continuing its military operations, it seems to have now closed off the Rafah crossing, and we're going to see a continued increase in the number of casualties in Rafah in Gaza. And where this is all going, your guess is as good as mine, John.",

But CNN reported few months ago, U.S. officials were not certain if they would know if Russia was moving tactical nuclear weapons into place. Unlike strategic nuclear weapons capable of destroying entire cities, tactical battlefield nuclear weapons are small enough to be moved quietly and could be fired from conventional systems already deployed to the Ukrainian battlefield. So for context here, little boy, the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima with a yield of Hiroshima, the yield 26 million pounds of high explosives that would be considered a tactical nuclear weapon today, right.

And I think what Putin is worried about is that those weapons which have a range of nearly 500 kilometers could be used to strike refineries and oil and gas storage facilities. Ukraine has been doing that already with our homegrown weapons. And this inflicted some significant economic damage on Russia, you know, exports have gone down 10, 12 percent, which is starting to hurt Russia's budget.

Biden and U.S. administration did not take the pulse up on that offer, because they probably saw that as too provocative. So they're being careful. But they'll watch Putin's inauguration. They'll watch, you know, his consolidation of power at home, and his celebration of the small gains he's been making at enormous cost, and go on about trying to resupply the Ukrainians what really matters is helping them hold the line with this new $60 billion worth of weapons. And so the tactical nuclear threats and the saber rattling are kind of a sideshow, no one's going to use them on the battlefield. They don't make sense to be used, unless in some extreme crisis, which we're not near. And what really matters is bolstering the weaknesses on the Ukrainian side with Western help.

McConney testified former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg was the one who told him they had to reimburse Cohen. Weisselberg, who is currently serving five months in jail on perjury charges in Trump's civil fraud case, had sketched out the payment to Cohen on a bank statement that showed Cohen transferred the $130,000 payment to Daniels' attorney. The total paid to Cohen, $420,000, allegedly included reimbursing Cohen for the money he paid to Daniels' attorney to kill her story, cash owed for other expenses, and a hefty bonus for Cohen. It was marked on the books as a legal expense. McConney suggested Trump kept a tight reign over his account, but Trump attorney Emil Bove, in rapid-fire questioning, tried to show Trump was not involved in accounting at the company in 2017 when these payments were made. Bove asked McConney whether he talked to Trump about these payments, \"I did not,\" McConney testified.
