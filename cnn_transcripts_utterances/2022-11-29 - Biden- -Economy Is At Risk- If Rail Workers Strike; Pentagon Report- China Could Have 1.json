Magma is underground, lava is on the surface.And so basically, Kilauea has its own plumbing, Mauna Loa has its own plumbing, so they didn't trigger each other. And fortunately as it's so rare these days when we're talking about geoscience and disasters, volcanoes are not impacted by climate change. So the fact that we have a changing climate doesn't affect these volcanoes at all. The volcanoes erupt when pressure builds up in the system and that's all that causes the eruption. Now, there is some misconception about do volcanoes make climate change worse? I'm happy to tell you they don't. They produce less than 1 percent of all the carbon dioxide emissions annually around the globe, so humans are still on the hook for that.",

The President has made the call and it was a very complicated call for a President who has really bestowed upon himself the title as most labor friendly president in the history of the country.This is something that will directly undercut what labor representatives have been negotiating for, at least on the rank and file side of things. Guys remember, the tentative agreement that was reached between rail carriers and the 12 major unions had to be signed off on by the rank and file, four of those 12 unions had their rank and file rejected. Now, administration officials make clear that deal included some very clear wins for union representatives and their rank and file. However, one of the things that did not include was paid sick leave. That was something that they wanted very deeply and was something they could not get. It's something that the President and his team say they support, but they need to stick to the agreement that's on the table right now. Now, one thing that did come out of that meeting between the President and the top four leaders in Congress is that Democratic leaders who control the House and Senate, House still for at least another month or two will move forward on that agreement. They do believe that they can move it forward over the course of the next couple of days. However, the reality remains. There is a clock here, it is ticking and it's not just the deadline, which is December 9th. It's the fact that every day they get closer to the deadline, certain critical components of really kind of the backbone of how goods and services are transported across this country will start to kind of productively shut down. That's the concern right now. That's why they want quick action, but still some very real issues outstanding, I guess, I would say as they wait for lawmakers to act.",

Well, only two years later, a fraction of that time the Pentagon now says Russia - China's nuclear stockpile has surpassed 400 warheads.It's not a question of where this goes from here. They say the pace they're building they'll hit 1,500 warheads by about 2035, so a little more than a decade. The cause for concern in the Pentagon is what is the goal of having this number of nuclear warheads? Certainly, it seems a far cry from the \"lean and efficient nuclear deterrent that China wants said it wanted.\" It remains a fraction of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, which is up towards 4,000. But again, it's what is the intent behind having this nuclear stockpile that is a cause of concern for the Pentagon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PAT RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: The challenge here is the more proliferation there is, the more concerning it is, the more destabilizing to the region it is. So certainly, we would want to ensure from a regional global and regional stability standpoint, that we can maintain an open dialogue to ensure there's transparency and that we understand what the intent is behind this.

And those numbers are growing as they look to modernize and expand their military force.What's the purpose behind this? It is power projection and according to the China military power report, you see that for example with the increased military economic pressure on Taiwan, especially after the visit of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this year, they are using their military more around that whether its navy operations, whether its aircraft into Taiwan's self-declared (inaudible). They use it as power projection. And Victor and Alisyn, we saw this one more time essentially just overnight with the South China Sea, much of which China claims is its territorial waters, a U.S. guided missile destroyers - cruisers sailing through the South China Sea, China claims it scurried that away and forced it to flee.

      "sentences": "Well, I think they're trying to address the underlying concerns of millions and millions of people, hundreds of millions of people all across China, who have suffered under these lockdowns. Anytime a case of COVID appears in a city, they shut down the entire city. People are not allowed to go out for food, to go grocery shopping, to go to restaurants, to go to doctor's appointments, even to go to work. And so that's having a huge toll on the psyche as well as the income of the Chinese people and there's a huge tension, frustration rising.Beijing is saying, well, our policies are being improperly carried out by local government officials, so they're trying to pass the buck. But the local government officials are afraid of incurring the wrath of Beijing and so they are just doing - imposing these draconian measures, until Beijing actually gives clear guidance on how they're supposed to approach it. But when you have a city of 23 million people or over 20 million people like in Shanghai, and the entire city is locked down, shut down. That's going to lead to huge tensions and that's why you're seeing these protests erupting all across the country. When people cannot get their sick ones to hospitals and then the patients die; when first responders can't respond to a fire and people die as a result of these lockdowns, that's when the anger of the Chinese people is coming out and that's what the communist government is most concerned about. They do not want these protests of hundreds of people spread across 15, 20 cities to get larger and larger and larger and then become almost the foundation of the leverage point for unleashing their grievances against anything and everything dealing with the Communist Party.",

The last one was on the fourth of November. We had 62 reported tornadoes, multiple fatalities. The greatest tornado threat is 4pm, 10pm, now that's Central Time, but we're already seeing it ongoing. Look at the temperatures, how about Missouri? St. Louis is 63 and it's 36 in Kansas City. That's the power behind the storm. Tropical air coming in from the Gulf and here is the bull's eye. When we get in closer now, already you're going to start to see not only a tornado watch, this is an elevated tornado watch. It's been given a PDS signal. That means a particularly dangerous situation, only issued for the most violent and potential damage to occur. The sunsets in Jackson, Mississippi at 5 pm Central Time. Tornado, Mississippi, tornado, they had one just northeast of Houston. They've got one here in areas of Alabama. So when you zoom in now, you'll see this one's moving north of Macomb. Again, on the 4th of November, they had 62. We could have more than that today. And that means long track, very large tornadoes, maybe EF3 or higher and it's going to come in waves. And, again, at night, that's when it becomes particularly dangerous, because tornadoes are two to two and a half times more deadly at night. Still damaging winds even without tornadoes will occur 65 to 70 miles per hour. Some of these could have what we call a tornado emergency. That means they're large on the ground now.

Now, look, it's important to say that Apple has not responded to any of this publicly. But what potentially is happening here is that Apple kind of has a vetting process for apps in its app store. So before anything can go on your iPhone, Apple takes a look at the apps, one, to make sure there aren't viruses or spyware or things like that in the apps, but also we've seen in recent years and they've looked into apps to make sure that they're not promoting hate speech or maybe what they view as dangerous misinformation. Last year Parler, that right-wing social media platform was removed for a few months from the Apple App Store until they got their hate speech policy together in a way that Apple was relatively happy about. So it's very possible that Apple has expressed some concerns privately or at least what they thought privately to Twitter about this under Musk. And what we did see overnight, of course, was that Twitter has - is no longer doing - enforcing its COVID-19 misinformation policy.
