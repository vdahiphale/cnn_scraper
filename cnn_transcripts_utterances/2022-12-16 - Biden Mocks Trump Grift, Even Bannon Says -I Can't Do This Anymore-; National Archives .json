Nearly six decades after his assassination, the National Archives just released more than 13,000 documents related to JFK's assassination. The release of the previously classified documents is the second of two document dumps ordered last year by President Biden.CNN correspondent Mr. Tom Foreman has the details for us. Tom, good morning to you. What's in the documents?",

This is like 11 copies of War and Peace all being dumped at once.What's in it mainly, though, seems to be a lot of minutia -- a lot of little details about all the endless, endless leads that authorities were looking at, at this time. So there's information about how they were wiretapping the Soviet Embassy down in Mexico, and about how they were following phone calls that came in from nowhere about almost nothing. A huge, huge amount. What's also striking about this as you read through it is that there is no sign -- I say read through it. I'm nowhere getting through all these pages. It's going to take a long time. There's no sign that there is any really big revelation in here. This really is about filling in all the little gaps because remember, this is the tail end of a huge amount of information that's been released over a long period of time -- roughly five million pages overall. And I just did the math a while ago. If you wanted to read all the pages that the federal government has on the Kennedy assassination, start reading now and never stop. One page a minute and you'll be done in a little over nine years.",

How federal law is interpreted.Can you explain what a reasonable accommodation actually is? What this bill would change if you -- if it can make it through? MARY ZEIGLER, PROFESSOR OF LAW, UC DAVIS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes. The model for the bill -- we already have the Americans With Disabilities Act and a lot of viewers are familiar with that if they have family members with disabilities. This would be kind of extending similar logic to pregnant workers, right? So, employers wouldn't have to do anything that's an undue hardship for them financially or otherwise. But accommodations that are reasonable and doable for the employer would be available for that pregnant worker. And I think what's important, too, is not just that those pregnant workers would be able to get accommodations but that requests for accommodations would no longer be serving as a basis for termination. One of the more kind of talking things that we see now is that employers will use requests for accommodation as a -- as an excuse to terminate. So we're seeing this not just that employees are losing accommodations that they need sometimes to avoid things like negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, but also that employers are using that sometimes as an excuse to get rid of employees who are doing a good job at work. So this is sort of extending disability protections to pregnant workers that we think they deserve.",

Tillis, who blocked this from progressing, about his concern. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC):  I absolutely want to make sure that those sort of reasonable accommodations are accounted for. However, in its current form, this legislation before us would give federal bureaucrats at the EEOC authority to mandate that employers nationwide provide accommodations such as leave to obtain abortions. Unlike Title VII and the Americans With Disabilities Act, this legislation contains no exemptions for religious organizations. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the reason that all of us got together -- that is to say on both sides of the aisle -- to emphasize this legislation is that it's critical that we find a path through.And the way in which the bill was drafted was a kind of -- it already has some language providing for exclusions along lines of abortion that was sufficient even for the U.S. Conference of Bishops.",
