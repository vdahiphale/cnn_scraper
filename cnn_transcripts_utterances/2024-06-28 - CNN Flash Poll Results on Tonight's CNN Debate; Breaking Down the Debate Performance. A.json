      "sentences": "Yes. So Erin, I first want to just stress everyone. This is a poll of debate watchers. So this is not necessarily representative of the electorate overall, although I will say as a partisan makeup, these debate watchers do pretty much look like registered voters; maybe about four or five percentage points more Republican than the usual universe of registered voters. So just keep that in mind as you see these results. That little bit of shift won't make a difference here.Look at the big question of the night. Who won the debate, we asked debate watchers in our instant poll. And the answer is a resounding Donald Trump did. Sixty-seven percent of debate watchers in our poll say Donald Trump won the debate tonight. Joe Biden, 33 percent say he won the debate tonight. Now, this group of debate watchers, they told us who they thought would win the debate going into it before the debate. And take a look at how that changed over time. Fifty-five percent thought before the debate that Donald Trump would win the debate; 45 percent thought Joe Biden would win the debate. Look at what the debate did to those expectations. That's when, you know, Donald Trump did much better than expected. Joe Biden did worse than expected among this group. And compare this to these two men debating four years ago. That's not always a comparison we have, obviously. The rematch is pretty unique. And so take a look at the complete reversal. Again, that top line and there's the debate tonight, 67 percent say Trump won, 33 percent said Biden. The next line is the second debate in 2020, where Biden won there by about 14 percentage points, 53-39 in our instant poll that night. This looks a little bit more like the first debate. Chris Wallace moderated. Sixty-six percent, Joe Biden won that debate that night, 28 percent said Donald Trump won the debate that night. You can see how this night is a complete reversal of that one. And then take a look at this question we asked. Do you have confidence in the candidate's ability to lead the country? Confidence in ability to lead the country. Fourteen percent said they have a lot of confidence in Biden; 36 percent of debate watchers say they have a lot of confidence in Trump. Neither of those numbers are stellar, by the way. You see 29 percent say some for Biden, 20 percent Trump. But here, a majority of debate watchers, 57 percent, say no confidence in Joe Biden's ability to lead the country; 44 percent -- again, that is not a great number. That is a healthy plurality here in terms of Trump's numbers, say no ability to lead the country, no confidence in his ability to lead the coverage [SIC]. But again --",

They knew he needed to be able to quiet concerns about his age and his ability to lead another four years. It's not just that he's president right now. He's asking voters for another term. And that was how Dana phrased the question tonight, that you would be 86 at the end of a second term if he were reelected. And instead, they're walking out of this with those questions only raised and being raised at the top levels of the Democratic Party. And the vice president defending his performance to Anderson, acknowledging that, yes, it was a slow start, though it was also a pretty difficult end, as well, if you watched his closing statement, compared to his closing statement that he delivered during the Chris Wallace debate, which I watched truly this morning. It was a very strong closing statement. In this one, he didn't even mention the word \"abortion.\" And it makes all the talk of Republicans this week, including President Trump, saying that Biden was going to be on cocaine, and other Republicans claiming that he was going to be on performance-enhancing drugs seem quite quaint when -- when you look at what the conversation is now.",

They have a summer to get through. They're now going to have weeks of Democratic hand-wringing and concern that we've been talking about and hearing about. Then they're going to have to get through the convention, should he stay, indeed, as the nominee. And there's no reason at this moment to think that he's not. We'll see what happens there.

It's June, so maybe this all passes. The conversation among Democrats is going to try to figure that out. But remember, Georgia, where we are, 11,779 votes. But, you know, Wisconsin 25,000 votes. Pennsylvania, 40,000 votes. Arizona, what, 10,000 votes. So I don't have all the math in my head. So he can't afford to lose much. Trump voters are going to come out. We know that. So the question is, he was already struggling. Biden came into this debate, not a ton behind, but enough behind for it to cause worry among Democrats. The reason to worry among Democrats has turned from worry into, I would say, panic or at least lowercase \"P\" panic. It's because they were worried coming in. They were already worried coming in? That, look, he's vastly outspent Trump on television in the battleground states, and it hasn't moved the numbers much.

And they've also had four years of distance from a Donald Trump presidency. And so that is how they're approaching this as they're looking at this. I think one of the most stunning things that happened in that debate tonight that has kind of gone unnoticed, is that Trump did not commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election.

And that's -- actually, I think it's more than that. I think people have some serious doubts now about the competence, more than questions.

How will we know the answer to that question?

And so all those Democrats who are in tough districts or tough states are going to get their pollsters and get their teams together. And they're going to say, did this hurt me? Does this hurt me? And that's the conversation that's going to trickle on for the next week or so. So when we're having -- when we're sitting at a table like this a week from now, we'll have a much better sense of what it means for whether the -- whether the in your face to the Biden White House will continue.

And I know we're out here analyzing the politics of it and the machinations of all of it. But he did not look good. He did not sound good. He did not acquit himself well politically, or as the leader of the most important country on the face of the planet. We have seven months to go in his term. We have a shorter period left in this election. I do think he walked into this thing tonight up to about right here in the quicksand. And now he's up to here. And I don't know how you get out of it when it's this high and your job approval is 38 percent. And you already, as Abby pointed out correctly earlier, having trouble with your own base.
