We are seeing Israeli troops as well as border police officers raiding two key cities in the West Bank, Jenin and Tulkarem, as well as the surrounding areas. And not only are we seeing Israeli forces moving in on the ground, carrying out raids, but also the Israeli military appearing to carry out several airstrikes in those areas as well. So far the death toll is nine people who have been killed so far, according to the Israeli military, which says that the operation is still in its first phases, suggesting that this is a military operation that could go on for several days. We are still getting reports of ongoing gunfire in and around those cities, indicating that there are still ongoing clashes in those areas. We are also getting reports that the Israeli military has surrounded or blocked access to several hospitals in the area. According to local officials, the Israeli military confirming that it was surrounding at least one hospital in Jenin but they say that that's because they want to prevent militants from seeking shelter and operating from there. The response, of course, in the occupied West Bank has been one of outrage from Palestinian officials and Hamas calling for a, quote, \"general mobilization\" against Israeli forces and settlers. The Israeli military says that there are two key reasons why they are carrying this out. They say that, first of all, Iran has been trying to flood the West Bank with weapons. And they also point to a number of attacks against Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank, as well as against Israelis in Israel, that they say have stemmed from these two cities. We know that, of course, there has also been a significant uptick in Israeli military activity, in Israeli raids in the West Bank against Palestinian militants over the course of the last 11 months, since October 7. We know that around 652 Palestinians have been killed according to the Palestinian ministry of health in the occupied West Bank, not only militants but also that includes civilians. And at least 4,500 people have been arrested since October 7 as the Israeli military has really stepped up its operations in that area since that time.",

It was very scant on details but hehad these four points that he outlined on this stage to journalists. I think we have those four points pulled up for you. In the first was a cross border invasion into Kursk. So of course, President Zelenskyy said, tick; I have done that, we have begun, we are on the path to victory. Secondly, he spoke on this strategic place in the world's security infrastructure for Ukraine. That's a reference to its bid to join NATO. He spoke on the use of diplomacy to force Russia to end the war. We've heard about Kursk, spoken about in this context by Ukrainian officials, who say that the more Russian territory they grab, the more of an upper hand they have at any future peace talks at the table. And finally economic pressure on Russia. And that's something that President Zelenskyy continues to push on -- sanctions, financial pressure, economic pressure on Moscow. And now he hopes, President Zelenskyy hopes to bring this victory plan, as he calls it, to President Biden around the U.N. General Assembly next month. But I also want to point out the context in which he was making this announcement. It's only this week that Ukraine says it endured the largest, the most massive aerial assault by Russia on Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict. It's also still happening now, this assault by Russia, this push by Russia, advance in the Donbas, toward Pokrovsk, where Ukrainian soldiers are outmanned and outgunned. So you have President Zelenskyy, who is very much trying to demonstrate strength, trying to hold control of the narrative. He doesn't want the momentum to shift in favor of Russia. And he's saying, we got this. Yes, we have this Russian assault. Yes, we have dozens of Russian drones and missiles being fired at Ukrainian cities. But we still have the upper hand, as long as our allies continue to supply and support us.",

I mean, look, I mean Telegram has kind of been one of the most open social media platforms for those types of groups.

So the conversations he was having with aides, things he was telling his inferior officer, Jeffrey Clark, someone at the Justice Department, to do, to try to use that part of the government to help fan the flames of people wanting to investigate election fraud. All of that is cut out. Jeffrey Clark is cut out. Trump's discussions with others. This was something the Justice Department needed to do after that Supreme Court decision. They went back to the grand jury in Washington, D.C., to do it. And the courts are going to look at this version of the indictment in the coming months. Still, Trump and his team are quite unhappy about this. He's calling it an act of desperation. And here's a little bit more about what his running mate, JD Vance, who had to say in response to what's called this superseding indictment being filed yesterday against Trump.

VANCE (R-OH), 2024 VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yeah, I haven't read the whole thing, but it looks like Jack Smith doing more what he does, which is filing these absurd lawsuits in an effort to influence the election.

And I use those terms -- and those are the terms that the highest court in the world, the International Court of Justice, has used just a few weeks ago, that the entire occupation is illegal, that this is a violation of the convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination and apartheid. So there is no military solution (ph). What this tells me, unfortunately, is they haven't done that. They are set on escalating. And the fear is what we saw in Gaza, not just in terms of the levels of destruction but also in terms of the failure of Israel's biggest backer, the U.S., Israel's other allies to hold Israel to account, to create a disincentive for doing this, to, for instance, stop the flow of weapons when they're being used in war crimes. If we see the same in the West Bank -- and people have been talking about the extremist settlers. Sure, they're a problem but the issue is the state, the state which supports those settlers, the state which is conducting these operations, including in hospitals. And this does not end well. Certainly not for the Palestinians, certainly not for regional stability.

To your point, the American people, I believe, have basically made up whether ornot they're going to support Donald Trump or oppose Trump in the election. However, that new indictment, the superseding indictment is important, because if Jack Smith didn't do that, the case would just go away and there would be no accountability for what we saw on January 6th. And of course, the action before and after that. So this is something that we -- we certainly won't see any courtroom drama before the election. This is something that's going to go into -- this court case is going to go into 2005 (sic), might even go into 10 -- 2025, maybe 2026.

Let's bring in CNN's health reporter Jacqueline Howard, who joins us now with more. Jacqueline, I'm sure many parents watching this firsthand are probably stressed.

That's in comparison with about 20 percent of other adults, who say they've experienced high levels of stress in the past month. And among parents, almost half say that level of stress has been overwhelming. And that's what the surgeon general is really focusing on here. His office just released this video of him, talking about this. Here's U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (MUSIC PLAYING) DR. VIVEK MURTHY, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL (voice-over):  Parents and caregivers in America are under pressure. As a father of two kids, I feel this pressure too. Raising children has always been a rewarding but stressful (INAUDIBLE). There are the usual difficulties of parenting:  dealing with financial concerns, worrying about our kids' health and safety and getting through the teenage years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
