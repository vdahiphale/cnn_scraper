Margaret, thank you as always for being here. It's great to have you. Kevin McCarthy is in a real bind here between the hardliners on his right and moderates like -- that was Mike Lawler, who represents a Biden district, so to speak, who is telling the truth, right? The Senate is controlled by Democrats. They're going to have to work with Democrats if they want to keep the government open. It really seems like -- I mean, weren't we having this same conversation, like, a week ago? It's -- we're nowhere closer to this getting resolved. MARGARET TALEV, DIRECTOR, SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY DEMOCRACY, JOURNALISM, AND CITIZENSHIP INSTITUTE, SENIOR CONTRIBUTOR, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Kasie, I think that's right. Speaker McCarthy has adopted a strategy for the course of this year of appeasement to deal with the right flank of his wing and I think we are now really fully seeing that appeasement policy hit its limits. I thought his quote about why he doesn't understand why they won't just agree to have -- put ideas to the vote and that he's surprised that they're burning the house down. I thought that was a very instructive quote because it tells you both his philosophy for leadership in the current context, which is just put it up there. Let them have their vote so they can take it home to their base and let's move on with things. We've seen the limits of that now. But also, I don't -- like, I don't think it's surprising actually at all. I think this is -- this has been baked in the cake since January that this is how this part of the caucus will behave, right? So what are his choices? Of course, there's the obvious choice right in front of us. He can cut a deal with Democrats and, you know -- I don't know if he could actually avert the shutdown but he could make it a very short shutdown. To do that would -- I'm not sure if it would end his speakership but it would definitely forge the vote on his speakership. And because he hasn't been that good at counting votes so far, that would be a very precarious place for him to be, right?",

If McCarthy could give Democrats a little bit of what they wanted -- Democrats -- enough of them would vote with Republicans to pass a continuing resolution that might keep the government open.

They look like they were maybe taken on an iPhone. It's Zelenskyy standing next to McCarthy and Jeffries on the House side. It's, as you can see, not great quality. This was not a public photo op with reporters.It's a huge contrast to what Schumer and McConnell -- we showed everybody that video a little earlier in the show of them walking down the hallway with him. He was sitting next to President Biden at the White House. And we also are reporting that McCarthy denied a request because he obviously controls whether or not Zelenskyy gets to make a joint address to Congress. He said no. And as you say, that's signs of divisions in McCarthy's conference. What does it say also about the state of the Republican Party and how it's changed? TALEV:  Well, I think it does foretell that if -- depending on who the next Republican nominee is for president -- but let's say it were to be Donald Trump returning as the nominee -- that if he were reelected president you could see a seriously difficult path for Zelenskyy to maintain that pipeline of U.S. support, and funding, and training. And there have been questions about how a shutdown would impact the training and assistance that's already in the pipeline. I expect that we'll hear more from the Pentagon. One of our colleagues, I think at Politico, has been reporting this -- that the Pentagon is going to maybe come out and clarify that they can consider some of the Ukraine training assistance to be sort of essential and therefore not impacted by the shutdown. But the White House is asking for 24 billion extra dollars for Ukraine. Zelenskyy is begging for this support. What the White House is able to push through the pipeline at this point, mid-shutdown, is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So Ukraine assistance is not maybe going to stop but the money, at some point, is not going to be there unless they can reach an agreement on this. So the Republican caucus is divided over this. Senate Republicans are standing firm with Zelenskyy. But House Republicans, particularly in hard, red districts where there is movement toward nationalism and populism, and an argument that --",
