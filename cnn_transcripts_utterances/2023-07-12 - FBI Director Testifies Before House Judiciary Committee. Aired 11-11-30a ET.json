MATT GAETZ (R-FL):  We're deeply proud of them, and they deserve better than you. REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH):  The time of the gentleman has expired. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for five minutes. REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN):  Thank you, Mr. Chair. And, Director Wray, thank you for continuing to serve with all of these attempts to sell your name, suggests you have committed crimes, when you have done an excellent job as FBI director. I don't agree with everything you have done. But, mostly, I do. And I think the FBI is our premier law enforcement agency. And I support law enforcement. To attack the FBI is to attack law enforcement in general. A few days after Mar-a-Lago, there was some individual went after the Cincinnati headquarters of the FBI. Can you tell us a little bit about that and how you think that came about?",

A subsequent review of the subject's devices and online postings identified a pretty striking anti-FBI, anti- federal law enforcement hostility. He was calling on others to kill federal law enforcement, claiming that he felt he was fighting a, in his words, civil war. And it's unfortunately part of a broader phenomenon that we have seen not just against the FBI -- and this is important to add -- but against law enforcement all across the country, not just against law enforcement professionals themselves, which is appalling enough, but calling for attacks against their families, which is truly despicable.",

We are here today because MAGA Republicans will do anything to protect Donald Trump, their savior, no matter how unfounded or dangerous it may be to do so. Welcome to the legislative arm of the Trump reelection campaign. A grand jury found probable cause that, among other crimes, Trump illegally kept highly sensitive national security documents which could put our country and others and our sources in danger if they got out,and which photographs show Trump kept those records in bathrooms, showers, closets, and in the Mar-a-Lago ballroom. MAGA Republicans are afraid that the justice system might hold Trump accountable for his actions. So, to protect him, Republicans are trying to intimidate FBI officials. And in case that does not work, Republicans are trying their hardest to discredit the FBI in the eyes of the American public. When Trump lost in 2020, they tried to make Americans distrust their election systems. And now that the FBI and the Justice Department have sought to hold Trump to the same standard any other American citizen would be held to, MAGA Republicans are telling Americans not to trust the FBI. To protect Trump, Republicans are trying to distract us from the real work that the FBI does every day, which is fighting violent criminals, child predators, and fighting domestic terrorists and extremists, so as to protect our democracy and our national security. And, even worse, MAGA Republicans are stirring up threats that pose a danger to the safety of FBI employees. It's past time that Republicans realize the consequences of their words and put the good of this country over politics.

And if you look, if you look at the reports that have started to come out now from the FISA court, from ODNI, from the Justice Department, from others who have looked at the effect of our reforms, over and over again, they are showing significant improvement in compliance. We're talking about the most recent FISC, FISA court opinion finding 98 percent compliance and commending us for moving in the right direction. A DOJ report found 99 percent compliance. Our internal audit found a 14 percent jump up to 96 percent. These are all separate reports looking at the impact of our reforms. A lot of the public commentary about our failures -- and, let's be clear, we have had problems. And those problems are unacceptable. And I'm determined with my leadership team to fix them. But those problems almost entirely predate those reforms, even though some of them have just come out recently. And so we're going to keep working at this.

In fact, a lot of people don't know this, but the Joint Terrorism Task Forces that we hear about so often at the FBI were largely created in response to domestic terrorism, not foreign terrorism. But in my first few years as director, we were identifying this issue more and more, and that's why we elevated in the summer of 2019 racially motivated violent extremism to a national threat priority level. And we saw, I think, about a 40 percent increase in the number of domestic violent extremism investigations, all before anything to do with January 6. Obviously, since then, it has continued. But domestic violent extremism cuts across the spectrum, from the racially motivated violent extremism, militia violent extremism, anarchist violent extremism, environmental violent extremism. And, of course, recently we have had a lot of violent extremism attacks against pro-life facilities. And we're investigating those. So it really covers a wide spectrum. And what they all have in common is three things, violence or threats of violence motivated by some ideology, and it varies, in violation of federal criminal law. And that's the domestic violent extremism -- violent extremism that I'm talking about when I have identified this phenomenon.",
