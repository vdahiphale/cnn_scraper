I'm Max Foster.It's Wednesday April the 3rd 9 a.m. here in London 10 a.m. in Gaza where the death of seven aid workers have sparked international outrage and brought an apology from Israel over what it's calling a grave mistake. The World Central Kitchen identified the seven killed in an Israeli strike on Monday saying these heroes were just returning from a full day's mission. Most are foreign nationals. The chief of staff of the Israeli military is apologizing for the deadly strike. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF, ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES: I want to be very clear. The strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers. It was a mistake that followed a misidentification at night during a war in a very complex conditions. It shouldn't have happened. Israel is at a war with Hamas not with the people of Gaza. We are sorry for the unintentional harm to the members of WCK. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The hospital was the largest in Gaza, serving about 250,000 patients each year. According to the director who now says a field hospital is urgently needed to treat the injured. He says the buildings still standing at the complex are near collapse.An Israeli delegations left Cairo, Egypt after drawing up an updated proposal for Hamas. That's according to a statement from the Israeli Prime Minister's office. It also says Israel expects the mediators to take vigorous action to find a deal for the release of the remaining hostages. Negotiators from the U.S., Egypt, Israel and Qatar have been trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage deal for weeks now. But a final agreement remains elusive. Talks resumed on Sunday after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the Israeli delegation to travel to Qatar and to Egypt. Meanwhile, anger is rising on the streets of Jerusalem. Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered outside the Israeli Parliament or Knesset again on Tuesday. They want Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign. Social media videos show some breached security barriers and try to approach Mr. Netanyahu's residence. Others clashed with police. Israeli media reports several people were arrested. The protesters are angry about the government's failure to secure the release of remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. Nada Bashir joins us now. As usual, a huge amount to wrap up. But the things resonating around the world, the aid workers that were killed, we're getting a better picture of what happened. And, you know, it seems quite confusing when you hear that they coordinated with the Israelis on their aid mission. And were in, you know, pretty well marked vehicles.",

And now they have been forced to pause those activities. And we have heard from a former British Army artillery officer who has said that the scene that we've seen in the videos provided and the accounts provided from journalists on the ground, are consistent with the use of what he's described as highly accurate drone fired missiles, and said it was hard to believe that this would have been an accident, but would need to inspect the missile fragments to provide a thorough analysis.

It says that its staffers fear that if they do go into Gaza as part of these aid missions, that they too, will be targeted. And we've been hearing very firm statements from world leaders. We've also been hearing a firm statement from U.S. President Joe Biden. Of course, the U.S., one of Israel's closest allies, but Biden said yesterday in a statement that he was outraged and heartbroken.

The quake triggered landslides, brought down buildings and damaged roads. Officials say at least seven people are dead and more than 700 others injured. Rescue operations are underway for dozens of people thought to be trapped, the majority of them in tunnels. At least 125 buildings are now also damaged, we think. The 7.4 magnitude quake struck off the eastern part of the island. That led to tsunami warnings and evacuations for not just Taiwan but also parts of Japan and the Philippines. All of those warnings have since been lifted though. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is following us for us live from Tokyo. Extraordinary scenes coming out from Taiwan.",

So as you mentioned, we know that at least seven people have died and about 736 people were left injured as a result of this earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks.Now we know that of the seven who died, all of them were found dead in Hualien County on the eastern side of the island. Now for context, Hualien County is a very popular tourist destination. It's a rural area and coincidentally where most of actually Taiwan's earthquakes take place. So the fact that this is happening in Hualien County is a huge shock for people. And now also we know that of the seven who died, three of them were actually found dead in Taroko Gorge, which is another popular tourist destination. Now we also know that 77 people are still trapped in Hualien County, a majority of them, like you said, in those tunnels. Rescue operators are trying to get to them. There are some foreign nationals as well trapped in these tunnels. Now in terms of the rescue operations that are underway right now in Taiwan, the defense ministry has dispatched military troops to work with local governments to try to get people out from under the rubble of collapsed homes, of collapsed buildings, but also those tunnels. Now one thing though, hampering and kind of affecting some of those rescue operations is the fact that some of these roads have been destroyed because of these very, very powerful quakes. So military personnel have had to use transport aircraft to try to get to those people who still need rescuing. For instance, you know, one of the main roads that lead from Taipei, the capital of Taiwan to Hualien County was partially destroyed. So again, this is making it a bit difficult to get to these people. But this is very common protocol in Taiwan when you see a natural disaster of this magnitude, to see military personnel work with local governments and trying to get people out and get people to safety. Now one thing we have to remember about this earthquake is that it comes just a day before Tomb Sweeping Day, which is in the Chinese speaking world, a day when people go to their ancestors graves and commemorate their family members and give offerings to them. But for many people in Taiwan, their plans will be disrupted because of again, this very, very powerful earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks that we could still be seeing for the next three to four days, according to Taiwanese authorities -- Max.",

Now the court did call into question a couple of individual petitions for those trying to stop this law relating to health and the right to privacy. But they said it wasn't enough to strike down the law in its entirety, and still the key provisions are there. Which makes it illegal to be homosexual in Uganda, it calls on those who would promote homosexuality in the words of the law to be prosecuted and sent to prison or pay a hefty fine.

But when you actually hear them reading out their reasoning, it really aligned almost exactly with the legislators saying that Uganda is a conservative place, getting the issue of child recruitment to homosexuality mixed up between with LGBTQ rights. They really signed off on this law in its -- almost in its entirety. The law has already, of course, been enforced, and has a very real implications. Now, it's not just the fact that you can be arrested and put into prison for violating this homophobic bill. It's also that many Ugandans have seen fit to take the law into their own hands. We've reported extensively on people being evicted, being beaten up in some cases, humiliated on social media because of their sexual orientation.
