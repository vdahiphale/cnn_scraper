Remember, the Secret Service that has either an officer or an agent involved shooting on their hands right now. So they need to address that situation as well as, you know, start a protective review that will run in parallel to the criminal investigation to understand, you know, was there a potential lapse in the security structure? What type of vulnerability was potentially not addressed in the initial planning phases of building out that site security plan? I was a little bit shocked that a representative of the Secret Service was not there because they were the primary, you know, stakeholder and responsible for the security plan of this site. And their agents or officers were involved in the shooting itself. So I left a lot of like questions unanswered that will linger now. And to answer your direct question, I do believe that they will come out with either a series of statements in response to some of those questions this evening or join in future press conferences, you know, about this matter.",

Now, the Secret Service, in its defense, does not rely on one single, you know, point of failure around a security plan. [00:30:06] That's why you have the counter sniper team that's there.

They say there is no reason to believe at this point there are other existing threats. They have tentatively identified the shooter, but they say they're waiting to confirm the shooter's identity through DNA and other means. They say they did not receive any threat information prior to this shooting. And when asked about the number of shots, multiple shots that the shooter was able to get off, the FBI said it is surprising. The shooter was able to manage that before being taken out by authorities. Well, Donald Trump's advisors say he is fine and will be at the Republican National Convention this week after he was shot in this assassination attempt.

They did say they have tentatively ID'ed the shooter.But right now what they're waiting on is, as you noted at the top there, biometric confirmation because there was no ID of the individual on this person when he was ultimately, in their words, neutralized by law enforcement earlier this evening. I will say that that question was asked. Are you going to the shooter's home? Are you looking at all those things? And the understanding is that that is part of this current investigation. But again, law enforcement here at this press conference behind me were not willing to really give us more information on this shooter. I just want to also note, in addition to the attempted assassination attempt that the FBI is now officially calling this and that they are investigating, Pennsylvania State Police, they were also going into detail that they are investigating -- well, the federal agents, they are dealing with the assassination attempt, the Pennsylvania State Police, they're dealing with the homicide of one person who was also in the crowd and two others who were also critically wounded at that Trump rally due to gunfire as well. There are so many questions that we have. At this point, it's too early, according to law enforcement officials, to say if this was just a lone wolf. It is too early to say how long this shooter potentially was up there on that roof that you've been describing over the past few minutes. And also at this point, it's too early to say what any motive for this particular shooting is. So those are all some of the questions that we are hoping to get answers to in the coming certainly hours and days. But one of the things that I'll note though is I asked the folks here behind me, the law enforcement officials, if this was a failure of security, which clearly it does seem here that it was a massive failure of security. And the FBI Special Agent in Charge, who was addressing the media said, it's too early to identify where specific failures were. But I bring that up because the one government group that was not present at this particular press conference that was, of course, heavily involved in charge of protecting this environment was the Secret Service. And they were not present for this particular press conference. And a lot of the questions that we were asking of these officials about lapses in security here for this event, they said that you have to put those to Secret Service. And, of course, Secret Service was not present at this particular press conference. So again, there are still, at this point, a lot of questions that we do have certainly about the identification of the person, how long he was there and how in the world this was able to happen. But the FBI and local law enforcement, they're encouraging people who may have been at that rally to call in, to provide any other cell phone video that they might have taken to give any information if they potentially know who might have been that shooter, to come forward and to help with this investigation. And I think that we're just getting an incredible look, certainly a first look, I should say, at the massive scale of this investigation that is underway right now from the federal level to here at the local level in Western Pennsylvania.

From there, we go to another angle. It shows a different angle but a revealing perspective. What you're looking at here appears to be Secret Service counter- snipers on a roof of the building just behind where Donald Trump was speaking. And you can see them reacting to something off camera. In fact, the snipers, gun, the weapon jerks upward right there at the moment of the first shots. And then you see them firing their weapons as those Secret Service members rushed onto the stage to bring the former president, push him to the ground for safety. Of course, these moments after they were hit. The point of showing that video there is it appears that the counter- snipers were at least looking in the direction of the shooter prior to the shots being fired. Retired FBI agency and law enforcement contributor, Steve Moore, joins me now. Steve, it's good to have you on. You've been in law enforcement. I've covered law enforcement for years. I'm always very conscious of not jumping to conclusions. Counterterror, you only know about their failures. You don't know about their successes, similar with the Secret Service. They are dealing with constant threats all the time. They snuff out threats more times than we know. But here, given your experience, I wonder what failures you see here.

A number of folks who were in the crowd said that, yes, they had to pass-through magnetometers before they entered the immediate area, but that location of the suspected gunman's position was outside that area. Typically, with events like this, what kind of security is there outside the coordinate? Is it just looking for potential threats?

Representative Mike Lawler, he told me earlier, this level of hatred and violence cannot continue. Republican, President Biden, of course, a Democratic, he called it sick.

The shooter missed both times, as I recall. And so sadly, you know, we have this terrible tradition. In Congress, you know, the threat level against elected officials, particularly in Congress, is intolerably high. Of course, Steve Scalise, Gabby Giffords, and Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked with a hammer. This is -- this is out of control. And I think a lot of it has to do with the political discourse that is just so angry, so vengeful, and so much rage. That's -- I hate to say it. And, of course, I hate the social media. You know, a lot of people go on social media and say the most vile things. I mean, I haven't even looked at social media tonight. I can't imagine what's being said right now. But truthfully, this is a big part of the sickness in our culture right now. And it's translated into this horrific event. And thank goodness the former president is OK.

It feels like people think that the government has at least much of the bureaucracy has a -- has a partisan inclination. And so many folks don't trust institutions to do their jobs. And at a time like this, it's important that we have trust in the FBI and the Secret Service to get to the bottom of what happened. We all want to know what happened.
