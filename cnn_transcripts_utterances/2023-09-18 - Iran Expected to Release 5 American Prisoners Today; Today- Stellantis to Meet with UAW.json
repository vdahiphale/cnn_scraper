      "sentences": "Well, it should be the end of what has been a years-long nightmare for these five dual Iranian-American citizens who have been held in Iran, and are due for release today, expected to be delivered to the airport any time now to board that Qatari jet which is sitting on the tarmac. The Qataris have mediated this deal over months, being a friendly nation with both the U.S. and Tehran. Of course, there are no direct negotiations between Washington and Tehran.Once those hostages are on the flight and wheels are up, it is about a two-hour flight to Doha, here in Qatar. And they will land on the tarmac behind me here, to be met by the American negotiation team. But nothing is a done deal until it is a done deal. Of course, we've been through these negotiations, these swaps, these exchanges in the past, and any small thing can really hold things up. But let's just consider what this deal is all about. As you rightly said, these hostages, these wrongfully-detained American citizens, will be swapped out for five Iranians in U.S. prisons, although two of them have said they want to stay in the U.S. One is going to a third country. So only two of them will be returned to Iran. And the exchange, the unfreezing of $6 billion worth of Iranian cash, which under U.S. sanctions has been frozen in a South Korean bank account until now. The negotiation has been that that money will be wired, effectively, sanctions-free to the Qatar Central Bank, who will act as a guarantor as the Iranians are given it to spend. That is what the Qataris have been doing in all of what is a very complex and complicated deal. So who are these prisoners? Well, we know three of five of them. Siamak Namazi is an American-Iranian businessman. He's 51 years old. He was originally detained back in 2015, and then charged with acting with a hostile state, that being the U.S., in 2016 and imprisoned for ten years. Emad, who is also a businessman, Emad Shargi, was -- actually went home with his wife to Iran. He's a dual citizen. Went home with his wife in 2017, arrested and charged in 2018 on espionage charges. And then Morad Tahbaz, who is an environmentalist and also detained and charged on espionage charges back in 2018. Siamak -- do the math -- has been inside the notorious Evin Prison for nearly eight years, and at times, and through an unprecedented live interview on CNN just this year, appealed to the Biden administration to get him and the others out and said he had felt like he had been left behind in what had been a series of exchanges over the years for the Obama and Trump administration. Bottom line, those prisoners, those hostages have not left Tehran as of yet. We are expecting to see them be told that they will be on that flight, the Qatari jet on the ground very soon, from which it is about a two-hour flight here to Doha. Back to you guys.",

There was indications that, you know, several hours ago that the plane would have left Iran and come to Doha, as we're hearing. It hasn't yet.So we have to ask what exactly is going on. It could just be bureaucracy. It could -- you know, this all hinges for the Iranians always around the money. So has the money got there yet? Has it not? We just have to wait and see and not count our chickens before they actually hatch. But overall, the deal is to give the Iranians the money they say they're owed by South Korea for selling $6 billion worth of oil many years ago. Then there will be a prisoner swap. The Iranians told me that that involves five Iranians imprisoned here, four of those Americans imprisoned in Iran. And they said that, you know, all the charges against the Americans will be dropped. I mean, as you know, the charges were completely specious, completely made up. They were accused of acting with a hostile power. The hostile power was their own country. They were business people. They were environmentalists. So it's a complete nonsense. And it's just because they were American citizens. And yes, I talked to Siamak, and I've known him before, in the early 2000s. And he basically said that he had to call out of Evin because he was desperate, and that many times he had been left behind in previous U.S. prisoner swaps.",

Why was he left behind under the Obama administration swap? They got Jason Rezaian out. They didn't get him out. Why was he left behind twice by President Trump when he did prisoner swap deals?

General Motors yesterday. And Stellantis will be at the main bargaining table today. Negotiations are ongoing. That is certainly good news, but no deal in sight yet. The sides are still pretty far apart, especially on those key wages. We also know that President Biden has directed acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and senior White House adviser Gene Sperling to come to town, to come to Detroit, to try to help move these negotiations forward towards a deal. We know that UAW President Shawn Fain does not want the administration involved in these negotiations. Also on our radar, Poppy, is across the border in Canada, the union Unifor, which represents over 5,000 Ford workers, could head on strike as soon as tonight if they do not reach a deal with Ford. That could obviously exacerbate the situation for Ford, who has three plants in Canada that is producing quite a few of their vehicles.
