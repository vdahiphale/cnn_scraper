They have got a good case here. And whereas he tried to be meticulous, he sees himself as being a smart guy and all of that sort of thing, but he wasn't that smart because he left behind quite a few clues.",

Number one, you have to attack the cell phone sort of the pings that are very damaging with respect to putting him in the area not only the day and coming back but all of the stalking that was done previous to that time. Number two, you have to defeat and explain the DNA issues as it relates to why would his DNA by there. Is there an innocent explanation that would attach him to that location? Number three, there is apparently a footprint that they will be testing to determine whether or not it meets his shoe. Number four, you have the identification as it relates to his eyebrows. There is just so many issues here with regard to -- that need to be explains. And in the absence of an innocent explanation it becomes problematic.So, how I would look at it from a defense perspective is that it would be a very challenging case based upon the probable cause that was laid in the affidavit. What is probable cause? Reason to believe that a crime was committed and that you committed it, right, the individual at issue. But based upon that, Erica, boy, is it compelling and damning evidence. SCIUTTO:  Chief Ramsey, one thing that is clear is that police were doing a lot of hard work, police and FBI, gathering a lot information, pointing in the direction of Kohberger fairly early on and during a period of time when folks -- and I get this, understandably, we're wondering what was happening and saying, you're not sharing anything. Do you even have a suspect? What are you doing? Should we be scared? But it was clear from this affidavit, they seem to be on to this guy for some time.",

And I know people were upset that they weren't sharing a lot of information, but you have to remember, bad guys watch television too. And so you have to hold things close to the vest during the course of an investigation because you don't want all of that information to get out.If anything, I thought they talked too much at the very beginning. They have more than one spokesperson, you had the prosecutor making statements, you had the chief making statements and then they had to pull information back when they started off by saying that it was targeted and they had to walk it back. So, you have to be very careful when you have cases like this. I know people want to know, but your job is simple. It is to find the person responsible and put together a case that is prosecutable. That is really the focus and that is the only focus.",

I mean, there will be a lot of individuals that will try to psychoanalyze this particular individual to find out more about him, some of the things he may have done in the past. It is unusual, I'll put it that way, to have someone start off with a quadruple homicide, even though it may not -- he may not have intended for it to be quadruple.I don't understand why he left the witness alive, to be honest with you. I'm glad he did. But normally in a case like this, that is last thing a person would do if you've already committed four murders, five won't make that much difference. I'm not trying to sound harsh but it is just a reality. So, I don't know what he was thinking. I have absolutely no idea at all.",

Nice to see you this morning.I have to ask, after serving two terms in the House, as you're watching what is playing out right now in Washington, what do you make of this moment? FMR. REP. ELAINE LURIA (D-VA):  This is really, you know, not that unexpected from what I saw coming with the new Congress. I mean, it was all about grievance, grievance, grievance. I think it's a Congress of versus governing, which is a stark contrast, and whatever negotiations Jim Banks was talking about that are going on behind the scenes. If McCarthy is making every concession in the world, how are they going to govern at all over the course of the next two years?",

There are bigger concerns here, the fact that without a speaker, there is no business happening in the House. New members have not been sworn in, as you know. You served on homeland security, for example, there has been talk about security clearances. What is your biggest concern in this moment when there is not currently a House of Representatives?",

And without a functioning Congress, the Congress can't perform its roles, its oversight roles, the critical information that they receive from our intelligence agencies and in support of the military. So, the longer this drags on, the less time that those members who would be serving on those committees in the House of Representatives would be able to perform those functions.And it is really a threat, it seems, looking from abroad. What are our adversaries thinking as they watch this chaos happen? And that certainly is a concern. It makes our country vulnerable during this time. And I think that this needs to come to an end.

You said it was more important than anything else you've done in Congress than your 20 years in the Navy. There were so many powerful moments of testimony. The report is out, the transcripts.

That is obviously out of the committee's hands now that that has concluded. But going to Republican-control Congress, it is the one place it hasn't broken through. Essentially those Republican members of the House who voted to not certify the election results two years ago, they are still perpetuating the lies and the myth and not facing the facts and the truth.

Kevin McCarthy stood up on the floor and he said the right things. He condemned the violence. He implied that President Trump had some responsibility. But shortly thereafter, he went down to Mar-a-Lago, met with Trump and made a 180 and has stayed on that course ever since. And, again, back to our original conversation, again, that is why I think he's one of the least worthy members of the House to be seeking a speakership.",
