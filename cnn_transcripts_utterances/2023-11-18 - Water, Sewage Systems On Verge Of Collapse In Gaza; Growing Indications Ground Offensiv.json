All right, let's begin in Israel, where desperate families of the 237 hostages held by Hamas are gathering at this hour. thousands marched today in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, calling on the Israeli government to do more to bring the hostages home, six weeks after they were abducted. It comes as Israel Defense Forces are now vowing to advance anywhere Hamas is found. There are growing signs that the IDF may soon expand its operations into southern Gaza, but the fighting continues in Gaza City. Doctors at Al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza is largest, say, they were ordered to evacuate by the Israeli military through the -- though, the IDF disputes that claim. A head doctor says six doctors are staying at the medical complex to treat around 120 patients, two vulnerable, to evacuate. Meantime, the first plane carrying children from Gaza with urgent medical needs arrived in the United Arab Emirates today. And it comes as the Palestinian Authority's ministry of health says only nine of Gaza's 35 hospitals are still operating.

And here today, you are seeing not only people who are simply concerned for the well-being of these -- of these hostages, and wants to bring them home, but also, family members of some of those hostages.

But the resounding message from the president this week, as he was at the summit in California was saying that the quote, only answer to this conflict is a two-state solution. That has been an idea that has been long endorsed by President Biden and he went on to say that Israel occupying Gaza would be \"a big mistake,\" again, reiterating a message there. But looking to the nearer term, and the urgency right now is the release of hostages held by Hamas. These negotiations have been ongoing for weeks, and they -- administration officials are working feverishly behind the scenes, President Biden even acknowledging that this week saying that he himself is involved multiple times a day on this issue. But, of course -- and of course, he'd spoke to Qatar yesterday. And in that conversation, they again talked about hostages. And that was the second time the two leaders had spoken in a week, which goes to show how much pressure they are putting on this. Again, unclear where the breakthrough will be or when there will be a breakthrough. But also, against the backdrop of all of this is the domestic landscape that the president is having to navigate. The politics of the moment that includes wrestling with pushback from members of his own party. And just in an event last week that I attended in Illinois, the president heard directly from a protester at an event who called for a ceasefire. So, these are issues that the president while he works with leaders around the globe, to try to solve and find breakthroughs in this conflict. He's also having to wrestle with them -- with them domestically. And so, all of that is what the president will have to work through in the weeks and months to come.",

And we think that's largely because their economy is in far tougher shape than it's been at almost any point, in 30 or 40 years, they've been holding meetings like this with the United States. You know, It used to be fairly standard fair for the Chinese to come into these meetings with either a stated or unstated assumption that they are on the rise, we're on the decline. They were growing at eight percent. Now, all of a sudden, Xi Jinping showed up, having to talk to Americans about investing in China at a moment that there has been disinvestment. He's got a huge property crisis with this overhang of debt. He's got economic slowdown, he's got troubles getting employment for young Chinese where the employment levels, unemployment levels, looked to be running above 20 percent.

One was the unrelenting anti-China tone you hear here in Washington. Right? From Democrats and Republicans. Which he thought was sort of feeding a cycle between Washington and Beijing.And he's right about that, it is feeding a cycle because the more people in Beijing here, trying to patch in here, the more they do the same, and, of course, everybody is under pressure to step up their military exercises, and so forth. The second thing he complained about was the export controls. And these were the controls on the most advanced computer chips and the equipment to go make them. President Biden has said, we're not backing down on those, those are not about an economic advantage. They're about a military advantage, and not giving the Chinese military the ability to get the most high-end chips. So, he said, this is on national security grounds. And the question really, that's hanging out there is can trying to make up for this on its own? They have been having trouble doing that. Or would they basically hope that another administration would ease up on those controls? I don't think Biden's going to ease up on.",

If they -- if the Chinese invasion was a full-scale invasion into the island, I think the U.S. and others would respond militarily.I also think that's the less likely scenario, because China needs Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes most of the world's most leading- edge chips, as much as we do. And destroying that on the way in would be counterproductive for China as well. It is, I think, more possible that they could do the slow squeeze. And you heard, Will talked a little bit about that in his piece, which is surround the island, cut off its communications, do some kind of embargo on goods coming in and out that they would have to inspect, and basically slowly take over the island that way. And without the show of military force, I think that would be a much harder response for Washington. WHITFIELD: All right. Lots on the table. David Sanger, good to see you. Thanks so much.

But at the same time, the judge rejected a motion to remove the former president from the 2024 presidential primary ballot there, citing the 14th Amendment.The district judge says, quote, \"The insurrectionist ban does not apply to presidents.\" It marks the first time any court determined that Trump engaged in an insurrection. The former president faces federal charges related to efforts in overturning the 2020 election results in Washington, D.C. Joining me now is Gloria Browne-Marshall, a constitutional law professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and author of the books \"The Voting Rights War\" and \"She Took Justice.\" Good to see you, Gloria. Let's break this down for everybody. It's complicated. At the same time, it can be looked at in a very simplistic way. These three decisions have shared rulings to keep Trump on the ballot, but all had different standards to meet. Colorado said it's unclear if barring insurrectionists from public office applies to the presidency. In Minnesota, the court said Trump can remain on the ballot because political parties have sole choice over who appears. Then there's Michigan, where the judge ruled Congress is the proper forum for deciding whether Trump is on the ballot. Is it all \"case closed\" now, no openings for other states to challenge whether Trump should be on their ballots, or is it ultimately just simply up to voters? GLORIA BROWNE-MARSHALL, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR, JOHN JAY COLLEGE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE &amp; AUTHOR: I think all of the above apply. I'll tell you why. I truly believe that other state courts and federal courts should weigh in, because they all have different interests. I also believe that the Colorado case is going up on appeal and that that appeal is going to be expedited. Unfortunately, we have a super majority of conservatives that have already shown their allegiance to Donald Trump, so we don't know what's going to happen at the Supreme Court level. But I think it deserves to be there. I also believe that, when Judge Wallace decided in the Colorado federal court that Donald Trump had participated in an insurrection, that was pivotal. That's what was missing here. I said this before, that until he has been seen as an insurrectionist by a court, then it's difficult to view the statute that's based on insurrection. So we've actually overcome a very high hurdle with that determination in the Colorado case.",

We saw the engagement of the president in this behavior. And yet, there has been no ruling that Donald Trump was, indeed, an insurrectionist, that he had incited the riots that led to the January 6th attack on the capitol. Now we have that connective piece. Once that's in place, as it is here, the idea that when, who does this pertain to, if it pertains to state and federal officers, then why not the president? The reason why I say this is because, back in 1868, when the 14th Amendment was enacted, there were, of course, certain federal positions, but nothing like we have today. There are thousands of places in government that could not have been thought of back in 1868. You can't limit it to just what was thought of there as an officer. I was a law clerk in federal court. I raised my hand and swore to protect the Constitution. Think of all of the different jobs that are in federal, local and state government where that's done. And of course, in the military and such. So I don't think it should be limited based on the wording that doesn't specifically include president, because it could also include justices of the Supreme Court. Think about this. You can't put everybody in that position. So I think this is an issue worthy of appeal and it should be taken quite seriously.",

But apparently, it's not all bad news.CNN's Kristin Fisher joining me now from South Padre Island in Texas. Why are scientists saying this is halfway successful, halfway bad? KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, SpaceX is calling it a success, because this second test flight was far more successful than the first back in April. This time, all 33 of these big raptor engines all ignited at once, something that's never been done before on this rocket. And then they were able to do the riskiest maneuver of this test mission, something they'd been very worried about, called the hot staging technique. This was the moment of separation, the moment when everything went wrong back in April. So the fact that that was a success today, some great news for SpaceX. And then they also didn't blow up the launch pad, which they did last time, totally destroyed it. That's a success as well. But it is also a failure, because this rocket did not complete its ultimate mission, which was to do almost a complete lap of planet earth and then splash down into the Pacific Ocean. So now it ended in an explosion or a rapid unscheduled disassembly, as SpaceX likes to call it. Because it ended in an explosion, that now triggers an immediate mishap investigation by the FAA, which could theoretically delay a next test flight attempt, Fredricka. But NASA, very pleased. The administrator congratulated SpaceX today calling this big progress. This, of course, critical to NASA's Artemis program to return American astronauts to the moon.",

It is a descent into what actually one U.N. official called on Friday \"evil.\" And I think that is probably the best script of it. The level of depravity, the intent to humiliate and terrorize so people cannot go back to their homes, so that land is cleared. It is heartbreaking that, after the first genocide in Darfur, there was such a public outcry around the world, especially in the U.S., and so many people called for action. So to come back 20 years later and have to say, actually, we failed these people, it's very -- it's difficult to see.",

And he just looked at me, and he said, \" I want you to believe me when I tell you that I have nothing to be ashamed of.\" And I guess I hadn't really thought about that until you asked that question. I think the familiarity, perhaps, allowed him that confidence at 17 years old to feel, no, I want to tell my story, I want to show my face. The enslavement and the humiliation and what was done to me, that doesn't chain me. So I hope -- and it's amazing we're getting to do this whole hour and it's going to go out on CNN tomorrow.
