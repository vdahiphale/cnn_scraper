This is their 227th rally. I don't know what's going on with them. Those beautiful ladies, but they always seem to have good seats.But Corey had the best seat in the house, and he was telling his wife and family on the way over in the car, he said, I am telling you, he is going to invite me up on the stage because I do that sometimes, I take people, we invite them up on the stage and she smiled, thinking, it will never happen. And little did anyone realize that Corey would be on the stage three months later in an almost immortal position and that is where he is today. He is on the stage in a -- I think -- and not almost, I think it is a truly immortal position. So the love that he showed on that day and throughout his life is the love that sustains the entire movement, love that our families have and the love of our communities and love of our country. It is a force more powerful than any hatred and malice, because even in the darkest hours, it shines forth as a guide and it guides us like nothing could ever guide us. It guides us really like a candle in the night.

If you look at the polling, people look at Donald Trump's presidency quite fondly. And one of those things is they thought he was strong. They thought he was strong on the economy. The prices were lower. They also thought he was strong on foreign policy. We see the bombings going on in Lebanon tonight. The Middle East is mired in war. We have a war with Ukraine and Russia going on. And so I think they wanted to project a modicum of strength here. And that plays into, well, his strength with voters because they look fondly on his presidency. And I'd say this is really a capstone to a good week for the Trump campaign. I mean, you start last Sunday where you showed Latino voters were moving away from Kamala Harris and into the Trump campaign. JD Vance had a - hit a home run on Tuesday night with his VP debate performance. We saw the firefighters decline to endorse anyone. That's a major victory and a reminder of the blue-collar workers that are moving into the Trump campaign. We see stories out today about Kamala Harris struggling in Michigan and many Democratic insiders think she's running too much of a Rose Garden campaign. So I think if you're the Trump campaign, you're - this is a capstone to a pretty good week.",

You've got 14 states now that don't require voter ID.California, where I used to live, is - just passed a law banning voter ID for voting. How - I still can't believe that's real. So how are you supposed to have a good, a proper election if there's no ID? It's just meaningless. And free speech is the bedrock of democracy. And if people don't know what's going on, if they don't know the truth, how can you make an informed vote? You must have free speech in order to have democracy. That's why it's the First Amendment. And the Second Amendment is there to ensure that we have the First Amendment. President Trump must win to preserve the constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America.",

Worth noting, he did say some things that are not true. He accused Democrats of wanting to take away people's right to vote. He wanted to - he accused them of taking away their freedom of expression and taking away their right to bear arms. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have said multiple times they do not want to take people's guns away.He also said that he believes President Trump would be the person that can preserve the Constitution and American democracy. Worth noting that the former president is, of course, facing numerous indictments for trying to overturn the 2020 Election, which he still does not accept as a legitimate result.

As you and I have been speaking for nearly three hours now, we have seen this continuous, pretty much sustained bombardment of the southern suburbs tonight. We are hearing from the Israeli military, the Arabic spokesman for the IDF in a post on X saying that the IDF is currently targeting Hezbollah terrorist targets in the Beirut area.No specifics there, but, you know, this is an area of the capital. It's a part of Beirut that is very heavily populated. We have seen a mass exodus from this part of Beirut where Hezbollah has a strong presence in recent days as we've seen these intensified strikes. But at the same time, you still have a lot of civilians in there. So it's unclear right now if there are casualties. And we're speaking and I can still hear some more blasts. I mean, this has been constant for nearly three hours right now. And this began with a warning from the Israeli military, also in a post on X, several others followed saying that they are going to be striking a number of neighborhoods and have asked people to move away from certain buildings in these neighborhoods this coming really late at night, so unclear if people got those messages. But since we have seen these sustained strikes on the southern suburbs and in at least two of those strikes, we have seen what appears to be secondary explosions. It appears to be a very long night for the residents of Beirut.",
