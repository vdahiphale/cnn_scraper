And now, he at this time, he is trying to pivot from a primary to the general election when he has to win over a lot of voters who are, frankly, not enamored with Trump. And this clip shows how he is, sort of, struggling to balance that. Take a listen to how he described, how he had to navigate trump in this general election.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is critical work for us to be doing because these are the people who are responsible for the deadly fake fentanyl pills that are being sold in our communities, on social media, to our kids. These are the people who are responsible for flooding communities from coast-to-coast and everywhere in between with the deadly fentanyl and methamphetamine. They're working for the two main cartels, Sinaloa and Jalisco that are responsible for almost -- virtually all of the fentanyl and meth across the United States today.And so, what we're doing is we are targeting every single part of what those two cartels are doing. And very critically, as you see from the work we've done over the last year, we are targeting and taking off the street, not only the equivalent of 193 potentially deadly doses, but also more than 3,000 individuals that are that Last Mile. They're the people that are putting these fake pills and the fentanyl powder into Americans' hands. And we are seeing hundreds of thousands of American lives lost over the last couple of years.

Arresting -- sorry, prosecuting 28 individuals, not just the leadership but also the precursor chemical suppliers coming from China, the people manufacturing the fentanyl in Mexico. And now what you us doing in the U.S. is following that Last Mile. The cartels need to get that fake -- those fake fentanyl pills and the fentanyl powder into the hands of Americans, that's how they make billions of dollars. So, we're going to keep doing this mapping and targeting, and we're going to keep doing it to take all the fentanyl off the street and also arrest the people who are responsible.",

More than 100 million Americans are -- have social media accounts, and this is one way that the cartels are selling their fake fentanyl pills across the United States.

I am also relentlessly focused on our mission, which is to save American lives and to do it with urgency. Because, Kate, I know, you know, that what happens in one year is 107,735 Americans are dying, and that is not acceptable.

The Russian appointed head of that region says more than 1,600 residents have been evacuated. Video shows a huge line of buses lining up to leave right there.Meanwhile, Russian attacks across Ukraine are intensifying, at least one person was killed in a missile strike on the port side of the Odessa this morning. In Kyiv, five people were wounded by falling debris after Ukraine intercepted nearly three dozen drones overnight. Our Nic Robertson is in eastern Ukraine this morning. And on top of all this, Nic, and we received new drone footage from Bakhmut, there are new concerns, I would say, about what is happening there especially on the eve of Russia's big Victory Day where they celebrate the defeat of the Nazis. Perhaps the Russians are looking for some kind of victory now in Ukraine. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN'S INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:   John, we've heard for long about the fight of over Bakhmut. The Ukrainians slowly, slowly, slowly losing ground there. But what they say they won't do is be defeated and pushed out of that city before Victory Day in Moscow. Why? Because they don't want President Putin to have the satisfaction of being able to claim one significant Ukrainian town that he's gained in this war, and they're going to hold on. But their fear and their concern is that Russia will throw everything into the fight tonight. Now, of course, there's been confusion created about the fight in Bakhmut because Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary boss, has said he'll pull his troops out. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader has said, he'll put his troops in. The Kremlin has taken heat from Prigozhin for not giving enough ammunition. Apparently, that ammunition, according to Ukrainians, has come through because they're getting a lot more shells falling on their troops. And this is what we're seeing in those images that you have there. And we've seen other images, overnight images, that match those, parts of Bakhmut on fire. The Ukrainians, though, however, are holding it. But we get a lot of conversations around here with different commanders in the region. And there is utter determination that this city -- this town, rather, won't wall before the 10th of May. But what we understand is it's going to be a very fierce fight and both sides are ready for it. BERMAN:  That poised for a renewed round of fierce fighting there. These pictures that we're seeing from Bakhmut, this drone footage, it's just extraordinary. Just smoke everywhere, burned out shells on buildings. Nic Robertson, to you and your team, please stay safe. Keep us posted. Kate.",
