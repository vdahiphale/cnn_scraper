This was Donald Trump's third time as the Republican nominee but, of course, this election was different because not for the first time -- for the first time, actually, he not only won the Electoral College, but he also won the popular vote. Sources say this has given him a different mindset compared to when he first entered office in 2017. Trump's campaign adviser Jason Miller telling CNN last week that winning the popular vote \"changes everything.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They would say he didn't win the popular vote, and we won the popular vote by records now, which nobody can say that anymore about us. Won the White House, recaptured the Senate, and now, as of today, recaptured the House. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

What would they do?Well, we found out that these 14 panelists from across the battleground states -- about a third had gone back to Trump. About a third stuck with the Democratic ticket -- in this case, Kamala Harris. And then the rest of them did third-party candidates. So they're really a divided group. But what we heard uniformly from them is that the economy is their driving concern and that's what they want the president to focus on. They don't want him on a retribution tour. They don't want him blowing up every sector of the federal government and all the institutions that they -- that they know and that they use, but most of them believe that he probably will try.

Doctor, thanks very much for being here. It's wonderful to have you. I'd like to start with just helping our viewers understand what a job like this entails, and the sheer size and scope that is under the attention of the Department of Health and Human Services, including over 100 million Americans who get their health care through Medicare and Medicaid. And the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is, of course, under HHS. Can you give us an idea of what kinds of decisions Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be having to make if he is, in fact, confirmed to this role? DR. ABDUL EL-SAYED, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, DIRECTOR AND OFFICER, MICHIGAN'S WAYNE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, HUMAN &amp; VETERANS SERVICES, FORMER DETROIT HEALTH COMISSIONER (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Kasie. This is going to be the man setting the agenda for everything from what science we pursue to who gets health care under critical programs like Medicaid and Medicare. What the ACA will cover. And I just want to give you three examples to answer your question. You think about the CDC and vaccine advisory. This is going to be the individual who helps to select who the next CDC director is and what kinds of vaccines we are recommending for children. Look at the NIH and the kinds of science that we pursue and the grants that we give. You could imagine somebody with very serious antivaccine views now starting to shut down research on vaccines for diseases that we don't yet have vaccines for. You think about another agency like CMS (the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) and decisions about what we are going to cover for seniors. And another one, finally, FDA (Food and Drug Administration). And you think about the kinds of decisions around regulation around food stuffs and medications. And this is someone, unfortunately, who has a history of some really questionable views. And it's not whether or not you agree with his views; it's whether or not his views are based in science. Science is the way that we ask and answer questions in our society -- a very diverse society. We ask can we observe whether or not this medication, for example, has real benefits? And unfortunately, this is somebody whose past statements have demonstrated no fealty to science whatsoever; just cherry-picking data that unfortunately will comport with his preconceived notions.",
