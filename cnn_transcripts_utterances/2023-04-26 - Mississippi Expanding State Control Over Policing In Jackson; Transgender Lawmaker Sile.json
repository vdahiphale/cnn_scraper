It is unclear if they can get to that point yet, but that is still what they're driving towards. They are concerned if they change the bill, whether it's to take away some the rescission of ethanol tax breaks.That has actually prompted a lot of concerns from some Iowa members. If they take that away or they change the Medicaid work requirements, some conservatives wanted to make it stricter on how the -- how Medicaid beneficiaries would get benefits under this program through this legislation. If McCarthy changes any of these provisions, he is concerned that it would open up the bill to a whole wide range of other changes, creating an unwieldy process and ultimately seeking the plan altogether which is why they are trying to pressure their members to fall in line now.

That means it must be an exact replication of the notes. The plaintiffs have already admitted of the four chords, one is not similar. This is very important because this is not similarity in feel. It's literally whether it's the exact same notes. So, I believe it is not infringement.",

If you go back to the Stairway to Heaven case, Led Zeppelin literally toured with the band spirit. And it is literally the exact same notes and they said, well, this goes back to the year 1400, Led Zeppelin has a long history of appropriating songs that subsequently they give credit to or they're arguing about. That is very different from the Ed Sheeran case.It's not like he was on the road with Marvin Gaye, who's deceased. So, that's the most recent case. And you would say using that logic, if Led Zeppelin skated, then insurances should skate. But if the jury believes like the hoi polloi. Well, it sounds similar, they're going to go against that. And that is not the criterion, which is exactly what is freaking everybody out as a result of the Blurred Lines case. Now, there's another expression of British expression where there's a hit, there's a writ. They're not suing all these people who don't have hits. They see this pile of money, they see the Blurred Lines case, they say, what the hell, let's give it a shot. And therefore, if I'm looking for a legal case, I would say slam dunk shouldn't be convicted. But once you get to court, you have no idea what will happen. Just like in the Fox Dominion case, they settled because if they went all the way to trial, who knew what would happen?",
