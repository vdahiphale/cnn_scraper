Just ahead, the Israeli military pushes further into Gaza City while tensions arising at the border between Israel and Lebanon. We'll have live reports.Then former British Prime Minister David Cameron makes a surprise return as foreign secretary. And Iceland prepares for another volcanic eruption likely to happen in the coming days. I'll speak to an expert about why this time may be different. Israel is intensifying its ground operations inside Gaza. Military officials say Israeli troops have pushed deeper into Gaza City. They breached the outskirts of the Al-Shati refugee camp and carrying out raids in multiple areas. The IDF says it's arrested 20 alleged Hamas members, including some accused of taking part in the October 7th attacks on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, talking to CNN. He's refusing to answer whether he takes responsibility for failing to prevent the October 7th massacre. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The second thing we have to understand is that there has to be an overriding and overreaching Israeli military envelope because we've seen any place that we leave, we just, you know, exit, give it to some other force. Very soon, terrorism resurges. So we must achieve nothing. The third thing we have to understand is that a civilian authority has to cooperate in two goals. One is to demilitarize Gaza and the second is to de radicalize Gaza.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

He says about 7,000 people are sheltering at the hospital, along with 1,500 patients and staff. But it's now ran out of food, water, milk for children and babies. Israel says it dropped off 300 liters of fuel outside the hospital on Sunday, but claims Hamas blocked hospital workers from picking it up.With intense fighting reported in the area, the hospital, which is run by the Hamas-controlled health ministry says, workers are too afraid to go outside and get the fuel, which in any case would have powered generators for about half an hour only. Israel alleges that Hamas's headquarters are housed underneath that hospital. CNN's Nada Bashir has more on the desperate situation in Gaza hospitals. And a warning, some of the video you're about to see is graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over): These are the sounds of the final gasps from Gaza's collapsing healthcare system. Medical staff in Gaza City, working under near relentless Israeli bombardment for over a month. But now this chorus of frantic voices, seen here working under torchlight, tells its own gut wrenching story. The Al-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza, has now collapsed. The hospital no longer operational, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. But these scenes are all too familiar across the besieged Gaza Strip. The vast majority of hospitals here are already completely out of service, the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah says, and those remaining now on a cliff edge. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): There is a direct injury in the head, internal bleeding, and we can't do surgeries. No surgeries, no oxygen, no electricity. We work manually. We are using a manual resuscitator. It is a clear injury. It needs an urgent surgery, a lifesaving one. He is less than a year old. BASHIR (voice-over): Remarkably, this baby survived. But his father, who was in the very same building when an Israeli airstrike hit, did not. At Gaza's largest hospital, Al-Shifa officials say newborn babies had to be moved and that at least three babies in the neonatal unit died after a generator powering incubators was damaged in an Israeli strike. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The IDF regularly says it is targeting Hamas. But doctors here say the hospital is now completely surrounded.",

On Sunday, the militant group Hezbollah claimed responsibility for missile attacks that injured civilians in the northern part of Israel. An IDF spokesman says Israel has, quote, plans to change the security situation in the north and that it will not allow people who live there to feel unsafe.Let's get some insight into that comment from Ben Wedeman, who's in Southern Lebanon.

Now here in the south, we're about 20 kilometers north of the border. We've been hearing fairly steady what sounds like artillery, incoming artillery and airstrikes from that area.Now, according to the official Lebanese National News Agency, just in the last half hour, two civilians have been killed, several wounded, when the house they were in was struck in an Israeli airstrike, completely leveling the house. Now, yesterday afternoon, according to the Israeli media, one worker with the local electricity company was killed as a result of a Hezbollah strike. So it does seem to be that the situation is escalating somewhat. Certainly basically since Saturday, we have seen fairly intense cross border fire. Now the worry is of course, obviously the Israelis are going to make good on their threats to escalate, especially now that we're seeing more injuries and fatalities. But until now it seems to be limited at least to the border area about 10 kilometers on this side, a few more kilometers on the other side. But it hasn't yet reached the point where it could spark a full out war, Max. But we're getting close.",
