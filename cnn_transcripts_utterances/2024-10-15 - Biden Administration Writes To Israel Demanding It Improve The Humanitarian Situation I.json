Too, Israeli Minister of Defense, Yoav Gallant, and Minister of Strategic affairs of Israel Ron Dermer, perhaps even threatening military assistance down the road if Israel does not get more aid into Gaza within the next 30 days. What more can you tell us about this letter? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bianna. This is a really significant step by the Biden administration. And essentially what they are saying is that if Israel does not within the next 30 days take certain steps to dramatically reverse for the better the situation in Gaza, the humanitarian situation there, then the U.S. maybe forced to reexamine the kind of military assistance that it is giving to Israel, because, you know, it could be running afoul of U.S. law at this point. International law, U.S. law, they do require that the U.S. in its provision of foreign military aid to other countries, they assure that those countries are not themselves violating international humanitarian law and certain laws governing, of course, the provision of U.S. humanitarian aid to populations in need, according to the, you know, U.S. policy. And so what we are seeing now is that the administration is witnessing such a dire humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza, one that in September was at its worst point since the beginning of the war in last October, that they are now saying that if Israel does not act within the next month, then they are going to, you know, have to look at the kind of aid that they are giving to the Israelis in terms of military equipment. Now, the bottom line here is that the U.S. has not already begun restricting that military assistance, right, because we just saw that they are providing this very advanced anti-missile system, air defense system to the Israelis, along with U.S. troops, to operate it. And the lack of humanitarian aid that has gone into Gaza, that has been a problem for well over, you know, several months now. And so the question is whether the U.S. is actually going to be using this leverage moving forward or whether it is simply an empty threat to try to get Israel to change its behavior. That really remains to be seen, what kind of actual concrete steps the U.S. takes if Israel does not abide by these warnings.",

      "sentences": "Well, that is the messaging being shared privately by Israeli officials to their U.S. counterparts,according to a source familiar with the conversations. But the public messaging from Israel, so far, has been very different. In fact, in the wake of the first report about these conversations, the Israeli prime minister's office posted on Twitter saying that Israel takes into consideration the advice of its partners like the United States, but that ultimately it's going to make its own final decision about exactly how and when to strike back against Iran. And so there is still somewhat of a lingering question about exactly what Israel will do, but there's no doubt that there has been an effort over the course of the last week by the United States to get on the same page with Israel about what this response looks like. And from my conversations with Israeli officials, I can also say that there is a desire to get on a similar page with the United States not to do something that would go completely out of whack with the U.S. as we have seen so many times before. And I think that the deployment of this THAAD advanced anti-missile system by the United States to Israel, certainly appears to be part of the carrot (ph), if you will, to encourage Israel to listen to the United States, to heed the U.S.'s advice as it relates to what it will strike. And in providing that system, of course, the United States has not only put about 100 troops on the ground in Israel to assist with the operation of this system at a time when Iran could very well strike back, following Israeli retaliation and as tensions are very high in this region. But that system, of course, will help Israel defend against likely Iranian retaliation after Israel carries out its strike on Iran. Now, we still don't know exactly what the timing of that strike will look like. The U.S. has said that that system is already beginning to be deployed in Israel and that it will be fully operational in the, quote, near future, but they're not specifying exactly when that would be. We do know, though, that this Israeli response to that barrage of some 200 Iranian ballistic missiles will be significant. It will be more significant than the response Israel delivered back in April following that first round of Iranian strikes. And Israel definitely wants to inflict some damage beyond simply sending a message, as they have done previously. So a very tense moment in this region. And, of course, we will see how  -- to what extent Iran feels compelled to retaliate. But certainly, the United States believes that if Israel avoids striking nuclear and oil facilities, that it could avoid sending this into an entirely new realm, one in which Iran, which targeted mainly military targets inside of Israel during this latest round, to prevent Iran from feeling compelled to strike strategic infrastructure or civilian targets as it is likely to retaliate after that.

A bit of a reprieve in oil prices on the news of this reporting that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to avoid nuclear and oil facilities in its retaliatory strike on Iran.

Anna Stewart, thank you so much.Joining us now to discuss all of this further is Miri Eisin, who's a retired colonel of the IDF and currently a senior fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism. Miri, it's good to see you again. It's been a while. So, assuming this reporting is accurate, initially reported by \"The Washington Post\" that Israel has agreed to limit its strikes to military targets within Iran, is that a decision that you would support? There are others in Israel, most notably former Prime Minister Bennett, who had been arguing for a direct strike now, that now was a perfect opportunity, in his words, to strike Iran's nuclear facilities. What is your take? MIRI EISIN, SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTER-TERRORISM: When I look at Iran right now, I'm mainly looking at the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC. They're the ones who run it. You said before military targets. But let's be clear, in Iran, there's the Iranian military, which has no impact whatsoever, and there's the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. And the Iranian Revolutionary Guard is designated, both by the United States, by the E.U., by the entire free world, I would say, as a terror organization. So that immediately gives you lots of targets that are, I don't want to say, you know, it's like good targets. They're the ones who supply the weapons to all the different proxies. They are the main instigator and destabilizer. And that gives you a whole list there. It's not the nuclear sites. It's not the oil arena. And it's specifically targeting those who are destabilizing the Middle East and the world.",

I think that it's important that you can do things against the Islamic regime of Iran that they all know, but you don't have to do something overt in the face, but rather to take it a step where everything calms down. But even when I say calms down, I'm in a war. This war was imposed upon us on October 7th, 2023. We're still in it. And it's not just about Iran joining in. They've been in from the beginning. So it can't be that they like get away with this, that they're the instigator, the supplier, the ideology.

And in that sense, I do think that bringing in these systems, it's not a question of calming me down, it's of the world being together against this threat. I think that makes a huge point. And I'll just say that in Israel right now, in that sense, I feel like I have to remind us all, we're fighting against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. There are 101 hostages there. We're fighting against Hezbollah in Lebanon and other places. And Iran is the one standing behind all of those.

All of this incredible, not as a good thing, enormous weapon caches, arsenals that we are uncovering and destroying inside Lebanon are part of Iran's system to protect themselves. So we're looking both at Iranian direct capabilities, but also the use of their proxies. And in that sense, I think that what we would see is Hezbollah trying to do even more. I don't think Hezbollah has been holding back because we've been degrading their capabilities. But I do think that Iran wants Hezbollah to hold back so that if Iran is attacked, Hezbollah can attack directly. Because at the end, they're right on the border. They're in Lebanon. And what we're uncovering right now in the kilometer two that Israel is acting inside Lebanon is an unfathomable arsenal.

They haven't done it every day because they fired so much. So in the intercepting, we intercept in and around 90 to 95 percent. Wow, were amazing. But that means that five to 10 percent get through. And sadly, that was one like that. You learn a lesson. That kind won't get through again, but you always have to understand at the end, it's statistics. And what they meant to do was to inundate us so that the statistics would be in their favor. And our preemptive actions have meant that, yes, they are going to have these kind of successes and I hate that, but I actually have to call it out. This is not a colossal failure. It's statistics. Let's keep being with our statistics, 90 to 95 percent of intercepting all the different type of projectiles that are coming in. With Hamas, it's been over 30,000 rockets from October 7th last year.

Kamala Harris' strategy, three weeks until election day, has been to continue to refer to Donald Trump and refer to, obviously, January 6, just this week.

I thought, in fact, what you heard yesterday in Erie and the advertising that goes along withit is a significant recalibration of the message. I mean, Harris, for good reasons, mostly, has been focused primarily since she entered the race on reassuring voters that she has the qualifications to be president. She's ideologically reasonable. She's strong enough to keep them safe at the border and on crime. What's been lost, and I think, in that period, in particular, if you look at that big, you know, swarm of interviews she did on the podcast and \"The View\" and Howard Stern and the Univision Town Hall. What's been lost is a consistent message about Trump. And I think the way you can gauge that is that his retrospective job approval has been steadily rising to the point where it's higher than it was at any point when he was president. And I think pollsters in both parties agree that's because voters are remembering his presidency primarily through the lens of what they don't like about Biden's presidency, inflation and the border. And the other aspects that go along with electing Trump and putting him in the White House have sort of faded from view. And I think that what you saw last night was Harris beginning what I suspect will be a sustained effort to remind people that there was a reason that when people were actually living through that economy, his approval rating never reached 50 percent which that a lot more goes along with electing Donald Trump than just the idea that the price of eggs is lower. So I think all of those, it is important by itself, not enough, but I think significant that his vulnerabilities can reenter the campaign dialogue in the campaign's final weeks.",

So she's down a little bit among the blue collar whites, right, without a college degree, but she's up probably a little bit among college educated whites. And the result is that among whites, she's basically in the same place, somewhere between 41 and 44 percent of the white vote on a national basis. Where she has suffered erosion, Bianna, as you know, is primarily among non-white voters where she has lost ground among Hispanic men, to some extent Hispanic women, and also among black men. And the geographical implication of that demography, those demographic trends, is that Biden first and now Harris are holding up better in the Rust Belt paradoxically, that are more preponderantly white than they have been in the Sun Belt states, that are more, you know, more diverse. So Georgia, like Arizona, looks like a tough road for Harris, and that she can really not afford any meaningful decline in her non-white share of the vote. You know, Georgia, she's still right there in polling, but she, in all likelihood, is going to have to match what Biden did last time among black voters. Not clear if she can get there given the level of economic dissatisfaction. Whereas in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, the black men who have been a problem for her are only five percent of the electorate and she can offset it elsewhere more easily.",

After that, we saw the Prime Minister of Canada, his Foreign Minister, his Security Minister come out for an unprecedented press conference and accuse India directly, agents of the government of being involved in the so-called vast and violent criminal network. Listen to Trudeau. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In their response, the Indian government said it strongly rejects these preposterous imputations and ascribes them to the political agenda of the Trudeau government that is centered around vote bank politics. It adds that it serves the anti-India separatist agenda that the Trudeau government has constantly pandered to for narrow political gains. And I have to remind everyone that, look, the largest Sikh diaspora resides here in Canada. And for that reason, it is highly political. But the Trudeau government saying categorically that these allegations are serious. They involve officials, diplomats from the Indian government. And when they refuse to cooperate with this investigation that they decided that they had to lay bare the evidence that they have. I will say that, look, beyond this spat between Canada and India, this really is going to be an issue for allies around the world, allies of India, as India becomes more ambitious, more confident. It has also become much more belligerent in terms of what it sees in its national interest. To that end, Trudeau had a conversation with Keir Starmer, the U.K. Prime Minister, as well as Melanie Joly, Canada's foreign minister, spoke with Antony Blinken. There's an indictment pending in the United States regarding Sikh separatism and, again, allegations that perhaps the Indian government was involved, as well, in the United States in some kind of activity. This is to be continued, but needless to say. This is something, you know, with really without precedent when it comes to two allies again and their relations.",
