It's the second deadliest U.S. hurricane and it is prompting feverish efforts to find those still missing and get basic services to some areas that are still in dire straits.President Biden got an aerial look at some of those hard-hit communities in North Carolina yesterday. Today he will view parts of Florida and southern Georgia that were also damaged. CNN senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak is joining us now. Kevin, the president is increasing federal disaster funding. Tell us about what he promised both residents and officials there as he was looking at this just enormous amount of damage.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The president announcing that the federal government will cover 100 percent of the cleanup costs not only in Georgia but across a number of states who have been impacted by this storm.And, you know, it's pretty rare for a president to spend two days in a row touring storm damage from the same disaster. And I think it gives you a sense of not only of the magnitude of this massive storm but also a window into how President Biden and Vice President Harris are looking to blunt any criticism that they're somehow absent from this crisis. And so we -- that started yesterday. The president getting a very clear view from the air of the destruction in western North Carolina. That was kind of the 10,000-foot view. Today he is really zooming in, getting onto the ground in Florida, in Georgia. The place he's visiting in Florida is where the storm actually came ashore. One estimate of the town, Keaton Beach, says that 90 percent of the homes have been wiped out. Then it's onward to Georgia where flooding has been a serious issue. And certainly, President Trump will want to hear from the residents of those communities of what exactly their needs will be. And those needs are pretty great and certainly, they want to see the federal government responding to what they're dealing with. Yesterday, President Biden announced that he was deploying 1,000 active-duty troops to help with the recovery effort. To help with the assistance and cleanup. But, of course, this is going to cost a lot of money. President Biden put the estimate yesterday in the billions. And we heard from the Homeland Security secretary that FEMA will run out of money if another storm hits this year. And certainly, we know that climate change is making these storms wetter. It's making them faster. It's making them stronger. And President Biden addressed that yesterday as well. Listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's because, of course, they have prepositioned a lot of these resources on the ground, whether it's bottled water, whether it's tarps, whether it's meals.But the issue is getting to these places, and that is an issue in some ways for the state governments to try and clear these roads of debris, of the knee-high mud. These towns are so isolated and that is part of what is making it so difficult to get this assistance to the people who need it. That is part of what these active-duty troops who are being deployed from Fort Liberty in Fayetteville, North Carolina to these states is to try and clear out some of these areas in order to get the assistance to the people who need -- who need it. The other issue that I think will be a task for the federal government in the days and weeks ahead is trying to reimburse people who are needing to rebuild their home -- who are trying to rebuild their lives. That is one of the key duties of FEMA at the end of the day is to try and provide the money that is necessary for people who have essentially lost everything in this storm. And so when you talk to people on the ground -- and I know our reporters have spoken to people in some of these isolated communities who are wondering where exactly the federal government is in all of this -- part of the reason they're not necessarily seeing FEMA on the ground yet in some of these communities is because it's so hard to get to. But that isn't necessarily due to a lack of an effort. The FEMA administrator, Deanne Criswell, remains on the ground in North Carolina. President Biden says that he's asked her to stay on the ground there until these recovery efforts are completed. And in states like Florida where this storm came ashore, the task will really be to rebuild some of these homes, rebuild some of these communities. And so this is all sort of what President Biden is trying to oversee with these two days of visits.",

Of course, this is important not just for restoring normalcy to the communities but also just in the more immediate term -- getting aid to where it needs to be and getting responders to where they need to be.We're deploying a number of tools. Our folks are in the FEMA command center. I had a chance to be there and get briefed by teams from all of the affected states before briefing the president a couple of days ago, and since then I have continued to get updates. What we're seeing is there are tools we have that can help. We have, for example, a routing assistance hotline that responders can use to find out our data on where the routes are available and if the normal routes have been closed off. But you've got to understand in some of these rural communities and mountain communities these are places where if a bridge gets taken out the next nearest bridge might be 20, 30, or more minutes away on a good day. As far as the interstate, the miles of closure are down below about 40 miles from 100, so definite improvement there. But parts of I-40 -- North Carolina's DOT is telling us that at best -- the best case scenario, it is months before they are permanently restored.",

Obviously, when there is a strike, that means the parties could not come to terms in time.In this case, the parties means the ILA -- that's the dockworkers and their union -- and what's called USMX, which is a consortium of employers really largely driven by the ocean carriers -- the big shipping lines that move these container ships. And we have been engaging the parties on all sides urging them to come to the table and get to a deal. We think that economically, they are not so far apart that they can't bridge these differences, especially when you consider that this is a very, very profitable industry. So what you have with the dockworkers is they're looking at the shipping profits, especially over recent years -- post-COVID. Just one shipping company had, I think, a five-plus billion dollar stock buyback program. There's another shipping company where a single shareholder -- just one owner -- one guy saw his net worth increase by over $14 billion in a one-year period. That, by my rough estimation, is a multiple of the entire wages of the entire East Coast unionized workforce collectively in that same year. And it happened to be a year where they actually did not get a raise under the last contract. So what the workers are saying is look, we've been out there -- they were out there during COVID. Many of them lost their lives going to work during COVID at a time when they couldn't Zoom to go into work -- and we kept getting those goods moved around our country. They want to participate in those profits. And there's clearly a deal to be had where these very profitable shippers -- shipping lines remain very profitable.",

The administration has been pushing to make sure that there are options. That there is more American-made energy. That there is more American-made clean energy.

And you account for the strike of almost 200 ballistic missiles into Israel from another region might open a third front.But I think Israel will certainly strike back and it will be more than just a proportional response. They will strike hard into Iran and I'm not sure what the targeting is going to be. But, yeah, the Biden administration continues to say we've got to have restraint because we want to hit the right targets. We certainly understand Israel's desire for self-protection against continued attacks inside their territory. But at the same time, the intent is to keep this from spiraling into a regional conflict. And I think the United States might get involved not only with air defense equipment but with fighter jets in some ways if these kinds of attacks continue to come into Israel. So I think we have to really balance the approach to this. To answer your question, which I've kind of avoided, will there be restraint? There may be some. The Biden administration is trying to get that restraint to refrain from a regional conflict.
