And there are definitely still a lot of questions about why this Secret Service agent shot at those three people attempting to break into a government vehicle. But this incident really also highlights the severe uptick in crime all around Washington, D.C., where in fact, over the past year, motor vehicle theft is up 98 percent.So here's the statement we've gotten from the Secret Service saying, on November 12th, that was last night around 11:58 p.m. in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., Secret Service agents encountered possibly three individuals breaking a window on a parked and unoccupied government vehicle. During this encounter, a federal agent discharged a service weapon and it is believed no one was struck. That's from Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi. Now, he continued to say in his statement that the people trying to break into that government vehicle, they immediately fled the area in a red car. And then a regional lookout was issued to supporting units. So the Metropolitan Police Department right here in D.C., they're helping to investigate this. And the Secret Service spokesman says that there was never any threat to the Secret Service protectees. And a source, in fact, has confirmed with our team that the agent involved in firing that weapon amid this attempted vehicle break-in is actually assigned, of course, to Naomi Biden's detail. She's the granddaughter of the President and First Lady, also the oldest daughter of Hunter Biden. She does live in Georgetown. So, of course, that's why the government vehicle was parked in that neighborhood, why a Secret Service detail was there. The first Lady's office at this point this morning, declining to comment on this incident. But, you know, John, this is certainly an ongoing investigation. There will be more details that come out. Also questions about why the Secret Service agent did fire this weapon amid this break in. But also likely more details to come out about the attempted break in itself. The Secret Service saying, of course, there wasn't any threat to Naomi Biden. But still a lot of concern developing about this incident happening just before midnight overnight. And, of course, three suspects, at least three suspects likely still out there, still being searched for by Metropolitan PD and others. John?",

But other times they won't so, you know, if you're a professional criminal in Washington, D.C., you should be adept at recognizing a law enforcement vehicle. They'll have the little lights behind the grill and sometimes on the dashboard.That's a question because it matters if they think it's a law enforcement car. They may think there's weapons inside, particularly if it's a federal law enforcement vehicle. That could actually be part of the threat. If they broke the back window and that's where weapons were being stored, that could be a deadly physical force threat to the agents. But they're still sorting through that.

The IDF saying this morning that it killed 21 Hamas fighters embedded among civilians near the hospital entrance. And this just into CNN, a U.S. official says Hamas has a command center under the Al-Shifa Hospital with fighters regularly clustered in and around the facility using fuel intended for the hospital. Officials from that hospital tell CNN that there is no fuel left to run the generators. All operating rooms are now closed. And the hospital director warns that if patients need surgery, they will die. We want to warn you, the next couple of videos that we're going to show you are very disturbing. In a desperate bid to keep babies from the neonatal unit alive, the hospital has wrapped them in foil and placed them next to bowls of hot water. And a warning, the next video here is also very disturbing. In the courtyard of Al-Shifa, a graphic scene playing out, bodies piled up, left discarded to the elements. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. MARGARET HARRIS, W.H.O. SPOKESPERSON: The staff, they can hardly move in the corridors for fear of being shot. They aren't able to bury the bodies in the courtyard. They even describe things like dogs arriving and eating the bodies because they cannot go out into the car park to bury the bodies for fear of being shot. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We were just hearing about that right there. Let me just read you this latest CNN report as you locate that on the map. A U.S. official with knowledge of the American intelligence says Hamas as a command node under that hospital and uses fuel intended for the hospital. And its fighters -- and the fighters regularly cluster around that hospital.So that information from a U.S. official as we're getting new video from the IDF of the Al-Quds Hospital, that's a hospital nearby. It's no longer operational, but there are still people inside waiting to be evacuated. And you can see in this footage from the IDF what they have circled and identified as a terrorist with an RPG launcher at the front door of the hospital going in and out of the hospital. So, General, if you will just talk about this. Talk about how Hamas uses these structures and how that complicates Israeli efforts in the region. GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, this was a long developed plan by Hamas to use international laws of land warfare against the Israelis to be able to bring global pressure against the Israelis when they retaliated. So the tunnel network has been built according to all the information that's been made public so that its centered node is under these hospitals. This is where the nexus of the tunnel network is. And Hamas did this deliberately. Now, from the Israeli perspective, they are under international law. So they have to protect humanitarian facilities. They cannot bomb hospitals. They have not bombed this hospital, but they do have the right to self-defense. And they are going to have to go into these hospitals and get into those command nodes. Maybe the command nodes will have been evacuated by then. But there is a fight for this, and there is concern about this by the Israelis to try to avoid the global implications of what they're doing, but they're still bound by the laws of land warfare. So you have one side that's legally trying to deal with an enemy. You have the other side which is cynically exploiting international law to put its own people at risk and use them as hostages.

The causes of her death still remain unclear. But a couple things to note about who she was, as you noted, she was a former federal judge and prosecutor. She was first appointed to the bench, the federal district court in New Jersey by Ronald Reagan and later to the Third District appeals court by Bill Clinton.And little is known about the deepness of the relationship between Donald Trump and his sister. While she never spoke out publicly, critically about his presidency, his niece and her niece, Mary Trump did release audio recordings of his sister talking critically about Trump while he was president. We have still not heard from the former president on this death. But again, this is still a developing story as we learn more details that she passed.

Right now, the courtroom is seeing an entire promotional video of the Trump Organization, the assets that they own and the history of them dating back to the 1900s. Don Jr. on the stand called his father an artist when it came to real estate, saying he sees things that other people don't see. Now, the state's attorneys objected to this, saying, does this somewhat jokingly, does this fit within the statute of limitations? And the judge sided with the defense, saying he would allow this video to continue playing, saying basically he doesn't want any issues from the defense that he didn't give them their fair shot and there'd be a retrial in this case.So this video is continuing to play as we speak, taking up much of the testimony of Don Jr. so far. Prior to this, though, Don Jr., did talk about his role within the Trump Organization, saying when his father became president, he and his brother Eric served as sort of asset managers of the company. He was handling more the bigger deals at the company, and his brother handled more of the day to day. That's sort of a light hearted feeling, I have to say, for we're hearing from the courtroom reporters in there. At one point, the judge said, welcome back to Don Jr. when he was on the stand. And Don Jr. basically said that he would say he'd be happy to be there, but he didn't want to be perjured by the attorney general. So there is some joking going on while he is there on the stand. Now, listen, we haven't gotten into the nitty-gritty of this case, which is those financial statements, right? We do expect that to happen within this testimony of Don Jr., certainly, as he's getting questions from the defense, there is a little bit broader capability to answer those questions. Not yes and no's like he had to do when he was on the stand for the state's attorney. So we're waiting to see that. But, John, right now on the stand, I can tell you that we're hearing more about Trump Organization and all the assets that they have right now.",
