      "sentences": "And a very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I am Paula Newton in for Isa Soares. Tonight, a hostagerescued from the tunnels inside Gaza is now in stable condition and being assessed by medics in Israel. What we're learning about the complex military operation that led to his rescue. Then, Russian air and drone strikes pummeled targets right across Ukraine for a second day. Now, Ukraine's President is promising to retaliate. Plus, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is accusing the Biden White House of forcing his company to censor its COVID-19 content during the pandemic, those details just ahead. Now, after spending nearly 11 months in the hands of Hamas, an Israeli hostage is now back home in the arms of his loved ones. We begin with a rare moment of joy in the midst of a war which still has no end in sight. Israel's military released this video showing Qaid Farhan Alkadi just moments after he was rescued from a tunnel in Gaza. Israel says commandos carried out a complex operation, but wouldn't give details -- and Israeli military official though does tell CNN Alkadi was alone without Hamas captors when he was found. Now, Alkadi was transferred to a hospital in southern Israel where doctors say he is now in good condition. Now, he spoke on the phone with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a short time ago. Mr. Netanyahu's office says he told Alkadi, quote, \"I want you to know that we do not forget anyone just as we did not forget you.\" Alkadi's family literally ran -- you can see them there, ran to greet him after they got the news. They had been so desperately praying for. His brother was all smiles as he spoke to reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so many other hostage families like this family want to see -- want to see a deal done and bring out all those -- all those hostages who have been suffering for so long. This is -- for this family here, it's something they could never have anticipated and expected. And of course, the reality is, it's going to take a long time to settle in.

But he said, you know, we believe in God, we believe whatever God decides is, you know, ordained and we accept what God decides. But there's no doubt that the Bedouin communities here really feel that they are living in essence as second- class citizens. And you know, that feeling that they have within the state of Israel is not an -- it's not an easy one. But on days like this, you heard Alkadi have a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu praising him, thanking him, you know, addressing him in a very sort of colloquial way, you know, in a friendly way. So, you know, I think it also represents how much they feel part of a community. But it's -- and this is what is probably -- was trying to explain. These things, the situation they're in and what they experience versus other Israeli citizens cannot really be put into one or two sentences.

This restriction of course, is in place because Ukraine's western allies are worried that if western weapons are used inside Russia, this could be seen as further escalation. Zelenskyy told us it has been very difficult couple of days for Ukraine. And this morning, Ukrainians woke up to yet another wave of Russian attacks. Five people were killed across the country. And this of course, comes after that huge attack yesterday, Russia launched its biggest aerial assault against Ukraine ever. The main targets of these assaults appear to be Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

And so, that's established with the Kursk incursion. But if Pokrovsk falls, then this opens the door to a wider Russian penetration in Donbas. And it makes it much more difficult for Ukraine to coordinate laterally across the front that it's defending in Donbas. So, it would be seen as a significant setback for Ukraine. So, the military operation hangs in the balance, nothing strategic is going to come -- militarily, is going to come out of the 400, 500 square miles that Ukraine has seized in Kursk. They'll interrupt some -- maybe a railroads, some highways, they'll capture some Russian forces, but it hasn't deflected from a Russian attack on Pokrovsk, and it doesn't threaten the Russian homeland at any strategic way. And so, therefore, it's a demonstration of force. It's a plea for assistance from the West. And what President Zelenskyy is asking for is the ability to use the long-range systems, the U.S. ATACMs and the British and French Storm Shadow missiles to   go after more strategic targets deeper inside Russia. It will serve a military purpose to drive back the ability of the Russians to use these glide bombs. It will also serve a very important political strategic purpose to show the Russian people that they are vulnerable to put pressure on Putin to call off this aggression against Ukraine.",

So, that's what I mean. Is it operationally significant? Absolutely. Because it shows Ukrainian innovation. It shows the ability to conduct offensive operations. It's a bold maneuver.

We have seen repeated evacuation orders now from the Israeli military, ordering civilians to move into so- called humanitarian zones. This has particularly affected in recent days civilians sheltering in parts of Central Gaza, who -- many of whom have had to face evacuation orders time and time again. And the reality is these humanitarian zones that they are being told to evacuate to are not guaranteed to be safe. We've seen humanitarian zones in the past becoming targets for Israeli forces who have said that they are targeting Hamas. But of course, these areas are densely populated with Palestinian civilians. And of course, what we've also seen, according to our own assessment, is the shrinking of these humanitarian zones. They are getting smaller and smaller. So, logistically, it is proving extremely difficult for humanitarian organizations, not only to carry out a safe and effective distribution process of vital humanitarian aid, but also to ensure the safety and security of their own teams operating on the ground. We've heard repeatedly now from humanitarian organizations who have been forced to pause or completely halt their operations simply because it is not safe enough for their teams on the ground.

Now, the Republicanpresidential candidate made the announcement on his Truth Social platform just a short time ago. Trump had been at odds with his Democratic rival on microphone rules, right, which led to speculation that the debate wouldn't go forward. It was a speculation that the former president actually amped up himself. Now, Trump says the rules will be the same as the CNN debate. For those of you keeping track, what that means is that the microphones will be muted when the actual candidate is not -- the other candidate is not speaking. So, that means there'll be fewer interruptions. Again, I know hard to keep track of. Thankfully, we're doing it for you. So, we will continue to keep track of that. Right now, again, though, September 10th debate still on. All right. Plastic might once have been deemed fantastic, but how about it being in your brain? Now, according to new research done on cadavers, an average of 0.5 percent of the human brain tissue is now plastic. Scientists found as much as 30 times more plastic in the brain versus other organs like the kidneys and the liver. Research showing there's been about a 50 percent increase, that's a lot, in fact, on the number of tiny shards of plastic found this year compared to 2016. That wasn't that long ago. CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard has been followed -- been following this fascinating and yet very disturbing story. OK. Plastic in our brains. The headline speaks for itself. But what's happening here? And is it harmful?",
