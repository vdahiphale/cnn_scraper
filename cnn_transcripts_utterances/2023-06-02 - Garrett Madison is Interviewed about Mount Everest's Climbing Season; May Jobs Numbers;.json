A Napoli sherpa abandoned a climb to save a Malaysian man who he saw clinging to a rope in an area that's known as the death zone.

And that is the most we've seen since January of this year. And the jobless rate going up to 3.7 percent, but going up for a really good reason because a lot of people, more than 100,000 people, entered the job market. So, they're out there trying to get work. And so that means the jobless raise rises a little bit.So, let's look at the - the graph of that jobless rate. You can see, it's been in this trend of 3.4 to 3.7 percent for months and months and months. That is historically low. That is a tight labor market. That means that there are workers who are able to find jobs if they want one. In fact, there are more - there are more job openings than there are workers to fill them. When you look at jobs added, that number, that 339,000, I told you it was the best since the beginning of the year. But the prior two months behind me, you can see, those were revised higher as well. So, the tally here, since the Fed started raising interest rates 14 months ago, we have added 5.1 million jobs. And it was in almost every category you saw job growth. Maybe flat in manufacturing, but everywhere else. In offices, in hospitals, in bars, in restaurants, in hotels, adding jobs here in this economy. And so for some context, in 2019 the average monthly job gain was 163,000. And that was a strong economy in 2019 before the pandemic. We're running twice that rate right now, you guys.",
