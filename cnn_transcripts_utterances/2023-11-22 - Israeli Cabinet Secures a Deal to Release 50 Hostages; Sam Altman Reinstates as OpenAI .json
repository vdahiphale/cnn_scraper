I'm Rosemary Church.The Israeli cabinet has approved a deal that will see the release of at least 50 hostages, all women and children, held by Hamas in Gaza for 46 days. The government overwhelmingly backed the deal after a six-hour long cabinet meeting that one official said grew tense and emotional at times. In exchange for the freeing of the hostages, Israel will pause its air and ground campaign against Hamas for four days. Hamas says 150 Palestinian prisoners, also women and children, will be released from Israeli jails as part of that deal. Qatar delivered the proposal following weeks of continuous negotiations. and now says the humanitarian pause will be announced within the next 24 hours. Hamas says the deal involves the entry of hundreds of trucks carrying aid, medical supplies and fuel into Gaza. And earlier the Israeli Prime Minister's office said the deal was set to include Red Cross visits to hostages that are still being held in Gaza. The Israeli government says a detailed statement will be sent to the families of hostages who are now anxiously waiting to find out if their loved ones will be among the dozens set to be released.

But this all comes as the administration, the White House, has been in constant contact with leaders in the region as they have been working through these negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that President Biden himself had gotten involved and that he believed the president had improved these negotiations. The president had spoken with the emir of Qatar twice last week. Qatar, of course, acted as a key mediator in these talks between Israel and Hamas.
