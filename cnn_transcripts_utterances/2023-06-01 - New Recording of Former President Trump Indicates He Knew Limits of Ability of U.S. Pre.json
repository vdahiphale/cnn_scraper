We had the Vice President of Trust and Privacy talking about that. And now the question is, what more can be done to protect them?LANCE ULANOFF, U.S. EDITOR IN CHIEF, TECHRADAR:  Again, when you have these cases, which started in 2018 and are just wrapping up now, a lot has happened in between. I have gone to a lot of Amazon events where a huge part of it is about security and privacy, constantly. But then they do something like Sidewalk, which uses all the devices and creates a little mesh network. And they initially did it and didn't tell everybody that they were sort of opted into it and had to say, no, OK, you guys don't have to be a part of that. So Amazon is learning. By the way, with the Ring thing, what happened there, they bought that in 2018, right? So after this had happened and, of course, Ring again, oh, let's put video cameras throughout the house? What's that going to be like when thousands of people can see the data and we don't really have -- they didn't have encryption. They didn't have two-factor authentication.

CNN has not listened to the recording, but Special Counsel Jack Smith has it, and sources describe it as an important piece of evidence in the possible case against Trump. Here's why it undercuts his argument that he just declassified everything, and it shows that he knew he wasn't supposed to share sensitive information with others.
