      "sentences": "Well, Danny, the president was briefed earlier this morning on the horrific incident in New Orleans. The White House says that it is also in touch with New Orleans Mayor Cantrell, and that the FBI is already on the ground in New Orleans offering support. We expect that Biden will be briefed throughout the day as newinformation is available, and the White House has said that it is also available to provide its support to local law enforcement as this situation evolves. Now, President Biden is here in Wilmington for a family event. He came here after a vacation post-Christmas in Saint Croix in the Virgin Islands, and we expect that he'll be departing for Camp David in just a couple of hours. It's unclear whether that still remains his plan, but as of right now, the White House has not communicated any change of plans for the president. Reporters could get an opportunity to shout questions at Biden when he departs for Camp David, so he could have an opportunity to speak on this matter. And that's coming up in just a couple of hours' time. Now, we know that Biden was last in New Orleans back in September. He held an event at Tulane University to announce new funding for his cancer moonshot program, a partnership with cancer researchers at Tulane University and at the time, several of his longtime advisors were also traveling there with him. He has very close ties to the city of New Orleans, his longtime infrastructure coordinator, Mitch Landrieu, was the mayor of the city. Cedric Richmond, also a longtime adviser to the president from New Orleans, as well as his budget director. So he has very close ties, as do many White House officials, to the city of New Orleans. But at this time, we know that Biden has been briefed, will continue to be briefed throughout the day, and we are awaiting any news on any potential statement by the president or whether he will take questions on this -- Danny.",

Now, we have a little bit of sound from our affiliate WVUE, from a witness from the site. Let's take a listen.

Juliette, talk to me about the FBI coming in and now investigating potential IEDs, potential improvised explosive devices. They didn't say that they had -- confirmed that they'd found one, but they are looking at this as a possibility.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So IED is a very broad term. And to the extent that what's -- what likely happened is in the car, there are things that could be explosive. There are lots of things in cars. It's a pickup car. We don't know what the perpetrators employment is.And so they are going to call it an IED now. That's what we would call the federal nexus. That's why the FBI is in charge, because we don't know the intent of the driver. So that's the second question. Now, is this term terror, terrorism, intentional violence? Look, overall, any rational person would look at this and say, this is terror. This is terror on an American city a few hours after the New Year, ten people dead. It's a party atmosphere. Someone intentionally evaded security precautions, also had a gun, shot two police officers. That is different than the legal term terrorism. To bring a federal case that requires a motivation that is related to a political intent. And we don't know what that is yet. So I think part of, you know, lots of things are going on. So my role is just to try to explain why does this seem confusing? Is, is that to bring a terrorism case in federal court, you need an intent that's related to political violence. We don't know if we have that yet. So I think the federal and law enforcement spokespeople are trying to just simply focus on what in fact happened, an IED, potential guns, and, of course, the use of a car as a weapon of mass destruction on a city that that was celebrating, and has a big celebration tonight as well, versus the legal case that may eventually be brought against this person and who this person is. And is he dead? Is he in custody? We don't know that yet. And so, all of that has to wait for the 11:00 a.m. New Orleans time press conference. FREEMAN:  And again, much of what you're talking about specifically because the mayor came out really, unequivocally saying this was a terrorist attack. And then the FBI later in that same press conference from about an hour ago said this was not a terrorist event. I want to actually go now to the scene in New Orleans. We have CNN affiliate WDSU, Cassie Schirm, with perspective from the scene. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "And we have breaking news on this developing story from CNN's Evan Perez. We can now report that the suspect in this New Orleans attack is dead. That's according to a federal law enforcement official telling CNN's Evan Perez.The suspect in this tragic both shooting and car attack is dead. That's just in to CNN. And this has been a big question because we had heard from local law enforcement and local officials on the ground in New Orleans earlier that there was this suspect in this pickup truck, but we didn't hear the status of this suspect until now. Getting this new information again from CNN's Evan Perez through federal law enforcement officials telling CNN the suspect in this New Orleans attack is dead. I want to bring into the conversation, CNN's Ryan Young. Ryan, you have that new information that the suspect is, in fact, dead. But I also wanted to get your reaction to that raw report, really, from that reporter on the scene. And it's striking. You see, the coroners van sitting in front of cameras to the entrance of Bourbon Street, presumably to not only do the hard work that they have to do, but also to block the view of potential carnage that's left behind there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. Danny, let's take this in two parts. When you think about that massive scene, you not only do you have the evidence that's involved here, you're going to look at shell casings and you're going to be trying to find any sort of physical evidence on the ground. Then you have the carnage of dead bodies there. And on top of that, you want to make sure you pay the ultimate respect to them while gathering that evidence.And with the state and the FBI involved, a lot of times they bring in a digital scene recreated, and they'll take pictures of the entire scene so they can do that later on in court and be able to show and illustrate exactly the path the truck was going through. And then how many people were hit. But so many times when you have a situation where bodies are hit, you will find evidence 100 yards away because of the force of the vehicle. And then what it does to the human body. So just the idea that an F- 150 was used in this, and then it was steering through a crowd of people, and you can only imagine the folks running online. Some of the videos that have been spread are just hard to watch and hard to talk about. When you talk about the suspect, I was talking to a state source since the last time I joined you, and it did seem like we were going to lead to this information, with the suspect being dead, and as he -- Evan Perez was able to confirm that. But they were doing an abundance of caution from what I was getting from one of my sources to make sure they had the suspect that they were looking for. So there's a lot of evidence that they're going to obviously have to go through. They're going to have to take pictures of that truck and then go try to figure out, where did this truck come from? Did the person plan to be there? Was this, you know, this is such a big event. And when you think about New Year's Eve as a person who's been down there before, there's hundreds of people who lined those streets all the time. And then you add the fact that you have two of the biggest college football programs down there for the Sugar Bowl. You can just only imagine the amount of people that could have been down there. But this, of course, happened around 3:15. The drones were also deployed last night from the New Orleans police department. That's something. So I'm wondering, were they able to follow this truck, especially after the shots were fired through the video cameras, through officers watching it after exchanging fire? Hopefully at that point. And then did they were able to track him down and then ultimately end this? I'm sure they're also going to try to figure out that the suspect tried to shoot himself, so it'll be interesting to see. Did he commit suicide or were officers able to take him out? So these are all questions that we'll be trying to figure out over the next few hours. Of course, there's 11:00 news conference, so hopefully we'll get some more information then as well.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Travis. So we just had a second explosion here in the French Quarter. They screamed fire in the hole a second time, and they detonated what sounded like another type of explosive device. You see some people from special operations and the bomb squad working right down the street. I think photojournalists define cage has zoomed in on them right now.So again, just to kind of set the scene here, the FBI alluded to the fact that there was an IED type -- type device that they were investigating because they feel like the suspect may have had that when he came into the French Quarter to do the harm that he did. [08:55:00] A state police trooper called in a suspicious device. We were cleared off of Bourbon Street. We're on Dauphine right now in Orleans. About five minutes ago, we heard the bomb squad scream fire in the hole, and we heard what sounded like a firecracker going off. And just about 30 seconds ago, or about 30 seconds before you came to me, we heard it again. Another fire in the hole and another detonation, which sounded like a firecracker going off. These aren't huge detonations. Some of the residents that that live here are actually out watching right now following what's going on. There were people on the balconies earlier, but again, because of this investigation leading to potential IEDs in the French Quarter, we have seen police doing massive sweeps here with the gloves, searching trash cans, searching under cars, everywhere here in the French quarter, teams of police officers -- we showed you that live on TV coming through looking for suspicious packages or anything out of the ordinary. They seem to have found one right on the corner of Bourbon in Orleans, right by the Tropical Isle Bar, which is a huge landmark for people wanting to party during Mardi gras, New Year's Eve. Other events in the French quarter. But again, we have heard two small detonations from the special operations RV that came onto the scene down the street that you're looking at right now, and we'll continue to follow and monitor the situation here.",

      "sentences": "I will find it very interesting to find out what that really is versus what it seems to be at first blush, in part because we have that witness a short while ago talking about this man shooting from inside the car, as if he didn't even get out of the car, unless this was a case of somebody working with him or this person coming earlier and leaving things there.I'll just be very interested to find out if that's exactly what they think it is. We've had many cases like this in the past where things are found, and authorities have to be very, very cautious. So if they see anything that looks like it could possibly be threatening, they have to treat it as if it's a real threat. But we will -- we will find out. I'm just thinking about the sheer number of people that they have to manage on an event like New Year's Eve. It really is quite remarkable. And that makes a big difference here. Remember, this is a town that routinely for Mardi gras takes in a million people, doubling the size of the metro area for jazz fest takes in a half million people this past year, with the Rolling Stones being there, huge, huge, huge crowds. The police there do a lot of work to prevent this sort of thing from happening and to keep alert to these sort of things. And I will point out when this event happened, you can bet your life there were police all over that road, because that's what happens during big events. And yet they couldn't stop it.",
