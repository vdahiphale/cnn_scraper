It's just past 1:00 a.m., there's a crowd of mostly young people that have gathered here to protest the COVID measures in China. They've been chanting, \"no to COVID tests, yes, to freedom\". And this is happening in Chaoyang District, this is where the center of the COVID outbreak is in Beijing where they've urged all residents to stay at home. So it's really unprecedented that we're seeing such a large crowd of people here. A lot of the folks as well, you can see they're holding these white pieces of paper. This is a symbol of anti-censorship, and we also saw a protest in Shanghai. We saw protesters also hold these white pieces of paper. Now, in this district as well, around here, there are many foreign embassies, including the American Embassy over there. So notable that they chose this site for these protests. Now, this protest has been going on already for several hours. It's very late, you can see the policeman right now is telling me to move back a little bit. But there's a large police presence here. Actually, on this whole row, a whole row of police men, but it is a peaceful protest so far. You could hear the cheering, the chanting, cars are also driving by frequently, they're honking in solidarity. The folks here don't look like they're going anywhere any time soon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But what that means is you don't have the same kind of herd immunity, and you also have relatively low levels of immunization, particularly among the older population in China. So this means that if they open up now, it has the potential to, you know, crush the public health system and lead to -- and lead to a lot of deaths. And that really -- if the party wants to change course on the policy, that creates a problem.

To show solidarity with Iranian protesters, the U.S. Soccer Federation altered the Iranian flag online.

In Kyiv, people are getting electricity in 2 to 3-hour chunks of time. The mayor of Mykolaiv in southern Ukraine says they've lost their water supply after a Russia strike on a pumping station in neighboring Kherson. Meanwhile, Ukraine says Russian forces may be about to withdraw from the Zaporizhzhian nuclear power plant. But Russia is pushing back on that. Our Sam Kiley brings us the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The head of Ukraine's atomic energy industry has said that Russia, he believes, is planning to leave the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which it captured back in March. Now, his allegations have got very little substance behind them other than, he says, information he's picked up on the internet and indications from people on the ground in the city nearby that the Russians appear to be preparing to make some kind of move. But this should be seen, really, in the context of the ongoing psychological war between the two countries who are also, of course, involved in a physical war because Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is a major strategic asset for the Russians. At its peak, it supplies 20 percent of the power of the electrical power into the Ukrainian energy structures. Those very structures that have been under relentless attack by Russian cruise missiles for the last month, resulting, for example in the city of Kyiv, the capital, having to reduce its energy consumption they hope by 60 percent, just to keep the essential services functioning. So it's very unlikely that the Russians would give that up. On top of that, it is an important military base for them. They've been using it and its environment to shell against Ukrainian positions, Ukrainian civilian towns on the other side of the Dnipro River. And if they were to evacuate it, it would become a bridgehead for any kind of future Ukrainian operations to try to recapture more of the southern territory, with the ultimate eye on the Crimean peninsula, which of course, Russia illegally annexed back in 2014, 2015. But this is all coming at a time when the Ukrainian government has also announced that 32,000 civilian targets have been deliberately hit by Russia. They're saying that outside of the frontline, only 3 percent of the targets struck by Russia could be described as military. Now, of course, this is again a Ukrainian-claim that would have been hotly refuted by Russia. Sam Kiley, CNN, Zaporizhzhia. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Russian government is saying they're not going anywhere, they're staying there. Truthfully, what I'd have to say having dealt with the Russians on many occasions, you always have to be critical of what the Russians say, officially. You never really know what they're going to do. But having said that, what I'd say is, with the recent actions by the Ukrainian forces in the western side of Kherson Oblast and the potential for them to -- an eventual river crossing into the eastern side of that Oblast and into Zaporizhzhia. I'm sure that the Russians are re-positioning their forces in better defensive positions, because they can't afford another overwhelming attack by the Ukrainian forces like they've experienced over the last several weeks.",

There has been a lot of fighting going on around that area and, in fact today, just recently, Ukrainian army announced that they were able to hold Bakhmut today under some very intense shelling by the Russian military. But there are several other cities and towns close to Bakhmut which basically oversee key road intersections, key bridges over rivers in that eastern part of the country, that Russia has also attempted to attack. The reports by Ukraine saying that Russian forces have been able to secure one of those cities, but Ukrainian forces have fought back. What -- you have to really imagine in this fighting in the eastern part of the country, it is a lot like the World War I trenched battlefield that we -- that historians look at. And it's going to go back and forth based on the shelling and the unbelievable disaster that's being caused by artillery tools between Russia and the Ukraine.

They have suffered morale problems, they are without food, without clothing, without warm clothing particularly. They continue to fire artillery, but that's about it. Ukraine on the other hand seems to have exceedingly high morale after a couple of their recent victories. They have been receiving Winter clothes from most of NATO forces, Canada, is an example, gave close to 500,000 suits of warm weather clothing to the Ukrainians. They continue to have support, not only in clothing and food and ammunition, but also in modernizing their weapon systems. Russia does not have that. They -- if they're worried about food and clothing, that tells me they're not worried about getting weapons to the frontline. And that could be certainly problematic for the Russian forces. The key in any kind of Winter fight, Christina, is the discipline of the force.

But they also talk about some of the poor conditions that they say that the newly mobilized are in. Like, for instance, in some cases, having to buy their own food, poor housing, and the like. Now, Vladimir Putin has already reacted to all this. In fact, last Friday, he met with soldiers mothers. There was some criticism of that meeting with some larger organization, also representing the wives and mothers of soldiers, saying, look he is talking to a hand-picked group of people there. There are others that have much wider criticism of Russia's mobilization efforts for Ukraine. And they feel that they're not really being heard. And nevertheless, in some cases, there has been cases where differences have been made. In fact, there were some mothers groups that, for instance, have called on some students to be allowed to go back home and continue their studies. And apparently, in some cases, that has actually happened. However, at that meeting last Friday, which was widely played here on Russian media, Vladimir Putin also made very clear that while he appreciates the sacrifices that the mothers are making, that he will also not be deterred from his course. He, for instance, said that he believed that the annexation of Donbas is something that should have happened a lot earlier, the reunification with Russia, as he called it, and he also said that he believes that Russia is not fighting against Ukraine, but is fighting against those who are arming and bankrolling Ukraine.

Now we have these protests. And now there are indications that the zero-COVID policy may stay in place for a little bit longer. Right now, there is no clear roadmap, and that's why traders are having such a tough, tough time and that's why markets are feeling a little bit rough right now.",

Today's Cyber Monday is expected to be the biggest online shopping day of the year. A lot of items on the list, electronics, toys, and smart home and exercise equipment. Well, CNN reporter Matt Egan joins us from what some considered to be the epicenter of holiday shopping, New York City. Matt, these strong numbers, Black Friday numbers, indicate perhaps that the consumer has been quite resilient to the inflationary pressures we're seeing at the moment.

And it means that Brazil are through to the knockout round with a game to spare. They haven't conceded a goal yet, so they'll be really, really thrilled with that.
