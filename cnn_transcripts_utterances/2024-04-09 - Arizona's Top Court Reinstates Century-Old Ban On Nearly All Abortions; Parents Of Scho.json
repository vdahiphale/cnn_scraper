BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Tonight, Arizona's Supreme Court ruling the state must enforce a near-total ban on all abortions, the controversial law which dates back to the Civil War, before Arizona even became a state. The court saying, quote, physicians are now on notice that all abortions, except those necessary to save a woman's life, are illegal.

We'll continue this conversation, to be sure.I want to get some analysis right now from CNN Political Commentators Alyssa Farah Griffin and David Axelrod, and Katie Watson is also joining us, an expert on medical law and ethics. Katie, let me start with you. How does the law originally from 1864, as I said, before Arizona was even a state, and which sat dormant for decades, come to be in effect now? [18:10:08] KATIE WATSON, LAWYER: Well, it's a decision that the Arizona Supreme Court made, and it's a grave mistake. The Arizona legislature in 2022 passed a 15-week restriction, which, by all legal analysis, would supersede that earlier Arizona law. The Supreme Court argued that the legislature hadn't explicitly repealed that Civil War era law, and therefore it, the incredibly more restrictive ban, stood. That just doesn't stand to reason, because the Arizona legislature could have repealed the 15-week ban after Dobbs and said, yes, we want to go back to a total ban, and it did not. So, this is clearly an instance of the state Supreme Court imposing its political view on the people of Arizona rather than respecting the already restrictive, legislative view. The court had argued that the legislature was hampered by Roe versus Wade. Clearly, in passing a 15-week ban, nine weeks before viability, it did not perceive itself to be following Roe versus Wade three months before Dobbs came out. That's how this comes to be. And the people of Arizona may reverse it. But let's center the patients. Arizona physicians were providing abortion care for over a thousand patients a month between Dobbs and now. So, even if it's resolved in the election, that's over 8,000 Arizona women who have to go out of state for care.",

And so it's -- you know, we should not forget the substance of this. And I'm glad you started off with Katie.But as a political matter, this could not be more of a disaster for the Republican Party. Yesterday, Donald Trump said, well, it's up to the people in the states decide, let the states decide. Well, here you find what happens when you let the states decide. In Florida, a six- week ban is in place. I guarantee you in both those states, if you put that on the ballot, and they will be on the ballot in the form of initiatives, that a majority of voters in those states do not agree with those policies. So, I think what this does is it puts a battleground state more in the leaning D column than the leaning R column, because I think there's going to be a massive turnout in November for a constitutional amendment in the state of Arizona, because the voters of Arizona now have a demonstration of the fragility of abortion rights in the post- Dobbs era.

We've been fighting one way for 50 years with no plan for enactment when something like Dobbs comes down.This is a political loser for Donald Trump, but he knows it. And just yesterday, by saying this should go back to the states, I think the thing he wanted less than anything was to have a state like Arizona come down with such a draconian ruling just one day later. But the onus is going to be on the Democrats to message that to voters, to be able to say this is a direct result of Donald Trump's policies from his first term. And a little part that gets confusing here is we've now seen three Republican states that have voted to elect Republicans, but also voted on ballot initiatives or constitutional amendments to protect abortion rights. So, Democrats have to be able to link the two, or you could actually see people breaking for Republican candidates, but also to uphold abortion.",

I think that what you're going to see are Republicans scrambling in that state to try and obviate the impact of this ruling because it is a killer, but I don't think you can unring the bell. You can't unring the bell. I think Kari Lake is more fragile as a candidate today than she was yesterday. I think Donald Trump's chances in Arizona have been impacted negatively.

It has the right to security, but no one is entitled to security at all costs. The unacceptable levels of human destruction have to be -- require accountability.

Hamas has put people in danger. But Israel is making choices that exacerbates that danger to unacceptable levels and refuses to allow for any of the humanitarian aid that could mitigate and at least protect those who were innocent in this entire process.

What Joe has started over the last four years will continue to grow, but it's going take more time. Elections are a snapshot. And we know that voting is not magic. Voting is medicine. And the evils and the ills that we see coming out of the Republican Party, from the refusal to expand Medicaid in states like Georgia, to the near-total abortion bans that you see covering 16 states, the attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion that are trying to strip economic access away from so many millions of Americans. Those are all things that will get exponentially worse under Republicans and can only get better if we return Joe Biden to The White House and we make certain he has a Congress to work with him, not against him, to make improvements for folks like Mozn and for anyone in the United States who wants more for their lives and their families.",

An appeals court judge refusing today to push back the start date so Trump can challenge the gag order imposed on him in the case.Let's break it all down with CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. Elie, Trump has been rejected now twice in two days for these last- ditch delay tactics over the gag order and the trial venue. Does Trump have a chance with the full appeals court?",

All it does is prohibit Donald Trump from making public comments about witnesses, about jurors, and about staff and their family members.He is still allowed to aggressively criticize the judge, the D.A., the case against him, as he has done over the past week. So, Donald Trump will have a chance to brief this to the full appeals court, but I don't think he's got any chance of winning. And important to note, Wolf, whatever happens with this gag order will have no impact on the trial start date, because even if Trump somehow succeeds in getting this gag order overturned, you just carry on with the trial without a gag order in place.

People don't like to think of themselves as biased. But the trick is looking at some of those other indicators. What types of organizations is the person a part of? What types of political activity have they been involved in to decide whether a potential juror can truly be fair for or against Donald Trump, depending which side you're on here, D.A. or defense.",
