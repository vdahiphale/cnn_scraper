That's an argument that the victim's family says it's just not possible. As you said, 35-year-old AJ Owens was killed on Friday, north of Orlando in Ocala, Florida.Authorities said that Owens knocked on the door of a neighbor who the family says is white, who minutes earlier had an issue with Owens' children playing outside. The victim's family said that the woman had previously harassed the children calling them racial slurs, and the N- word. Owens' mother said her daughter wanted to know why the woman kept an iPad that the children left behind and why she threw a pair of skates at them. Here's more about what the victim's mother said.

And the more we see, the more the planet warms, the more pollution goes up there, the better scientific instruments get, the more we're seeing that old predictions vastly underestimated the pace of climate change. And you can see on the charts. Now, it's looking like it went down by about 12 and a half -- just over 12 and a half percent per decade. And this is hugely important because of what's known as the albedo effect. That is the reflection off of that white ice up there in the summertime to flex a lot of the sun's energy away from Earth, meanwhile the open ocean absorbs it which brings a lot more heat into the -- our ecosystems.
