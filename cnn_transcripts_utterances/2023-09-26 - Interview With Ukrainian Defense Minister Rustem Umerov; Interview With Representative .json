I'm Christian Amanpour in London. A reset for Ukraine for the war in Ukraine and for the country's military machine as they settle in for the long haul against Russian aggression. President Zelenskyy has appointed a new defense minister to mark this shift. He is 41-year-old Rustem Umerov. And he got the job just 20 days ago. In his first and exclusive interview tonight, Umerov tells me his ministry is getting a reboot. And there will be new emphasis on building up Ukraine's own arms industry as the U.S. and European allies start to wonder how long and how much more they can provide. He tells me the counteroffensive is making progress. And I began by asking him about the fate of Russia's Black Sea fleet chief, who was shown on video by the Kremlin today, a day after Ukraine claimed to have killed him in an attack on Crimea. Minister Umerov, welcome to the program. Can you confirm that the head of Russia's Black Sea fleet, Viktor Sokolov, is in fact dead or alive?",

It has been all the centuries, for the last 300 years. It was expansion. It was brutality. It was killings. So, Ukraine is defending the values that people share. The independence, the sovereignty, the human rights. So, we want our people to be happy and be a part of the European Union and NATO. So, that's why we defend our own values. President Zelenskyy has given the world class -- I would say, the example of resistance. And it gives a big hope to people, an example of courage, an example of retaliation and resistance. So, these values are shared by most of our peoples and with most of our partners. So, this war should end only with one condition, when we regain all of our territories and we regain and free people. Why? Because, as I said, Russia should be taken accountable for what it caused to the world order. And that's probably the answer when it will finish.

You know all about what this is meaning to the country and to national security. Do you see any risk of any sort of shortfall in support for Ukraine? REP. PAT RYAN (D-NY): Absolutely. What we say here in Washington and in the Congress matters. Our reputation as United States of America, no greater friend, no worse enemy. That is at risk when you see the MAGA extremists signaling that they might back away from our democratic ally, fighting for their territorial integrity, as you heard so compellingly from the defense minister, fighting for our shared democratic values. We have to have their back especially at this moment. So, not only are there material concerns where we could see resources and dollars and weapon systems at risk, but our sort of strength of the support in terms of the optics and the perceptions has already been weakened by folks like the Gaetzs and others that want to turn our backs on our democratic ally right when they need us the most.",

Because when President Biden talks about -- and what we've all declared as rightly unprecedented investment in the climate and in new jobs aligned with green jobs, he says, the clean energy economy should also be a win-win for auto companies and union workers. When I think, climate, I think, jobs. When I say climate means jobs, I mean good paying union jobs. I wonder whether that story is not being told.

In my district alone, north of New York City, two hours, we are adding thousands of good paying union jobs literally as we speak here, building clean energy facilities, building infrastructure, roads, bridges, broadband. That takes time. It doesn't happen overnight, but we are seeing that. We are seeing wages finally come up for working people, for union members. In New York, we're seeing union enrollment increase as people see the importance of that collective bargaining and the strength and power of working people. So, I think that we are finally headed in the right direction here in the country with record bipartisan infrastructure investment, with semiconductors and the Chips Act, with the Inflation Reduction Act and clean energy, it all comes together and it gives directionality to the United States economy where we are going to be back leading across the globe rather than being on the receiving end of the economy that has really hurt workers for decades.",

So, this is about actually positioning workers and auto companies to be -- and continue to be, as American, in the lead in the next evolution of transportation. And so, those transitions, of course, require new investments, it require some change.

It's typically meant for critical turmoil, climate crises, earthquakes and has been used a number of times since 1990. This is the most recent iteration of that. I mean, Venezuela is a very unique situation in the migration flow. We have about 7.2 million Venezuelans who have left the country since the critical crisis there. And they have mostly actually gone, to the credit of those countries, to about 16 Caribbean and Central and South American countries. After COVID hit, which took a big economic toll on many of those countries, they started migrating to the U.S. So, it's a more recent crisis for the U.S., but it is a big crisis.

And some people rightly say that have -- they go and invoke asylum. In that regard, our border today is totally different than it was even 10 years ago. The border challenge in the past was about single Mexican males sneaking through the border looking for work. Now, we have large number of people from countries all over the world with families who come and seek asylum. Now, asylum is our commitment both on the international law and national law, which means that we can't remove a person who claims that they are in fear of facing persecution. But those persecution grounds are very narrow. They are to be on the basis of your race, religion, social group, political opinion. And I think that's where, I think, our problem is, that our asylum system is broken. It just is backlogged. It's about -- it takes years for people to get their process claimed and their claim processed. So, that means that people who actually deserve it don't get it for a long time. And people who don't deserve it are clogging the system, which then becomes the pull factor for people to come.

And so, they tried to create more order to the system. In the process, what has happened is that they have allowed a large number of people to come in an orderly way, which then has downstream effect on cities and states, that's what we have seen exhibited in the last year or so. So, I think they, at some point, were on the right track, that we really have to allow people to come in an orderly way. They have tried to establish this CBP app One through which people can get appointments. But then I think there are -- that have tried to disincentivize people to come between ports of entry. Unfortunately, the numbers are so high that even between ports of entry, we are now letting in about 30 percent (ph) people who have arrived there. So, we have to really get the asylum system going in a robust way so that we screen people at the border and letting people to process their application inside the U.S., not before a clogged immigration court system, but before asylum officers who are citizens of the USCIS, and that process could take months as again CS (ph), and that's worth trying.",

What made this chapter different is that they came in the visible, targeted, concentrated way initially driven by political module by southern governance. And then, we realize that New York City has this consent decree from 1981 which provides housing for everyone as a matter of right. Now, that has never happened in our history before. Immigrants who would come, they have organically integrated into the social fiber and economy of the city. This -- and they are generally seen as a net benefit, almost all benefit and no cost, because they provide their labor, they provide tax contributions and they take very little in public benefits. In this case, it became a drain on the public benefits because of housing. And New York is one of the world's most expensive housing markets. So, it became -- you know, New York City mayor says, we are going to spend about $12 billion in the next three years, and that is a very large ticket.
