CNN has now learned the special counsel has subpoenaed Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows who was witness to Trump's actions during the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. CNN's Evan Perez has more details now from Washington.EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Donald Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has been subpoenaed by Special Counsel Jack Smith who's overseeing two investigations of the former president. The subpoena is seeking documents and testimony related to January 6 and Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. And the move to subpoena one of the Trump's most senior aides in addition to the recent subpoena of former Vice President Mike Pence, marks the latest significant step in this sprawling investigation. Smith is investigating Trump's handling of classified documents after he left office. And while the subpoena is related to January 6, Meadows also may be of interest in the document's investigation. He played a role in the months and months of discussions going on between the National Archives and Trump's representatives over returning government records that were in his possession. Special Counsel subpoena could also set up a clash with the Justice Department and meadows and Trump over executive privilege. Now he was a witness to Trump's efforts to pressure officials in the States and in Congress to help him remain in power despite losing the election. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But he only won about one-third of the college-educated Republicans. Now he was able to make that work, because as I said, the two-thirds of college Republicans who weren't that keen on Trump never coalesce behind a single candidate.I think once again, those college-educated Republicans will have to be the basis for any candidate who wants to seriously challenge Trump. And the question is whether anybody can consolidate them better than the group like Jeb Bush and John Kasich and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz did in 2016. On paper, you would say that Ron DeSantis is better positioned to do that, and also better positioned than any of them to cut into Trump's blue-collar strength by strengthening -- stressing some of the same cultural issues, but you've got to get on the field and actually run against Donald Trump.",

People here say it is like a war zone, but no bombs went off here, and in seconds a historic city was wiped. Wherever you turn, there's something happening, it's the constant sound of diggers, heavy machinery on every street removing the rubble.Police and emergency services are everywhere. You have ambulances screaming past, heavy military presence, and families searching for and retrieving the bodies of their loved ones. You see people sleeping on the streets, tents cities for the displace that are popping up everywhere. And with fires burning for people to keep warm, the smoke, break dust, and all kinds of fumes here make it so hard to breathe. One man telling us this is what the apocalypse would look like.

It claims Russia has taken great efforts to not only relocate but also re-educate those children, and in some cases train them for military service. The report was produced by the conflict observatory at the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, with support from the U.S. State Department. It found more than 6,000 children from infants to teenagers, have been in Russian custody at some point during the war.43 facilities were identified in the network, stretching across Russia and even into Russian-occupied Crimea. At least 32 of those facilities have apparently engaged in what the report calls systematic re- education efforts that expose children to Russia-Centric Academic and Cultural Education, and in two cases, military education. Russia is dismissing the report as absurd. We'll CNN's David McKenzie has the story of one Ukrainian woman willing to travel to Russian-occupied territory to be reunited with her daughter. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Weeks ago, we first met Tetyana Vlaiko in Kyiv, in a shelter for displaced families, all of the mothers here separated from their children by the trauma of war. TETYANA VLAIKO, UKRAINIAN MOTHER, (through translator): Emotions overwhelmed me when Lilia (PH) left. When I realized what was happening, it terrified me. All I wanted for the best for my child at the time. MCKENZIE (voiceover) Her 11-year-old daughter Lilia, stuck in a Russian camp in occupied Crimea, all the lessons are in Russian. At first glance, the retreats seem like any other summer camp, but the loyalty expected from Ukrainian children is crystal clear. Part of what a new Yale University study calls systematic education efforts. But Tetyana and Lilia's story begins a year ago, the hometown of cosigned fell quickly to advancing Russian troops. Within days the occupiers began a campaign to ratify the population. Often, coercing thousands of parents like Tetyana, to send their kids to the camps. But when Ukrainian forces took back her son in November, Tetyana's daughter was on the wrong side of the front line. MYKOLA KULEBA, SAVE UKRAINE: We provide rescue mission for children who were abducted, and now in Russia Federation, and in Crimea. MCKENZIE (voiceover) Mykola Kuleba, the founder of Save Ukraine, declined to say exactly how they negotiate the entry into enemy territory, just that the mothers can't do it on their own.",
