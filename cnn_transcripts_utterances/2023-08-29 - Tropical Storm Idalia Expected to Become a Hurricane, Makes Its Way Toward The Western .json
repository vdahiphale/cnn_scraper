Though 30 states have a higher minimum wage, the current federal minimum is $7.25. There is also something called a tipped minimum wage, meaning if a portion of your pay comes from tips, from customers, your employer can pay you less than minimum wage. The current federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13 per hour. So servers and other tipped workers can be paid $2.13 per hour by their employers with the understanding that they`ll likely earn enough money through tips to get them to at least the state`s minimum wage. But there is a movement by some U.S. states to get rid of the tipped minimum wage and eight states have abolished it. One fair wage is a group pushing for businesses to be required to raise the pay of these employees to the state`s minimum wage, plus tips. But some business owners worry this could end up hurting their bottom line, ultimately driving up prices for customers. Some employees worry that the new initiative could actually decrease their overall take-home pay. CNN`s Business and Politics Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich is looking at the changing landscape of tipping.
