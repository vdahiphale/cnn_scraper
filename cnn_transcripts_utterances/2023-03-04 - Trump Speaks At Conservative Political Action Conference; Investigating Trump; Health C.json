Trump crushed the politician seen as the biggest rival for the nomination, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 62 percent to 20. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now from the CPAC. I guess, this was not a big surprise that Trump won the CPAC poll and it's not much of a surprise what he is saying right now, I guess.",

It would have actually been a huge surprise if he didn't win the straw poll or win it by a huge margin because CPAC, which used to be the kind of elite conservative meeting, particularly for people who wanted to run for President in the Republican Party has become much more of the Trump show. So had he not won the straw poll, it would have been significantly embarrassing for the campaign.Now what we're hearing from Trump right now is a very us versus them themed speech. He is making a pitch to be the President once again, and the line that just got a standing ovation was probably the biggest reaction I've seen so far was him saying he wanted to obliterate the Deep State and he's taking on the establishment, including the establishment Republican Party. I know it's not that surprising. We've heard it before, but it does seem to be a lot of punches at the Republican Party. He said that they were no longer going to be the party of Paul Ryan, Karl Rove, Jeb Bush. He also pushed harder for isolationism saying they were no longer going to be the party that gave money to endless wars. This is a different stance than so many in the Republican Party. And so far, he has not called out any other major potential 2024 presidential nominees, however, we did hear him say something that sounded like a very veiled threat at Ron DeSantis. Take a listen here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we saw that in the speech that he's giving right now. He is taking his message to Democrats and what he calls fake news and RINOs, Republicans In Name Only and as we mentioned, naming Republicans specifically and that's a real shame. But as you said, Jim, it's very early. We've got virtually a year until Super Tuesday of the big 2024 election, and a lot can happen. And the good thing is, we have a good bench. We have strong names that are ready to hit the trail in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, and connect with voters.

And CPAC, even though they like to talk about that it is a diminished CPAC, is still where the energy where the enthusiasm rests within the largest voting bloc of the Republican Party and that is a room that belongs to Trump. And the problem that I think the Republican Party is facing is they want to separate who is at CPAC and the people that are CPAC, from the rest of the Republican Party. Well, who is the rest of the Republican Party? Let's look at Republican leadership in Congress -- Kevin McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz -- so many of the people that genuflect at the altar of Donald Trump. There is no difference there. So yes, this is one of the biggest assets that Joe Biden and the Democrats have going into the 2024 election, because they're running against a party that is doubling down on failure, the MAGA agenda failed in 2018, 2020, 2022.

We have Tim Scott.We have other big names, Mike Pence is there as well, that made the conscious decision not to associate themselves with CPAP, because they're hearing from many rational Republicans across the country that are ready to turn the page and ready to look past Donald Trump and they're going down there and connecting with what I see is a strong movement within the Republican Party that is out to look for a candidate that reflects the policies of Donald Trump, but not the personality of Donald Trump. And there's a big movement out there. There's money behind it, there's momentum behind it. And there certainly is a strong desire, even from social evangelicals who are strong on board with Donald Trump, Republicans are ready to turn the page because they realize that while he may win a primary, it will not be possible to win a General Election with that type of rhetoric in the future.",

They don't know how to run against Donald Trump without standing up with a real backbone to back up everything that supposedly they're saying in a veiled way, you can't do that with any credibility to the American people without saying the words Donald Trump.

FOX News has also not had on Trump's since September, which is a long absence for the former President of the United States, a Republican who's announced his candidacy for 2024 to not be on FOX News. They also have not had any of his family members who are surrogates to the President on the network, including Lara Trump, who they dropped. She was formerly a contributor at FOX News. They dropped her in December because of her father's campaign and what they see there as a conflict. So Trump hasn't been on the network, he's attacking the network.
