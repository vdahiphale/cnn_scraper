He has figured out that he can use his legal problems for advantage on the political trail to perpetuate this narrative, which is very effective in the primaries, at least, that he's a victim, and that seems to be the objective here. The problem is that you don't get to the White House just by succeeding in the primaries. You have to get into the general election.

It's not inherently racist to call someone by their own name, true. But there's no other reason for Trump to highlight Haley's South Asian ethnicity than to hope that voters will see it as different. And some of them even might see it as inferior and that is the point. Just as Trump emphasizes former President Barack Obama's Arabic middle name, Hussein, which is commonly used in the Muslim world, although Obama himself is not a Muslim.

Trump has been consistent, suggesting the U.S. has become a \"dumping ground\" for everybody else's problems when he said Mexico was sending rapists over the border when he launched his 2016 presidential campaign, saying an Indiana-born judge overseeing a class action lawsuit against the now defunct Trump University couldn't be impartial because he was Mexican, saying just a few weeks ago that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of America.\" This racially charged behavior goes back decades to the 1980s, with his full-page ad calling for the reinstatement of the death penalty for The Central Park Five, four black and one Hispanic teens who were convicted in a brutal gang rape. They were later exonerated, and in 2014, New York paid them a $41 million settlement. But in a 2016 statement to CNN, Trump refused to acknowledge the men were innocent. They admitted they were guilty. He said, \"The police doing the original investigation say they were guilty.\" He said, \"The fact that that case was settled with so much evidence against them is outrageous. And the woman, so badly injured, will never be the same,\" he said. And in 2019, it was much the same. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Trump is using an insidious rubric that we have seen before, one that he honed as the birther-in-chief, questioning whether former President Obama was born in Kenya instead of Hawaii.
