But then certainly when it comes to what happened last night with these outside agitators, outside aggressors, it does -- it does -- I think we were really waiting for the university to do something. And what I would say is that the university's non-action in terms of what it really means to keep students safe but also their non-action when it comes to the encampments' demands is ultimately what allowed the violence of last night to take place.

And that's why we're seeing him make statements like deal or no deal. We will go into Rafah as he tries to mollify the right flank of his government. But while that may be the position of the right flank to say, you should not go into this deal, that could potentially lead to an end of the war that would see some 30 Israeli hostages released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the majority of the Israeli public actually supports that. According to Kan News (ph) here in Israel, a poll from them shows that a majority of Israelis support a deal that would see the release of 30 hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners; 54 percent of Israelis support that position. Now as it relates to a deal that would see the release of all abductees in exchange for a complete end of the war and the release of thousands of terrorists, on that front, you have slightly less support but still 47 percent of respondents, a strong plurality in Israel in terms of the respondents to that poll. So that just gives you a snapshot in time, of course. But it does give you a sense of the kind of opposing dynamics here in Israel. A majority of the public wants a deal, wants a deal now. But the key members of Benjamin Netanyahu's government, those who are keeping him in power, are opposed to this latest framework. The question is, if that government collapses, we've already seen a member of the opposition, Yair Lapid, for example, say that he would come in as a white knight to save this government, to keep it in power.

So this clearly plays right into Trump's demagogic strategy. We saw a very interesting interview that he did with \"Time\" magazine this week, where he refused to rule out violence after the election, depending on the result, Trump is creating this strongman image. He is trying to convince a majority of Americans or enough to win the election that the country is spinning out of control, not just at home but the war is on the march abroad, that there's a possibility of a third world war. He did try this in 2020, you'll remember, after the Black Lives Matter protests, after the murder of George Floyd by a white police officer. At that point, Biden managed to win the election. He managed to convince Americans that this picture that Trump was painting, this American carnage -- to paraphrase Trump's first inaugural address -- wasn't the reality about the United States. Biden's the incumbent. A lot of people are angry. They are discontent with the state of the country. And the economy it could be that this argument is a more successful one for Trump this time around. And that's why a lot of people are saying, well, sometimes the president needs to control the narrative of a developing and dramatic event.

The big question here is, will the prosecution retry this case? Because the highest court in New York actually ordered a new trial. But its at the discretion of the prosecution. And the response was on Friday that we will do everything in our power to retry this case. But it's left to be unknown, to see if they actually mean that because it's sort of ambivalent in one sense. But what the highest court of New York said was there was just too much evidence that the judge put into the case and the trial of Harvey Weinstein. And by the time it got to the jury, he'd lost constitutional rights, the right to a fair trial, due process rights, so many that are embedded in the Constitution. Because you are supposed to be tried on the charges before you.
