This is \"Connect the World\" from your Middle East programming hub. Also happening over the next two hours, Vladimir Putin looking for arms and allies rewards Kim Jong-Un with a statesman's visit to Pyongyang, the first in over 20 years. What else will he give Kim in return? Boeing CEO faces Congress for the first time amid new claims from another whistleblower breaking just hours ago. And raging fires in California and New Mexico as extreme weather continues to rock the United States. Well, markets in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. And if the futures, markets are any indication, these markets will be flat on the open, keeping an eye on that back with those markets as they open at 9:30 Eastern Time. Pageantry in Pyongyang to welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin, he is due to arrive anytime now for his first trip to North Korea in almost a quarter of a century. The two countries have become closer in recent years as North Korea is believed to be sending Russia weapons for the war on Ukraine. They both deny that. Well earlier Mr. Putin made a working visit to Siberia. CNN's Mike Valerio is in the South Korean capital of Seoul watching this for us and the pomp certainly impressive. What's the real purpose though, Mike, of this trip?",

And youknow we understand that at the end of the song and dance Becky, by the end of the day tomorrow that they're going to sign something some sort of document that enhances their words that strategic partnership that they both reached in September of last year. But what that partnership is how tight these ties become, or how strong or how much more strong and strengthened they become. That is an open question. And, you know, we were talking last night on the air about this treaty between Moscow and Pyongyang in 1961, July 6th of 1961. That's a mutual military assistance agreement. But you know, Becky, from reading the tea leaves from the Kremlin and speaking of more North Korea experts and listening to what has been said, as we wait for Putin here on the Korean peninsula, there are more and more experts who are saying you know what, based on what Moscow was saying, we think this could be more of a small deliverable tomorrow in the economic realm. So what more what both countries want starting with North Korea, they need help with their missile technology, satellite technology, food aid, energy aid, the quote, unquote prestige of standing with a leader like Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-Un, standing in Kim Il Sung square, seeing that huge parade that's going to happen tomorrow. Russia wants more and more ammo to prosecute its war with Ukraine. But you know, Becky, very interestingly, we went back to comments that Vladimir Putin made not too long ago in recent days, where he thanked, yes, thanked South Korea for not sending lethal munitions to Ukraine. And because of that, North Korea, experts are saying, you know what, we don't think that Moscow is going to go all the way with a mutual military assistance agreement when this is all said and done. And we don't think the experts are saying that Russia is going to give up its missile and nuclear technology to Pyongyang. So listen to what's been said on that point.",

We're going to trade on an elevated level and, you know, forget the dollar, we are moving to our own transaction system right here, strengthening their alliances.

Survivors did say that it did happen as many were sleeping, the 15 who were killed, as we understand it from the hospital officials. In this, the majority were women and children. So six miners we understand. And also we know a number of them were women. They were taken to two separate hospitals, as well as a number of injured within these two strikes. Now this was in Nuseirat. It's an area that has seen significant fighting in recent days. In fact, it's the area where just a week last Saturday, the four Israeli hostages were rescued from by the IDF. The devastation they left behind according to hospital officials and Gaza officials was at least 270 killed.

CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Two questions to you, really President Biden the special envoy is in Lebanon, he was in Israel yesterday, and he is called this escalation serious.

Now, we know that, for instance, here in Lebanon, theintermediary for the United States when it comes to Hezbollah is Nabih Berri, who is the Parliament Speaker and the head of the Amal movement and political party that is a political ally with Hezbollah. So he was the second person that Hochstein met here in Beirut today after Joseph Aoun, the head of the Lebanese army. And clearly messages are being passed now, whether Hezbollah actually is going to listen to the Americans in terms of the Americans wanting to de-escalate is a very good question. And also keep in mind that as much as the United States has limited influence on the course of events in Lebanon, in particular, on Hezbollah. And also has the same problem with Israel, with a prime minister, who we've seen time and time, again, has defied the American requests in Gaza. So therefore, both sides are sort of a wild card when it comes to United States efforts to try to calm the situation down on the border. Prime Minister Netanyahu is under intense pressure, not only from the hardliners in his cabinet, from the opposition as well in Israel, who are demanding that Israel take firm action against Hezbollah in the South of Lebanon.
