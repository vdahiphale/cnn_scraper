I'm Anna Coren.Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, high risk rescue, the IDF rescues four hostages during a raid in central Gaza, but as Israel celebrates the reunions, Palestinians mourn the lives of those killed during the operation. Details on how the mission unfolded, ahead. Well, President Joe Biden praises the U.S. relationship with France as he celebrated it during a state visit. We're live in Paris on the president's final day of his trip. And at the French Open, Iga Swiatek wins her fifth Grand Slam in an emotional final. Details as we look forward towards the men's title match today. An Israeli military raid on a Palestinian refugee camp led to emotional reunions for four newly freed hostages and their families, but there are lingering questions about the deadly toll of the rescue mission. Well, this was a scene at a hospital in Israel where the four hostages met with family and friends for the first time in eight months. The Israeli military released this video showing some of the reunions. The IDF says the rescued hostages are in good medical condition, but were taken to hospital for medical exams. Israel says the operation was carefully orchestrated and took several weeks of intelligence gathering, but it could have been called off at the last minute. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, SPOKESPERSON, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: Precisely because of the challenges that operating in such a densely populated area poses, but also because of the threat and challenge and possibility that one or the other because they were held in different locations could have been if we would have been revealed on the approach, then the Hamas guards that were watching over the hostages could have executed them. So, it needs to be conducted in a way which enabled us a swift approach, a swift and rapid interception and engaging the enemy as we breached the entrances to the -- to the two places, to the two locations simultaneously, under a 360 degree threat.

And we have to warn you, the video we're about to show you contains disturbing images. Well, hospital officials in Gaza say at least 236 Palestinians were killed and more than 400 injured. The IDF says the number killed was less than a hundred. Well, CNN cannot verify the numbers from either side. One man who was there says people did everything they could to save lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We tried to get ambulances, but no one can enter, as it was already a military zone. Dogs were eating people's remains. We pulled out six martyrs, all torn up, children and women. We risked our lives to get them to the hospital. The soldiers told us to go back, but we had to continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They'd even built models of the apartments that the hostages were being held in in order to prepare, in order to train, and it had been -- they'd been planning this for some time. They'd indeed planned to go ahead on earlier occasions, but had aborted those plans because for various reasons.And so, it was only at the last minute really that the operatives involved from the Shin Bet, from the counterterrorism unit of the Israeli police, and also from the IDF. It was only at the last minute that they knew that things were a go. And so, at around 11:00 in the morning, local time, there were airstrikes in the refugee camp there, the forces moved in simultaneously to both apartments because they didn't want to rescue one hostage and then the other people guarding the other hostages to get wind of it and then do something which would hamper the operation. So, simultaneously, these two apartment buildings, they rescued Noa Argamani with little fuss. They took them by surprise, the IDF says. They said that a fierce gunfight ensued when they tried to rescue the three men who were being held in the other apartment. And then, when they left those two apartment buildings that they came under heavy fire, including from rocket propelled grenades, and that they were given further cover by air strikes from the IDF, that the hostages were protected by the bodies of the of the officers who had rescued them. They took them to helicopters that were waiting for them on the beach, and then flown back to Israel for an emotional reunion with their families in the hospitals, and really bringing a huge amount of relief and joy. Four Israel in a war that really hasn't had many of those moments for the country.",

On Friday, Russia's Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged, though it signaled it might raise them if inflation does not come down. And at the start of April, the country's benchmark stock index reached its highest point since the day Russia sent its troops into Ukraine in February 2022. For more, let's head to Vilnius, Lithuania, where we're joined by Vladimir Milov. He's a former Russian Deputy Energy Minister who also advised the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Great to have you with us. Many thought that the Russian economy would collapse as a result of Western sanctions, but as we can see, that is far from the case. Russia has found buyers for its oil, its natural gas and other commodities in markets like China and India. Why aren't these sanctions working?",

Actually, sanctions are working, and I'm really puzzled about all this pro-Putin bias in the Western media, which is claiming that Russian economy is thriving and doing OK.It is not doing OK. Even the governor of the Russian Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, was forced to delay her press conference on interest rate on Friday, she was waiting until Putin finished his celebratory speech about how great the economy is doing, and then she said that inflation persists, 10 months of interest rate hikes were not able to do anything about it, and she is warned that in July, they might significantly raise already growth prohibitive interest rates, because inflation is not coming down. And actually, if you listen to all the economic officials, ministers, deputy prime ministers, and heads of big business at the Petersburg Economic Forum, there's a lot of trouble. Investment is not coming in. Tax hikes recently announced by the government are significantly curbing the economic activity. There is a significant shortage of labor because of the war and mobilization. So, things are really very, very far from OK.",

What might really work is if the western countries would really seriously enforce the G7 oil price cap, because Russia has been consistently selling its oil to the international markets well above the $60.00 price cap, and it's doing so now, it really takes a serious effort to trace all these transactions, traders, refiners and shippers of the Russian oil, who are allowing the oil to be shipped above for $60.00 per barrel. That really takes a serious enforcement effort, which is not being done to the necessary extent. And this is what the G7 countries needs to do.",
