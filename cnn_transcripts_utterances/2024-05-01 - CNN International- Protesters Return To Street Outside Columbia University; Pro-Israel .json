In New York, students and faculty have now returned to the streets outside Columbia University after police remove protesters from Hamilton Hall on campus and dismantled the encampment here overnight. Columbia will hold all final exams online now, and police will remain on campus until after graduation. In California, UCLA has canceled classes after protesters and counter protesters clashed overnight. Video shows pro-Israeli protesters tried to remove the barricades around the encampment, sending off fireworks pointing lasers using pepper spray. Police, eventually arrived on the scene moving between the dueling protests. Polo Sandoval, he's at Columbia University, Josh Campbell is in Los Angeles at UCLA. Polo, let me go to you first protesters removed overnight by police at least some of them have returned with what end in mind?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you know, Jim, it was just 24 hours ago, I was observing one of those occupiers on top of Hamilton Hall, the building that you see behind me waving a Palestinian flag. Here we are today. There is now a relative calm, not only on campus, but off as well.Yes. To your point, there were some protests and demonstrations, but that's in the area around Columbia. So that means for the first time in some two weeks now, any member of the Columbia University community who wishes to participate in any sort of demonstration. They now have to do it on those sidewalks around the campus. That is because of that restricting access that was put in place after that occupation on Monday night, which means that only the students who reside on campus and those deemed as essential a personnel are allowed on campus. The president of the university, Minouche Shafik, out with the letter that she sent to the NYPD saying that she did that with the campus was describe it on the brink, which is why we saw essentially a repeat of what took place almost two weeks ago when she turned to the NYPD for assistance and clearing out that in cabinet, which would, of course, subsequently only pop up again. And that eventually led to the occupation. Today, the NYPD and also New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Jim, he said that there was certainly a factor among those arrests, the -- as he described it, outside agitators. According to the NYPD, they influence some of those demonstrators as well. Meanwhile, there is certainly some criticism that is building against the NYPD for his handling and also against a university who's called for a police presence for the next several weeks on campus.",

You could see as they walk here, they're essentially trying to repair and rebuild. They had a lot of barriers out here, plywood and the like when this group came, we saw a video of them trying to pull down the barriers.They were setting off fireworks towards this camp. There were clashes. We can see on video chemical irritants sprayed and so certainly an escalation between these two groups here. And one interesting thing, Jim, is that we didn't see a massive law enforcement presence last night. In fact, \"The Daily Bruin\", the newspaper here at UCLA, said that nearly two hours went by before you actually saw a large amount of authorities come in. That's different right now, as we pan over, you can see over here in the wings there are law enforcement officers that are staged. This is only a small, small percentage of the officers who are currently stage in this building next to us, there are dozens and dozens of patrol cars have been brought here, multiple agencies providing resources here in the L.A. area. Again, the question that a lot of them have, would we see a repeat tonight, similar to what we saw last night, something that there certainly hoping does not happen. [15:05:07] And then finally sort of pointing out, Jim, that for law enforcement, this obviously a very precarious for them to be in as well. A lot of these pro-Palestinian demonstrators across the country have been essentially ridiculing the police for being near these encampments, telling the police to go away. Of course, when violent strikes, they call the police. And so, the police are trying to walk that fine line between not having a very heavy-handed presence here, but also being on standby in case public safety is threatened, Jim.",

Of course, across the country here at UCLA and speaking about our experience on our campus, what I can say is that the encampment protest is one of the main ways that are Jewish students currently feel unsafe because it represents the ways that our university is not upholding the policies that they have instituted to make a campus a safe and welcoming environment for everybody, and to build a quality and equity for all student groups.You know, Jim, when our -- when Jewish students wanted to have a vigil to commemorate the 1,200 Israelis that were slaughtered on October 7th and over 200 that were taken hostage, they were told they couldn't use real candles. We had to use plastic electronic candles because that was the fire marshals rules. We were told our vigil be shut down. Every student group agrees to follow policies and rules to ensure that everybody feels safe, and everybody feels welcome and every can walk freely on their campus. And this encampment does the exact opposite of that and that is why our students feel so unsafe. Not to mention the many forms of antisemitic slurs, imagery signage, in ways that we've been seeing messages directed directly our Jewish students, but also just in general on our campus, coming from the encampment. SCIUTTO: I -- CNN has reported instances like that as well.

In fact, they haven't been behind any of the counter-protests near the encampment in the last week.Our Jewish students, as I said before, are looking to their campus leadership to create a safe and welcoming environment and to do everything they can to protect from antisemitism. So whoever these folks are, we don't know. We know they're not Jewish students.

MEG TIRRELL, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Jim. Florida has really been seen as kind of an outlier in the South because it did have more abortion access. And so for that reason, this change to a six-week ban from a 15-week limit is really seen as a seismic shift in abortion access in this region. You know, last year one of 12 abortions done nationwide were obtained in Florida and one of three abortions done in the South were in this state. That's about 7,000 people who obtained abortions in Florida per month in 2023. And a lot of people, Jim, have had to cross state lines in order to get abortions and they come to Florida because it's the closest state from other states that have a lot of restrictions, you know, upwards of 8,000, approaching 9,000 according to estimates from the Guttmacher Institute last year. Now, what we hear from experts is that folks are going to have to travel a lot farther up to North Carolina where there's a 12-week ban, but there's also a long waiting period there. So it's difficult to orchestrate that. They may have to go even further north to Virginia for example.

I mean, there really is an effort to drive a wedge between law enforcement and simply the act of clearing out campuses and the left. And I think the Biden White House realizes this, in which is why you don't see President Biden coming out to say anything directly because if he takes decide of the protesters will then he's alienating centrists and some of the undecideds, whereas if he condemns the protesters and he alienates like 20 percent of voters who are under 35.
