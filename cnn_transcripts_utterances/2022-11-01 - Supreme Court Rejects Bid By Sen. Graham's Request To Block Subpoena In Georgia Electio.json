I mean, what the lower courts said is that there are still some things he can't be asked about because it has to do with his legislative activity, essentially his role as a U.S. senator.So when he gets before that grand jury, which is the secret process, he can object to certain questions and say, this has to do with what I was doing as a senator, I don't feel I should have to answer that. It's possible he could still move forward and litigate certain questions in court. But it's a win for the DA. She wanted him in front of her special grand jury. She said she wants to wrap up her investigative work by the end of the year, so this works toward that timeline. And remember, she wanted to ask him about calls he made to Georgia officials around the 2020 election, including one call he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where Raffensperger thought he was trying to convince him to throw away votes, which is something Graham has denied.",

Is this a guarantee that he's going to appear and that he's going to testify? No, absolutely not. It means that they are having these discussions behind the scenes. Trump obviously has a variety of other legal issues hanging over them and there are plenty of lawyers who would say you shouldn't be putting your client before a congressional committee under oath when you have all these other potential legal problems out there.

But I do think that the broader point of Nicquel's piece is that there is a problem for Democrats among black men, even Latino men, where there is a little bit of drifting over to the Republican Party. And the reasons for that are very diverse and there are many, but I think the bottom line is those voters want to be spoken to directly by the Democratic Party. They don't feel that way right now. And there has been something about the Trump era where Trump didn't have to talk about immigration in a different way, he could still demonize immigrants, he could still say offensive things and he's still been able to make some inroads in these communities. And I don't think that Democrats have really looked at that and figured out what's going on there. And we may be seeing in this midterm cycle another cycle where there's that erosion.

At one point telling them that he's supported Brian Kemp before, supporting Brian Kemp was cool.They went over the way that Kemp handled the pandemic, something that is very familiar to anybody who has heard Kemp's stump speech over the past few months here. The elephant in the room, of course, being the former President Donald Trump who not only encouraged an opponent but endorsed that opponent heavily in the primary against Governor Brian Kemp.   No real mention of any of that today. There were a couple of mentions of the Trump-Pence ticket and what appeared to be a little joke from the former vice president when encouraging people to go out and vote early, saying you should email, you should call, you should even tweet if you need to do that, everybody kind of laughed about it. But more than half even we heard the former vice president talking about Kemp's opponent, Democrat Stacey Abrams, attempting to cast her almost as a scary figure trying to pit them against each other in manners saying that you've got to not just keep her out of the governor's mansion, but keep her away from any other higher office. This is something that the Kemp campaign has tried to do repeatedly on the trail attempt to say the Democrat's Stacey Abrams is looking to go beyond Georgia. Brian Kemp making the assessment that she potentially could even try to go as far as the White House. That, of course, is something that the Abrams campaign has said has many different undertones to it, saying that she is - said she wanted nothing more than to be governor, which of course is why this is a rematch from that 2018 campaign between them. Again, they have another hit here. We did try to ask the question as to whether or not former Vice President Mike Pence or, excuse me, or Gov. Kemp would do sort of a unified ticket thing.

In fact, just today, United airline pilots voted against a tentative contract agreement put up by the airline. Delta, perhaps the most dramatic so far. In fact, they just held the union vote yesterday. Ninety-six percent of its members from its chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association participated in this vote 99 percent of Delta pilots voted for a strike if necessary, mostly a symbolic move here. We can't underscore that enough, but Delta pilots really just want more pay, restructured pay, in some cases, and especially because the airline is reporting huge revenues for the third quarter. In fact, you can almost really say here that the pandemic recovery has really hit its peak. Things are pretty good for the airlines right now. Delta puts out this line, it says, \"Delta pilots are not on strike, so this authorization vote will not affect our operation for customers. We're confident that the parties will reach an agreement that is fair and equitable, as we always have in past negotiations.\" So nothing happening when it comes to Delta pilot striking just yet. If it does come to pass, then we may see a strike sometime early next year, but nothing happening for the holiday season.",
