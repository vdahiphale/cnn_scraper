And Silvio Berlusconi's funeral service starts in an hour. Thousands of mourners are paying their respects outside Milan's Cathedral. But first, a rescue operation is underway this hour in the waters off Greece. At least 59 people have died after a boat carrying immigrants sank. The Greek Coast Guard has managed to rescue more than 100 people so far. Local media report the ship setoff from Libya, bound for Italy. Let's get to Barbie Nadeau in Rome with the very latest.

You know, Max, I mean, we only really seem to pay attention to these stories when there are several hundred people on board and one of these boats goes down and it's visible and they'd called for help.You know, we're understanding this boat left Libya en route for Italy. We understand that how it got into Greek waters is probably a matter of wind and lack of motor on this boat. They've saved 104 people. 59 bodies have been pulled out of the water, but we're hearing the number on that boat could be anywhere between 400 and 750 people. That is an enormous loss of life if that, in fact, is confirmed. Of course, there are no passenger lists on these smuggler ships. There's absolutely no accountability whatsoever in terms of the real number. It'll just be basically the number of bodies they end up retrieving from the water. But this is all going on during, against a backdrop of negotiations across Europe right now and how to stop migration both from Tunisia and Libya. And there is talk of investing a lot of money in both of these countries to try to stop boats from coming. But the boats are still coming, Max, and there are NGO rescue ships out there trying to save them. And these boats call for help. And authorities from both Italy and Malta and now Greece end up doing a lot of the work, but it's just another tragedy among many, Max. And, you know, this is just summers basically just starting.

Maxi screens have been installed in the city's main square as thousands of people are expected to come and say their final farewell. He was a highly divisive but dominant figure in Italy for more than 20 years. We'll have more about his life and legacy later in this show. British officials now say that two of the victims in Tuesday's attacks in Nottingham were university students. The students were apparently stabbed by a 31-year-old man as part of a sprawling rampage that involves attacks with a knife and a stolen white van in various parts of Nottingham. Both students were 19 years old. One played field hockey and the other was on the University of Nottingham cricket team. CNN Scott McLean following development in this investigation. Everyone wondering about the motive here, Scott, and it does increasingly look like it was just a random attack.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so police say when it comes to the motivation, they are keeping an open mind. They say they are working with counterterrorism police, but that doesn't necessarily mean that this will, in fact, turn out to be terror related.There have been several searches at locations across the city, but no one arrested beyond the 31-year-old suspect, who was tased by police as he was taken into custody. And what makes this crime especially unusual is the sheer, a, randomness of it and, b, the physical distance between the location of each of these crime scenes. So you had two people stabbed in one location more than a mile away. You then had another person killed with stab wounds. And then a third location, you had people mowed down by a van, and then a fourth where the suspect was actually arrested. And all of these places are more than 1 mile apart from one another. So this, obviously, took place across the city and across a considerable amount of time as well. We now know the names of the two victims, both 19 years old, as you said, both students at the University of Nottingham, Grace Kumar and Barnaby Webber. Kumar was a gifted field hockey player, so gifted, in fact, that she represented England on the under 18 team. Webber was a cricket player. His parents said that he was over the moon for having been selected for the University of Nottingham cricket team. They wrote in a statement, in part, \"Complete devastation is not enough to describe our pain and loss at the senseless murder of our son. He was a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man with everything in life to look forward to. As parents, we are enormously proud of everything he achieved and all the plans that he had made\". Now a third person in his 50s, we now know his name is Ian Coates. He worked at a local school and the school put out a statement saying that he was beloved, respected, and he always went the extra mile for students. It was apparently his van that was stolen by the suspect and then used to attempt to mow down three other people, one of whom is in critical condition in the hospital at last word. Of course, the question here is why? This has left Nottingham, a city of 320,000 something people pretty shocked and searching for answers. The Home Secretary just gave a speech on this in the House of Commons. Obviously, she was asked about what we might know about a potential motive and she made clear that that question is still unanswered. But she pleaded with people not to rush to any judgment or not to draw conclusions before police have all the facts.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max. And I think the way that you just said it too churning across the Arabian Sea is a great way to say it, because this thing is moving about the same pace as you and I can walk, right? I mean, a very, very slow pace.And that means that it's got a lot of time to pick up that energy from the warm ocean waters. But also it helps kind of stabilize the storm a little bit too, because we get this upwelling of the cooler waters from down below. But still, nonetheless, we're still at 160 kilometer per hour storm. That makes it equivalent to a category 2 Atlantic hurricane for some of our domestic audience. This is tropical Cyclone Biparjoy by the India Meteorological Department. It's known as a very severe cyclone. And this continues to churn and move very slowly at a northeasterly clip at about 6 kilometers per hour. So, you can see what I mean. Basically, a walking pace of an average human. Here's the Gujarat state. There's Pakistan. This is Northwest India. Just to give you some perspective. What can we expect? Well, there are several threats, not only the wind threat, but also the flash flooding and storm surge threat, all of which I'll cover here in detail. But you can see the forecast as we head into Thursday afternoon local time. That's when we expect the worst conditions to impact the Gujarat state. South of Karachi. That's the good news because this area, of course, heavily populated in Pakistan, but the Gujarat state houses about 60 million people, one of the fifth largest states in India. And this will be impacted by strong gusty winds that will exceed 100 kilometers percent hour at times. And then once it finally moves in land, we'll see the dissipation take place, but not before creating the storm surge conditions in the India Meteorological Department calling for 2 to 3 meters above that astronomical high tide. So the potential for coastal inundation does exist as this storm starts to push in all of the moisture and the water from the Arabian Sea. Now the other threat, of course, the flooding, because the slow moving storm will produce in a rainfall totals in excess of 250 millimeters, perhaps locally, higher amounts. You can see -- I'll highlight this quite nicely for you here -- you can see in that Gujarat state, that's where we're predicting anywhere from 250 to 500 millimeters. In such a short period of time, it doesn't take much to produce that localized inland flooding. And as that storm moves inland, you can see the dissipation. But we still have our flood threat as it moves inland and brings the rainfall along with it. So Max, lots to talk about, very complex storm system. But one thing's for sure, the flooding threat will be real as the storm makes its slow progression into the coast.",

His career was marked by a series of political and financial and personal scandals, many of which landed him in court. A man with a flamboyant personality, no doubt.

No, actually, it's despite all of this that there is still this kind of affection for a figure that anyway managed to be, you know, both a politician, often because he's better than you, and some other times because he's like you. And Berlusconi often was both things. He was better the average man, because he was a self-man made billionaire.

And much of his foreign policy when he was prime minister was to actually attract Russia and Turkey into the west.But at the same time, the relations with these populist controversial figures that sometimes have been actually indicated as either his product or very close to him, sometimes the relationships were not so easy. For example, many times there have been commentators drawing a parallel with Donald Trump. And in an interview years ago, he actually described Trump as too arrogant. And when I tried to interview him about it, one of his -- one of the closest persons to Berlusconi told me he doesn't like talking about Trump because, you know, he thinks that he has a tacky taste. And Berlusconi is convinced to have a very good taste. And at the same time, he thinks that he's a ferment made and Trump is not. Then it's true that there were many, there are many common points with these kind of figures, because Berlusconi comes from the star system, which is part of the reason why it still is so popular. And in the star system applies a rule that are very different than the political system. So, for example, if a manager breaks his hotel room, he gets fired. If a rock star breaks his hotel room, it's cool. Which is one of the reasons why these kind of figures like Berlusconi, like Trump, who come from the star system, actually, they can get away with many things because different kind of categories are applied to them.
