Following Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor's visit to Israel, now you have the defense secretary accompanied by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Israel. This is a full-on U.S. pressure campaign to get Israel to move to the next phase of this fighting, to reduce civilian casualties in its fight in Gaza and to begin thinking about the next steps of the war, and also, of course, to get on the same page about what happens after and if Hamas is removed from power and destroyed in the Gaza Strip.There is a lot of disagreement between the U.S. and Israel on all of those fronts. And the defense secretary, we're told by a senior defense official, he is going to be focused today on getting an assessment from Israeli officials, a very blunt and clear-eyed assessment of what kind of progress they have made so far against Hamas and what more they feel like they still need to accomplish in this current phase of the campaign before they can move to another phase, which would be far less intense bombing, far less of this kind of all-out ground defensive. And instead, what we expect to see would be special operation raids going in and out of urban population centers, intelligence driven, something that would ideally, in the U.S. minds, cause far fewer civilian casualties than what we are seeing right now. But a lot needs to happen before we get to that point. And so far, at least, U.S. officials, Israeli officials publicly are very much not on the same page about exactly when that happens. And so today's meetings are going to be crucial to trying to get sonnet payment page and to seeing if Israel will accede to the pressure it's getting from the United States.",

There's history there, obviously, dating back to the many presidents prior to Biden, that Netanyahu has really irked. And let's be reminded of what happened with Barack Obama.That having been said, there's no other leader in the world who the Israelis can rely on more than the United States at this time. So is Netanyahu putting his political future ahead of what's needed right now on the ground in Israel for their own security and the ongoing fighting in Gaza? That is the big question. Within Israeli circles, I think it is notable that we haven't heard the word \"indiscriminate\" used again. That was one time that it was reported that President Biden used with donors in the U.S. We didn't hear that from Jake Sullivan over the weekend. It will be interesting to hear if we hear that now from the defense secretary. But there is real attention now on the divide between these two leaders, notably at the direction of where Netanyahu is taking this. I don't think much of this is coming from the United States. I don't think there's much beef with any other officials, even among IDF leaders. I think it's specifically with Netanyahu and what he's saying publicly versus what he may be saying behind closed doors.",

He didn't have to worry about the P.A. He weakened them over the years as well, though they did that to themselves, equally so.So for him to say publicly that he's boasting about not having achieved that, he's clearly speaking to his base. He's speaking to the far right within the country. He's speaking to his own party coalition and some of those really controversial members there, because if he loses their support, then he's done. You see internal polling within Israeli. And there is continuing decline in support for him, his leadership, his execution of this war.

It's the group that Nikki Haley does best with.Take a look at how much moderates make up New Hampshire, it's 36 percent. Nationally, they only make up 27 percent of the vote. And in Iowa, where there was also a CBS News/YouGov poll where Trump was well ahead, moderates only make up 17 percent of the vote. So the New Hampshire electorate is far better for her than either nationally or in Iowa. But I think here is the real question. Is winning New Hampshire merely enough? So national GOP frontrunners who won Iowa and then lost New Hampshire, which perhaps could happen to Donald Trump. Bob Dole in 1996, George W. Bush in 2000. Both of them won the nomination. So Nikki Haley has a long hill to climb. She'll have to do something historic, but the fact is at this point, she's in a better position certainly than she was a month or two months ago.",
