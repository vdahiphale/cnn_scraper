Now, I'm not one of those people who then say, well, Trump should never be prosecuted and should get a pass because of bad conduct.

And Congress has the ability to exercise oversight on this as well, and I'm confident they will.But my argument about the Justice Department is that under Loretta Lynch and Jim Comey, they made a decision that I think is completely inconsistent with what we would have done in the Bush Justice Department under John Ashcroft.
