All right, 6 a.m. here in Washington. A live look at the Supreme Court, where again, so much of the action in this 2024 presidential election is going to play out right there inside that building. Morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to be with you on this Monday morning. And this week, the rematch that the country seems to be dreading is on. Former President Trump set to tighten his grip on the Republican nomination on Super Tuesday. And on Thursday night, President Biden will deliver what could be the final State of the Union address for him, with millions watching. A pair of polls from \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" over the weekend show just how tough the road is for Biden right now, who voters overwhelmingly say is too old to run again for president. But it's Donald Trump's legal challenges that really make this race unprecedented. And the Supreme Court has sent a rare smoke signal indicating that they are prepared to rule today, and it could be on state challenges to his name appearing on the ballot under the 14th Amendment. It's going to be the first, but not the last time, that the court will weigh in on this presidential race. They have to decide whether Trump can be tried for his role in the January 6 riot at the Capitol, just as the country is set to decide whether Trump will take the presidential oath once again.

We don't have mahogany desks, and if we do, they're 200 years old and they're falling apart.\" So there's a lot of fun in this, but the reality and the more seriouspart of this is they know they need to rein in spending. And part of that is, one, a lot of Donald Trump's top people are very concerned of having a repeat of what happened in the 2020 campaign, when Trump was the incumbent. They were supposed to have this big money operation that was supposed to be one of the assets to his campaign. And then over the summer and into the fall, they really faced a cash crunch.

They spent more than $50 million on his legal expenses. So that's something that they're dealing with. They also have another fund called the Legal Defense Fund. That is what they use to pay for co-defendants' lawyers, as well as his allies who are caught up in Donald Trump's legal problems. But one thing that is new that we have in this reporting is Donald Trump himself has begun to pay for his own legal bills.
