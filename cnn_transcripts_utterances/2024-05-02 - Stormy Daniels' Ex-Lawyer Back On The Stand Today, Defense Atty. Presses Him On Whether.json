Welcome to our continuing special coverage of the Trump New York hush money trial, day 10 (INAUDIBLE) prosecutors put four more alleged gag order violations before the judge and the defense paint expected witnesses Michael Cohen and current witness Keith Davidson as the true culprits in this case, not Trump. Davidson, as you know, represented Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal and secure deals for their silence about alleged affairs with Trump in the crucial months before the 2016 election. But any effort to make them the villains and Donald Trump the victims countered by prosecutors who played the phone conversation Michael Cohen secretly recorded and CNN exclusively obtained, featuring Donald Trump taking an active role in the Karen McDougal deal.

And if you're the juror and you're going home for the night and you're replaying it in your mind, maybe some of them have heard it before. To Maggie's point, it's been out there for a while. But first, just the fact that it exists, I think, is incredibly notable. Michael Cohen's tone in the call is also incredibly notable. Trump, then kind of correcting him about the means of funding this thing, that strikes out to you immediately, that he wants it to be in cash, not \"finance.\" There's so many elements of it that if you're - just from a human perspective, not a legal perspective, that replays in my mind.

And, by the way, Michael Cohen made over $400,000 out of this scheme, which he got later in 2017 and that's the defense here. It's not crazy. And it may yet be refuted by the prosecution.
