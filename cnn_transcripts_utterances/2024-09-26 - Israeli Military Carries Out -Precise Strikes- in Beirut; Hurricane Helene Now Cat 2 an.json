Hurricane Helene could potentially reach catastrophic category 4 strength by the time it makes landfall in Florida later today. We're live there with the very latest for you. International and regional diplomats scrambling to achieve a ceasefire in southern Lebanon as Israeli strikes continue to batter the area. We're live in Tyre (ph) this hour. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

Israel says itcarried out, quote, \"precise strikes\" on Beirut. Today, state run Lebanese media says that missiles hit a building in the southern suburbs. It is an area where much of Hezbollah's leadership is based. This as the United States, France and other allies work on what they hope is a ceasefire deal or at least a plan in principle. The Israeli prime minister, who is due in the United States any minute now to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York, is dismissing the prospect of a ceasefire anytime soon. Right. Let's bring the team. Nic Robertson, Alex Marquardt, back with us this hour from Israel and New York, respectively. And we are joined by CNN's Ben Wedeman, who is on the ground in southern Lebanon. And Ben, I'm going to start with you. At the scene of numerous attacks, multiple attacks at this point, deadly attacks by the Israelis and just in the past 24 hours, more loss of life. Just describe where you are and what's been going on there. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Becky, we're in Tyre, this exact same spot from which we covered the 2006 war. And what we're seeing are very similar scenes. The hills behind us, there have been a variety of airstrikes causing great big plumes of smoke and dust to rise into the sky. And I'm hearing something in the background but I can't see quite what it is. I think it's interceptions by the Iron Dome system. And what we're seeing also in addition to these strikes is the massive disruption that has been caused by this war that began in full force on Monday, with Israel's version of shock and awe. What we saw, for instance, as we were driving here from Beirut, driving through the town, the city of Sidon, is that thousands of people have fled from the south to the relative safety of Sidon, where the schools are full of the displaced. We went to the municipality there. They basically said that this city is at full capacity in terms of hosting the displaced. So there awe essentially people just sleeping outside in the open on whatever they can find. We spoke to one woman, Hum Hamid (ph), who had walked with her two sons for 12 hours from southern Lebanon to get to safer ground. Her feet were blistered. One of her sons was sick, covered in a blanket in front of the municipality. Yes, I'm seeing some distant smoke on the horizon so, yes, I mean, massive disruption. This is just the sense of deja vu one feels here yet again, covering yet another war here in south Lebanon -- Becky.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and they are, the targeted strike in Beirut witness to that, in the last couple of hours. Thestrikes along the border with Syria, where the IDF says that these are locations that Hezbollah uses to bring weapons into Lebanon. The strikes overnight in the upper Bekaa, the strikes along the border that Ben is witness to right now, it continues full force and the projecting the image of forces part of that as well. The IDF released more video of more troops close to the border with Lebanon in training, preparations for it correct in place, in case they go across. The only way to read media releases like that from the IDF of troops training late night with a message around it is this is clearly part of either the negotiations, the pressure or what to expect, that these troops will be going across. That's part of the messaging. The messaging being read by Israel here this morning, 45 projectiles the IDF said that they counted coming from Hezbollah within the past hour. Another 40 projectiles coming from Hezbollah, landing in the upper Galilee. So the incoming rockets, missiles coming from Hezbollah today not quite at the pace of yesterday. But compare today with where we were two weeks ago. This is -- this is a massive, significant step-change. And the idea that talks that were trying to end the lower level of conflict that was going on a few weeks ago and have been going on for almost a year, that they could now draw down the massive scale of what's happening at the moment, it just seems the messaging and intent from here. And what we heard from the foreign minister, for example, saying the only thing we're going to do is keep going until Hezbollah pulls back from the border. It's very clear where the messaging is behind the prime minister, as he arrives in New York for whatever elements of diplomacy he engages in there.",

And Firas, you I know were in touch over the past 24 hours with senior U.S. officials who've been working on this plan. It does, to the point that Alex was just making. It does seem unlikely that, given the momentum that the IDF now have and the impact that they are having on Hezbollah in Lebanon, it does seem unlikely at this point that you are going to get Benjamin Netanyahu landing in New York, ready to concede to anything, let alone a pause in the fighting. I don't know how significant it is that Hezbollah at this point are still firing rockets back, including a ballistic missile over deep into Israeli territory, over Tel Aviv yesterday. So just give me a sense of what you understood to be the thinking behind this, the sort of the process for this peace plan. Have you a window? The U.S. thinks they are going to leave for this. We're well into election sort of time at this point, only 40 odd days away from this U.S. election. The window really for this Biden administration is closing at this point, isn't it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Becky, I heard Alex from New York state that the administration is striking apositive tone in public about this. I can tell you, from speaking to these senior officials that, in private, it is a very different tone. In fact, when I saw senior White House officials on Friday and over the weekend, there was this collective shrug. But the plan, which was to clinch a ceasefire in Gaza, bent on (INAUDIBLE), the deal then in many ways been prenegotiated or new security arrangement overlooking, that plan had all but collapsed. By early this week, they had this ceasefire idea, which they have been working with the French. Now it's been described to me as a Hail Mary, an unlikely situation to pan out. But the administration nonetheless feel that they need to try, given how dire the situation is on the ground. There are no illusions that Hezbollah, Nasrallah has climbed up the tree by linking Lebanon and Lebanon's fate to Gaza, refusing to cease-fire across that border unless there is a ceasefire in Gaza. And they understand that that's a very difficult thing to achieve, to decouple Lebanon from Gaza, because the entire Iranian and Hezbollah strategy from day one after the October 7 attack has been this unity of fronts. This kind of ring of fire that they've established around Israel. So for Nasrallah to concede and back away from that and sees a ceasefire arrest, ceasefire in Gaza, is very difficult to imagine. Very quickly, I'll tell you that the thing to look out for is certainly Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at the U.N. tomorrow. There are some quiet hopes in  the administration that he would offer Nasrallah the fig leaf he needs on Gaza, the climb down from that tree, perhaps an end to major operations in Gaza, declaration of victory, that things are winding down. But yes, in the background here, the administration is not hopeful.",

And frankly, those that I spoke to very much echoing what you've heard from U.S. officials. I mean, this is this is a proper outside chance. I mean, nobody really knows, nobody's really believing that they can pull this off anytime soon. The problem is, when you, when you when you talk to regional sources, the concern about what happens next if this continues in Lebanon and if there's a ground invasion and the Israelis go all out, the concern is palpable. I know we've talked for weeks and weeks about the risk of an escalation, concerns about regional instability. We are right in that sweet spot at this point, aren't we. Just explain from your perspective, given those that you speak to around this region as well -- and you've been on this Lebanon file now for months and months -- what are the risks here?",

And the wishful thinking is that the Israeli prime minister, there will pop into the wind. They have done quite well for themselves militarily. It's been a shock and awe campaign. First, the pager attack, which was sophisticated and unprecedented. Then the walkie-talkies, an ultimatum to Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, saying, we can have a deal now if you stop firing or we can continue. And then this barrage that killed the top commander, a military command of Hezbollah. So clearly Bibi Netanyahu here feels the wind in his sails. The argument I made in a recent piece I wrote for \"Time\" magazine is that the real objective or the primary objective here from Bibi Netanyahu doesn't seem to be the return of 60,000 plus Israelis to the north. That is unlikely to happen without unlocking a political deal. A ceasefire can be the gateway to it. But the real objective here is to degrade the Iranian ring of fire around Israel, Lebanon, (INAUDIBLE) Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, militias in Syria and Iraq and the crown jewel being Hezbollah and Lebanon. If that is truly the key objective here, it seems that mission creep is probably what will happen. Netanyahu will continue to push forward in Lebanon.",

That is just to the west of the city of Tampa here inFlorida, where emergency officials this morning expressed a great deal of concern with the fact that folks that live in this low-lying part of Pinellas County have not evacuated. And you're getting a sense of their concern, why they are worried by the fact that folks are coming out and enjoying an otherwise sunny day as some of the bad weather moves in. And that's because we've already started to see some of the flooding associated with this hurricane. What you're taking a look at here is the result of high tide and some of the rain that moved through the area overnight and into this morning. This kind of flooding is taking place with the storm southwest of where we are located. And the hurricane is not expected to make a direct impact here in Pinellas County. But the concern is, if we're already seeing this type of flooding, what do you think it's going to look like later on this afternoon and tonight, when the forecasted 4-6 feet of storm surge search associated with the storm is forecast to hit this area? And so the concern from emergency officials is that folks may think that, because the storm is so far off the coast and it is not going to directly hit the Tampa Bay area, that they shouldn't take this threat seriously. But this storm, the size of it is so large, that folks really -- emergency officials want folks to take it seriously. They're saying, look, we're going to see some of that rain. We're going to see some of that tropical storm force winds. But more importantly, we're going to see that storm surge. And when all those three things happen at the same time throughout the afternoon, then you're going to see the type of flooding that we're seeing right now, if not even worse. The bay itself is just on the other side of where we are. And we've been watching it creep over the entire morning as high tide kicks in. That water keeps getting closer and closer and closer. And so emergency officials would like folks to go ahead and move further inland, considering some of the evacuation orders that have been in place since yesterday. And as this storm gets closer to us, even though it's going to be off the coast, of course, the window for folks to get out is a little bit more narrow -- Becky.",

Well, the death toll from Israel's war in Gaza has risen to 41,495, according to the Palestinian health ministry. CNN's Paula Hancocks has more.

A mother and her four children were killed when their home in al- Berej (ph) was hit by an Israeli airstrike early Monday. Their uncle said it happened at 3 am. They were killed while they slept. Another strike at a school sheltering displaced in Nuseirat camp killed a couple and their 5-year-old child. Israel said it was a precise strike targeting Hamas operatives. A man staying nearby says, these are the remains of the missile. They were innocent and displaced, sleeping in this little room. The next day, a drone strike in al-Berej (ph) killed two children and 20- year-old twin men. Their father says they were sitting by the front door, looking at their phones. They were born together and killed together, he says. Children playing in the street were rushed into hospital. We have asked the IDF what the target of this strike was.
