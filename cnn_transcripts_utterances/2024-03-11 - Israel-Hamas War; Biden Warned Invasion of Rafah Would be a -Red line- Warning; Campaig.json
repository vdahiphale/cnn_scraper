And what we know is that the president himself has been feeding weapons to the Israelis at the same time that he is, feeding in food and medical gear and so forth to the Palestinians.

Several international news agencies pulled the image, saying it was manipulated. This morning, Kate responded to the controversy on social media saying, \"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused.\" CNN Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy joins me now to discuss. Oliver, we have a lot of problems in this country. This is not one of them, but it is something that a lot of people around the world are talking about. I mean, this is the first official photo we've seen of the Princess of Wales since her abdominal surgery two months ago. And then there are news organizations now saying, hold on a second, this photo appears to be doctored. And I was looking at this this morning, Oliver. It is really weird.

They're good photos.And so, they distribute them to their partners. They put them on the homepages of websites like CNN, front pages of newspapers. And obviously after, you know, some close inspection here or just maybe glancing at the photo, it came to their attention that these -- this image was very obviously edited and manipulated. Now, the palace isn't saying exactly what happened here, like, in terms of what she edited. They're just admitting that she's edited the photos. But this is really damaging to their credibility. And that, like, now people are going to be much more suspicious when they release these handout photos.
