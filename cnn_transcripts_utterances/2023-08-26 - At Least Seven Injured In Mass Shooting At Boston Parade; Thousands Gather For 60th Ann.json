At least seven people were injured after shots rang out there in Dorchester. All of them expected to survive. So, these are non-life-threatening injuries, and this took place during Boston's Caribbean carnival or festival, if you will. Usually features at least two parades, one of which was getting ready to get started. And then, you see what actually took place there, with just a few people that were left behind there at the scene. And quite the chaotic scene that actually played out, when you look at some of these pictures from one of our affiliates coming in. And as we, again, wait to hear more from officials about what potentially could have led to this series of shots being fired. What prompted it. When you look back at the history, we do know that there have been other incidents related in some way, shape, or form to this festival. Again, this usually draws in massive crowds, families coming together. In fact, this year, celebrating its 50th anniversary. However, we've also seen some violence coming out of that, either close to the parade route there, or at the location itself, and in some cases even resulted in the deaths of individuals in year's past. So, we'll actually try to find out exactly what played out here. And then, of course, if any of the rest of the day's festivities were potentially affected. Fred?",

It's always just heart wrenching to hear that a treasured community event has been disrupted by acts of violence from those who had nothing to do with the event. And there is no -- absolutely, no excuse for something that is open to the community and part of Boston's culture and heritage to be talked about in this way because of the acts that were introduced. I'm so thankful to all of our first responders and especially Boston police who were had a very strong presence there, as they had planned and prepared for, and therefore, as you heard, we're not only there to immediately get weapons off the street and make the arrests for holding those accountable and begin the investigation, but also to apply their training in saving lives and ensuring that on the medical side, they would be taking care of those patients until EMS arrived quickly after that. And so, it just shows the range of professionalism and work and just immediate action that is required on a day-to-day basis from all of our officers. We're so thankful that they are part of so many important city events. And today, the rest of the day is going to be a really wonderful celebration. You see, not only our officers and partners out in full force, but community members, organizers, people from every generation coming out to celebrate. This is the 50th anniversary of the carnival. And that's thanks to the incredible dedication and leadership of people like Ms. Shirley Shillingford and so many organizers who have weathered not only ups and downs in terms of temperature and rain. But keeping this tradition going that is important for so many through very difficult moments of having the funds to keep it going and encouraging new generation - the new generation of members to get involved. And so, most of all, thankful to Ms. Shillingford and the team for ensuring that Boston has one of the most vibrant and strongest carnival celebrations anywhere. We're going to have a great rest of the day and just want to thank them for 50 incredible years. So, now, I'll pass it over to Ms. Shirley Shillingford. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A total of seven people, according to police a few moments ago, were injured as part of the shooting. But really one of the main, and perhaps, most important takeaways, according to Boston's mayor is that this incident was not related to that event that was taking place earlier this morning. Though these pictures will certainly tell you that it was certainly affected by it. Or at least, the event itself was affected by the shooting, when you see that parade and the festivities that were put on pause amid the chaos here.Also, I should note some pretty tremendous grace there by one of the organizers, apologizing for what happened, though, it is very clear, based on what we've heard from authorities that this event had nothing to do with the violence that broke out. Nonetheless, this event that was described just now as a very treasured and vibrant one for the community there in Boston, particularly in Dorchester is by some accounts potentially going to proceed here amid this investigation that is still ongoing that left, again, seven people injured, and at least two suspects arrested. This certainly does raise those some very important questions about what police have taken into practice in terms of protecting people there, being that we have seen similar incidents play out. Perhaps not at such a large scope. But we have seen violent incidents on the sort of sidelines if you will, of this carnival in this parade. In some instances, has even resulted in the deaths of some individuals.

We have seen two defendants say they want to have a speedy trial. For the former president, he wants basically the opposite of that, just as he has with his other trials. The other question we're going to have is what Court does this take place in? Now, this is a Fulton County, this is a state indictment. But there have been five of the 19 defendants, they have tried to move their cases to federal court; includes Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, Jeffrey Clark, who is the former Trump DOJ official, and three of the Georgia fake electors. Now, their argument is that they were acting as Federal officers when they carried out the actions that are laid out in this indictment. And this could be significant because not only are we expecting the former president to file a similar motion, but the 19 defendants could have all of the trial moved if a judge agrees with these arguments.

That tweet went out on social media, that fundraising appeal just as Trump was arriving at the Fulton County Jail.Of course, President Biden has been very intentional, not trying to weigh in on these cases. These four indictments of his predecessor, that's been a strategic decision as much as a moral decision. President Biden very much believes in the independence of the judiciary, but he also doesn't want to provide President Trump with a pretext for claiming political persecution. So it has been interesting to see these developments. And in both of these cases, the campaign and President Biden adopted sort of a sardonic tone, approaching this with something of a light touch, not necessarily weighing in on the gravity of what's at stake here. And of course, President Biden will have a balance to strike as he goes forward because the issues that are at play in these indictments go to the very heart of democracy, subversion of democracy, President Trump's attempts to remain in power. Those are issues that President Biden feels very strongly about and has weighed in on the past. There will also be issues that animate this campaign going forward. But President Biden certainly doesn't want to appear as if he is meddling. His strategy has really been to go about the business of the presidency. And in fact, you saw that out here in Lake Tahoe this week as well. On the day that President Trump was arriving at the Fulton County Jail, the White House said that President Biden had spoken to the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy going about the business of American foreign policy. So even though there isn't sort of a larger strategic shift at play, certainly what we can take from this is that the White House, the campaign and President Biden aren't going to be completely silent on these issues going forward.

And he's told us that he's accelerated the launch of his nonprofit Nojono Health to aid in that effort. Ryan Staub, for his part on his GoFundMe, has so far raised $27,000 to eventually return to Front Street. Great news there.But back to the lawsuit, preserving evidence of power equipment in the area where the fire started is critically important. So the electric company here, Fred, has faced allegations that it moved and potentially damaged equipment before federal investigators got to the scene. The utility is responding today with this statement, writing in part, quote, Hawaiian Electric is taking reasonable steps to preserve its own property that was damaged or destroyed because of these devastating fires. However, state, local and federal government actors and others are moving forward to fight the fires and to clear out debris and other items that impede that effort. It is therefore possible, even likely, that the actions of these third parties, whose actions Hawaiian Electric does not control, may result in the loss of property or other items that relate to the cause of the fire. Translation the utility is saying it may not be our fault if there is evidence that is damaged in this case. Fred, it's just one of so many tributaries as Maui continues to hurt this Saturday.",

It could be rivals. It could be Ukraine or another way that often investigations end up is inconclusive. Well, we simply don't know. The data didn't tell us what we wanted to find out.

But this is, I think, why you see Putin, who for months and months, you know, was in the Kremlin hiding away from COVID behind long tables. He has been out for quite a while now among the people being embraced. There was video that I was watching just the other day where, you know, post-crash, where he is out and people are yelling, we love you, President Putin.
