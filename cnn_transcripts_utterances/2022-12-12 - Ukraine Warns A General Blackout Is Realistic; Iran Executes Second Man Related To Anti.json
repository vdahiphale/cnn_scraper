We are live in Kyiv, for you. Then three months into anti-government protests in Iran, a second person is executed. We've all the details. Plus, how scientists just made a huge breakthrough in fusion energy that could eventually end dependence on fossil fuels. We will explain this hour. But first, Russian missile attacks over the weekend have plunged much of Ukraine into the dark. Now, Ukraine's foreign minister says a nationwide blackout is a realistic possibility, as snow blankets Kyiv and other places right across Ukraine. The state energy company is reporting a significant power deficit. Meanwhile, there's fierce fighting in the southern and eastern Ukraine with Ukrainian shells reportedly hitting Russian targets in the occupied city of Melitopol. Will Ripley joins me now from Kyiv this hour. Will, good to see you. Let's start off right there in Melitopol. What do we know unfolded there, because there have been some conflicting reports from what I saw, in terms of numbers of casualties?",

But the latest information when we puttogether what's being reported in Russian state media, what sources here in Ukraine are telling us is that the target of this shelling may have included a hotel, a private hotel that served as a sleeping quarters for private Russian mercenary fighters from the Wagner Group. Now, this is a group that has been highly controversial for their role in this conflict and others. They are fighting on the frontlines, and based on Russian intercepts listened to by CNN, these mercenaries for the most part have better conditions than a lot of the Russian soldiers, in terms of their weaponry, in terms of the equipment that they have available to them. And also, in terms of just their overall living conditions because they come to the frontlines, they fight and then they return to occupied areas often where they see these buildings that they used as their accommodation, their sleeping quarters. Well, Ukrainian Intelligence directed them to a location that was targeted by intense bombardment, again from the Ukrainian side. And people died, perhaps scores of people died. You're talking about potentially dozens or even more numbers that could have been to the hundreds. Still unconfirmed what exactly the numbers are, but if this indeed is the case, if the Wagner Group's sleeping quarters were targeted and there were mass casualties, this would be yet another huge setback for Russian forces on the frontlines that have been able to essentially, hold the lines. But certainly haven't gained back any grounds even though they have been intensely targeting, in particular, the town of Bakhmut which is where Russian forces have been focusing their efforts in the Donetsk region. Isa, and so, the Wagner Group potentially here taking huge losses.",

And a warning, some viewers may find images in his report disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Getting the ingredients for lunch to Vyachesslav's best friend, his arm and his livelihood. Hit by a missile in Bakhmut, he thinks his life was saved by his leather jacket which held him together when he was hit, searching for cabbage and beads. \"I don't know what hit me, I don't understand, but the force was incredible.\" He says. \"Because the arm just flew off. I was conscious, but I was praying, I tell you, I prayed to survive.\" He was a builder and he was right-handed. But not anymore. He was rescued by soldiers from Bakhmut, which has been the scene of the most intense fighting along an 800-mile front, and rushed to hospital here. \"The first thing I asked was if I could have my arms sewn back on\", he said. I saw that it was completely torn off and was just hanging in the sleeve and my stomach was burning.\" There are times he wishes he hadn't survived. \"Now, I'm half man, half zombie. Half human, to be exact.\" The fighting in Bakhmut is merciless, and it's been relentless. Weeks of intense artillery duels have torn the city apart and ripped into the dwindling numbers of civilians still there. The local Ukrainian authorities have implored civilians to leave the region for months. The consequences of staying on are rough and catastrophic and end up here in the nearby Kostyantynivka hospital. (on camera):  So, this is how the Ukrainians are managing to get around the destruction of their power grid. This is a Ukrainian series of boilers installed in this hospital. It can only heat, though, the intensive care ward, the maternity ward and the operating theaters. Everybody else just has to wrap up warm. Is that because you don't have power?

Griner was released lastweek after nearly ten months spent in Russian detention. Her agent says she landed her first dunk during a light practice. The agent also says Griner is doing really well and will decide whether to resume playing over the holidays. And now that Brittney Griner is free, attention is turning to other Americans detained overseas, particularly Paul Whelan; the former Marine currently 2 years into a 16-year sentence in a Russian jail after being convicted if you remember of espionage. Well, in an exchange for his freedom, Russia is said to want Vadim Krasikov; a spy serving a life sentence in Germany. Fred Pleitgen takes a look at how likely that scenario is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The early indications are that it's pretty much off the table for now. The U.S. is saying that they don't believe that this was ever a serious inquiry that the Russians made or anything. That the U.S. could actually follow through on. But we're talking about a man named Vadim Krasikov, he's known here in Germany as the tear-garden killer. He assassinated a man not far from where I am right now in central Berlin in 2019. This was a person, a Georgian national who had fought against the Russian military in Chechnya in the 1990s. And the court -- after Mr. Krasikov was apprehended, ruled that this killing was put in place by the Russian government. That it was instigated by the Russian government, ordered by the Russian government and aided by Russian security and intelligence services. Now, of course, all this caused a big rile between Germany and Russia. The Germans expelled two Russian diplomats, the Russians for their parts said that they had nothing to do with it and called all this politically- motivated. But we do know from earlier this year that there was indeed an inquiry on the part of the United States towards the Germans about Vadim Krasikov. The Germans say that they never really took that seriously or didn't take that as a serious idea from the United States. And it certainly was never discussed on the top levels of the German government. So, right now, the U.S. also seems to have come to the conclusion that it's highly unlikely that a three-way swap, if you will, that, that would work out. Certainly, it's very difficult to see what would be in it for the Germans in all of this. So right now, the U.S. obviously says that it's still doing everything it can to try and get Paul Whelan released. Very unlikely, though, that Vadim Krasikov would in any way, shape or form be part of that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
