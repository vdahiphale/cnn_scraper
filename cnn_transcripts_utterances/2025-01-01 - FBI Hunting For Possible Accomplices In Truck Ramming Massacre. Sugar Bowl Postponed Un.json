And we also knew from them that they found an ISIS flag in the vehicle along with a potential IED, and that they found potential IEDs in the surrounding French Quarter area. Well, we are now learning from law enforcement sources that tell CNN that investigators have reviewed video that shows three men and a woman who they believe may have been involved in placing suspected IEDs in the French Quarter and that investigators also found writings that they believe support their going theory that this was inspired by ISIS. Of course, comes on top of the flag that was found as well.And we know the FBI has said for most of the day that they have been investigating this as an act of Terrorism. Now, there are also questions about how exactly this vehicle got around barricades that were installed years ago to sort of -- to try and prevent this very thing from happening. Well, we`re getting a glimpse of kind of how this happened specifically from some surveillance video from a business across the street from the key intersection here. It`s actually the intersection behind me from where I`m standing, you see a white pickup truck come down Canal Street, essentially behind where I am now. And then a police officer, what appears to be is sort of blocking Bourbon Street. But what you do see is that white pickup truck goes around that police officer and then goes into Bourbon street where again, we know this attack unfolded. And we got a little clue from law enforcement today who told us that, well, those barriers just weren`t working. They were under repair at this point to try and get ready for the Super Bowl coming next month. And so instead they put police vehicles in front of some of those entry points, other barriers, to try and prevent some of this happening, but that -- this person went around these vehicles onto the sidewalk and was able to evade some of those barriers. Now, there were a lot of extra people in town for a big college football game between Notre Dame and the University of Georgia. We also know from a shop owner that the packs were still -- the crowds were still packed on the streets at around 3:00 a.m. when this attack actually unfolded. So it was still very busy. We know that football game was pushed an extra day. But at the heart of this is still 10 people that were killed, 10 families who are trying to figure out in the opening hours of 2025 how to move forward after this attack that happened in just a few minutes, Wolf.",

And so they may have a solid forensic connection between the IEDs which would only confirm their suspicion that those three men and one woman are related to or working in concert with the driver of the truck. So that`s the biggest potential threat the Bureau is probably focused on right now. And they are doing all the things that we have seen in these sorts of situations in the past. They are scouring video coverage to try to locate those folks and track their movements last night as they led up to the moment of placing the IEDs.They`re trying to locate places to search. They`re trying to locate individuals who might know something about those folks. So it`s a lot of activity going on focused in that direction.",

But again, you know, you`ve got a lot of pedestrians, especially this football game coming up. You have a lot of people that will be walking there, which makes them vulnerable.So they delayed it a day to go over their security plan to do the best they can to probably push that perimeter out further, certainly lock it down from any vehicle traffic and things like that. Nothing`s going to be 100 percent. I mean, that`s just the way it is. But clearly the steps that were taken yesterday or early this morning were insufficient. When you look at that in one video, the way the truck was able to just easily maneuver past that patrol car, they`re going to have to reevaluate an awful lot when it comes to securing major events.",

So everything that this subject wrote left behind in terms of his own writings, his own activity on any devices, any electronics devices, telephones, that sort of thing that may have been seized through the searches we`ve seen taking place throughout the day. All of those, all of those items are going to help them get one step closer to the four other people they know they have to find and potentially others. There may be other people involved in this plot who did not appear on that surveillance video that we`ve been talking about for the last couple of hours.So, they have a lot of intelligence that they need to collect and analyze to get a full picture of whether or not a critical threat to security still exists. We will not know the answer to that until we can confidently state whether or not he`s worked with other people. And do we have those folks under control or in some sort of custody?",

O`TOOLE: Again, a great question, and I think people need to be concerned. People need to be vigilant. So what they need to hear from authorities is that the case is being resolved. Here are the people that have been included in this, what investigatively has been exhausted in terms of leads. If it is left the way it was left today, where there`s still a lot of work that has to be done, and that`s simply a matter of fact when you have a case like this, but when it`s left like that, where we still have a lot more to do, what`s not being said is there may be some important points, some important leads that we`ve not been able to close yet.

I mean, it totally changes the situation that we think the bureau is in right now with our initial reporting was that they were essentially looking for four people who they represented at the press conference. They were pretty confident that this person did not act alone. They said they felt he was not solely responsible. That still may be the case, but at this point, Wolf, it doesn`t seem that we are publicly aware of, you know, a direct lead to individuals who are spotted anywhere, if they`ve already ruled out those four from the surveillance video.So it doesn`t settle the issue. It doesn`t really make the picture any clearer for the FBI in terms of assessing the ongoing threat. It just means they have to resort to the sort of methods that they use after every one of these attacks, whether it`s a lone wolf offender or some sort of conspiracy, that they`ve got to go with the focus on the person who they know was involved and responsible, and that is, of course, the driver of the truck. And they`ve got to do all those things that we talked about in the last break. They`ve got to really drill down on his writings, his activity. They have to identify locations where he has slept, lived, worked. They have to identify individuals who are also associated with those locations, be they friends, family, coworkers. They`ve got to start doing interviews of all these people. And really start to develop a picture of this person, who he was, what he -- what motivated him, how he might have changed in his radicalization that brought him to this moment where he staged this attack. So it`s through that sort of very detailed, very labor intensive investigative work that they`ll be able to shed more light as to whether or not he actually had other people working with him on this attack.",

So where do you think this investigation goes from here? O`TOOLE: I think at this point it`s very important that they ruled out that these people that they saw on video camera were not involved in the incident. But they still have to rule out that other people might have assisted him, just like Andy said. And that can be determined again through forensics. Is his the only fingerprints that they found in the truck? What about on the ISIS flagpole? What about on some of the components of the IEDs? So they really do have to rule out that he did all of this by himself. And frankly, if he did all of this by himself, from the planning part to the construction of the IED, to getting the car to driving into New Orleans, that would be pretty phenomenal for him to do it. Not that it`s not possible, but it certainly would make him stand out because there`s just a lot of layers to this crime that almost really require demand that the FBI look to make sure other people weren`t involved. And maybe not side by side with him, planning every step of the way, but helping him as he got parts and components and did recons for him. That absolutely has to be ruled out before I think people are going to feel safe that this has been an exhaustive investigation.",

You know, we tend to think -- I mean, each -- I think the one thing you can say about individuals who are drawn to extremism and go through this period of radicalization, each one goes down that path in a slightly different way. When I was running the counterterrorism division in the FBI, we conducted a survey of every person we had convicted, all the results of the investigations that ended in convictions for charges related to terrorism, to try to look at every factor we knew about those people to distill those that were the most relevant to that radicalization experience. And by far the most relevant factor, the most common factor among all these convicted terrorists, people associated with terrorism, was the consumption of online propaganda. So it`s really, that`s the sort of thing that can happen to anyone.It can happen to people born in this country, people who came to this country as immigrants. It can happen to people who were started out life in the religion that they then pursued an extreme belief in, or it can happen to people who converted to those beliefs later in life. It happens to the rich, to the poor, the highly educated, the uneducated, but all of them consume a high volume of online terrorist propaganda. So it`s really not so much the career factors that we see determining who goes in that direction, but really the behaviors that get them there.",

Because there seems to have been a point in his life where things just went downhill for him and they continued to go downhill. And so who were the people that he reach to during that period of time to talk about what was happening and talking about, you know, what he thought about life and what was -- you know, what was happening with his job and with his marriage. So being able to do that point in time, personality assessment of him to see who was there when his kind of outlook on life changed is really going to be critical. And I think that outlook on life change is something that I`ve seen in the behavioral analysis unit. When people start looking at their life and then start to develop a lot of reasons and excuses for why their life has taken such a downward spiral, taking no responsibility for it themselves. And I think that makes them even more vulnerable to a radicalization process where you can almost make your -- kind of your downward spiral in life seem almost better. Something to look up to.",

If it had continued up into here, there would have been I -- I can`t imagine the count of people who would have died in that circumstance. It hit that large red cranes type device and stopped. Nonetheless, this is one of the reasons that we need clarity on whether or not people can simply grieve this terrible event and look for answers or whether they need to be concerned about somebody else being out there. Because look at all the other areas so close by Jackson Square, Cafe du Monde right down here. So many people have visited. It`s right up in here. So many people have visited that`s merely blocks away. Preservation Hall, a great tourist attraction. Pat O`Brien`s a bar. So many young people go to there. Canal Street over here, we mentioned, huge, a lot of Mardi Gras parades there. They had a parade for the Sugar Bowl in this area just before this all happened. And of course, the Superdome right over here. You could walk from here all the way over here to Jackson Square in 30 minutes easily in a very relaxed fashion. And this is a town that has lots and lots of people around it and they`ve taken security seriously. They`ve been aware of threats. There are very serious questions now as to what maybe wasn`t done right here. First of all, we have the Sugar Bowl that`s happening right now, 75,000 people maybe inside the Superdome, maybe more watch parties all over town. Mardi Gras technically starts next Monday with the first parade. That`ll go on for about two months. About a million people will come town for that Jazz Fest, will get a half million or more in town. That`s coming up a little bit later this spring. The Super Bowl in just a little over a month. These are huge events, all of which, if there is a threat out there, are all in a position of having to be concerned about it. And in fact, the NFL put out a tweet saying, deeply saddened by the news of this devastating event in New Orleans. Thoughts with the victims, the community and all those involved. And the NFL and the local host committee have been working collaborative with local, state and federal agencies the past two years to develop a comprehensive security plan. They will go through with that plan. This is the thing, Wolf. Security plans like this, New Orleans has them, Louisiana has them. The question is, why didn`t they work here?

VERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENTHe heard from a law enforcement official close to the investigation that the cybertruck was actually rented from Turo. That is the same car rental company that was used by the suspect in New Orleans. Now, as is standard, according to this source, they are seeing if there is a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion. But as of this writing, they have not yet found a connection. That source also revealed what was inside the truck, explosives that included fireworks, gas tanks and camping fuel. And authorities believe that was connected to a detonation system controlled by the driver. We`re also hearing this same sentiment from Elon Musk who tweeted out that they have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented cybertruck and is unrelated to vehicle itself. So he was clear to say that this was not an issue with the cyber truck. And the sheriff also earlier said that they are checking for secondary devices. They`re investigating many different leads. But he was clear to say that there -- does not appear to be any further threat to the Las Vegas community. In total, one person, the driver, died.
