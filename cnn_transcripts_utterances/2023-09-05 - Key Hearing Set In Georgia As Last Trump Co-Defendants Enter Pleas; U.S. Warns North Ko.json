This, as CNN has exclusive new reporting on the special counsel's 2020 election probe.Also tonight, the U.S. warrants North Korea it will pay a price if Kim Jong-un arms, helps arm Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. I'll ask key White House Official John Kirby about that and the prospect of a Kim- Putin meeting in Russia. And the manhunt for a fugitive killer is expanding right now after a security camera catches a glimpse of the escaped convict in Pennsylvania, outside the original search area. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. But we begin with breaking news right now. The former chairman of the Proud Boys was just sentenced moments ago in connection with the January 6th attack. CNN Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is outside the federal courthouse here in Washington. Evan, Enrique Tarrio got 22 years, 22 years in prison. Tell us more about this very significant sentence.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. This is a very harsh sentence. This is much longer sentence than any of the other co-defendants, members of the Proud Boys received. There have been four others that were sentenced just in the last few days.And the judge made reference to the fact that he said this is a case that is an outlier. This is a historic case. He said that what happened that day on January 6th did not honor the founders. It was the kind of thing they wrote the Constitution to prevent. He spoke of Tarrio, who was the leader of this conspiracy, the seditious conspiracy, which four members of the Proud Boys were convicted of. And he said that what Tarrio did slanders the father of our country, referring to George Washington. 22 years is longer than some of his other co-defendants. One of them, Ethan Nordean, got 18 years. Another one, Joseph Biggs, got 17 years. Zachary Rehl got 15 years. Dominic Pezzola, a lower-level member of the Proud Boys, received 10 years. One of the things that we heard in court today was Enrique Tarrio addressing the judge and the courtroom for the first time. He spoke about how he was sorry. He spoke after his mother and his sister apologized and begged for the judge to show some mercy. What Tarrio did was he apologized to the police officers who were attacked at the Capitol that day. He also called on January 6th a national embarrassment and begged the judge to show some mercy on him. In the end, the judge said that he didn't really believe that Enrique Tarrio had shown any remorse. He referenced some of the recent interviews that you've seen from Tarrio, including one just a few weeks ago, in which he said that the Proud Boys did nothing wrong. So, in the end, he sentenced Tarrio to 22 years, which is longer, Wolf, than the statutory maximum for the major crime that he was convicted of, which was seditious conspiracy. Obviously, he was facing additional charges beyond those. Wolf?",

In one case, Dominic Pezzola, he was one of the lower- level members of the Proud Boys, but he played a key role. He broke those windows that allowed the mob to get into the building. And after he was sentenced, the judge left the room and Pezzola stood up with his fist raised and said, Trump won.",

He had an enormously significant role, what we refer to in sentencing jargon is a leadership role over the group that probably had the most deleterious effect on the riot that day.But I have to say, even though they've applied the terrorism enhancement to his underlying sentence in this case, I don't think it goes quite far enough. The fact is, we have all -- we have defendants at many, many levels in different organizations who are convicted of offenses related to international terrorism. They are recipients of the terrorism enhancement at its full level. And I just don't see the same sort of seriousness being given to domestic terrorism convictions and be there no mistake, this was an act of domestic terrorism. It absolutely fits under the statute. Applying the terrorism enhancement was appropriate here. I just think it should have been done on an equivalent level for someone who was clearly a leader in that group.",

One senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri, just told me moments ago that everywhere he went in Missouri over the congressional recess, he was asked about Senator Mitch McConnell's health.And there now is an expectation that tomorrow behind closed doors, he will address his full conference for the first time about everything that happened here and indicate to them that he can do the job. That is a message they tried to send today when releasing a letter from the Capitol physician saying that Mitch McConnell's episodes were not related to a stroke, a seizure or Parkinson's disease and also indicating that he can continue on with his business as usual. And that is also the message that McConnell tried to convey when he went to the Senate floor and told his colleagues that he was busy this August recess and there's a significant work ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): Now, one particular moment of my time back home has received its fair share of attention and the press over the past week.

His office initially said that he was experiencing lightheadedness, and there's some skepticism among even some of his colleagues about that reason for why he froze up.Of course, the Capitol physician also said that lightheadedness is tied to people who have had concussions. McConnell suffered a concussion when he hit his head and fell in a Washington hotel earlier this year. But when talking about that is the reason for the freeze- up, at least one Republican senator -- Kentucky Senator Ram Paula, fellow Republican from his home state, was skeptical of that reason. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY): I think it's an inadequate explanation to say this is dehydration.",

And the vast majority of people who've made comments about it publicly have said he sounds great, looks forward to get back to work, and that they support him here. So, actually, I think the letter that came out from the Senate physician today talking about the tests that McConnell had undergone, the neurologist that had seen McConnell really kind of tells the whole story. I texted with him a little bit today. He was feeling good and glad to be back in Washington. So, I suspect when he speaks to his conference tomorrow, you're going to see a big vote of confidence out of most people coming out of that room.",

I think he owes the United States and members of his great state of -- constituents of his great state of the Commonwealth, excuse me, of Kentucky, an explanation of truly what happened.You know, Wolf, I want to level set just a moment here. When Hillary Clinton got hot on the campaign trail in 2016, it was breaking news. It was every news cycle over and over and over again. And Republicans were just, you know, beneath the dignity of their office as they were guessing about her condition and what may have been. And I think that if Joe Biden actually went through a similar episode where we've seen not once but twice Mitch McConnell go through, then what he's doing would not be enough. And so, like I told Scott many times over, my prayers are with Mitch McConnell, the only person who can help or decide whether or not he resigns, as he is in his family. I'm not calling on that. I'm not asking for that. But what I am asking for is more transparency about the leader of the Senate and more transparency -- or, excuse me, the minority leader of the Senate and more transparency about what he's going through at this time.

I think he has a rock solid hold on his conference there. He's been in that position for many, many years. And, of course, he will meet with his fellow senators tomorrow, and has already been doing some of that calling. There's some transparency with this letter. I'm sure he's going to get many more questions. I think one of the questions for Mitch McConnell is, what if this happens again, right? It happens sort of back to back in a similar way. He, of course, had that concussion, and there could be some lingering effects of that. That's what the doctor's note suggests. So, I think that is a kind of lingering question. It's going to be an ongoing issue for him. He might quiet it for now when he meets with his fellow senators, but I think what happens if this happens again?",

Dr. Fauci, as always, thank you so much for joining us. How concerned should we be about this COVID exposure for both the president potentially and for the first lady? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Well, as we know, the first lady is infected. That's unfortunate that she got infected, but I think she should be doing really quite well for a number of reasons. One, she's fundamentally a healthy one. She has been vaccinated. She's been boosted and she has had a prior infection, as you can recall, Wolf, last summer, which means she has a hybrid immunity or good amount immunity which didn't prevent her from getting infected, but certainly would go a long way to prevent her from getting severe disease. So although you never can predict, I would imagine she strongly that she should do really quite well.

I would imagine we're going to see an increase as we get into the fall and what we should do is follow the CDC recommendations. In fact, particularly among individuals at risk, the elderly and those with underlying conditions may want to as the cases increase to wear a mask when they're in indoor settings, particularly when there are crowds. [18:55:14] And I'm not talking about mandating anything. I'm talking about good common sense and following the recommendations that we likely will get from the CDC as we proceed into the fall and if the cases increase in their number. Also importantly, Wolf, in a couple weeks by the end of September, we should have available a booster shot that appears to be very well matched in the sense of being able to protect against the circulating variants. We have EG.5 and FL.1.5 and a lot of XBB variants now circulating. And the vaccine available towards the end of September is an XBB1 vaccine which could be very well matched to what we're seeing, which is all the more reason, particularly for people at risk, to seriously consider taking that vaccine when it becomes available.",
