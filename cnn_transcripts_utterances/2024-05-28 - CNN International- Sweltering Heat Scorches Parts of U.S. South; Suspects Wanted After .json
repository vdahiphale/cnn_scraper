Take a look at the national picture here. This is a heat risk map, and you can see that Americans are being impacted from coast to coast.The colors in this map, you can see that there is a shade of tan and all the way to a deep red on that map. And those are the ranges of risk, from minor risk to extreme heat risk. We're expecting that OSHA issue regulatory framework in the next few months. This is after OSHA issued a 2022 initiative that inspected thousands of workplaces already in relation to heat-related injuries. Now, one of the data points that OSHA looks at is the number of deaths that are heat related. Now, the number that I'm about to share with you is not just for work- related deaths. These are overall deaths in the United States that are related to the heat. And you'll see that these numbers are staggering and they have been increasing. In 2021, the number of heat-related deaths was about 1,600. That number increased a year later to about 1,700, and last year it increased to about 2,300. Now, these risks don't stop people from working out and or doing activities outside. You can see some of them out here in Houston. I talked to them about some of the precautions that they take to make sure that they can do it safely. Take a listen.",

So it's worth talking about how critics got to this dire warning.Well, the bill would strengthen the powers of the legislature, which would allow lawmakers to demand sensitive information from, let's say, the president or the military, for example. Things like that, Max, happen all the time in the United States and the U.K. It's a check and balance of government. But the protesters here are saying this bill is incredibly vague, very broad, and the party supporting it, the Kuomintang and the Taiwan People's Party, advocate closer ties to China. Critics are concerned that sensitive information -- we're talking about state secrets, for example -- could be demanded, then leaked from lawmakers who support closer China ties and end up in Chinese hands themselves.

So I think from a political standpoint, it'd be unlikely for those two groupings to band together. It really depends how well the ANC does. It could squeak over 50 percent.
