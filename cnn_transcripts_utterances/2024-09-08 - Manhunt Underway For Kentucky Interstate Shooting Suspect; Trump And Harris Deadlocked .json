And so I called the police and when they got there, they told me that they would have to take my mother to the morgue as opposed to what I thought would be the funeral home. I didn't understand it. I watch \"Law and Order,\" and I'm thinking she doesn't need to be in a morgue. I didn't kill or anything.But at the end of the day, I started crying uncontrollably. I couldn't stop crying. And what the police officer said, and I am very still traumatized today every time someone gets killed because I remember his stern voice saying to me, if I didn't stop, meaning crying, he would have to arrest me. And so, yes, every time I hear about a Sonya Massey, a Breonna Taylor, Botham Jean, someone that gets killed in their own home or in the home of a loved one at their pad, it relates me back to the racial trauma that I experienced each and every time from what I went through in they experience of police officers in my mom's home, the home that I grew up in, that she lived in for over 40 years. That's one of the reasons why. So, yes, despite whatever credentials I have, I still have reason as a black woman to fear the police and fear for my life in certain instances involving the police.",

We hit a temperature of 112 degrees the other day in L.A. for only third time in its history since the 1800s.You can see the warnings are still in effect from Los Angeles down to San Diego. 25 million people under these excessive heat alerts here. You've got temperatures still up around 100 degrees through Sunday and Monday in L.A., again way above the average of the upper 70s. So some triple-digit heat in Palm Springs, in Phoenix, and Las Vegas. Temperatures are out 100 degrees or hotter. On top of this, we also have some very dry air. You've got that relative humidity down to 5 percent to 15 percent, and winds are gusting up to 40 miles per hour, so, again, that just makes these fire conditions more erratic and harder to control. There are two fires that we've been watching. The Davis Fire up in -- near Reno, where it's got to 1500 acres that are burning, zero percent containment. And then the much bigger Line Fire that's near Los Angeles, that's got 17,000 acres. Again, very hard to contain. We'll find these winds continuing to kick as we go into tomorrow. Again, winds, gusts rather 20 to 30 miles per hour. So something to watch. A little bit of a low in the morning on Tuesday but then the winds do come back again Tuesday afternoon, something firefighters will have to contend with. Remember this also brings smoke, too, so with the extreme heat that already gives you poor air quality because the heat traps our pollution, which for a place like L.A. they really struggle with. Now you add that wildfire smoke can really do some damage when it comes to that air quality. So if you have lung or heart disease, if you're sensitive to things like that, you really want to keep that in mind for some of the smoke conditions. We will find temperatures starting to ease back on the West Coast, some cooler temperatures coming in later in the week as some of that heat starts to spread to the east.",

First poll in a while to show Trump ahead. We'll have to see if it's confirmed by other polls. The CNN and CBS battleground state polls that came out, CBS today, CNN a couple of days ago, they would extrapolate up more toward a narrow Harris lead. But, Fred, the thing that I take from all of these polls is the consistent finding that Harris is basically replicating the share of the vote among whites that Biden got when he won in 2020. And she's still -- even though she's improved on where Biden was when he left the race, she's still underperforming among non-whites, both black and Latino voters.

Obviously, Donald Trump enjoys having the Kennedy name, an aura and the, you know, his support by the time that Kennedy got out of the race. That dwindled toward the most alienated voters, more whom probably will end up with Trump than with Harris.But Donald Trump is explicitly saying he is going to give Kennedy a large role in federal public health policy, putting him on a commission, may be leading a commission to look at, you know, what he calls chronic childhood disease, which is code for his opposition to vaccine mandates, which are in essentially every school in the country. Pew polling shows 70 percent of Americans support vaccine mandates in schools. I'm guessing that number is even higher among suburban moms. So, you know, Democrats haven't really talked about it much, but you do wonder whether associating so closely with Kennedy could compound Trump's troubles with white-collar women in the suburbs.

Well, you know, the biggest takeaway for me from that \"New York Times\" poll today that people are talking about is that roughly 30 percent of all voters said they need to know more about Harris. That rose to about 40 percent of both black and Latino voters. And 50 percent roughly of voters under 30.You know, because of the unusual circumstances by which she was, you know, nominated, I think you have to go all the way back to Wendell Willkie in 1940, the business executives that Republicans kind of plucked out of nowhere to be their nominee against Franklin Roosevelt. That may be the last time that there was a nominee at this point in the process about whom voters had less firmly formed opinions. The initial impressions of Harris have been good, her favorability is high, but as you see, a lot of people feel that they have -- they need to know more about her. And so in many ways, her task at the debate is less to make a case against Trump than to make a case for herself, and to show voters both what she would do and that she has the energy and competence to handle the job of president. I think that poll really sets up a very specific mission for her at the debate this week.",

We are seeing increased mental health needs for our young people.And I think that there's just so many things in society he now that our youth are dealing with. What we have to do, as a community and as a collective, is be able to teach our children how to express themselves. How to use words to be able to express feelings that they may not really know how to articulate. And give them the tools to really cope, when they're experiencing with things like depression, trauma, anxiety, whatever it may be. About thoughts of, you know, wanting to misuse a substance. We have to really spend time with our young people to give them these skills.",

Thousands of people, 10s of thousands, have poured out onto the streets in towns and cities across Israel, demanding an immediate deal to release the other 101 Israelis, dead and alive, still being held inside the Gaza strip.

It was the first case in 25 years that they found inside Gaza.It's just a sign of how crippled the health infant structure is in that country after so many months of Israeli bombardment in response to those October the Seventh attacks.
