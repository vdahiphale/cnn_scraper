      "sentences": "-- the battle for our brains. Author and Duke University professor Nita Farahany tells Walter Isaacson that we need to protect ourright to think as neuroscience advances. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London today. Today, Fox News Corporation and Dominion Voting Systems go head-to-head in what is said to be one of the most important media trials in more than half a century. Truth telling and disinformation are now in the dock as jury selection is completed and opening arguments get underway in Delaware. Dominion is suing Fox for defamation and $1.6 billion in damages, accusing Rupert Murdoch's right-wing Fox News channel of knowingly spreading lies about the 2020 election and about Dominion Voting machines. The judge has already ruled that Fox add lies about the company and the election. But Dominion must prove that Fox did so intentionally and with actual malice. Fox has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and argues the lawsuit is a three threat to the First Amendment. So, what's at stake and how could it impact law, politics and, of course, the press? Few know the inside of Murdoch's media empire better than veteran British journalist Andrew Neil. He ran Murdoch's \"Sunday Times\" in the U.K. for over a decade, and he's now host of the \"Andrew Neil Show\" on Britain's Channel 4. He's joining me from Dubai. And from New York, Jelani Cobb, dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. Welcome, gentlemen, both of you to the program. Andrew Neil, can I start by asking you because you are already, as well, managing \"Sky News,\" and I mean, you were really an insider. And yet, I think you believe that it's a good thing that this comes to trial and that it wasn't settled out of court. Why is that? ANDREW NEIL, CHAIRMAN, THE SPECTATOR AND FORMER EDITOR MURDOCH-OWNED \"THE SUNDAY TIMES\":  Well, the first thing I would say is this is the biggest crisis for the Murdoch organization since the phone hacking scandal in Britain over a decade ago, that was a big crisis. This is just as big, if not bigger. The journalist in me, of course, wanted to go to trial. It's a great story. It's going to be six weeks of a great story, but not just the journalists. I think there's a public interest in it going to court, going to trial as well. This isn't just Fox News that is on trial, it isn't just the group of Murdoch organization that's on trial, it's fake news and disinformation that's on trial. It is America's defamation laws may be on trial. Is the bar too high to defame someone in the United States? And if Dominion was to lose this, well, what would the constraints be on fake news and disinformation? Frankly, I would think there would be none. So, the stakes are very high.",

      "sentences": "So, that's really the question and, you know, how you view it will depend on largemeasure on how you see these kinds of matters or where you stand politically. If you recall at the very beginning of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, one of the things that he said that, you know, start to raise alarm, certainly among people in media circles was that he wanted to \"loosen up the libel laws.\" And that is likely a reference to kind of the biggest law that we have around media freedom and the First Amendment or the biggest ruling, which is \"The New York Times\" versus Sullivan case from 1964, which established a doctrine that an outlet can publish information and information can be false as long as that information was not intentionally false or a result of malice, a malicious attempt to defame the person or so grossly negligent that the newspaper or the news organization should have known better. And, you know, that's been a pretty high standard, but it's also allowed newspapers to take risks, it's allowed newspapers to break stories, it's allowed newspapers to do investigations and those kinds of things. On the other side of it there are lots of people who are on the left politically who would just love nothing more than to see Fox News get its comeuppance in this case. The other side of it is that if that happens, that could unintentionally have the ripple effect of giving Donald Trump what exactly he wanted in 2015 when he said that he wanted to \"loosen up the libel laws.\" A precedent could ricochet, depending on what happens in this decision, it could ricochet around and become a principle that makes it generally more difficult for the media to report on kinds of things. And what will determine this, like at issue, at the center of this is whether or not Fox News is reporting on Dominion was an honest mistake, something that, you know, came up that turned out to not pan out or if it was a result of gross negligence and if they intentionally misled the public.",

It's much, much easier for plaintiffs to win here in the U.K. than it is in the USA.

And I will say, the thing I was going to say that connects to this is that the most damning part of this is the backlash against Fox News' own journalists who were reporting that, in fact, Joe Biden won the election fair and square. And you know, they were certainly, you know, journalists who felt that there was an internal backlash against them for that, not all of them are even still working at Fox as a result, you know, and kind of unceremoniously, a few people left in the immediate aftermath. If you have those people saying, we told the truth and we were punished for it, then that really changes the calculus.

So, again, the opinion makers or the executives knew that, they knew that their own journalists have fact-checked that it was a fair election. Andrew, Rupert Murdoch, though, said in e-mails that were revealed to his own CEO, Suzanne Scott, getting creamed by CNN. Guess our viewers don't want to watch it. Watch, what I was referring to, the accurate result as Fox was reporting it. You know -- well, I don't know how close you still are. But you've known Rupert Murdoch. You must have read the Gabriel Sherman \"Vanity Fair\" piece on him. What's happening? Is he losing it or is he playing the game? Well, what's happening?

It's hard to see how you get around reporting or taking seriously or taking incredibly arguments that go to the contrary of the very kind of fact- finding mission that, at least, in theory, is at the heart of your news organization. And so, there's that. I will say one thing too in response to Andrew's point, there is good reason -- even if Fox News gets creamed in this settlement, there would be good reason for them to not appeal to the Supreme Court about this because it's like -- you know, it's bad to have an apartment fire, but if you open the door, you now have a building fire. And so, if you appeal this up to the Supreme Court, you could actually -- this could be a onetime loss, you know, in a circuit court. If you go to the Supreme Court, you could actually codify this as a bigger loss. And if they change the libel laws, there are a lot of conservative news outlets that will be vulnerable as a result of that, too, which is part of the calculation.",

And I'm absolutely certain that the main message there will be that, yes, we recognize the enormous amount of weapons, ammunition supplies that have already been provided to Ukraine, but we need to do even more because we need to ensure that Ukrainians are in the position where they can punch through the Russian lines and also, cross the minefields and be in a position where they can liberate, to take back territory which is now currently illegally occupied by Russia.

And that's exactly what we have done over the last weeks, is enormous amount of equipment, which is now transported into Ukraine. And on top of that, NATO allies are providing training. This has enabled, actually, Ukrainians to make a lot of progress already, pushing back around Kyiv, in the beginning of the war, not least because of training and support given by NATO allies since 2014.

So, their spirit is still high. But I spoke to Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair just yesterday, along with President Clinton, as they were reflecting on what it took to get the Good Friday Accord, the peace in Northern Ireland. It took courage, it took commitment, and it took patience and time. And they, especially, Blair said, you know, if the West is going to achieve the goals that you've all laid out, you can't get fatigue and you can't give up now. This is what he said.

And the courage, the determination, the bravery that the Ukrainian armed forces, but also the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian political leadership with President Zelenskyy have demonstrated over the last months since the invasion have inspired the whole world, and actually inspire us to continue to support them. It will be a tragedy for the Ukrainians if President Putin wins. So, it's the morally right thing to help them defend themselves, the right for self- defense is enshrined in the U.N. charter. But it's also in our own interest to support Ukraine to not give up, because if Russia wins, then the message to all authoritarian leaders, and, of course, also to President Putin is that when they use military force, when they violate international law, then they get what they want, and that will make the world more dangerous and us more vulnerable. So, it's in our own security interest to support Ukraine. And then, lastly, I really feel that when I travel around in NATO countries and important countries, I actually see that people care. They care when they see civilians killed, when they see women raped or when they see children forcibly abducted, taken away from their parents. So, therefore, it's a strong support across the alliance. It varies a bit. It goes a bit up and down. But the main message, from what they tell us (ph), and the people in our countries is that, we will stand by Ukraine because this matters also for us.",

So, Walter, you say you intentionally would make the choice if you wanted to, to use the devices, that won't be true for everyone. And already in workplaces worldwide employees have been required to wear brain sensors to track their fatigue levels, to track their attention or their focus or even their emotional levels in the workplace. And in China, there are reports that people have even been sent home for work based on what their brain activity reveals. Similarly, students and classrooms in China and other countries have had their brain activity monitored by mandate to have to wear these brain wearables. It's happening in criminal justice systems worldwide where police are interrogating people's brains to see if there's recognition of crime scene details. So, cognitive liberty is about both your rights to make a choice to navigate through a game, to be able to swipe with your mind or type on virtual keyboards, but also to not have both the devices mandated nor interference or collection of your brain data or manipulation of your brains, which can happen too.

They've used this product with enterprises, with companies worldwide who used it to track fatigue levels of employees. It's not that different from driver assist technology, which is in some trucks and cars, the differences it's being trained on the brain to pick up that electrical activity that signals a person's fatigue level. They've reported that they've partnered for a trial with the North American Trucking Company to test out SMART kapp, and I suspect there will be increasingly more examples of employers starting to integrate that. Employers during the COVID pandemic, especially during work from home, started to introduce a significantly more number of productivity tracking software programs on employees work from home devices. I don't think it's a far stretch to imagine in a world where surveillance in the workplace is increased significantly, that certain kinds of sensors might be integrated, at least, in limited context here, even here in the United States.",

The right to cognitive liberty looks at the balance between societal and individual interest. And one thing that's SMART kapp is doing really well is they're minimizing the data that they're collecting? You could collect a lot more information from the brain and mine it if you're an employer. SMART kapp overrides all of that data on the device itself, they provide only an algorithmic interpretation of a score one to five as to whether or not the person is wide awake or falling asleep, and those kinds of practices start to get to the responsible use of this technology. If you're going to have it in a setting where, for example, a truck driver has their brain activity monitored for fatigue levels, implementing those kinds of safeguards, I think, decreases the intrusion into their mental privacy.",

I interpret it morenarrowly than the concept of mental privacy, which is why I include mental privacy as part of it. There's a lot that happens in our brains from automatic responses to emotions, to basic brain states that mental privacy would cover. Freedom of thought gets it, that inner monologue, our thought, that space for private reprieve, which I think is so fundamental to human flourishing. It's what gives us that space to decide who we are, develop our own self- identity, choose what will share and won't share with other people, define our own terms of vulnerability, have a place where you think daring thoughts or thoughts that might go against the green, if you're in a tyrannical or not an authoritarian regime, dreaming a dream of resistance and rising up against injustice. All of that requires that we have a space in which your thoughts are not accessed, your thoughts aren't manipulated and you aren't being punished for what you're thinking. And I worry when we breach that final domain of privacy, that space for private reprieve, that it will be very difficult for people to be able to continue to cultivate that kind of inner monologue.

When technologies are designed to take advantage of those brain shortcuts and heuristics, it can be very difficult for us to resist, difficult to not return to our phones over and again, to platforms or you say, like, OK, I'll watch one more episode.
