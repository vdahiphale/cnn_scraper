Donald Trump's lawyers just negotiated a $200,000 bond for the former president just ahead of his expected criminal arrest this week in the Georgia election interference case. We're following all the new legal maneuvers by Trump and his co-defendants.Also tonight, Trump's Republican primary rivals are preparing to debate without him. We're setting the stage for the first GOP face-off on Wednesday and how it will be shaped by Trump's confirmed snub of the event. And we're also live on Maui this hour for President Biden's tour of the fire ravaged island amid the ongoing search for hundreds of missing people and questions about the administration's emergency response. We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in \"The Situation Room.\" These are live pictures of the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta, Georgia, where Donald Trump's $200,000 bond agreement was hammered out just a short while ago. It's a critical step just ahead of Trump's surrender at the county jail, his historic fourth criminal arrest. Authorities there are now preparing to book Trump and his 18 co- defendants this week. We have team coverage of this breaking story. Alayna Treene is standing by for us. She's near Trump's New Jersey home, but first, Evan Perez, he's here with me in \"The Situation Room.\" What are you learning, Evan, about the terms of this bond agreement for former President Trump? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is the most extensive of these bond agreements that we've seen so far. There are a number of defendants, there are lawyers, came to the complex there, the government complex in Atlanta, to negotiate the terms of the surrender of their clients. In the case of the former president, we saw his lawyers there today, and his is obviously the biggest of the bond. It's $200,000. Most of them have gotten $100,000 in others' numbers. In this case, the former president has a number of conditions that he has to meet. Just take a look at a number of these that are listed in this agreement. One of them says that the defendant shall make no direct or indirect threat of any nature against any co-defendants. Similarly, against any unindicted co-conspirators, individual one through individual 30. Also, no threats against victims. And perhaps the most interesting one, Wolf, this is the only one that we've seen like this, specify that the former president cannot make any threats of any kind on social media platforms. Of course, that's something that we've seen him do. We saw him on the day of his indictment say something to his, to one of the witnesses, Jeff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor in Georgia, urging him not to go testify that day. So, something that obviously has caught the attention of the court, of the judges down there in Atlanta, and they've issued a warning against the former president. We've seen, Wolf, similar warnings by judges in his other arrests, in his other bond agreements, but this is the first one that has specified no threats on social media platforms.",

But that is something that his lawyers do not want. They do not want it to appear as if they are leaving it for the last minute.And of course, the district attorney's office has given all of the 19 defendants, including the former president, until noon on Friday to voluntary do so. So, as of now, they are planning for Thursday. But of course, this also comes as Donald Trump is skipping out on that debate on Wednesday. As his opponents are preparing to take the stage in Milwaukee for that debate, Donald Trump will be sitting down with Tucker Carlson. And we have some new reporting, Wolf. My colleague, Kristen Holmes and I, have learned that that interview with Tucker Carlson has been pre- recorded. So, Donald Trump on Wednesday night will be remaining here in New Jersey, just nearby me, at his golf club in Bedminster. And then Thursday he will travel, likely, to Georgia for his surrender.",

There is supposed to be an incentive with these bonds for the defendant not to run.

But to Evan's point, they're trying to apply the same factors as they apply elsewhere. I do think, though, as Shan notes, that when he gets there on Thursday, which is likely. We know that because he wants to milk the ratings. This has been good for him in the short term. Personally, I think it's a sugar high. It's going to be hurtful in the long term.

According to the mayor of Maui, the FBI whittled the list of missing from more than 2,000 down to about 850. That was a big drop given the governor had told us the more recent report, previous to that was over 1,000. And we actually met a couple at our hotel who told our producer they were looking for ways to get their names off of the missing list. So hopefully there's still some confusion that can account for that 850, but a lot of people are coming to grips with the idea that because the heart of this historic beautiful town was essentially cremated that their loved ones may never be found.",

Traditionally over the last century or so native Hawaiians were left out of key decisions about water use and land rights. And so to hear government officials talking about we will rebuild Lahaina, that actually puts a little bit of hesitation in their minds, because given the tragic history of natives on this island, they worry that it will just be co-opted by outside corporations from the mainland and that native Hawaiians and longtime residents of this beautiful place will be squeezed out by vulture capitalists who are trying to take advantage of these big losses that will loom large.But then for so many they just want a hand to hold and a hug and somebody to express their crushing grief to. In this moment we saw somebody, just some locals setting up a really touching display of crosses along the Lahaina bypass. They only had time to make 53. They planned to make 114 crosses. They put them up. So they wanted the President to see some indication of the loss here. But they're going to come back and also put up 850 yellow ribbons for the missing and take them down as people are found.

Do you think this $200,000 bond agreement former President Trump is appropriate?REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT), RANKING MEMBER, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Well, Wolf, I think what we're seeing right now is pretty standard issue stuff. I noticed that $200,000 was more of a -- significantly more than some of the other defendants that have turned themselves in Georgia. What I think is going to be really interesting, Wolf, is not so much the actual bond agreement. I don't think anybody thinks that Donald Trump is fleeing the country. But what's really going to be interesting is the way in which the presentation of Donald Trump in Georgia is going to, you know, overshadow the Republican debate. Think about it. He's going to be fingerprinted, to my understanding, and may have a mug shot taken. That mugshot may be made public. My understanding is that's the way it's done in Georgia for ordinary defendants. President Trump has avoided that up to date. And imagine how that's going to sort of galvanize the media and the American people at a time, of course, when lots of other Republican candidates are trying to break out and make themselves known.",

There is a stipulation that he will not make threats against property. I mean, it's really pretty remarkable. And much, much broader, by the way, than those stipulations in the various federal indictments in which he's had to present himself for arraignment.So, you know, yes. I don't know if that's part of typical Georgia procedure, but this is much, much, much more specific than the restrictions that were placed on him at the federal level. And is he going to be able to resist it? I mean, I don't know. You know, Donald Trump is presumably getting a lot of advice from his attorneys on this, but this is not a guy that we know, having watched him now for six years, that is really capable of selfcontrol or of muting himself on social media.
