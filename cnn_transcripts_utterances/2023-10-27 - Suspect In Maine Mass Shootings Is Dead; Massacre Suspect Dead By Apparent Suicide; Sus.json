That is according to the sheriff, sources say, from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.And at any moment, as you can see there, we are expecting a news conference from authorities in Maine, Maine State Police, on the death of the 40-year-old Robert Card, who's the suspect in this mass shooting. Now, law enforcement sources tell CNN's John Miller that Card was found in an area near the recycling center from which he had recently been fired. Card is accused of murdering 18 innocent people, wounding 13 others, in a shooting rampage at two different sites this week, a bowling alley and a restaurant in the small city of Lewiston. Now, it is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year in a nation that, unfortunately, sees all too many of these incidents. I want to go straight now to the site of where this body was found. CNN Correspondent Brian Todd is in Lisbon, Maine. Brian, tell us a little bit of where you are, what this I'm going to show you a little bit of what this area is like. It's pitch black now, but what is it like in the daylight? Can you give us any clues about how this man was found?",

It's kind of almost a strip mall kind of an area here, but there are woods right behind me here.I'm going to show you kind of the scene. This is the area that we're going to be talking about. This is the area where we believe he was found dead. The police are blocking us from getting any closer. You can see they're taking this very seriously. They've got some tactical weapons. They've got two police officers manning either side of this intersection and a car blocking us. But what we believe is the site is behind this Walgreens over here down the street. And according to our sources, John Miller, Josh Campbell, Evan Perez, he was found in a wooded area right near the recycling facility. That recycling facility, again, we're almost certain, is just down here kind of in the darkness over here, behind that Walgreens and the police are, of course, heavily protecting it. There's another police vehicle over here, again, all these officers with tactical weapons, making sure that nobody gets anywhere near there. So, this is the area and, again, stressing that we know that he worked at Maine Recycling, and these are, we think, a couple of different recycling facilities that are grouped very close together right back there and he was fired from that job recently, according to John Miller. So, you know, again we we've got had various accounts throughout the week from colleagues who worked with him at least one colleague who worked with him at this recycling center, did tell another news outlet about him behaving erratically and acting violently and some of the co-workers there being concerned about him. But, again, this is where he worked down here, where he lost his job recently and we believe there are woods back there and that's where he was found. Abby?",

And it actually all happened around the time when we were getting indications that police were searching the suspect's home. They may have found a note, information at his home, which then led them to this location. The one thing I want to say is, today, as more law enforcement officials converged to this location, more enforcement, more officers came in, they started searching deeper into the woods. And I think perhaps maybe this is what led to this discovery. Maybe there was more of an outside search, maybe they didn't go in as deep into the woods because they just didn't have the teams to do it. I don't know. Perhaps that's one of the things we'll wait to see, because today they certainly stepped up many of the searches. They went in deeper into the woods than we have seen in the past two days. We actually -- me and my team, we actually walked along the trail, going from the boat launch to a trail that actually leads into this recycling area, which he could have easily taken once he dumped his car and walked over to this area. So, clearly, police knew about this area. They had some information that he was connected to this area, which led them to the location yesterday when they did the search. They went back today and, obviously, this is the information we're getting. Hopefully, this press conference will start soon. I can tell you, you can see people behind me here, people are shaking hands. Many of the officials here, the mayor is here standing behind me of Lewiston and other officials who've been here every day since this happened, there is a sense of relief here tonight that I have not seen or felt since I've been here. People are smiling. Something about this has certainly changed the mood here. One part of this is over. We are now onto the next part, of course, the grieving. But there is a sense of relief here that you can feel. People, for the first time, are smiling. We are waiting for more officials to come here. You can tell many folks here. This news has caught them by surprise. So, that's why this press conference is going to be delayed, because they're waiting for many of the other law enforcement officials, the people who were here searching and who have been leading these agencies to get here so they can start this press conference. But two things here are very important. Obviously, the threat for this community, for the people who live in Lisbon, who have been suffering greatly, the people in Lewiston who have been suffering greatly because this happened in their community, they can put some of this fear behind them and now begin what they really need to do, and that is get together, plan vigils, remember those who were killed here and get together as a community to grieve.

      "sentences": "Yes. Actually quite a lot of questions unanswered here, including, as we were just discussing with both Shimon and with Brian Todd, this is an area that has some resonance to this suspect, and, similarly, the two locations where he carried out these massacres also did.So, John, as someone who's been in law enforcement for a long time, I'll ask you, does it surprise you that this location ultimately was where he was found and that it was not pretty thoroughly searched very early on in this process to see if he was there? MILLER:  So, that's a good question and one question is, you know, what did the river have to do with it? Did they confine their immediate search to the side of the river where they found the car on the idea that he might have been moving on foot, or did they expand to that other area before the second day? But to get to the core of the beginning of your question, if you look at offender characteristics among people involved in mass shootings or active shooter situations, you see that most of these are kind of grievance-driven, grievance at work or grievance at school or grievance with a social circle and feelings of rejection. So, that's a good question. So, if you kind of look at this case and break it down, he had a mental health episode in the Army where he said -- in the National Guard, where he said he was hearing voices and hearing things that made him think about hurting other soldiers. That ended up with him under psychiatric observation for a period of time. That's a stressor, okay? He's suffering from likely depression, sounds like paranoia, and other mental health issues at that time. And then he loses his job. And we understand where he was found may have been in the vicinity of the place where he lost that job. And then we are told by law enforcement sources he broke up with a woman he'd been in a relationship with. So, if you take that as grievances, he had a problem with the National Guard and a problem at work that caused him to lose that job and relationship issues that caused his relationship to break up. And where does he go? He goes out in the town where he was a part of the fabric, one of those who enjoyed hunting and fishing and to the places where he had been before with the person he was having a relationship with and he strikes out. So, in some ways, much less than a mystery, Abby, he's almost a case study of what the active shooter, what the mass shooter looks like based on prior cases and indicators.",

      "sentences": "Well, now that he has been found, that he is obviously found deceased, I think they will be a lot freer to be able to provide some details.I mean, one of the questions that we all have is, you know, we know that they were searching this area, how long -- when did this happen? When did they believe that this happened? We know they searched this area very thoroughly. Certainly, Shimon was there on scene as they were doing some of the initial searches. It's one of the first places they went to. So, the question is, was he somewhere in the woods there and then turned up and then finally ended this. To John's point, I think there's a lot of this that really matches up with what we've seen in a lot of these shootings before. And, unfortunately, Abby, you know, this country, we've had so many of these things. And you know for those of us, me, John, a few others, you know we've done so many of these, we almost know the script. This one has been a little different in the fact that not only do you have two scenes of shootings, right, massacring people, he also gets away for some period. And so that's unusual. So, the question that we have that we're going to hear from a little bit hopefully today is a little more about this investigation, what they've been able to determine, maybe when did this happen, and perhaps a little more about his connection to these two places where he carried out this massacre because it's clear he knew these two places and had a lot of connections to that community.",

It is entirely likely that that, of course, will be the case if it is what it appears to be. We also learned that it was in Lisbon Falls along the banks of the Androscoggin River, that is, at some point, the back end of the recycling center where he once worked and where we are told by sources he was discharged fairly recently. So, that could go to explain if he took his own life, why he picked that spot and what it meant to him. And that is basically what we learned. The things we don't know are -- is it that he showed up in that spot today, having evaded police for a period of almost two days at that point, and did he take his own life right there? Or did he do that right after the shootings? The Commissioner and the Chief didn't really address that, and they probably won't be able to until the medical examiner really examines that body and comes up with a time of death and some judgment about how long that body has been in that place.",

Hopefully, some of that will get cleared up tomorrow morning at the next presser.But it's a really interesting location for this to have come to an end. If you -- there's only about a mile between the recycling facility where he worked and the -- I think it's called the Paper Mill Trail, Miller Park area where the boat launch is located. That is on the smaller river that leads into the Androscoggin. I don't remember the name of it, but it's right there where that river meets the Androscoggin. And there is a trail that runs right along the Androscoggin River. It's about a mile in length between the boat launch and the recycling center, main recycling. So, you know, again, we are -- we're theorizing here because we don't have -- we haven't been given many facts to work with, but it's a wooded area. But as you said, Abby, it's bordered by some streets, some industrial facilities, some other businesses. Lisbon High School is not far away. There are some wooded areas in there. You are right along the river. It's entirely possible that he took that trail right from the parking lot where he left his car and walked one mile to the vicinity of the recycling center. If that's the case, he certainly picked a spot that had the same sort of personal significance as both the bar and the bowling alley. Those have been reported as places he used to go to with his girlfriend, recycling center, he used to work there. So, it's really, and for me, the thing that really rings is the last lead that we had on his location was the night of the shooting, the location of his vehicle. And so, that's where the trail stopped. And so, it's really the very logical place where you would continue to look out in every direction. And a walking trail that leads off of that parking lot in the direction of his former place of employment certainly would be a logical place to --",

We had a little interaction, he and I, because he was throwing us out of the area. That's what he's talking about here. And he told us to leave, because we were in this area that they were searching where they found this suspect dead today.And as you can hear from him, there is this sense of relief, not only here in Lewiston where this happened, but also in Lisbon because the people living there have been stuck in their homes for the past two days. Supermarkets closed, banks, pharmacies, they can't go to their doctors. It's been a very difficult two days. I spoke to a woman today. We went to the supermarket to get food ourselves. And the lines in the supermarket were incredible. To the back, every lane of the supermarket to the back filled. And the fear that people were facing, they couldn't go buy food. Finally, today, they were able to go buy some food. And people were in tears over the fear that they were feeling. So this today, this news for them is an immense relief. You know, here today being at City Hall, we walked in, people were shaking hands, they were happy, they were smiling. Obviously, the next steps here. You also want to highlight something that's very important here. Some of the victims, four of the victims here are part of the deaf community. And you saw the governor in the beginning of the press conference give a hug to the sign language interpreter. That was an important moment. This community -- the deaf community has been really so deeply traumatized and affected by what has happened here and that was just a very touching moment for the governor to give a hug to the sign language interpreter. And I think there's just this sense of relief here that really is unspeakable. For the first time in so many days, people can finally smile and I think that's important to highlight and obviously for the victims what this means. And hopefully in the coming days they can all get together and share memories of their loved ones. And we move on here, onto the investigation and onto the healing.",

It was almost a smile on the Chief's face of relief from all of this. But, you know, this is a community that is going to be seeking answers. If you live in Lisbon, which is the last known location, as Andrew McCabe was just saying, of the suspect, 9:56 P.M. on Wednesday night, his vehicle was found there. So, tell us a little bit about the resources that were brought to bear. It wasn't just these local police departments, state resources, federal resources.

Tomorrow is actually the first day of hunting season and it was going to be stopped in the communities near where the murders occurred because people believed there could be some danger of being in the woods.So, now, the first thing is people can actually go hunting tomorrow, which is an important part of our culture and our lives. But because we had so much gun ownership, we never thought we would have the kind of, you know, shooting that takes place in other places. But this is a reminder to all of us that no one is immune, no community is immune. My district is actually on the border here of Lisbon and Lewiston, but Portland, Maine, most of the communities in my district for the last two days have shut down their schools, as well. Bowdoin, where the suspect lived, people have been nervous, that's in my district. That has been a scene where the police have been searching houses and looking for everything. So, those things can stop, people can start to go back to normal, but this has really impacted our entire state because it's just such an occurrence that we never thought would happen here and having this shooter who people believed was on the loose has just caused great fear in our state.",
