      "sentences": "You know, almost add Juneteenth to the list of those holidays. You know, the federal holiday is not until Monday, Erica, but things have been really busy here and in airports across the country. In fact, the line at one point was past where I'm standing here at the Terminal 2 north checkpoint here at Reagan National Airport.And 2.73 million people screened by TSA at airports across the country yesterday. That is 14 percent higher than the same day last year. In fact, almost reached the post-2020 high mark that we saw on the Friday before Memorial Day when 2.74 million people were screened. So only about 10,000 people shy. The numbers all week have been huge, above 2.4 million people each day. And here's what's happening. Really a confluence of things. Not only the federal holiday of Juneteenth, but also more states recognizing it. It's Father's Day weekend. And, of course, the kickoff to summer travel that happened back on Memorial Day. In fact, it will be even busier in the air than we have seen since the depths of the pandemic. The FAA says it anticipated 52,000 flights nationwide yesterday scheduled by air carriers. About 50,000 today. It dips off a little bit, then comes back bigger even next weekend. So, this is really a huge holiday weekend for travel. Add it to the list with Memorial Day, Labor Day, July 4th. We're really seeing the genesis of what will be a big holiday weekend for years to come. There's also a lot of pent-up demand because of the depths of the pandemic. So, that is causing people to really pay for it. $288 is the average round trip ticket according to travel site Hopper, although this weekend people are really paying more, about $318, Erica.",
