You could hear a pin drop in this room, quite frankly.Let me stand away so you can in fact -- you can't see the pictures anymore. It was remarkable, really, wasn't it, to hear these family members who are clearly in shock, and clearly very angry about the lack of communication from authorities about their loved ones. I thought -- I think it's important to point out that Adrienne, the 66-year-old midwife, was from Be'eri, which the IDF has said was the most badly hit kibbutz. And, listen, you know, a lot of these kibbutzs on the border with Gaza have been very badly hit. The stories that you hear about what happened on Saturday morning are absolutely tragic. But Adrienne was at this Be'eri kibbutz, where she has lived for more than 40 years. Her son Nahar was explaining that he was born there. She's a nurse. And this place witnessed a massacre. And, clearly, you know, she is now missing. And you can just sort of see in Nahar's face, and with his sister here as well, what they're going through at present. As I say, you know, Be'eri is one of the worst hit of what have been terribly hit Kibbutzs. We also heard from the father of a young man who was at the dance festival. And we've been reporting, of course, for the last, sort of, 48 hours, 50 hours now, on the massacre that happened there. A young Israeli -- a young soldier serving here in the IDF, his father we heard from, who is now missing in action. And John and Rachel, whose son, of course, Hersh, was at that festival. I don't think there's much to add, really, as far as the emotion in this room and what we've heard. But they are clearly now appealing to the U.S. administration directly. Appealing to President Biden and appealing to the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to do whatever they can as - and this was my question to them -- we hear much talk of the imminent incursion by the ground, the ground incursion into Gaza at present. The assumption is that these four families here, representing four people who are missing at present, that the understanding, the assumption is that all of these people are being held hostage by Hamas at present.",

And as Nahar, Adrienne's son, just said, look, he said, I understand it - you know, it was a chaotic situation. We - we get that. But the fact that there has been so little or no communication since then from authorities is what is - is so difficult for these family members to deal with at present.And we do know for hours, certainly at the kibbutzs we've had this story retold time and time again, I've heard it from a family at the hospital here yesterday whose son is in ICU, who was at a kibbutz on the border, you hear this story, 6:30 in the morning they heard the rockets. By sort of 8:00 in the morning, 8:20 as Rachel pointed out here, it seems that the militants were overrunning many of these kibbutzs. Look, bombing isn't -- the rocket fire isn't unfamiliar to many who live in these border communities. So, they got into the bunkers, they got into their shelters, as they normally do. But then these places where overrun. These communities were overrun. And for hours these kibbutz members were in these shelters. It was 10, 12, 15 hours before anybody came from the Israeli authorities, from the IDF, to help out. And it was some time after that, that many of the wounded were evacuated from the actual kibbutzs. So, there is this -- certainly this sense of abandonment in the early hours. A real sense of, you know, not being able to understand it, just not being able to understand why it was that nobody came for them. And this real sense of abandonment by authorities. And you're hearing exactly that from these families now. Just not -- not just on the part of the Israelis, but on the part of the U.S. administration at this point as well.",

I'm hearing explosions in the sky above me. There are detonations probably linked with the attacks that are going on in Gaza at the moment. You can see just - if, John, if you're able to pan a little bit around there, you can probably see some of the smoke rising up from Gaza.We are relatively close here, in a secure location. But the targets in Gaza have been the Hamas firing sites. The Hamas leadership. Islamic jihad firing points leadership as well, but Hamas specifically is what the Israeli defense force say that they are targeting. [09:45:05] And I'm looking there in the sky. It looks like a number of rockets have just been launched from Gaza. One, two, three, four. You don't really hear them being launched. At night you can see the fiery trail. But right now, I'm looking at them in the sky. And the fact that they haven't been intercepted yet would indicate to me that they're potentially on their way to central Israel. Maybe sort of Tel Aviv area. And I would expect the Iron Domes further north in Israel to try to be intercepting those soon. But, again, impossible to say. I've just seen the trails of the rockets. They weren't there a few seconds ago. It's a dynamic situation. This vantage point allows you to sort of see what's going on here. But the Iron Dome intercepts, that when the coastline is being attacked, there is Ashkelon where the power station is, further north along the coast is Ashdod. And when they're being attacked there, you really get a strong view of the Iron Dome in -- trying to intercept. And I'm hearing some distant - distant fire in this direction, which is maybe the intercept of those rockets we were looking at there just underway.",

We just saw five Humvees with about a dozen IDF soldiers in each of those Humvees heading in a the direction of Gaza.And at the same time, minutes ago, we just had a barrage of rockets, Iron Dome intercepts, right overhead where we were. We actually went - we're standing right in front of a shelter. There was a woman here who was delivering meals, food for those troops who are mobilizing at this moment. She rushed into the shelter. And we were all headed in the same direction. But, again, there is this sense that life is still going on here. And yet, at the same time, there is a calm sense of slight concern. One woman stopped here on the side of the road to ask us if we could come with her to get her gas tank filled at the gas station, simply because she is afraid of those rockets overhead. Does not want to be alone. Wants to feel some sense of security. She tried to flag down a police officer to do the same. So, on the one hand, you have life continuing. But on the other hand you have this eerie sense that life is not as it typically is here, and certainly a sense of concern, a sense of fear, and also a sense that this country is gearing up for something much bigger as all of these troops head to the border.",

More specifically about hostages or - and - and the missing, there's been no contact whatsoever. And the lists, of course, are growing, because more and more is becoming revealed outside of the fog of war about the people who we just could not track down and realize that they are, in fact, not with us, and somewhere in Gaza. Not being contacted in general, and in this - including the American government, but that's not, at least from my perspective, that's not the main thrust here. It's what to do now. And I would like to believe that even if it is the barbarianism of Hamas, and they've proven it, they've proven it. I'm a man of peace, but they have shown their colors. There's no question. They are not all of Gaza. But they are a sickness. And I don't know what the future of negotiations would look like, and -- but I do know that forces of good in the world, in the same way that they came together to defeat, at least temporary, ISIS, have the power to come together to create a better ending to this than without those combined forces of good.
