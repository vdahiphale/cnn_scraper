      "sentences": "Well, Capitol Hill is waking up to a new reality this morning with a 51-49 majority for Democrats in the U.S. Senate. That's all thanks to voters in Georgia who have reelected Raphael Warnock. CNN projects Warnock will win the Georgia runoff by a slim margin. It's his second runoff victory in just two years. Warnock will defeat former Republican challenger former football star Herschel Walker and now serve a full six-year term in the Senate. Walker carried the vast majority of Georgia's rural counties while Senator Warnock ran up the margins in the cities, especially Atlanta. He promised that in his first full term he will represent all Georgians.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): But here's my promise to you, I will walk with you even as I work for you. Because here is what I've learned as a pastor, you can't lead the people unless you love the people. You can't love the people unless you know the people and you can't know the people unless you walk among the people. You cannot serve me if you cannot see me. And so, during these difficult days, even as I work on specific public policy proposals and I offer bills and work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get those bills passed, I just want you to know that I see you.

      "sentences": "It's a big deal, Bianna, so I'm glad you are asking it. Because some would say, look, Democrats already had control of the Senate at 50-50. So, you know, what is really one more count? You know, how much more of a big deal is it? And it is because at 51 it's going to give us control over the committees that oversee the Senate and all of the issues that the Senate has jurisdiction. And that I think is incredibly important. And I will not under estimate some of the reasons why voters might have gone to the polls especially on our side and, frankly, independents as well as they saw House Republicans and Kevin McCarthy really focus on instead of the things they promised during the election of governing and focusing on solutions for inflation, the economy, crime, border, all of the things that they talked about that Democrats did so horribly and that Republicans were going to come in and change, instead what is the first thing that they announce?They announce investigations. They threaten impeachment. They want to have Biden's cabinet resign or else. And so that to me indicates -- and I think frankly to a lot of voters indicates that Republican leadership, Republican control actually means additional chaos, more chaos, not governing. And so, I think that gave an additional reason for people to go to the polls in Georgia to say, look, we want reasonable solutions. We want people who are going to be focusing on our problems. And that's why I think Warnock was so smart when he continues to talk about bringing everyone together, representing everyone in Georgia, including the people who did not vote for him. Because his message along be with so many Democrats that won in the Senate, and frankly, a lot in the House too, where we also did a lot better than expectations is because we focused on solutions. We focused on bringing people together. We focused on governing. And that I think did Democrats a lot of good.",

      "sentences": "And Karen let's pick up on that. That's a good point that Maria raises. Because Warnock went out of his way not to only appeal to progressives in the state but to moderates as well and even those Republicans who were not willing to vote or a bit, let's just say, upset with some of Herschel Walker's rhetoric and his past. And we saw Warnock continue throughout this campaign to talk about his work across the aisle with Republicans. Now that he will be back in the Senate for another six years, what do you make of this hope, at least, for more bipartisanship not only in this lame duck, obviously, but in 2023 ahead?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's going to be a challenge. It should be but I think it will be as Maria pointed out. We know that the agenda on the House side is going to be driven by investigations. That being said, now that Democrats have full control, real control of the Senate, it does give some leverage to try to reach out, you know, to the other chamber to say, look, many people are up for re-election in 2024. We need to get a few things done and to try to see if there are some small places where perhaps they can move some things forward.But the other thing that I think is critically important, couple things here, it gives Democrats in the Senate the opportunity to, as some of us in Washington would say, stop bad things from happening. So, some of the legislative or some of the more message type legislation that may come from the Republicans in the House will be stopped by Democrats in the Senate. And that will also set up, again, because one of the things as Charlie was mentioning the Republicans have to worry about is the extremism label. Not just Trump but Trumpism. And so, you know, the more you see Democrats, both in the House and now in the Senate really talking about solutions, that says -- you know, leaves out of the equation what are the Republicans going to do? And if you then see Republicans in the House being more extreme and you don't see Republicans in the Senate willing to work with Democrats, again, that sets up sort of a messaging narrative going into the 2024 elections where we have both the presidential and a pretty tough Senate map as well.",

How he's walking with the people even though they may not have voted with him in trying to get things done, unity across the aisle. Those are the two take aways for me.",

But right now, Donald Trump is still the biggest draw among Republican voters. The most popular person who is up for 2024. So, will they be able to do it? If they can't, Joe Biden will win again. If they do, I think it could be a new day for the Republican Party and American politics.",

Twice now it's the voters of Georgia who literally have fundamentally helped to change the direction of this country.And I think what that says for the Democratic party is we need to continue to learn the lessons of how important our ground game is. The that has a lot to do with how and why we won in Georgia. I worked on the 2021 special election. So, let's keep learning those lessons. For the Republican Party, well, it's nice to see them finally talking about quitting Donald Trump, this is not a profile in courage. It is the American people who stood up and stood firm and said, no, we're not going back to 2020, we're moving forward.",

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, where he said the country's path to independence lies to a free Donetsk Luhansk and Crimea. For more on this development Scott McLean joins me now. Scott let's return to these drone attacks that occurred in Russia.

But you're right, there's a lot of questions for the Americans right now because they're the largest arms supplier to Ukraine. But officially their policy has been to not supply these kind of weapons because, of course, they're worried about a multitude of things. But primarily they're worried that any strikes deep inside of Russian territory could intentionally escalate this kind of conflict.So, American officials from State and from the Defense Department were asked this over and over again, some version of the same question. The State Department's spokesperson, Ned Price was asked point blank whether or not the U.S. had provided these weapons and he said very plainly, no. Another State Department official Victoria Newman was asked whether the U.S. policy on not providing these weapons had changed at all. She also said very plainly, no. And so, perhaps though because we also know that there is a Ukrainian state-owned weapon manufacturer that said that it has developed the capability of long-range drones and successfully tested them, perhaps the U.S. is enabling that kind of development. And so, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked about that yesterday and here's his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia, but the important thing is to understand what Ukrainians are living through every day with the ongoing Russian aggression against their country. (END VIDEO CLIP) MCLEAN: So, not enabling, not encouraging according to Antony Blinken. But the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was asked whether the U.S. was doing anything to prevent Ukraine from getting those kinds of weapons and his answer was, no. So, not encouraging, not preventing either.",
