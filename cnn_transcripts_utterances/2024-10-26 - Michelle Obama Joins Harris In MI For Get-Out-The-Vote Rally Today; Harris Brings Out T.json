I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York in this weekend for Fredricka Whitfield.Jim Sciutto is in Jerusalem following that breaking news out of the Middle East. We're going to get to him in just a moment. But, first, it's the top of the hour and we begin with the race for the White House. Today, both candidates are holding rallies in Battleground Michigan. It's a state that is critical to their path to the White House. And any moment now, former President Donald Trump will speak to a crowd in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. This is his second campaign rally in the state in the past two days. It's a big day in that critical swing state. Right now, voters are heading to the polls for the very first day of statewide early voting. And nationwide, more than 30 million people have already voted. New CNN polling released Friday shows that the two candidates are tied, with each getting support from 47 percent of likely voters. Let's go to CNN's Alayna Treene who joins us now from that Trump campaign rally in Michigan. So, Alayna, give us a sense of the timing, how soon before we see the former president, and what can we expect to hear from him today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, I expect that he's going to be taking the stage any moment now maybe before I even get off this interview with you. But, look, you mentioned early voting. That is something I have to say that the Trump campaign is leaning very heavily into to now -- into now.And I expect you're going to hear Donald Trump today talk about that as well. Already we've heard some of his advisers, including Dan Scavino, Stephen Miller, encourage people in the crowd here to vote early. And I bring that up because it is notable. Donald Trump for years has been very skeptical of early voting. I'd argue he's still skeptical and has criticized it in the past. But when I talked to his senior advisers, they say we need every single tool in the toolbox to get people out to vote. So that's going to be a key message, I think, here today. But also, really, what this final 10 days is for the Trump campaign is him delivering closing arguments. Trump's advisers say that tomorrow, when he is in New York at Madison Square Garden for that very large rally, that will be kind of a culmination of what he wants that closing argument to be. So that's what you'll hear some of today as well. He's going to talk about the economy. He's going to talk about the border. He's going to continue leaning in to those personal attacks against Harris. All things we've really heard him been doing and kind of escalating in recent weeks. But Rahel, I also just want to bring your attention to that Joe Rogan podcast that he had been interviewed for yesterday, that he recorded yesterday. They're bringing him on right now. I told you this would happen. So -- but to get back to the Rogan interview, he recorded a podcast with Joe Rogan for about three hours yesterday, a very long time. Donald Trump actually remarked last night in Michigan that it was the longest interview he thinks he has ever done. Now, part of the reason that is so important is one, of course, Rogan is very popular. He has more than 14 million followers on Spotify, more than 17 billion on YouTube, and this has been something that the Trump campaign has been working hard toward for several months. They really viewed that as kind of the cherry on top of their overall strategy, this cycle, to really try and reach male voters, specifically young male voters, as well as low propensity voters, voters who are not typically political. Now, listening through it, it wasn't very much of like a hard interview. We didn't hear Rogan really pin him down on anything that we haven't heard before. But I do think it was really an opportunity for Donald Trump to have a conversation with him and potentially reach audience members that perhaps didn't think of voting for him or didn't think of voting before.

He's a podcast host and also an investigative reporter for The Shade Room, that's a website that focuses on celebrity, politics and trending news and predominantly focused on the African American community. Justin, great to have you. Thanks for joining us today. You know, the Vice President has been really leaning in as you know on star power in recent weeks, Beyonce. Willie Nelson joined her last night in Texas. Bruce Springsteen campaigned with her a few days ago in Georgia, obviously, Obama. Justin, how much do you think these celebrities really matter to voters? What are you hearing? JUSTIN CARTER, HOST &amp; INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"THE SHADE ROOM\" PODCAST: Yes. And Rahel, thank you so much for having me. I've been following you since your Philly days. I'm from Philly myself. So it's so good to hear your voice. Yes, yes, yes. The million dollar question is, will the celebrity, the star power move the needle forward? And I think it definitely gets people's ears perked up, especially those younger voters. You know, Beyonce and Kelly, hello, I mean, star power, talk about star power last night. So does it move the needle forward? I don't necessarily think it moves the needle forward. I think a lot of young people, a lot of people know who they're going to vote for as we're so close to Election Day. But I think what it does do is it gets people excited to get to the polls, whether they voted already or not voted at all or maybe they're waiting for Election Day and maybe for those last minute voter who decide to register late. You know, there's some states that allow you to register super late. So, you know, maybe this is an opportunity, you know, bringing these stars. There's so many of them coming out the woodwork now, super excited to register and to get out there to the polls. You have to physically get people to the polls. SOLOMON: Yes. It's an interesting point. My guests in the last hour said that this could really come down to who has the better turn out the vote machine. And to that point, Harris is holding a get-out-the- vote rally in Michigan with former first lady, Michelle Obama. And as we talked about former President Obama was on the campaign trail with her and has been for the last few days. Talk to me a little bit specifically, Justin, about the Obamas specifically, I mean, how impactful are they?",

And I think that is a key strategy with the Harris campaign right now is, you know, any excitement that they can garner from any demographic they're going to do.And Michelle Obama is a huge figure, huge, huge figure amongst everyone, black and white, every demographic, Hispanic. So, I mean, I just read that she has like a 61 percent favorability percentage. And so that goes a long way. And she's also known for going viral. You know, you hear the terms, you know, they go low, we go high. You know, that was trending years ago in the election. So, I think using the Obamas to their advantage could help move the needle as well. You know, again, they were very, very popular, especially amongst that black voters.

It was a focus here in Kalamazoo several months ago before she even actually became the nominee, where she was joined by a former Trump administration official in an appeal to conservative and Republican women about reproductive rights. It's just that this time she'll be joined on stage in Kalamazoo with former First Lady Michelle Obama. And when we heard Obama last address Democrats in a big way, it was at the DNC, where she essentially leaned on Democratic voters to get off of the sidelines, to not be delicate if in this truncated campaign you didn't hear from the campaign directly that this election is just too urgent. But take a listen to how Vice President Harris is framing this issue of reproductive rights. (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: One in three American women lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban.

It had been anticipating for some time Israel's retaliatory attack on Iran following Iran's ballistic missile barrage some three weeks ago, and now the region waiting to see what comes next.A short time ago, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris joined a call with their national security staff regarding the Israeli strike and what might follow. Prior to that, President Joe Biden had said that he hopes this is the end of this cycle of retaliation we've seen over recent weeks. Iranian officials and Iranian state media are calling the effects of this attack limited. Israel is communicating that it has now completed its military action against Iran, at least for now. I'm joined now by Arlette Saenz at the White House, Matthew Chance here with me in East Jerusalem. I wonder if I could go to you first, Arlette, to describe how the White House is receiving the news of this strike overnight. President Biden said the U.S. did get advance warning. This was coming. Is it your view that they are breathing something of a sigh of relief now that this strike was not as large, perhaps as provocative as they had worried in recent weeks, including the possibility of strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure?

A senior administration official last night said that these risk -- actions by Israel overnight were very much done in self defense and were proportionate to what they had been discussing before. But all of this comes even as of right now, there seems to be the fact that they've avoided an all-out war in this moment. This does come at a very delicate and challenging time in the political landscape back in the U.S. as there are still many Americans frustrated with the Biden administration's response to the conflict in the Middle East, specifically the way that they've been dealing with Israel. And it's an issue that could be a liability for Vice President Kamala Harris heading into the election and just over a week, especially in a critical battleground state like Michigan, which has a large population of young voters and Arab American voters who are very frustrated with the way that the administration's handled all of this.",

You had no Israeli deaths. You did have one Palestinian that was killed in the West Bank. They don't have air defense for the Palestinians in the West Bank. That was it. And that was on the back of not only Israel assassinating Hamas' leader in Tehran on the date of the inauguration of the president. But also on the back of Israel repeatedly blowing up the capabilities and the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is, by far, Iran's most capable proxy and it's essential deterrence against Israel. So what we are seeing here is that the Iranians have very little capability to respond to Israel. And that means they're very concerned about what might lead to a war. That's why they showed restraint for the second time in the last several months when we've had Israel versus Iran trading blows. Certainly, the Israelis are the ones that are then determining what kind of escalation they'll be. And the fact that this was delayed by several weeks, the fact that the Americans, in advance, remember, promised to provide THAD missile defense systems, which we're immediately set up on the ground in Israel. And also, that the Americans put sanctions on ships that had shut down their transponders, and that we're helping to illegally get Iranian crude exported for hardcover currency out of the country.

That's the headline with Israel, vis-a-vis, Iran as well. So, yes, Israel has escalation dominance in this war against all of its adversaries that encircle it but aren't existential threats to Israel. They can't be because Israel is so strong militarily. I mean, if someone had -- had done this to the United States -- imagine Trump wins the presidency. He invites the Israeli prime minister to the inauguration, and then the Iranians assassin tonight him on inauguration day in Blair House across from the White House. Do you think the Americans would wait for four weeks and then and then warned the Iranians that advanced. Here's what's coming and then no Iranians died? No, there'd be regime change efforts from the United States almost immediately.",

First, you're thinking, can I normalize my relations fully with the gulf states? Can I normalize relations with the United States of America? And in other words, give myself a chance to actually rebuild in the region and more broadly, geopolitically, or, do I need nuclear weapons?

The U.S. didn't want that. The administration pushed back. As you mentioned, they send a quite capable missile defense system in the THAD here, perhaps to help ward off another Iranian attack.

I mean, the Israelis just not really responding there. But in this specific instance, I do think a level of greater Israeli restraint, if we can call it that, against Iran is because of America can efforts, both carrots and sticks, mostly carrots in this case, as you mentioned, with Israel over the last month. I think that, in this case, the U.S. deserves some credit for helping to mitigate what would otherwise likely have been more significant Israeli strikes against Iran, perhaps against some of their leadership. Certainly, I think they were prepared to make attacks against oil capabilities that the Iranians have. And we've seen none of that from Israel with these last strikes over the past 24 hours.",

It was also and is ground zero in terms of one of the most draconian laws in the whole country that have come about because of Donald Trump and what he did to select three members of the United States in court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And I'm here now in Kalamazoo in Michigan to talk with the folks here about their priorities around ensuring that this election produces a president of the United States who honors and protects a woman's right to make decisions about our own body. I'm about to go and meet with some of the physicians who are on the frontlines of this issue for addressing the harm that has resulted from these Trump abortion bans.
