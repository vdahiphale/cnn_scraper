The markets and the events that we're talking about: The United States has been in direct contact with Niger's military leaders and urged them to step aside. Saudi Aramco plans to give an extra $10 billion to shareholders, which of course, includes the Saudi government. And Zoom, the latest company to tell its employees, or at least some of them, it's time to come home to the office. We are live in New York. Together we have a week ahead of us. Monday, the 7th of August. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business. Good evening. The United States says it has told Niger's coup leaders to step aside as they dig in for a fight with their neighbors. ECOWAS, which is the bloc of Western African nations that you will be familiar with says it will meet on Thursday to discuss its next move. Yesterday was the group's deadline for the military junta to stand down or face possible military intervention. You see them out there. The military has been bringing troops into the capital, and thousands of people have rallied there on Sunday in support of the new government. A spokesperson called on the young people to defend the country.

So what we saw on Friday was the Secretary of State announce that there is a pause in terms of US foreign assistance to Niger. It is not all of the assistance that the US gives to the country, it doesn't include humanitarian aid or food support, but there is a pause in terms of some of those programs that the United States typically gives to Niger, and they continue to watch this space. You know, when we asked the State Department spokesperson, just this afternoon, if there's a point person for the US from the State Department who is kind of running the lead on the talks with officials in Niger, the military junta, they declined to comment on any specific person doing that are any specific meetings or trips that are occurring, saying they would give us more information, you know, when they could. But it is clear that there is contact between the US and Niger that's ongoing. The spokesperson also said, in the last seven to 10 days, there has been direct contact between the US officials and the military junta in Niger. Of course, as you included in the introduction, pushing them to back down, so they are trying to take advantage of this moment in time, where they hope that there could be a return to a democratically elected control of the country.",

Like I'm-- I work in both the office and I work remotely, so I can juggle running the company and getting my kids to wherever they need to go. But I'm in the office when there's a purpose, you know, for collaboration on projects, team building, training, mentoring, brainstorming, you get the idea. I think -- I think two things can be true at the same time. Remote work has its benefits and it has its challenges. So, I think you -- as you mentioned our polling that we recently did here in the U.S. And in that polling, we found that employees get this. They know that some work is performed better in person, especially when it requires collaboration. So, for example, 82 percent of workers say team building is better handled in person. But I think employees have also deep and valid concerns about commuting times and work life balance.",

I think it's to listen to your employees and be flexible. So, I think it means seeking their input and taking that into consideration. And I think flexibility may mean permitting remote work for individual tasks or rethinking traditional work schedules. Having collaborative time in the workplace, I think the key is that most employees agree that a certain degree of impersonal work is important. They just don't like mandates and rigid rules on how they get their work done.",
