      "sentences": "At any moment, Louisiana could become the first state to label abortion pills as dangerous, a move that has been widely criticized by health care professionals.A first-of-its-kind bill is waiting to be signed by the governor right now after being passed by the Senate yesterday. This legislation is intended to do three things. First, it will make it a crime to give abortion medication to someone without their consent. Second, it will reclassify Mifepristone and Misoprostol as class-4 controlled substances. This is a designation that would require physicians to have a special license to prescribe the pills. And every time they do prescribe them, the state would track the doctor, the pharmacy, and the patient involved. And third, it will make it a crime to possess abortion pills without a prescription. To give some context, since 2022, abortion has been banned in Louisiana with no exceptions for rape or incest. And Mifepristone and Misoprostol are commonly used for conditions other than medicated abortions. Doctors say they routinely used Misoprostol to treat miscarriages, stop obstetric hemorrhaging after birth, ripen the cervix to induce labor, and prepare the cervix for surgical procedures, IUD insertion or uterine biopsy among them. With me now, is the Louisiana State Senator who sponsored this bill, Thomas Pressly. Sir, thank you for taking the time to be with us. And first off, I am so sorry for what happened to your sister. I know you've widely discussed this. Her then-husband was sentenced to prison time this year for spiking her drinks back in 2022 with abortion pill medication to try to terminate her pregnancy. It's horrific. I think anyone familiar with the details of it knows that. I do, though, want to talk to you about what's in this bill that you did not initially include in it for the purpose of prosecuting -- for the purpose of prosecuting situations like the one that your sister was in. That is going to make Mifepristone and Misoprostol Schedule IV drugs, which was ultimately tacked on. Why vote for that additional piece? STATE REP. THOMAS PRESSLY (R-LA): Yes. Thank you so much for having me on. As you mentioned, my sister was the victim of a horrible domestic violence attack where her then-husband tried to grind up Misoprostol seven different times and put it into her drinks trying to kill my now-22-month-old niece and significantly harm my sister and her health. Look, this bill is intended to ensure that doctors, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants have the opportunity to write these medications. And they will be dispensed at pharmacies throughout the state of Louisiana. That's going to continue when it's for a legitimate health care reason. As you mentioned, Louisiana has already outlawed abortion. So we're just trying to put some guardrails in place so that bad actors do not get these medications and use them in harmful ways like that, that my brother-in-law tried to do with my sister.",

It's a very common occurrence for scheduled drugs to be prescribed by doctors, by nurse practitioners, by physician's assistants and dispensed at pharmacies throughout Louisiana.

That's coming in. Prosecutors made it very clear that they want to introduce parts of the messages from that laptop as evidence against Hunter Biden. But they said today clearly that they don't want to introduce everything, just a couple of specific messages. And the judge agreed to allow Hunter's attorneys to challenge the authenticity of some of those messages. The prosecutors wanted the judge to just instruct the jury that it was all authentic, but she didn't want to go that far. She'll let Hunter's team question the authenticity and legitimacy of specific messages. So that was good for the president's son. But Special Counsel David Weiss and his prosecutors also got some wins in these pretrial rulings. Specifically, Boris and Brianna, they got a broad interpretation of the gun law that is at the heart of this trial. They will need to prove, to win a conviction, that Hunter Biden was using drugs around the time when he bought this gun in 2018. They won't have to specifically prove that he used drugs on the exact day. So that ruling from the judge might make it easier for them to win a conviction. Guys, the hearing is still underway. Hunter Biden is in there. The special counsel is in there as well. And as you mentioned, this trial is just 10 days away.",
