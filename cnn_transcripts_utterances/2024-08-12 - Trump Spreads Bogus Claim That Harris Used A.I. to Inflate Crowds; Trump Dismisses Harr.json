Look, Jim, I mean, I think for as much as we talk about election conspiracy theories and lies and everything else, I think it's really hard to grasp just how ingrained this all is, right? Whereas some of us might have forgotten, most normal people, unlike you and me, Jim, who don't think about Trump and politics and the news all the time, might have forgotten about just how pervasive these conspiracy theories was. For people who are kind of in this MAGA media universe, it's the only thing they've been hearing every single day for four years. And the conspiracy theories have built and they're snowballed. And Jim, look, last time in 2020, the conspiracy theory was if Trump -- the only way Trump can lose is if it's stolen.",

Kamala Harris doesn't have that going against her.

You put him in front of a podium where he does a press conference, you put him in front of a podium in front of a large crowd, he spreads misinformation. And I think the issue is, and the reason partially why the Harris campaign is rising, is he is struggling to define her. He is not able to throw the same attacks that he did at Joe Biden at Kamala Harris, and he is also obsessed at looking backwards.So, Kamala Harris has done things like consolidate the Democratic base. We've seen a huge jump in the black vote, in the Latino vote, young voters. We've also seen independent voters and those critical double haters breaking their way in that New York Times/Siena poll. Trump and Vance are like minus seven, minus nine and Harris and Walz are plus two and plus eleven. If people like you, that's a good position to be in when you're running for president.

The Russians right now are mounting a massive push in the east of Ukraine to try and gain territory from the Ukrainians, and the Ukrainians are hoping with their move into Russian territory that they'll make the Russians move some of those forces that are putting pressure on the Ukrainians in Ukraine's East to that area that the Ukrainians are now sweeping through as well.

And with the advent of social media, and other avenues, they're able to connect with one another. And these organizations are able to grow.
