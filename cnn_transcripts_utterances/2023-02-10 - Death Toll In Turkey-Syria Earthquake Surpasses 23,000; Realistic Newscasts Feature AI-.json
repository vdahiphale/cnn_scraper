Now, there's a cost to it and, I'm sorry, Congressman Kinzinger just said, there is a cost to them. There is a cost to us. Those Sidewinder missiles cost about three hundred eighty, four hundred thousand dollars. So every time they put a cheap balloon out, or some other object, we have to take it down.

Now speaking purely as an intelligence guy, I was amused a bit by those who were complaining about the Chinese balloon being an Intelligence failure, but yet also complained because we took the time to learn something about it and it's not like we can fly over China and observe one of their balloons. So this was an opportunity to gain Intelligence. And so I think that that may have been a valid argument. All to say, I think it would be a good thing if we had a protocol that could be explained both to the public and especially to the Congress about as the ground rules.",

Their apartment is flattened. My country manager ran out with his children, as he said, the walls were crumbling around him. I mean, my stomach fell. I felt physically ill. And, you know, right now, we've been trying to scramble to get aid into not just that area, but also yes, as you were mentioning there, across the border, and to Syria with very little resources. Because our organization, INARA, like so many others who would normally be responding to this using our staff on the ground, well, our staff are now, you know, survivors and victims of what has taken place. We managed to get one truck out tonight, I've got more boxes waiting to go in the next 24 hours. I'm heading down there, myself.

They died because they didn't have the diesel to run the heavy machinery that was already in country. They died because the resources simply weren't there.
