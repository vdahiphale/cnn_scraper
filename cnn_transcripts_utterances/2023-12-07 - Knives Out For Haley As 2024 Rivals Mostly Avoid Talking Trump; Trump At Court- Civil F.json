She says they're just jealous as she wants new endorsements and climbs in early state polls. But it's of course, all relative.Haley may now be in second place in states like New Hampshire and South Carolina, but she is still 20 or 30 points behind Donald Trump. Trump, of course, was once again not on the debate stage. She was where you see him now in New York City, particularly in a courtroom in Manhattan. That is where he is as we speak. Listen to what he said just before going into the courtroom, it's for a civil fraud trial threatening his business. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, 45TH U.S. PRESIDENT: She is a witch hunt the likes of which probably nobody has ever seen. We have put on a case that is absolutely 100 percent where there is not a judge in the country that wouldn't have given us a total victory. But there's not a judge in the country that would have been taken this case because it is a witch hunt and it's a very corrupt trial. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

One of the things when I watched the debate stage last night that I kept asking myself was, DeSantis was unloading the opposition research book onto Nikki Haley. And he was trying to get out every single piece of research they had on her, which a, shows they see her as a real threat in this moment of the campaign.And b, my question myself was, I wonder if he's going to continue to press that on the campaign trail in a way that we really haven't seen as much or is he's just going to leave that to this high-profile moment in the debate stage. We'll see in Iowa. He obviously continued in the Fox News interview. Notice, he said, he loves to tie the donors' thing, the fact that she has some Wall Street donors and the Koch network, to some people who had previously supported Hillary Clinton. This is also while one of the Super PACs supporting him is up with an ad tying Nikki Haley to Hillary Clinton. And as he did last night, he is trying to make her not one of us, meaning conservative and tried and true conservative the way that the base is in Iowa, that's going to show up to the caucuses. And that I think is going to be his mission for these next several weeks to sort of other her as something that is establishment, more Democratic leaning, and not really one of us.

Or make a claim to have him one last night. Nicky had a worst performance of any of these debates but that's from a high bar. And it's also -- she also last night was clearly the frontrunner, which is a good place to be on any debate stage.Chris Christie dominated the stage, which is always a good place to be. And Ron DeSantis had his best performance so far. So, you know, how that all matters. I don't know how many persuadable voters were watching last night. And so even though, I think Vivek Ramaswamy's attacks were reasonable and grotesque and deranged. I don't think they matter that much. Because no one's going to be replaying them a lot, except in the context of -- look at what a jerk this guy was. And look how well Nicky handled it. So, the only other takeaway I would have -- and this is true, of all of these debates, if you take Ramaswamy out. When you don't have Trump on the stage, this is still pretty a Reaganite party. The arguments I mean, Nicky and DeSantis don't actually disagree on very much. They just say the other one is lying about what they say their positions are. And here's some oppo research to prove it.

And that will change the calculus for people of their understanding of him in this race. Obviously, he has a long shot for the nomination.
