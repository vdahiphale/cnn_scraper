Georgia's elections chief, Gabe Sterling, who I'm going to be speaking with in just a moment, has told us that more than 1.8 million Georgians voted earlier by mail, almost 1.9 million. You'd see the numbers here. That's incredible numbers, record breaking numbers for a midterm runoff. And both parties have poured an incredible amount of money and resources into this race because while Democrats will still control the Senate next year, regardless of today's outcome, what a Warnock win does is give Democrats more leverage. Right all of a sudden, Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Manchin, that whole rubric changes. And it includes then that they can get nominees confirmed faster. It would also give the party a one seat advantage in the congressional committees that are now evenly split, right? So there are real tangible things that would happen here for Democrats. And Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema can't single handedly control their party's agenda anymore if Warnock prevails. We are watching breaking news also out of New York this hour, Trump's companies found guilty on all counts by a Manhattan jury, including tax fraud, falsifying business records and conspiracy. The attorney for Trump Org just responding. And we're going to have more on that in a moment. First, though, teams covering both the campaign's in Georgia tonight. Eva McKend is with Warnock.

That was also evident among student organizers this week working with the campaign, they indicated to me that they were more confident now.Still, Senator Warnock expressing cautious optimism again this morning to his supporters, cautioning them saying listen, Herschel Walker still has a real path to victory here and that Republican voters tend to come out on Election Day.

You know, this is the general election, this is a month ago, so it's not going to match those numbers. The question is, how far down? And so, if it's higher than anticipated, what is happening? Is the Walker campaign with Brian Kemp's help? Remember, the popular Republican governor. Herschel Walker gets 49 percent four weeks ago, Governor Kemp gets 54 -- 53 percent and change. He has given his turnout operation over to the Walker campaign, which was not the case four weeks ago. Is that why? Is Brian Kemp helping Herschel Walker turnout votes? If so, that could make a difference. Or, or is the Warner campaign realizing you had a shorter early voting window? They thought they were very successful in that early voting window, but it closed on Friday. So are they doing a good job running through their list? Who didn't show up by Friday and getting their voters to turn out today on Election Day? That's the mystery of the election or both campaigns.

That's the big question. And that's the question that's going to be -- this election will help settle, it will fully settle.But here's why, if you look at this. So, just four weeks ago, Warnock's in the runoff, he's the leading candidate. But just by 37,675 votes, on that very same day, on that very same day, the Republican governor wins in a landslide by nearly 300,000 votes. So a Republican governor and incumbent who you see all this blue around Atlanta suburbs, yes, Brian Kemp lost the Atlanta suburbs, but look at the difference, right? He's getting in Cobb County, he's getting 47 percent Brian Kemp, compared to Herschel Walker, who's getting only 40 percent, margins matter where the people live in the popular suburbs. So, is this a race? What is Georgia? It is clearly a state that a mainstream Republican can win and win quite comfortably. But Wolf, it is also, go back in time to 2020 in the presidential race, it's also a race that a Democrat can win Joe Biden by only 11,000 votes, almost 12,000 votes. Remember 12,000 votes call that in 2020. Go back to 2016, Donald Trump wins it in 2016. Let me get it in here by 211,000 votes and change. So what happened between 2016 and 2020? Well, Donald Trump became toxic in the suburbs, toxic in the suburb. So, a Donald Trump Republican has trouble in the suburbs, not just in Georgia, but everywhere. A Brian Kemp Republican can cut the margins in the suburbs and win comfortably. Who is Herschel Walker? How does Warnock perform? That's what we find out just a couple hours.",

This was an off the books compensation scheme where employees receive corporate apartments, a car leases, and the case of one top executive private school tuition for his grandchildren. These counts included scheme to defraud, conspiracy, three counts of tax fraud and multiple counts of falsifying business records. Now, the district attorney for Manhattan, Alvin Bragg, said that this verdict shows that there is one standard of justice in Manhattan is saying that this was everyone should be treated equally under the law. Now the Trump Organization said that they will appeal this verdict. And the judge said that sentencing for next month, now that for January when they will be back in court.The company faces under the statute a maximum of $1.6 million in fines. And while there's no mechanism under New York law for a company indicted and found guilty of a felony to face any sort of dissolution or unwinding, the -- guilty verdict against the company can make it very difficult for them to do business. It can make it tougher for them to get financing, to make it tougher for them to get contracts. So, the full impact of this is still unknown.

Even though the control of the Senate was not at play as Republicans certainly had hoped it would be at the time of this runoff, it certainly still provides an opportunity for Republicans to effectively control half of the committees in the Senate to slow down nominations for the White House and to make things more difficult for the President. So that certainly has been a big motivating factor for Republicans.And as I'm speaking to advisors to the Warnock campaign, they are heartened by these high turnout numbers. As the Secretary of State's office was just telling you a few moments ago, this turnout might hit 1.3 or 1.4 million Election Day turnout alone. And the Walker campaign certainly likes to hear that, you know, and certainly that was a message because Republicans are here in Georgia trying to send a message to the White House and the President. Of course, now, there are many Democratic votes in this Election Day turnout as well. So we'll have to see how this shakes out in the final 90 minutes or so a voting. But certainly, Joe Biden was front and center in this race, even though he never traveled to Georgia during this campaign because the Warnock campaign asked him not to. They said he was simply too toxic and could turn off some of those voters in the middle.

So everything was slowed down by being a 50-50 Senate. And so, having him there is going to make us be able to push balanced judges onto the court.
