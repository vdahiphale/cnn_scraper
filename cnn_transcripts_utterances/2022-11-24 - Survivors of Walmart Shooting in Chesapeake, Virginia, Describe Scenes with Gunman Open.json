Apparently, the suspect did have occasional outbursts, some of them directed at the gay community, other directed at other races.And it's interesting, Kraus was also telling me that after the suspect was involved in this bomb threat on his mother, after that case was dropped and sealed, Xavier Kraus hoped that his friend might get life back on track, and clearly that didn't happen. Kraus says we were about the same age. Kraus said it really struck me. I was living across the hall with my girlfriend, the suspect was living on the other side with their mother. And, you know, he also said that the suspect was very proud of the weapons and showed them off to Kraus. And that made Kraus feel a little uncomfortable. And he raised that, and the suspect said, you know, it's not the guns you got to be afraid of, bro, it's the people. And Kraus said that that has really sort of sat with him. He feels terrible for his friend, terrible for the victims. And I just want to end on one thing, because we can't make this all about the suspect. Club Q, this was a small LGBTQ community here, and it's going to be very difficult for them to recover, they say.

And what is really interesting is that there is this new trend. If you look at the numbers over the last few days, this rush is really getting longer because folks are able to work from home. We've been averaging about 2.3 million people a day at airports nationwide, so this may be it. We may see big peaks, not big rallies when it comes to these big travel rushes in the future just because trends have changed, people are able to work from home. The one good thing here is that things are really smooth for the airlines and passengers have had a pretty good experience because, frankly, the weather has been pretty good and the cancellations have been pretty low. We see about 20 today, 60 yesterday. So that is good news, especially considering it pales in comparison to the huge cancellation numbers we saw over the summer, 50,000 in total. And the pressure has really been on airlines to get their act together. That was all compounded by staffing shortages. Airlines have been on this hiring blitz.

Tend to be more removed from the delivery of services of government. She's seen as being effective at that, generally speaking, and that is what lets you win in Senate races often is what lets you win in governors' races. It is how you behave in connection with the services people want. And so, I think it is -- I think that brand is based on something substantive.",

You have all of these things. Look, not to say that investigation shouldn't happen.

And I think that, you know, whether that is where the public is, I think is an open question. I think that we have certainly seen in previous, you know, years and in previous congresses, when Congress is perceived as overreaching on certain investigations, and whether they get too personal. I do think that there is an appetite among a pretty wide cross section of Republicans in the House for activities and investigations related to Biden. I'm not sure how wide the appetite is for investigations related to investigating the work that's been done already by the House Select Committee on January 6th.And that's another question that McCarthy is getting pressured on by some corners of the House Republican group. And so, you know, I think it's a huge open question. But the -- because Republicans did not get this overwhelming win in the Midterms, I do think that they're going to face questions about what kind of mandate they are taking the gavel with.",
