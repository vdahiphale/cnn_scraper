Biden has done the same, even saying, you know, to fundraiser last week that he thinks Israel's losing international support because of indiscriminate bombing of Gaza.

But it's hard to say that Israel is listening to us now. They're clearly doubling down on these same tactics. But all of us, all of us, including the veterans in Congress who wrote this letter, want to see Israel succeed in its mission to eliminate Hamas. Hamas has to be eliminated if Israel is ever going to be secure and if the Palestinians are ever going to be free. Let's not forget Hamas is an organization with the destruction of Israel written into its charter, an organization that uses its own people, the people of the Gaza Strip as human shields in this conflict. So, we want to see Israel succeed in getting rid of Hamas and we're concerned that their current tactics are not going to achieve that goal. That you can't win what is fundamentally a counterinsurgency fight just by killing your way out of a solution. Because every time you kill innocent civilians, and we know that Israel has done a lot of that. You help recruit terrorists to the cause. So, my hope is that ultimately Israel will see what we're trying to tell them. We're trying to share a bunch of lessons that we learned painfully over years of fighting insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Fewer of them would get killed. It'd be much better for the Palestinians. It would save a lot of lives in Gaza. And of course, that's at the end of the day what we want to see happen for Israel. So, yes, this is very true, I mean, look, this is similar to why it's so absurd that you hear people like Donald Trump pressuring Ukraine to essentially surrender and negotiate with the Russians, when Putin could end that war in a heartbeat by stopping his illegal invasion. So, the bottom line is yes. Just like Putin is the aggressor in Ukraine, Hamas is the aggressor here with Israel and Gaza. But the reality is, as you said, Kate, they're not just going to stop on their own. So, what Israel needs to do is change its tactics to a way that envisions a political solution that both sides can buy into. And ultimately tries to not just eliminate Hamas terrorists, but also win over the people of Palestine to that idea, to that political future. International support is important for this because I don't think anyone believes that you can have a successful political two state solution without the support of Arab nations. So, when Secretary Blinken cautions Israel that they're losing international support, that's not just a backhanded way to put pressure on them to change their tactics. That's a real serious recognition that if you want peace at the end of the day, you're probably going to need an international coalition to help make it happen.",
