We think there are about 340,000 votes left to count for Maricopa County alone, 290,000 of them are votes that were handed in on Election Day, mail ballots that were handed in on Election Day.

The question is how much more Republican this time for that huge batch of 290,000 votes? And will it be enough for Blake Masters to overtake Mark Kelly? He would have to win by enormous margins on that 290,000 vote total there. But that's the situation in Arizona. We think there's 540,000 votes left overall. One thing to think about as the target, he would need to win 60 percent or more of the remaining votes in order to take Mark Kelly. Democrats feeling good. It's not over, but they're feeling good there.Nevada right now, The Republican Adam Laxalt is still ahead by 9,000, but his lead shrunk overnight. Also, there were new votes reported from Clark County, home of Las Vegas that makes up nearly 75 percent of the state. There were 12,000 votes reported in Clark County of which the incumbent Democratic Catherine Cortez Masto, she won 61 percent of that. A little bit of a similar situation -- I should put thousand there. It's not just 12. It's 12,000. A similar situation up in Washoe County where there was roughly 18,000 votes counted last night, and of those Catherine Cortez Masto, she won 60 percent. Now, the reason I put those messages up there, of the remaining vote, and CNN thinks there is roughly 95,000 -- there are roughly 95,000 votes left, 95k votes left here. If Catherine Cortez Masto won 60 percent of that -- that would give her the lead. Will they win 60 percent of it? I don't know.",
