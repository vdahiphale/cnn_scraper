So he's received 20 years in federal prison for the attempted kidnapping of a federal official and 30 years for the assault on the immediate family member of a federal official.So concurrently, 30 years in prison, minus time already served. It's been a little more than a year and a half since David DePape broke into the home of Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi's house when she wasn't there and attacked her husband, Paul, with a hammer, severely injuring him. And all of this was caught on cameras. Both the break-in was caught on surveillance video and then the assault itself was caught on body-worn camera in front of two police officers. And Speaker Emerita Pelosi and her husband, Paul, they were not in court today, but their daughter, Christine, was. And she read victim statements on their behalf. Paul saying in his statement that he continues to have health issues to this day, had fainting spells back in November. And they continue to be scared. They've had to re-up security as they continue to get threats to this day. Speaker Pelosi saying -- Speaker Emerita Pelosi saying that their home is a heartbreaking crime scene, a reminder every day of what happened. Now this wraps up David DePape's federal case. He now moves onto his state trial, which should happen later this summer where he is facing charges of attempted murder, as well as burglary and assault -- Brianna?",

And then we're having a hearing about what? About President Biden and accusing -- them accusing him of being too old, accusing the attorney general of malfeasance, and trying to support President Biden in some way. And so we were there to do work, to actually get the facts out. And the very first thing that happens is Marjorie Taylor Greene starts attacking the appearance of one of our colleagues. That is what started last night. It enraged people, not -- not just myself, but clearly a lot of other folks. And things devolve from there.
