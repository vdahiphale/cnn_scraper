The fact of the matter is what he made was less than a lot of other attorneys in a similar position, and it turns out he was a very effective attorney.So, again, I think them pointing to racism is really disingenuous because Donald Trump, he's referred to finding Willis as racist, he's referred to the attorney general in New York as racist, the district attorney in New York is racist.

If he's been pushed forward into a yolk, the autopilot is going to resist that because it's trying to maintain level attitude. So, you've got one force going down and one force up, and they're competing with each other. But at 75 pounds, the autopilot is going give up. It's just going to say, if you're airplane, you do what you want, I'm done, because that's the setting that is typically applied in these aircraft, and at that point, the aircraft would abruptly, and I mean abruptly nose down, much more violent than a carnival ride.

And it is some bureaucratic red tape that you have to go through because the D.R. has their border that essentially sealed off with Haiti. So, that makes it a challenge.But then you're also just talking the logistics of ultimately when we were able to find a helicopter to bring us in, those pilots' willingness, and then their ability to make that approach.

Gunshots. Do you hear that? There it is.Already hearing gunshots just a few seconds into stepping out of the car after arriving here at Port-au-Prince. (END VIDEOTAPE) CULVER (on-camera):  We spent hours this morning with those pilots trying to find different areas and then going through different maps and coordinating with a team here on the ground, a security team, to evaluate whether or not the areas that we were trying to land are viable options. And it's because an area they had identified a couple of days ago as a good landing zone today is under gang control. So, Abby, that's the challenge that we face, but it's beyond us. Imagine those who are trying to get out. The pilots tell us they have hundreds of people on lists just desperate to get out of Port-au- Prince right now. And then beyond that, those who don't have that luxury or that opportunity to leave. Many of the Haitians themselves, who would hope to have just some basic needs and aid brought in, well, the logistics of ours getting in, you know, shows you just what they'll be dealing with when it comes to trying to get what they so desperately need to have. David Culver, thank you so much for bringing that to us. I mean, this is such an important story unfolding right on the United States' borders, practically. It's so important for us to hear it.

Joining me now is Scott Mantz, an entertainment journalist and a film critic. He recently saw that movie. Last night, in fact, Scott, you called it a masterpiece. Some reviews have really focused on these similarities, scary as they are, between the environment in the film and what's happening in today's society. What similarities did you see?",

It takes place in the near future. It could take place tomorrow or maybe even, you know, November. The point is that never before in my life watching a movie, and as youcan imagine, I've seen a lot of films, have I felt so much like we are so close to this moment where the country is so divided that one wrong move and we could descend into civil war. I have never had that feeling before in my life. The movie is so visceral, so immersive. The combat scenes are absolutely incredible. The movie stars, like I said, Kirsten Dunst, also Wagner Moura and Cailee Spaeny, who was in the movie Priscilla last year. They're photojournalists making their way from New York City to Washington, D.C. to interview the President before rebel factions get there first. The movies or T.V. shows this reminded me of were \"The Walking Dead\", \"Children of Men\" and very much like \"Apocalypse Now\", not stylistically, but instead of going up the river to, you know, find Colonel Kurtz, they're going down to D.C. to look for the President.",

And I just, again, it just feels, you know, certainly in my lifetime, I've never felt like how close -- and this is my opinion only -- how close that we really are on the brink of a civil war.
