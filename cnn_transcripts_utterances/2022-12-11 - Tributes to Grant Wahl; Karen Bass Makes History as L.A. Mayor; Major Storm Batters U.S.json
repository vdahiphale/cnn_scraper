LEANA WEN, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST:  There is so much that we just don't know, we heard about his sudden collapse, we heard about this viral illness that preceded it. But we don't know whether these two things are necessarily related. People get viral illnesses all the time. This is the season when many people have colds or the flu or other things. And especially for somebody who's generally young, and what it sounds like pretty healthy. It's extremely rare for them to die, much less to die suddenly from that viral illness. And also for people who do die, it ends up -- it's not usually sudden. In fact, there is gradual deterioration, somebody may be getting short of breath, they're in the hospital, et cetera. So that sudden death, it could be related. I mean, there is -- there are possibilities, maybe the viral illness, and we don't know this, but maybe the viral illness somehow affected the heart in some way. But there are other possibilities, too, including whether the sudden death could be caused by a sudden heart rhythm problem or a heart attack or a blood clot. Again, we just don't know. And again, it's just so tragic at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP) HARRAK:  Dr. Wen also said she does not want to imply there's anything Wahl could have done differently to prevent his death. The quarterfinals Wahl had been covering have ended with a semifinal that few would have predicted. We'll have highlights from those matches coming up a little later in the program. The January 6th committee says its final report on the attack at the U.S. Capitol will be made public by December 21st.

As part of that final report, lawmakers might include criminal referrals to the Justice Department, identifying people that they believe have committed crimes. Now who might be the target of these referrals? Obviously the committee has been looking very closely at Donald Trump. But they have also zeroed in on some of his top associates, like Mark Meadows, his White House chief of staff; Rudy Giuliani, his longtime attorney; John Eastman, a lawyer that worked on some of the post- election attempts to undermine the Democratic transition and a man by the name of Jeffrey Clark, who was a senior Justice Department official that schemed with Trump on how to use the powers of the DOJ to stay in office. Now whether the committee decides to go forward with these referrals, it's important to remember that the committee is made up of politicians, not prosecutors. And any decisions on a criminal investigation or a criminal indictment would be made totally separately by the Justice Department. Switching gears, in another Trump investigation, the Mar-a-Lago investigation, a federal judge on Friday declined to hold former president Trump in contempt over noncompliance with a subpoena. This investigation is all about whether or not Trump or his closest advisers mishandled highly sensitive classified documents and national security documents when they left the White House in January 2021 and brought those materials to Mar-a-Lago, his resort and home in south Florida. The criminal investigation has been ongoing for the better part of the last year and, as part of that probe, prosecutors wanted to hold Trump in contempt. That's because he did not fully comply with a subpoena that was issued in May that demanded the return of all classified documents. Back in May and June, his lawyers handed over some documents but dozens of additional documents with classification markings were later recovered. The DOJ wanted to ramp up the pressure and have a judge hold him in contempt. But on Friday the judge declined to do so and she told both sides to work out their issues separately without a contempt finding. And of course, the investigation, the criminal investigation, is still ongoing. It's being overseen by special counsel Jack Smith here in Washington -- Marshall Cohen, CNN, Washington.

WNBA star Brittney Griner continues to undergo a medical evaluation at a U.S. Army hospital in Texas, following her 10-month detention in Russia. Griner's wife posted an update on Saturday, saying in part, \"As BG and I started our journey to heal our minds, body and spirits, I want to personally say thank you to some of the hands, seen and unseen, that helped make it possible for me to see my wife again.\" While Griner was arrested in Moscow last February for a small amount of cannabis oil, given a nine-year sentence, most recently she had been laboring at a penal colony, where she struggled to stay warm in the frigid temperatures. Once the euphoria of being home wears off, Griner will likely experience some difficulties readjusting to a normal life. One person who knows all about that is a former oil company executive, who was detained in Venezuela for five years before his release in early October. He spoke earlier to CNN about that experience.

So your relationship with your spouse, your children, even my grandchildren, so that I'm now building a new relationship because, when I was detained, they were just babies. So the aspect of the family is important, but also some other aspects in their normal life, such as your career, your normal activities. I used to be a marathon runner as an example.

In addition, COVID-19 continues to pose a significant threat, particularly for  unvaccinated or undervaccinated New Yorkers, as the virus remains one of the leading causes of death in the United States. The Department of Health is now urging, especially children, people with immunocompromise, 65 years and older, to possibly wear masks, saying, let's put out a mask advisory. Consider it; it's not a mandate but it might be a good idea as these viruses continue to spread. It's not just here in the state of New York, it's happening all across the country; 80 percent of hospital beds are full right now. They are taxed. And also this statistic coming from the CDC, 26 hospitalizations for flu for every 100,000 Americans, a number they haven't seen for more than a decade.
