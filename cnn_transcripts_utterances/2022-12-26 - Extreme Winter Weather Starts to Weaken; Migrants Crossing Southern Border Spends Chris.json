The Ukrainian's response to that ultimatum. And China once again down-playing its rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak. The country is overwhelmed health care system tells a different story to that of the official ones. The end of brutal freezing temperatures might be in sight. Relief possibly on the way for millions of Americans after the historic winter storm left at least 37 people dead. Conditions are beginning to improve. We saw that on Sunday where emergency workers were able to get out to survey the extent of the damage. The governor of New York is requesting an emergency disaster declaration from the U.S. federal government to help the state cover the costs of the storm. At least 17 deaths have been reported in New York where officials say many of those who died were either homeless or stranded in their cars in the below freezing temperatures. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look, a lot of the people here cannot go to the city-run shelters. The city of El Paso has opened a convention center, but only about 300 people are sleeping there because in order to go to that location you need to have the proper documentation. So, the only option they have is a non-profit shelter like this one run by Sacred Heart Church in El Paso, but they are completely at capacity. Their capacity is for about 130 people. They're sleeping about 200 of them every day when the temperature is about 20 degrees. But the problem is because they don't fit, a lot of these migrants have to sleep outside. That's why you're seeing so many blankets. That's why you're seeing them one next to the other because they're always trying to keep warm. So many of them telling me I don't necessarily want to be here, but it is the necessity from our countries that have forced us to come here. I talked to one father who told me that he saw Santa Claus here and he took a picture with him, sent it to his 7-year-old son in Venezuela and told him, look, Santa is in the U.S. So, the bike that you so desperately want is going to be delayed because Santa is still here in the U.S. He says that when he finds a job here in the U.S., he will be able to send his son that bike.

Divided government, it's obviously meaning Democrats will find it harder to pass legislation. That's not a forecast. That's actually a prognosis.We're waiting it see what will happen. For instance, the House Democrat Jamie Raskin speaking up now saying the next step is to save our democracy by reforming the Electoral College. Now, for those who aren't too familiar with this wonderful bit of American electoral arcanery, Americans don't directly elect the U.S. president even though they put that name on a piece of paper. Instead, it's a slate of voters who are then expected to carry out the will of the voters when they vote. The Electoral College as long as I can remember it has been up for reform. The problem is how do you reform something that everybody wants to reform but nobody can agree on the way forward? Well, Raskin says it's now time to actually deal with it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  The Electoral College now, which has given us five popular vote losers as president in our history twice in this century alone has become a danger not just to democracy but to the American people. It was a danger on January 6th. There's so many curving byways and nooks and crannies in the Electoral College that there are opportunities for a lot of strategic mischief. We should elect the president the way we elect governors, senators, mayors, representatives, everybody else, whoever gets the most votes wins. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Richard Johnson joins me now, lecturer in U.S. politics at Queen Mary University in London. He joins me in London.Now, this is really straightforward, isn't it? Let's deal with this call for the Electoral College. I'm sure as long as you can remember, people have been saying, well, popular vote versus electoral vote it doesn't really work, but nobody can find a way to change it. RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON:  That's right. The last time that the constitution was amended to try and fix some elements of the Electoral College was in the early 19th century with the 12th amendment. We've heard, you know, talk about amending the Constitution, which is what you would need to do to change Electoral College after the 2000 election, after 2016 and nothing came of it. There is one way around it, though, which is that the state legislatures could actually pass legislation that says that they will cast their Electoral College votes to the popular vote winner. And if you can get states to add up to 270 electoral votes which is the majority, you could actually kind of bypass the Electoral College. And there is some effort to do that in the states. We're not at 270 yet, but that probably is the most likely way you could get around the electoral college.",

I think earlier in his presidency there was some doubt whether he faced a significant challenge in a Democratic primary. I think that's less likely now. I think he's had a good year.

I would say that, you know, that's going to be something that will be a challenge against him.I think that he's more demonstrated any particular incident where he's been unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency because of his age not at least not in any way that we've seen.
