Plus, President Biden is now facing a special counsel investigation. Why did it take the White House two months to disclose classified records were found in his home? And remembering Lisa Marie Presley, the tributes for Elvis's only child. This is what we're watching At This Hour.Thanks for being here. I'm Kate Bolduan. We're going to start in the south today as we were tracking what is left behind really from a deadly tornado outbreak. Dozens of them have been reported in Alabama, Georgia, and Kentucky, at least seven people were killed, six of them in a single Alabama County. One of the hardest hit areas was the historic city of Selma, where a tornado caused widespread damage structures just torn apart, lives shattered. This morning, authorities are getting a clearer picture of the extent of the damage, what they're going to need to pick up and clean up and they're also still searching for more survivors. Let's go to Selma, Alabama right now. Ryan Young is standing by for us. Ryan, look at that.",

But we wanted to show you just how powerful this storm is. And close to six feet tall. Look at this, look how tall this tree is. And look at this metal that's just wrapped in all over this tree, like it's an ornament.This is what we're seeing signs of destruction all over this city. We are on Broad Street, which is the main street here in downtown Selma. And as you look this direction, you can just see how the storm plow through this area. We're going to walk this way to show you that building in the background, as we were looking around and even doing our own assessment, there are houses that they still haven't been able to reach, because they are trees down throughout this area. Power companies have been surging in trying to restore some of the power and phone service is very spotty throughout this area. The terrifying part about this, we were talking to people who did not know this storm was going to be that powerful had to run for a closet because they were terrified by what they were hearing. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEBORAH A. BROWN, TORNADO SURVIVOR: We had to run for cover. We had to go run and jump in the closet. Oh, oh my God. Oh my God you all look. Oh, my God, just to be able to beside us. Oh, my God. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we still don't know what the total assessment is just yet. A helicopter was just flying over from the state as they were trying to figure out exactly when to send their emergency crews, you can tell they're going to be doing this for quite some time, the cleanup is going to be massive. And this stretched all the way to Georgia.So as you understand as first light comes up, people are still shaking their heads trying to wonder how the storm was so powerful, and how it hits so quick, leaving a lot of people just sort of caught off guard.

And the weather service from Birmingham picked up pieces of debris. Now the radar can distinguish between twigs, leaves, shingles, and raindrops. I can't tell you if it's a stick or a twig or a leaf, but it can tell you that it's not a raindrop.And some of that debris was 200, just 20,000 feet tall, 20,000 feet in the air. That's how much it was sucking across parts of this area. Just taking this tornado, taking this damage and just throwing it outside on the top of this tornado. This is just going to be devastating. Weather service out there right now trying to look to see what it was, was it an EF3 or maybe something stronger. They're not rare. But certainly, the number that we've had so far this year, certainly would be rare. There are the fringes. But because we have 35 and I see so many dots so close to each other. I'm thinking maybe that was the same tornado on the ground for quite some time. There right there is where the rain is now. It is not severe across parts of Florida, just a cooler air mass. Colder behind it and the Buffalo that's where it's snowing, also some snow trying to get to Nashville right now could even make its way all the way into North Georgia, as we work our way into tonight. Out to the west, yes, this is where it's going to rain and snow again, but only for just maybe three more days, maybe four. There's going to be rain, there's going to be snow in the mountains. But by the time we work our way into next Thursday, the forecast is for below normal preset. And the forecast for that is bad as good as you can get for the people in California.",

But it is a symbolic moment because it is the first time former President Donald Trump's companies has been held accountable, convicted and sentenced amid numerous investigations that have been swirling around the former president. One of the prosecutors had argued to the judge that Trump organization should get the maximum amount under the law, saying that it is the only way to deter companies from committing crimes is to make it as expensive as possible. The Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that this closes one chapter in their investigation, but he emphasized that their investigation into the Trump organization continues and that's something that's that they will continue to work on. Now, the Trump Organization issued a statement after the sentencing saying that they did nothing wrong and that they will appeal the verdict. Kate?",

He served of course as U.S. Attorney General, under President George W. Bush. He's now Dean of the Belmont University College of Law. It's good to see you, Attorney General. You've said before the announcement that you -- that before this special counsel was announced and appointed that you thought a special counsel should be selected. Now that one has what do you think of the choice of Rob Hur?ALBERTO GONZALES, FMR. U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL UNDER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Well, I don't know him personally. He apparently worked in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland, during the last few months of the time that I was the attorney general. I may have met him during one of my visits. But based on what I understand to be his history, he appears to be very well qualified to take on this task. But more importantly, of course, in the mind of Attorney General Merrick Garland, he's well qualified. You know, and I have to think that hopefully, putting politics aside, Republicans won't have any problem with himself being a Trump appointee. So I think it's a good choice. And I think he's got a lot of work to do. And, you know, one of the things that I do wish, this is a huge distraction for the White House, and it is a distraction for the President as it should be. Obviously, he's going to pay attention to this. But if I think if I were advising the President, I would try to move this out of the White House. Have the lawyers be the ones that speak for, in connection with the investigation to the public, have a private spokesperson so that the White House Press Secretary hasn't -- doesn't have to deal with it again, because there's so much need of attention of the White House in the White House staff, the President. And so as much as possible, you try not to let this be a distraction. Of course, it's going to command some attention. But to the extent you can try to move this out of the White House.",

But I think in the Bush administration, we tried to move things out. We did -- when I was White House counsel. And there was a possibility of President Bush being perhaps spoken to by a special counsel in connection with the Valerie Plame leak. You know, I didn't have anything to do with it, because I'm a government official, this related to perhaps personal conduct.And so we went out and hired personal private counsel for President Bush even though the role, his role in connection with the possible leak was very, very limited.

Why because in each case, the facts are going to be different, they're going to be very, very different.And that you have prosecutors that are very different. They have different perspectives, different judgments, different views about discretion and connection with criminal cases. So I can understand what you might say, you know, that cannot be a double standard, in terms of there has to be at least an investigation initially, as to both President Biden and former President Trump. But after that the paths diverge, as far as I'm concerned, because the investigations have to follow the facts. And the facts are going to be different. And of course, the other things that the that are going to be different are what's the level of cooperation, you know, what -- how much damage or harm has been to the United States as a result of the -- these documents not being protected? So there are things are simply going to be different. I think it's important the American public to understand that what happens in one investigation doesn't mean it's going to happen in the other investigation. And it doesn't mean that the other investigation, perhaps the prosecutor isn't being diligent. Again, these are experienced prosecutors, they're going to make judgments based upon their own experience, and based upon their own discretion, and based upon the facts as they find them.",

OK, anything that's classified, needs to be protected and needs to be accounted for, and needs to be turned over in an appropriate manner.And that goes with respect to every government record that belongs to the archivist as soon as a presidential term is over. And so obviously, there needs to be additional directives. We need to be follow up with staff to make sure that everything has been done according to the book. But in terms of, you know, personally, being accountable and personally looking at every document, you just, you don't have the time to do that.
