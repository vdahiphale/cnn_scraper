We are now waiting for him to arrive at the Manhattan federal courthouse for the next day of his civil defamation trial. This is the case brought by E. Jean Carroll.Now, Donald Trump has already been found liable for defaming her and also sexually abusing her. Today, Donald Trump may take the stand, all in an effort to convince a jury to not make him pay more money in damages and also in reality an effort to make his legal problems a pillar of his presidential campaign strategy. CNN's Kara Scannell is live outside the courthouse for us. So, Kara, to remind everyone, this trial has been delayed a couple of times. What's going to happen once it resumes?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, so this will be the first time the jury has heard testimony in this case in about a week. And as it is, they only have heard two days of testimony. But we are in the homestretch of this trial with E. Jean Carroll's team expected to put on their final witness today, that's her former editor at \"Elle\" magazine. She will be testifying for E. Jean Carroll. And then Carroll intends to introduce some clips of a videotaped deposition that Donald Trump gave in this case. He's asked a lot of different questions there. Making these denials, repeating these denials of -- that Carroll has accused him of and also confusing her for his second wife, Marla Maples, in a photo. And Trump, of course, has said that he doesn't know who E. Jean Carroll is and that she's not his type.So, the jury will hear that testimony as Carroll's team then rests their case. Then the big question is, does Donald Trump take the stand. He is likely to be the only witness that this team calls if they do call him. Now, he says that he wants to testify. The judge has said, though, because this case is not about the defamation or the sexual abuse, it is only about damages and harm, his testimony will be limited. He will not be able to deny raping Carroll. He won't be able to say she lied or that she made up the story to boost sales of her book. So, it will be very narrowly constrained about what he is allowed to say on the witness stand, though we have seen Donald Trump does not always abide by those rules. We saw that in the civil fraud trial just several weeks ago when his testimony turned more into campaign rhetoric than it did the actual substance of the trial. So, this will be the tension in the room if Trump does take the stand. He's already clashed with the judge who threatened to throw him out of court because Trump was talking loudly to his lawyers, saying things, according to Carroll's team, such as witch hunt and that this was a fraud. So, it will certainly be a moment if he takes the stand. Does he stick to what the questions are? Does he go beyond that? And how does the judge handle this in this case because, in this case, unlike the civil fraud case, there is a jury here. It is important to what the jury is allowed to hear and what they're not allowed to hear to make a decision in this case. Now, Carroll is seeking more than $10 million in damages. Trump's team trying to say that what Carroll's statements did had -- when she came up with her allegations, the harm that she faced was not necessarily related to Trump's statements. They're trying to walk that line. Kate.",

The standard is that there was a willful disregard for information that they knew or should have known that he was dangerous, that he had a propensity for violence, and their failure to take action on that front.It's a very different legal theory than we've seen in the past relating parents being held responsible for the act of their kids. Usually it's a reckless endangerment charge. They're not being held responsible for the actual death. Child neglect. Those are the legal theories we've seen before.
