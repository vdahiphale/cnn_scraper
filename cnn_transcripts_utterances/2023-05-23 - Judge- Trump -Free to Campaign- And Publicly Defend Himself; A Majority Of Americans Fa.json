Trump says he understands he's not allowed to talk about certain parts of the case. Then, the charges now facing a 19-year-old accused of driving a U-Hall into the security barrier at the White House. Inside the truck, according to the Secret Service, duct tape, a backpack, and a Nazi flag. Plus, well, that's going to give them something to tweet about.

Today, a New York judge gave Donald Trump an official trial date, March 25th, 2024, next year, in the criminal case related to that hush money payment to porn star and director Stormy Daniels. Now, that will set up no doubt what will be a media spectacle right in the thick of the Republican 2024 presidential primary season. Mr. Trump himself just wrapped up a courtroom appearance by video conference a short while ago. That was his first visit to the court after pleading not guilty last month to 34 counts of falsifying business records. The New York judge also imposed a protective order that would bar Trump and his defense team from sharing evidence from the case with third parties or from revealing evidence on social media. Prosecutors requested today's hearing to ensure Trump is aware of these new rules imposed on him. But the judge also made it clear today he's not imposing a gag order on Trump and that the former president does retain the right to use the First Amendment, publicly defend himself as he makes this run for the White House. Let's go straight to CNN's Kara Scannell who's outside a New York courthouse. Kara, what else did the judge have to say to Trump?",

The judge warned all sides, including the former president, that they cannot make any commitments, personal or professional, during that time period beginning March 25th and however long this trial takes.So that was a clear message to the former president. Now Trump appeared virtually. He was sitting side by side next to one of his attorneys from Florida where they appeared in the courtroom. You know, the judge addressed him. Trump only spoke once when the judge asked him if he'd seen the protective order, the reason he was there. He said, yes, I have. And then the judge, you know, said, I'm not going to go through this line by line, but he made the point to Trump that this was not a gag order. He said it was not my intention in any way to impede Mr. Trump's ability to campaign for president of the United States. He said Trump is free to deny the charges, free to defend himself against the charges, and free to campaign. What Trump not free to do is to post any information they receive from prosecutors that could be witness statements, grand jury testimony, he's not allowed to post any of that on his social media pages. The judge explained to Trump if he violates that court order, there are consequences. He said it could be sanctions up to including being held in contempt. Now, that was the main thrust of the hearing today. I mean, setting this trial date was something that people were waiting to see when it would land. The judge saying it will be the 25th. He's not going to move it, but the next time Trump will be in court will be in early January -- Jake.",

They didn't want him to be able to turn around and be, like, well, I didn't exactly understand what I was supposed to do according to this order.

Ordinarily, any criminal defendant has a right to do really whatever he pleases with the discovery, which is the evidence and the witness statements that prosecutors have to turn over. However, if the judge finds there's a risk that this person would use those materials to harm somebody, to harm a witness, to harm one of the parties to the case, then the judge can put in restrictions. Now, this case is complicated by two factors. First of all, as the judge recognized, Donald Trump is running for president. He has a First Amendment right to speak, to engage in political speech, our most protected form of speech. On the other hand, Donald Trump is the very rare defendant where millions of people look at and hear his every utterance. And as we've seen, some fraction -- some small fraction of people do tend to act based on his words. So the judge is trying to strike a balance here.",

But as the judge noted, this is not a full gag order. There are restrictions that have been placed on the extent to which he can share certain types of information with third parties or on social media. That is because he has a history of not always using his First Amendment responsibly. He attacks prosecutors. He attacks judges. He attacks people who successfully have sued him. So, that's how he's come to be in this position. I'm curious to see if he'll follow this and if he does not, what exactly prosecutors can do about it.",

Also remember, prosecutors always have the ability under New York state law to bring charges for obstruction of justice, for threatening a prosecutor, for threatening a judge.

A majority of Americans say, no, you should reduce spending as well as raise the debt ceiling. Twenty-four percent say raise the debt ceiling no matter what. Only 15 percent say do not raise it, let the U.S. go into default. And when you look at this question about what Congress should do, look at it by party, Jake. Overwhelmingly, you see here Republicans, 79 percent, say raise it only if there are spending cuts included as a part of the overall deal. That's near unified position for the Republicans. The Democrats are split here, 45 percent saying make sure spending cuts are part of the deal, 46 percent saying raise it no matter what.
