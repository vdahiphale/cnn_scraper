Live from New York. It's Monday, February 19th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And good evening. Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of the Russian opposition leader, Alexey Navalny says President Vladimir Putin killed her husband and that she knows exactly why. She vowed to continue Navalny's fight for a free Russia and urged opposition supporters to join her. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YULIA NAVALNAYA, ALEXEY NAVALNY'S WIFE (through translator): I ask you to share your rage -- rage, anger and hatred with me towards those who are daring enough to kill our future and I address you with Alexey's words, which I believe it is not a shame to do. It's not a shame to do little, but it's a shame not to do anything. It's a shame to make yourself intimidated. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Everybody knew who Alexey Navalny was, he was thecountry's most prominent opposition leader and everybody is shocked, if not surprised that he met this untimely death in this penal colony in the far north of the country. You're joining me now in the middle of Moscow, right outside the FSB headquarters where you can see people are still coming in. There's a lady who had just done that now. There are some more people over here, they're coming to pay their respects, to offer sympathy and condolences to the family and friends and the organization of Alexey Navalny. These are all the flowers that have been put down so far. Just go ahead (speaking in foreign language) -- and as I say, this is a monument to the victims of repression during the Soviet period, and so it is interesting that this is the place where people have chosen to come and pay their respects to Alexey Navalny. There is a photograph of him here. Somebody has laid that. People are putting traditional red roses, a children's picture over here, saying on the tombstone there, Alexey Navalny, \"geroy\" which means hero, and that is how, of course many people in this country see him as. Now, just the act of putting that flower on this memorial is risky in a country like Russia, because all kinds of dissent, all kinds of political opposition have been crushed by the Kremlin, and even though people are doing this now, it's not large numbers. But as I said, a steady flow, you can say, shows just how angry and how much people are sort of braving that repression to come out and put these flowers on this monument. Remember, across the country, hundreds of people have been dragged from these snowy parks, in towns and cities across Russia, and taken away and detained for doing exactly this. And so it is a huge risk that people are taking is. There's a whole line of people coming here now. A huge risk that people are taking to come out and pay their respects to Alexey Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One of the things that we've seen the Ukrainians apparently do is able to shoot down a couple of those Russian jets, they might have moved some of their sort of medium or longer range anti-aircraft systems to the frontlines. But of course, that's not something right now that's sustainable. So they do say that the F-16, they believe will make a big difference even if they don't get a massive quantity of them. There are certain other things that the Ukrainians believe could play in their favor, even if the US doesn't deliver more military aid to them and that is that right now, here in Western Europe, a lot of the artillery ammunition production is ramping up. It is going very slowly, but at some point, that's going to kick into high gear and the Europeans believe that they are going to be able to supply large quantities of artillery shells to the Ukrainians. The big issue is how much damage will the Russians have done until then, and I think another problem that the Ukrainians have also very much identified is that they do need to be capable of mobilizing more troops for the frontlines than they have so far. It is something that the Ukrainian say they've identified. They want to change the rotations, they want to make sure that some of those troops that have been fighting on that area of Avdiivka, some of those forces were on the frontlines for almost two years nonstop. They want to change that to a certain degree, give some of the soldiers a breather and make sure that no one's on the frontline for an extended period of time -- Paula.",

Companies found to have violated the DSA could face fines of up to six percent of their global annual revenue. But in some cases, it appears that companies could also agree to make changes that would bring them into compliance with the DSA, and I think the hope is there that while those changes would only be required in Europe, the platforms might agree to make those changes broadly for all of their users and then that way, it might benefit users beyond just the EU.",

We're headed out to where Russia may be filling its war chest to a record high. Crude oil tankers sometimes engaged in opaque secretive transfers, these two under sanctions busting suspicions in the past, the big one from Russia's Black Sea coast, transferring crude to the smaller one, which also came from Russia. WALSH (on camera): Here you get a feeling of how hard it is to keep track of all of this just transfers occurring out here in the blue expanse, massive trade for billions of dollars of oil, some of which ends up helping the Kremlin fund its war.

So the smaller one actually has an interesting history itself, it was once owned by a sanction person. WALSH (voice-over): Russia is richer than ever before. Last year's budget was $320 billion. About a third of which spent on its invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions were meant to dent oil paying for war. But instead, India has stepped in and is now buying 13 times more Russian crude oil than before the war, worth $37 billion last year, says one estimate exclusively given to CNN. India buying Russian crude isn't sanctioned, but it's buying so much Russia might need to dodge some sanctions to ship it all. We asked an artificial intelligence firm Winward to analyze all global shipping last year for direct shipments between Russia and India, and they found a huge 588.
