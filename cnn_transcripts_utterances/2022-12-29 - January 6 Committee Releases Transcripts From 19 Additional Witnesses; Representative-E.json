One nearly identical to what his father's allies would soon attempt. And there was also some rather unflattering testimony involving First Lady Melania Trump's opinion of Trump, Jr. and others in her husband's inner circle. Also tonight, new details of a purported conversation involving Senator Lindsey Graham, who said he would become a champion of these baseless election fraud claims if the President's allies could \"just give me five dead voters.\" It is a lot to unpack, so let us start with CNN political correspondent, Sara Murray, who has been digging through these transcripts all week for us. Sara, what more can you tell us about these new details from Donald Trump, Jr.'s testimony to the Committee?",

It was very similar to the strategy that his allies actually put forward, as you just said. So the Committee is asking Donald Trump, Jr. essentially, why did you send this text? And this is what he says he says, \"Perhaps in reading it, it was the most sophisticated, you know, and detailed, and again, about things I don't necessarily, you know, know too much about, but it sounded plausible. And I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text.\" Now, Donald Trump, Jr. notes in his interview with a Committee that he thought this was like a copy and paste job.

These are not military targets. There are no military targets around here. And yet it's attempting to affect the Ukrainian people. And it's failing miserably, because, as the man with the cigarette was saying, I've seen this before, and it's just the horror of the way the Russians conduct warfare.",
