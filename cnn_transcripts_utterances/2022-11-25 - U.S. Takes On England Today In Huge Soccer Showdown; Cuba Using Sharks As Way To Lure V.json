But this is an English side where it's a pretty ominous warning for the U.S. because Gareth Southgate, their manager, despite the 6-2 victory in the last game, said he feels England needs to do better. He wants them to qualify as quickly as possible for the next round and they would do that if they got a win against the U.S. later today.But this is a really young, dynamic, exciting U.S. side with so many of their players who played their domestic football in England. They know their opponents really well -- the likes of Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams. And the goal scorer in their game against Wales, Timothy Weah, said that they're relishing this title as underdogs. Coach Berhalter said that they've seen their moments on the stage. They've got through the emotion of that opening game. And he's backed them to repeat what has become something of a U.S. tradition in this tournament, which is embarrassing England at the World Cup. They did in 1950. They did in 2010. And they had a barbecue with their friends and family earlier this week to really gear them up mentally. They're very much hoping they can get something out of the game, which would give them a huge boost with the hopes of making it into the next round.",

It's the same ankle that ruled him out of their cup America success in 2019. The coach, Tite, trying to play down the emotion, saying he's confident Neymar will still play some part in this tournament. The medics, though, have said the next 24-48 hours will be crucial in finding out more. The good news, though, for Brazil is that they seem to have a new superstar who really announced his presence here on the World Cup stage.

This has got to be everybody's worst nightmare if you go on a cruise, right? A man who was reported missing from a Carnival cruise ship -- he was rescued off the Gulf of Mexico, though. He was last seen on Wednesday night at the bar on the cruise ship -- the Carnival cruise ship Valor. It turns out he had gone overboard. So on Thursday, the Coast Guard received notice of this missing guest. They launched this massive search and they were able to retrace the ship's route to find the man and confirm he actually had gone overboard -- and taken out of the water. When they found him he was responsive but there is no word yet on his condition. Officials say more information will be released later today. I mean, what a harrowing story -- wow. Meanwhile, Cuba is taking a big bet that tourists are looking for a thrill by diving with sharks. They're hoping to lure vacationers to the island nation by giving them a chance to swim with the sharks -- swim in shark-infested waters. CNN's Patrick Oppmann, extremely brave, took the bait and takes us beneath the surface. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Usually, they are the last thing you want to see in the ocean, but sharks are the reason why we have some here to the waters off eastern Cuba. We're hoping to see the predators up close and with no cage. Local guides say this is the only place in Cuba -- perhaps one of only a handful in the world where divers can safely sign alongside bull sharks. We are taking them at their word, praying the sharks had a big breakfast. Bull sharks are considered some of the most aggressive in the world, but the ones we see seem mostly curious -- swimming around me for a closer look before gliding away. Guide Lazaro says they want to teach visitors to respect sharks and to protect them.",

At the top of the food chain but never seeming to threaten us. OPPMANN (on camera):  When they said the shot of adrenalin in your arm, they were not kidding. I don't want to admit to being afraid but they're very impressive creatures. OPPMANN (voice-over):  Creatures that there are now more and more reasons to try and protect.

It's driving a lot of fear, anger, and confusion, and that's why we are seeing these rare scenes of public dissent breaking out in several cities across China.There's no certainty in your day-to-day life. At any moment, your home could be suddenly locked down. You could be sent to a quarantine camp for being identified as a COVID case or as a close contact. And the conditions at those COVID quarantine camps can be incredibly rough. Not only that, but in lockdown, time and time again, we're seeing people struggling to get enough food, daily essentials, emergency medical care. I recently interviewed a man on the outskirts of Beijing who blames the zero-COVID policy for his father's death because in lockdown, he couldn't get emergency help in time.

The announcement came after months of painstaking reproachment between the two parties, as well as years of deep political crises in the South American nation. According to two sources with knowledge of the process, who spoke with CNN, the talks will gather around three main areas. The creation of a fund to address the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis managed by the United Nations and backed by Venezuelan foreign reserves. The partial relief of U.S. Treasury sanctions on the Venezuelan oil industry. And the guarantees of free and fair elections to elect the new Venezuelan president. Venezuela has been suffering a deep economic downfall since 2014 due to chronic mismanagement and the collapse of the price of oil. To this day, still 80 percent of Venezuelans live below the poverty line, according to an independent survey by the Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas. And according to the United Nations, over seven million Venezuelans have fled the country in recent years to escape the crises. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Bogota. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They called it a touchdown but upon review, it was called incomplete. The Patriots couldn't believe it. It certainly looked like he caught that ball the entire time. Henry said afterward he thought his hands were under it. The Pats settled for a field goal. They took a 3-point lead at that point but with the game tied in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins to Adam Thielen for the touchdown -- his third T.D. pass of the game. The Vikings take the lead for good there to beat the Patriots 33-26. The Bills, meanwhile, playing in Detroit for the second time in five days. Before the game -- check this out. A Bills fan had a sign that said \"All I want for Christmas is to play catch with Stefon Diggs.\" Well, Diggs, in the holiday spirit -- he grabbed the fan, took him out on the field, and granted that wish. He played a little catch. Pretty awesome there from Diggs. Then Diggs coming up huge in the game. After a Detroit field goal, the game was tied with just 23 seconds. But Josh Allen just threw a missile to Diggs over the middle of the field. Great catch by him. That got the Bills in field goal range for the game-winner. They would win 28-25 to improve to 8-3 on the season. All right. And finally, the Cowboys trying to snap a 3-game Turkey Day losing streak, hosting the Giants. In the third quarter, Dak Prescott gets it over to Jake Ferguson, who then is going to leap the Giants' defender like a hurdle.
