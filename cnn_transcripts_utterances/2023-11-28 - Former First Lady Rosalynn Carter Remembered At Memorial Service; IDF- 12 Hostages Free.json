The President and First Lady and Secretary of State Bill and Hillary Clinton, and every living First Lady, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama, Melania Trump, as well as, of course, Vice President Kamala Harris and first - Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff.As we wait for the hearse to depart, I want to bring back our panel to talk about what we've seen. And, Kai Bird, I want to start with you, because I know this was - well, I'm sure this was emotional for millions of Americans watching today, but as somebody who has been a biographer of the Carters, and I know this was particularly emotional for you. What moved you the most? KAI BIRD, AUTHOR, \"THE OUTLIER\": Yes. No, it was extremely emotional. I hadn't seen President Carter since the 75th wedding anniversary party back in July of 2021. And I'm - I have to say I'm a little shocked at how thin and frail he looks. It's very sad and I can't imagine what he is thinking, having lost his wife of 77 years. I'm also particularly moved by the three eulogies given by family members: Chip, Amy and the grandson, Jason. They were very moving, touching and I think they bring home an essential point that must be remembered about the Carters. This is a presidency that was defined by its decency. And Rosalynn Carter and Jimmy were both extremely decent people.",

And it's not as if that they didn't have there - there's some animosity in their relationship at which she noted but I think that was quite telling that she was asked to speak. But she talked about the fact that Rosalynn Carter decided that she was not going to have any regrets at the end of her life but even before that she wasn't going to have any regrets when it came to campaigning so hard and working so hard for the political causes that her husband was fighting for.And she also talked about the fact that Rosalynn Carter not just - didn't just focus on mental health but also caregiving and Judy has a son who needs round the clock care and so that is something that they bonded over. One thing I do want to mention and Kate you were talking about this before the service started was how blunt Rosalynn Carter was and you witnessed it when it came to the Trump presidency and the fact that Judy recounted what Rosalynn Carter said about Joe Biden being in the White House saying that it is a relief to have him in the White House. Saying that may be not a surprise but saying that with Melania Trump there was interesting. KATE ANDERSEN BROWER, AUTHOR, \"FIRST WOMEN\": Could have been a little awkward in that moment for sure. She was determined to be taken seriously, too. I think that's something else that Judy said.",

This is an opportunity for us to see them celebrated and people are really educated about Rosalynn Carter today.So she had a lot to say about who was there, who was invited, Mrs. Trump, all the First Ladies, the sisterhood of this group. This is now - there are just five of them left. And when Mrs. Carter died she was the last of that group that was the biggest group of first ladies, six or seven, that were together at the Reagan Library opening. When she passed, that was the last woman in that photo. I think she understood and appreciated what that meant to be part of this, serving your country as first lady. I think she showed us all the fierce work ethic that she had, she lived her faith in actions not words and I think she wanted that to be seen. A great capacity to love, to love her country, to love the work she was dedicated to. She left a mark on the role of first lady. I think we all learned so much about that.

There doesn't appear to be a uniform way they were held by Hamas. Some were held underground, according to their family members. Some were held in houses above ground and moved around from location to location. Some, as we learned from one of the families, from the family of Hila Rotem, was held with her mother until they were split just a couple of days before Hila Rotem was released without her mother, which was a violation of the truce agreement to release families together.They were given minimal food, according to most of not only the families of the hostages, but also the doctors. Having to subsist largely on pita bread or rice and basic carbohydrates like that. One of the issues the doctors say they've had to deal with repeatedly is the issue of nutrition, and that's been one of the major challenges on the physical front. In fact, one of the elderly ladies who was rushed to Soroka Medical Center upon her release was suffering greatly in critical condition, according to doctors there, because of the lack of nutrients there. So that remains the greatest physical challenge. That doesn't even begin to cover the challenge of mental health and dealing with the much harder part of the recovery on that front. That will take time. Doctors have said that's a long process that begins with family reunions. Of course, part of the hard part there is that some of these freed hostages are just learning as they come out that their family members were murdered on October 7th by Hamas in the terror attack, and that has to be processed as well. That makes it all the much more difficult as this process plays out. Ten hostages released tonight, Israeli women and children. Ten more expected tomorrow. Wolf, I'll make one more final point, if I may. The truce survived arguably its biggest challenge, active fighting between Hamas and Israel. The two sides blamed each other. It was easily another moment where this could have fallen apart, but Wolf, in at least a partially good sign, it held together, at least for now.",

Same thing has happened to my aunt in that day. It's really hard to know the details at this point, but here we are again, a few days after a big sigh of relief to our family, with Doron, Raz and Aviv being reunited with Yoni Asher, and our family finally could take a big sigh of relief and joy, this happiness.

They were trying to negotiate any possible way, and I think, again, it just points out to who we are dealing with here and how low they can go as far as treating human beings on the very basic levels of humanity.This is outraging, and this is really hard to know that they're holding bodies just so we can - so they can negotiate them for life, people there are to be returned back to the Gaza Strip, and those are convicted criminals.
