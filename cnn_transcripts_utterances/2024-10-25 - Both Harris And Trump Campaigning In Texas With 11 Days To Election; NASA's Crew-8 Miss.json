Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are holding dueling rallies today in a state that is not a battleground. They're headed to Texas for two very different reasons.Harris wants to use the setting to further highlight her fight for reproductive rights in this election. And she'll be joined by megastar Beyonce, the first time that this worldwide star will be making a campaign appearance this election. And Trump is expected to be in Texas to target illegal immigration again and sit down with one of the world's biggest podcasters, Joe Rogan. CNN's Kristen Holmes joining us now watching all of it for us. So, Kristen, why Texas and why now?",

The studio is in Austin, Texas. Donald Trump finally got this sit-down with Joe Rogan later today and then they added this Austin event.But it's obviously a good time for him to talk about immigration, one of the key issues that he has put on the radar of these voters because as they look at all of the polling, they still believe that this issue is one that one, Donald Trump pulls ahead of Kamala Harris on, and two, is really important to voters. Now, he's going to be in a border state. Why not use the opportunity to talk to the press? But I do want to get into this sit-down with Joe Rogan. As you said, this is one of the most famous podcasts really in the world. Joe Rogan has more than 14 million followers. And Joe Rogan has not always been a fan of Donald Trump's. In fact, when he sat down with RFK Jr. -- he was a big fan of RFK Jr.'s -- and he said that essentially, all politicians were manipulative except for RFK Jr. And one of the reasons that comes into play is that once RFK endorsed Donald Trump one of the big things that Trump's team and allies of both RFK and Trump were working on was this sit-down with Joe Rogan. They believe that this is essentially the crowning jewel in a strategy that they've been trying to deploy for the last several months, which is reaching out to these low-propensity voters, meaning voters that don't generally head to the polls. These voters don't typically engage with politics in the same way that people who regularly vote do, but they do listen to podcasts and they do potentially follow Joe Rogan. And so they are trying to get Donald Trump to appeal to those people -- to the people who are outside of the general electorate to expand Donald Trump's own electorate and drive them to the poll in November. And I really don't think it should be understated how big of a deal this is for Trump's team who have been working on this sit-down with this podcast, with Joe Rogan for several months now.",

It was configured for them. Things like weight -- body weight and mass. That's all the spacecraft is configured -- tailor-made just for this crew. And so rather than try to stick Butch and Suni on board, which would have introduced quite a few variables, NASA decided to leave two crew members off Crew-9 and fly that mission up with two empty seats. So that's why they did it to minimize the variables and the changes in this crew rotation and because these guys have been -- Crew-8 -- they've been up there a lot longer than Butch and Suni. They've been up there since March. Butch and Suni have only been up there since June.
