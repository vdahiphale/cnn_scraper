Welcome to CNN TONIGHT.We're waiting for the release of the video from the latest deadly school shooting in the U.S. Three families sent their children to Covenant School in Nashville today, not knowing their children would never return. The head of the school, a substitute teacher and a custodian were killed, too. Can you imagine? Of course, you can. Because at this point in this country you've either lived through in that shooting or you've imagined it. We cannot keep having the same conversations over and over again. Tonight, we try to find a different way to talk about it. Plus, listen to this 2017 duet from Dolly Parton and Miley Cyrus. Did you hear those inflammatory words there about rainbows? Tonight, we're going to talk about why that song was deemed too controversial by one Wisconsin elementary school. And Gwyneth Paltrow's accuser took the stand in that ski collision trial today at his story was very different from hers. We're going to play for you what happened in court. But let's begin with the latest school shooting in Nashville today. I want to bring in my panel, Los Angeles Times Columnist L.Z. Granderson, star of CNN John Berman, former Senate Candidate Joe Pinion and Commentator Ana Navarro. Guys, thanks so much for being here. Before we start, let me just bring everybody up to speed about what we know about this school shooting at this hour. So, police say the suspect had attended that elementary school, may have resented going there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Yes, it is absolutely disgusting. And you know what I think it takes? I think it takes every American imagining that that is someone you love or a child you know or you love or from your family that could be at that level of risk. I can tell you that every time I hear one of these stories today, when I heard that, I have -- my husband has grandchildren who go to private schools that are parochial. I thought of them immediately. And I'm sure that's the case for you and for you and for you, and for you. We all know I have -- I thought guns were not my issue.

That is when you have an authoritarian-type of person who's insecure, they don't hesitate to try to use every power that's in their levers to try to make sure they maintained that power. I believe it was at Chile that just got rid of their president for trying to do like the exact same thing.So, it's not as if what's happening in Israel is unique or not even unique to democracy, it is just the latest example of when you have an authoritarian figure whose goals unchecked, they're going to try to go as far as you let them. PINION:  So, I think it's a little different, and I think that it's different because Israel is different, right? You're talking about a nation founded effectively as a Jewish state, even though there is a long secular history. I think, for me, I compare it not to January 6th but to September 11th, right, that we have reached the point now where there are people who are born, who are living, who are adults, who weren't alive when those towers came tumbling down. And if you look at the history of Israel, right, even the people who were more secular trending, they all understood that Israel was born out of this crucible, this desire to actually codify Jewish existence. And so as you get further and further away from this founding of this Jewish state of Israel, a nation that does not have a Constitution the way that we have the question becomes, who are those people, those elders with the white hair that remember why Israel exists and are trying to create safeguards to make sure that it doesn't actually go out of existence? Now, you can have a conversation about is he going about it the right way. Certainly, there are people in the streets who are arguing, perhaps certainly not going the way he thought it was going to go. But the conversation is critical not just for the people of Israel, not just for the Arabs who live in Israel, but certainly for the safety and security of the world moving forward, including our interests here at home in the United States.",
