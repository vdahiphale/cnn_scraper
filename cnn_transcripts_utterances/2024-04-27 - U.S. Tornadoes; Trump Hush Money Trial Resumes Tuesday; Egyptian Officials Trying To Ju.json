Kyiv's mayor said all of the patients have been moved to other facilities. The U.S. Defense Department is pledging $6 billion in long-term military aid for Ukraine. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made the announcement on Friday, calling it the largest security assistance package to date. It will include interceptors for Ukraine's air defense systems, counter drone systems and other critical equipment. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: My Ukrainian friends, we know the burden that you all carry and you should know that all of us have your back. And we still do and we won't back down. Ukraine's struggle for freedom matters to us all. If Ukraine fell under Putin's boot, Europe would fall under Putin shadow. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The nation's first all-race democratic election in 1994 was a huge milestone in post-apartheid South Africa. It's no doubt what president Cyril Ramaphosa is talking about right now, live pictures from Pretoria. Well, with evidence that inequality still exists and crime and corruption is running rampant, the once hopeful promise of democracy may be losing its appeal ahead of next month's critical elections. Now those elections pose a serious threat to Mandela's party, the African National Congress. Our David McKenzie is live in Johannesburg. So David, politicians like Cyril Ramaphosa, the president there, that we're seeing live now, talking about this, using this anniversary as an occasion to mark how far the country's come. But given the country's current troubles, it's not lost on the many voters how far there still is to go.",

The iconic election of 1994, with all those people waiting in line to vote, of all races, colors and creeds, was is a defining moment of the 20th century. And now we face a country that -- South Africans face a country where there are significant challenges. Inequality is growing; corruption, crime a significant issue; there has been rolling power blackouts and other major issues that we've reported on extensively. And the next month's election will certainly be the most closely watched election, I think, since that '94 iconic election -- Kim.",

Big major cities, like Johannesburg, Cape Town, other parts of metropolitan areas in South Africa have seeing the biggest challenges to the ANC's hold on electoral politics. They still have a very significant support, of course, particularly in rural areas.Many people tie the ANC government's use of social grants to prop up the poorest of this country and see if -- and expect -- and this is false, of course -- that if the ANC were to lose power, those grants could go away. But it's a very effective tool for keeping loyalty amongst the population. I think you've seen the ANC split, as it were, in a certain way. You have Julius Malema, the former anti youth league leader, who comes from the Left, and former president Jacob Zuma, who is now running for a rival party, could be a spoiler in this election. All of it means that this country, which has had a very vibrant democracy for 30 years, is potentially entering uncharted waters, that the liberation movement that is really part and parcel of politics here could lose significant support.",

But the Bucks would answer back after this. Kris Middleton, who made a three in the seconds of the fourth quarter to force overtime, hitting another one to tie it back up. Middleton had 42 points, so any calls a time-out in the huddle. You can see Tyrese Haliburton telling his team, we're winning the game right now. And he was right.

Both he and Washington got ejected. The Mavs would go on to win by 11 to go up 2- 1, wild scene. The New York Rangers are also a game away from sweeping the Washington Capitals out of the NHL playoffs. Chris Kreider with a goal in the first, moving him into a tie for third on the Rangers' all-time playoffs points lists. And Igor Shiserken (ph) was absolutely stellar too, after allowing an early score, New York's net minder finishing with 28 saves as they go on to win 3-1, good news for the guys in blue. Only four teams have gone up 3-0 and gone on to lose a series in NHL history. So they are in pretty good shape. And lastly for you this morning, Kim, if you need any evidence that Chicago Bears fans are pending their hopes on Caleb Williams as their team savior under center, here it is. Less than 24 hours after taking him with the first pick in the NFL draft, the quarterback's gear has already almost sold out, according to fanatics. The only jerseys left are the orange adult XXL and the youth navy blue. And for fans who maybe pre-ordered the number 13, the number you were in college, that is a bit of a tough break because he is going to instead wear 18 in the Windy City. And Kim, keep in mind this record was set only 10 days ago with Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever. Her jersey just went crazy and now it seems like Chicago fans following suit. They've got their guy. We'll see if it works out for them.",
