In just a few moments, we're going to be bringing you live remarks by Vice President Harris who will be speaking live in Houston to a biennial gathering at the Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority. It's hard to imagine she won't weigh-in in some way on what her opponent, Donald Trump said today at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in Chicago, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has already called his remarks repulsive.Before we play some of what Mr. Trump said, I do want to read you a portion of the statement his campaign put out shortly afterwards trying to put their spin on what happened, quoting now, \"President Trump has continually said that unlike Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, he's running to be president for all Americans and if you're running to unite the entire country you have to back it up with action President Trump did today.\" So that's how the campaign is explaining it. He was trying to unite the country today.

All eyes tonight will be on whether Vice President Kamala Harris decides to directly take on former President Trump's comments head on.She is set to speak tonight at an event with a Sigma Gamma Rho.

This is actually the third Divine Nine sorority that Harris will be speaking to just this month as she is seeking to rally Black women voters heading into this election. But as we wait to see whether Vice President Harris will respond to Trump, we are hearing tonight from her husband Second Gentleman, Doug Emhoff, \"The Washington Post\" is reporting that Emhoff a pushed back on Trumps' comments in a fundraiser in Maine this evening. Emhoff said, in part that Trump's comments at the NABJ showed, \"A worse version of an already horrible person. The insults, the BS shows a lack of character, but it's a distraction.\" He added, \"That guy it should never be in the White House again.\" Now, the Harris Campaign did release a statement responding to Trump's NABJ appearance say that he attacked Black journalists and that he also was seeking to divide the country at this time, but they didn't directly mention Trump's comments questioning Harris' identity and heritage as a Black woman. Instead, a lot of that pushback has fallen to allies, like White House Press Secretary Karine John-Pierre, who was asked about the moment in real time in the press briefing today. Take a listen.

      "sentences": "No, I want to be succinct in my analysis though, Anderson, and just kind of give it how I see it. There are a couple of points.The first is that, every person who votes for Donald Trump is not a racist and we have to be extremely clear about that. But Donald Trump is a racist. I recall not long ago, I think it was back in 2016, I believe, it was after, I was on \"State of the Union\" and there was a question about David Duke. It was before the Mississippi primary and I called Donald Trump a racist and David Axelrod, who I love and adore and who provides me more guidance and mentorship that I could ever be thankful for pulled me aside and said, you have to be cautious about throwing that term out and using it in such a fashion. And I so I began to say that, is that Donald Trump uses racism as political currency. And I think that's actually accurate as well. What we're seeing here though, and I want to be extremely clear, what we're seeing here is as Abby said, somebody who is extremely desperate. But I disagree slightly with the analysis. I think that Donald Trump goes into environments like this and talks to Black folk like they're dogs, because he wants to appease to other White voters. And I think he goes into environments like this and I think the spin that you're seeing from JD Vance and others is that he went into the lion's den -- he went into the heart of the beast. And the reason he does it is not to woo Black voters, but to show other White voters, at least I did it. I went and tried to talk to those Black folk and they just didn't really want to hear it. Now Kamala Harris, for example, has a different philosophy than I do. Because I disagree with Michelle Obama. I believe I'm from South Carolina where the politics is different. Michelle Obama said, when they go low, we go high. I believe when they go low, we go to hell and so I think that you have to fight fire with fire. Kamala Harris is more in line with Michelle Obama. I think Kamala Harris understands as you'll see tonight, that there's no benefit in rolling around with pigs because you both get muddy and the pig likes it. So, she's going to stay above the fray and she's going to talk about a vision for tomorrow. And I'm just going to stay here pissed at both the NABJ for inviting him and platforming him and him, for having the audacity to come into our house and disrespect Black women in front of Black women. I'm livid at it and I've been that way for nine years and I just want something new.",

Policies are what are going to help Republicans win the White House and wind down ballot races, not attacks and trying to litigate the race of a different candidate. Republicans need to stay focused and on-message. I know that seems a monumental task some days, but those policy positions that helped drive the economy forward, that were securing our southern border, that made sure geopolitical catastrophe was not at our doorstep previously, are what we need to be telling the American people and not trying to litigate the noise that you're hearing right now.",

There was a smattering of people who were there and seemingly in support of Donald Trump. I would say, there was only like three or five people. There was a lot of people who were there who were kind of mocking Donald Trump. Some folks laughing at the things he was saying.I mean, but I think my biggest response to what the room gives me is a sense that this is not something that's happening outside of Donald Trump's own volition. This is happening because Donald Trump believes these things about Kamala Harris. No one made him say these kinds of attacks about her. No one made him to Birtherism 2.0. He's doing it because this is something that is consistent in who his kind of public appeals have been throughout his political career. And so, I don't know what Donald Trump was expecting in that room, but then that room, you have a lot of accomplished journalists who are looking for facts, who are looking for contexts, who are looking to press people on questions, who are going to ask some things that other people don't ask. And so, when I was in that room, I was proud of Rachel Scott, I was proud of Kadia Goba, who were asking him pressing on those questions. And I think that's the reason we got some of these answers from Trump, is because that kind of DEI hire question that some people are afraid to ask, Rachel read the riot act and send it to his face. And I think that's the reason we got those sort of answers. But the room wasn't, I would say, pro or anti-Trump. That's largely a room of journalistic voices. You only had a smattering of people who I think were there may be because they knew who will be there. That was a small group of people, but the majority of people were there listening. And I think, frankly, if I have a critique, I wish we were able to ask more questions from the audience.",

I mean, they just did.They had a candidate and although they were very disciplined in their messaging, in the way that they were maneuvering, the way they prepared him for the debate, et cetera, it was just -- they had some sense of control. They had a decent convention. I thought it was a weird convention and I'm kind of sick and tired of using that word, but that's the only one I can come up with. But they were able to kind of stake a claim. It's what they were trying to present with Donald Trump. With Kamala Harris, she presents to them what is just a nemesis. It's been a thorn for Donald Trump for a very long period of time, which is an articulate, successful, powerful woman, particularly of color. He cannot respond to that for some reason and we're seeing that now, and what I believe is that, and Astead probably will text me later about this and say I'm decently naive -- but I just -- I believe in what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature. I do not believe that the underbelly of this country is going to win again. I just can't fathom someone going and praying on our least common denominator.
