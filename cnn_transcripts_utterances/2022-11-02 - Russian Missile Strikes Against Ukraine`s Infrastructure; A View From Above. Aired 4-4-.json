Among them, a hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine`s biggest in Zaporizhzhia. Another power gen site in central Ukraine. Kharkiv subway in the east still by strikes on vital infrastructure there. And despite intercepts, 44 across the country, according to the government, groups of missiles getting through, at least three according to this witness near Kyiv`s hydroelectric power plant. A missile flew over our house and went to the balcony, and saw the second missile and a drone, she says, both were flying in the direction of the power plant. It`s so scary when you see it. Three weeks of targeting Ukraine`s electricity network is pushing the power grid towards a tipping point, no doubt more of this to come. Nic Robertson, Kyiv, Ukraine.

      "sentences": "When you look at the Earth from the space station, it`s absolutely magical. It glows inblue, and it`s the most beautiful scenery you could possibly imagine. When you take a step back and you see the arsenic`s entirety, you understand it it`s just an oasis in the cosmos. All around, there`s nothing. No life. It`s blackness emptiness and there`s this blue bowl with everything we need to sustain human life and life in general which is absolutely fragile. It makes you want to cherish the Earth. I`m Thomas Pesquet, an astronaut for the European Space Agency. I`m coming back from my second mission to space, all onboard the International Space Station, so permanent laboratory that orbits the Earth. Just like us on board of space station, the Earth is a spaceship and we are its crew. It flies around the sun. It has limited resources. It has some protection means but they can be overcome. You don`t control the amount of resources that you have on board but you have to manage them. And what you can control, the way you care about the spaceship, the way you maintain it because you want the flight to be as long and peaceful as possible. You can see a lot of the consequences of human activities from space. Some of them climate change, some of them are just plain old pollution. My first mission was in 2016 launch, 2017 landing. My second mission was five years later, 2021, and I could see a difference. The most visible effect is glaciers retreating, year after year mission after mission. You know, the ice caps melting in the poles. I`m an ambassador for the food and agricultural organization of the United Nations. But during my mission on the space station, we had a lot of research done on plants because space is a harsh environment for plants. By studying plants in the environment of space, then we can study how they can resist to a drought or water scarcity, and then we can feed all those results to research being made on Earth and to create some more resistant crops, the crops that will resist to climate change. We`ve also worked a lot on all our packaging just like on Earth, we`re trying to limit the production the use of plastic the production of waste and so we came up with edible packaging, which is just a such a fantastic and simple concept. We need foam to protect everything from shocks during launch into space, so what we did is we turned that foam into food it`s like gingerbread. Now, our packaging is at the same time our source of food. It reduces the need to send cargo up. It reduces the production of trash. It`s brilliant. So, hopefully, that technology can also transfer to packaging on the ground and then we can reduce our environmental footprint every time we go buy something in the supermarket. If we set ourselves on the right path, there`s nothing we cannot do. We built that unbelievable facility in space. We`re using it every day, peaceful cooperation between countries that we`re not always friends. So if we can transfer that model to the way we deal with the environment I think we`ll get there. I`m optimistic for the future. If we can make a space station fly, then we can save the planet. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
