I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin in Israel where families are desperate for the return of the 237 hostages who have now been held by Hamas for six weeks. Right now families and supporters of those hostages are gathered in Tel Aviv. They're calling on Israel's government to do everything they can to bring them home safely. And it comes as Israel Defense Forces continue their battle in Gaza. Officials now vowing to advance anywhere Hamas is found with increasing indications that could mean IDF forces expanding ground operations into southern Gaza. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis is growing across the enclave. Following evacuations at Al-Shifa Hospital, one official says six doctors remain to care for the remaining 120 patients, too vulnerable to move. The Palestinian authorities Ministry of Health says only nine of Gaza's 35 hospitals are still operating. Fuel tankers and other aid entering Gaza through the Rafah border crossing today, the Israeli war cabinet agreeing to allow two fuel trucks to enter daily. But the U.N. says the limited supply is far from enough to meet Gaza's urgent needs. Let's go now to CNN's Jeremy Diamond live for us at that hostage rally in Tel Aviv. And it actually just ended but, Jeremy, what have people been telling you?",

For weeks now, we know that the Israeli government has been negotiating with Hamas via the Qatari government with the assistance of the United States. There appears to be a deal on the table that is being negotiated that could see dozens of women and children released in exchange for a multiday pause in fighting, but it is unclear if the Israeli government will take that deal. And so tonight, Israelis demanding with chants of now, now, now for those hostages to be released.I spoke with the cousin of one of those hostages tonight. This woman had been taken hostage with her husband and her daughter. But she sacrificed herself when there was a moment of opportunity to get away. Her husband and her daughter were able to get away but she has been held hostage in Gaza for 42 days. Her cousin tells me that she is anxious and frustrated. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I do know on a very basic level that my cousin, an innocent woman was taken from her home over 40 days ago, and she's still not home. So for me, yes, of course, I'm frustrated.

And to do that, he has to go all the way south.The problem is there's no return address for Hamas. There's no command centers. I don't care what anybody says, they move around, there's just no way to find them until you take all of Gaza. And so I think that's what the Israelis are forced to do. Fred, we have to be honest, they don't enjoy, you know, knocking these apartment buildings down. It's just they don't know how to get rid of Hamas unless they reoccupy Gaza. [15:05:04]",

And these wonderful volunteers have also been distributing all their staples for Thanksgiving, things like rice, green beans, cranberry, a lot of things that people would need for that kind of a meal. The organizers here describe this as enough food to have a modest Thanksgiving dinner. And let me tell you, this is not only about supplying the needs for family for a single day this year, this is more about helping families that are in needs because they lost their jobs. They're recovering from the pandemic and facing other situations. Let's take a listen to what the President of Hosea Helps told us earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because even if the economy is doing a little bit better than last year, for many families, it's still very hard to make ends meet. And just to give you an idea, yes, food prices have gone down a little bit. Just to give you an idea, let me tell you, for example, that a 16 pound turkey is $27.35 right now, that's a little less than 6 percent, down as compared to last year. A Thanksgiving meal is $61 which is 4.5 percent less than last year.But listen to this, and this is a key 25 percent higher than in 2019. How long will this line go on? They went to get even more food to be able to help more people. But the reality is that these people lined up for hours and hours and hours and everybody's eager to get some sort of help. But let me tell you this to finish, Fred, I have been hearing happy Thanksgiving here so often that I feel like it's the holidays already.",

So it traveled much farther than it did during that first test flight back in April. It also successfully separated, the spacecraft separated from the top stage and then the bottom booster, that was a success. All 33 Raptor engines successfully fired and worked in coordination with one another.And then finally, the launch pad actually survived this time, but it was totally destroyed during that first launch attempt. So those were the successes. But then of course, ultimately the rocket and this spacecraft did fail. There were two explosions or rapid unscheduled disassemblies as SpaceX likes to call it, because the ultimate goal of this mission was to -- for the spacecraft, the starship spacecraft to splashdown in this Pacific Ocean after completing almost a near full lap of the earth. So, SpaceX calling it a success. But the FAA has launched a mishap investigation to figure out all the little things that went wrong, what went wrong before they can give SpaceX the green light to try again. Fred.",
