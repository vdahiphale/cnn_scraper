I think that theletting out of the lawsuit initially that we saw in November of 2023 just last year, if he was going to settle that lawsuit, the time to do that would have been certainly the day before it became into the public realm. As to what we're observing, right, we should believe our eyes, right? Are our eyes lying to us? It's a vicious assault, the kicking, the punch, however you describe it. And I think that, notwithstanding the fact, Brianna, that the lawsuit has been settled, I think you saw that the federal government is investigating, right? You saw the Homeland Security Investigation agency that was there at his home looking into various allegations that were made in that lawsuit and others with respect to his conduct concerning sexual activities, concerning the consent around that, concerning any other commercial activity. And I think that's the larger fish to fry here. And so, when you see things like this, it does give credence and credibility to what people were saying, notwithstanding his denials. And I think the federal government is going to be looking into this very carefully as it relates to potentially moving forward in -- I know they're investigating, but in ultimately doing something about that investigation.

But, before taking off, Scheffler did release this statement, saying: \"This morning, I was proceeding as directed by police officers. It was a very chaotic situation, understandably so, considering the tragic accident that had occurred earlier. And there was a big misunderstanding of what I thought I was being asked to do. I never intended to disregard any of the instructions. I'm hopeful to put this to the side and focus on golf today. \"Of course, all of us involved in the tournament express our deepest sympathies to the family of the man who passed away earlier in the accident this morning.

And that's where he says the misunderstanding occurred. He thought he was following the initial instructions here. On the assault issue, I mean, it -- this idea, we see from the police report, is that this officer was kind of dragged a little bit.

If it's a detective, are they in plainclothes? Are they not? The other issue is, what instructions was he given? Were those instructions inconsistent? Was one person telling him to do something in law enforcement and another person telling him to do another? Was it accidental, such that he was going to the side where the person was dragged, that is, the law enforcement officer, or was it intentional? And so those are all the quirky facts. Obviously, if you do something intentional under the law, or even if you're reckless, that you consciously disregard the risk that your behavior could result in something, that's criminal. Sometimes, things are accidental. And that's what gets us into the misunderstanding category. But we will really have to see if this video footage available or other surveillance, what the specific conduct was, before we could proclaim whether it was, A, a misunderstanding or, B, something in the criminal variety.",

Maybe the fact is that they do know where they are, and most of them, again, may not be alive. So that's number one. Number two is, it just speaks to the humanitarian -- the morality of the Israeli people that would -- that would eagerly swap even the deceased body of a loved one for 40, 50 Palestinians, which is what Hamas is demanding. So, I think it speaks to the virtue of the Israeli people to do that. But I -- again, I think it speaks to the brutality of Hamas that they continue to hold on to these people, both living and the deceased now, for seven months and continue to use, as regrettably, the Palestinian civilians in Gaza as human shields. It's just a very difficult part of this, and we know that the Israeli people, the Israeli government want to accomplish two things, and probably in this order. Number one is return all the hostages, dead and alive, and, number two, wipe out Hamas once and for all.

And Israel's defense minister, Gallant, has said that he opposes military rule in Gaza. He's called on Netanyahu to rule that out. How do they make a plan for what comes next after all of this?

Both rest on the shoulders of the Israeli government and arguably right with Benjamin Netanyahu. And, as you pointed out, the Israeli defense minister publicly challenged Netanyahu to come up with a plan, saying that we need a political outcome. And he's absolutely right to say that. And so the question is, who will govern and provide policing services, who will provide public services, who will make sure security is intact during the time in which -- after Israel accomplishes its military objective and begins pulling out? And there's been suggestions of some type of U.N. force or a pan-Arab force or something like that. But that's very unclear. And it's something that may be -- may be weeks, but probably months away. And then the long-term solution is, will there be a two-state solution, Palestinians and Israelis living side by side in peace and security? And, if so, who will govern? Who will be in charge? And, again, this rests back on the Israeli government, principally Benjamin Netanyahu, who has rejected that vision, and for most others, to include the United States, who's -- who believe that is the way forward.",
