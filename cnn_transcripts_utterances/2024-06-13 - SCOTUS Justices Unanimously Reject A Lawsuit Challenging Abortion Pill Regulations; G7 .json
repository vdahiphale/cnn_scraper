      "sentences": "Yeah, that's exactly right. And what it does is while it closes the door on this lawsuit, it leaves thedoor open to other potential lawsuits. But as you guys mentioned, this is one of the big rulings we've been anticipating. And it really thrusts the justices back into the center of this abortion debate two years after they overruled Roe v. Wade. So, Zain, like you said, this time they gave sort of an inadvertent win to the supporters of abortion rights. So, the Supreme Court, it was a unanimous opinion. And what they did is they dismissed a lawsuit brought by anti-abortion doctors that could have severely restricted the availability of the abortion pill. And this is a drug that is used in more than half of all abortions nationwide. It's a drug that's become increasingly used in the two years since abortion rights have really been restricted in many states around the country. And what the Supreme Court said is that this particular group that brought this lawsuit, just this group of doctors, doesn't have the necessary legal standing or the legal right or the injury necessary to bring this case. And the Supreme Court said that's because the doctors here, they specifically didn't prescribe Mifepristone. They didn't use Mifepristone. So, they just didn't have any standing to even bring this case. The doctors, they had asked to really nullify the ability of the Federal Drug Administration to even approve this drug. And they also wanted to get rid of all the changes that were made to the drug in recent years, like making it available via mail, via telehealth, also allowing women to use it up to 10 weeks in pregnancy. None of those restrictions went back into place. All remains status quo. So, this is really a major win for abortion rights group. As I mentioned, though, it doesn't close the door to future lawsuits. You know, other groups might have the legal standing in the future to bring this case. They could really challenge the legality of Mifepristone, of the FDA's ability to approve Mifepristone in the future. But for now, this pill will remain widely available. So, Zain, you know, a big win at this moment for abortion rights advocates. But it's notable. We do have, you know, we're expecting about two dozen cases still in the coming weeks here. There's another case involving abortion rights. And then, of course, we're expecting several other big ones, including whether or not Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution. So, still a lot to come from this Supreme Court, guys.",

We'll get more details of it when President Biden announces it fairly soon. That is potentially something that could be in a risky place. But I think perhaps what backs it up is the fact that all the other NATO members are also making similar security -- bilateral security agreements with Ukraine. Fourteen NATO members have already done it. This will be President Biden moving ahead with it today will be a signal to the other 17 NATO members, as well, to do the same. So, in a way, there's some insulation from whatever impact Donald Trump might have if he becomes President. And if he makes other moves that would weaken NATO, as well. This, in a way, tries to provide some backstop on those risks. But I think what we're seeing in that multilateral deal to use the profits from those 300 billion dollars of frozen Russian assets to give Ukraine a $50 billion loan. I think that is a very clear signal of what's being done to try to ring fence support for Ukraine in case Donald Trump wins the presidency. And why -- why does -- why do I say that? And why has it been done? This this loan being done structured this way. And also, it's worth noting that it's agreed at the top political level. But because of the expediency behind this, some of the details are still being worked out. But the reason is to give Ukraine that money before the end of the year, a $50 billion loan. Ukraine gets the $50 billion. It's obligated to pay it back. But it has the money before a new U.S. President would be sworn in. So, that that would ring fence some support for Ukraine.

Indeed, ironically, the only one who's not currently in trouble is Giorgia Meloni, the Prime Minister of Italy and the host of this meeting. And she came from very much the right side of the Italian political spectrum, but -- but has become, I think, by all accounts, a very responsible and determined leader and somebody who has advocated support for NATO support for Ukraine. So, predicting what somebody is going to do once they get in office is very difficult, particularly with all due respect to the European Union, when it's based on European Union parliamentary elections, which are -- which are detached from decision making would be a kind way to put it. You know, I think it looks like Ursula von der Leyen will be reapproved by the parliament as the head of the -- basically the head of the European Union, which means no real change there. And the major factor, of course, is what happens in November in the United States. And that at this point remains a toss up. Yeah, you're absolutely right about Giorgia Meloni. I mean, I think sort of her perception or the perception people had of her on the world stage a few years ago is very different from the way people see her now. I mean, she's obviously become quite cozy with Ursula von der Leyen, with President Biden, as well.

But as you noted,the forecast is calling for more rain this afternoon and into tonight and into Friday, meaning that the flooding that you're taking a look at here is probably not going to get a whole lot better anytime soon. We are in a neighborhood in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. That is in Broward County. And this city here received well over a foot of rain in the last 48 hours. Now, we should have some aerials giving you kind of a broader look at just how bad of a situation things have been across parts of South Florida. The last couple of days, we saw a similar scene play out down in Miami-Dade County. That is home to the cities of Miami and Miami Beach, as well as Aventura. In those places, we saw anywhere between six to eight inches of rain. Now, across the state of Florida in southwest Florida, that is home to the Naples and Fort Myers area, folks there have been drying out since about Tuesday and Wednesday when about a foot of rainfall really accumulated there. And we saw some pretty significant flooding. Now, as a result of all of this rain and flooding, Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis, he declared a state of emergency in five counties here in Florida, including Broward County, as well as Miami-Dade County. And what that allows is for state and local resources to start working together to try to get some of this water out. They try to move some staff members, as well as some equipment into some of these neighborhoods, all in an effort to try to push some of this water out. Now, we were in this very neighborhood back in April of 2023 when a similar system moved through the area, except at that time, more than two feet of rain fell across parts of Fort Lauderdale over about a 48-hour period. And so, right after that happened, city officials out here tried to mitigate things moving forward. They installed new drainage systems. They bought additional water pumps. And they had all of this in place in anticipation that we're going to see more and more of these types of weather events take place. But as you can see here behind me, despite this new drainage system, despite having these water pumps on standby, ready to go, it is really difficult to get that amount of rainfall in that short period of time and try to move all of this water out. And so, officials really are telling folks, we're still not out of the clear here. We've got rain this afternoon. We've got additional rain tonight into Friday. And so, the expectation is right now that we're going to look at another two to three inches of rain come tonight. Zain?",

This Supreme Court ruling today is the justices trying to deal with some of the uncertainties that their original ruling brought up. Democrats are trying to -- every time there is a ruling by a conservative court or a conservative legislative parties anti- abortion law, they're trying to say, this is Donald Trump's fault. And it's a powerful argument because we've seen in previous elections that this is a driver of turnout for Democrats. Trump's position officially is that leave this issue to the states, but that doesn't get him off this political hook. That's the reason the Democrats are using it. And it's one of the few issues, in fact, where President Joe Biden has the greater trust of the public and a higher approval rating than Trump.

Just to pivot slightly, obviously Biden right now at the G7. I was talking to Ambassador Bolton just a moment ago saying that, look, so many things are up in the air, especially when it comes to the U.S. elections. We don't know what is going to happen come November. How much meaningful progress can President Biden make in terms of his decision- making at the G7 when the next few months are anyone's guess?

I think what a lot of thisG7 is doing with particular reference to Ukraine is trying to almost lock in future U.S. and Western support for Ukraine. We're going to see this also at the NATO summit later in the summer in Washington, that it would be more difficult for Trump and perhaps right- wing leaders in Europe, if they get more influence after the parliamentary elections on the weekend, to turn their backs on Ukraine. The problem is, is that Biden is not going to sign a treaty with Ukraine. It's not something that can be ratified by the U.S. Congress. Trump could come in and if he decides that he wants to cozy up to President Vladimir Putin, for example, he could undo a lot of what is being done in terms of long-term support for Ukraine economically and militarily at this G7 meeting. So, that is the backdrop of this. To your point about Biden and democracy, I think one of the hard issues for Biden is when you talk about democracy for many voters, it's almost an esoteric concept. It's hard to grab hold of. I think Democrats need to do a much better job of explaining to people what it would be actually like if their democracy is taken away, what it would be like if an American voter lost the right to choose the person they want to be President. I think there's a real need politically to boil this down to much more understandable terms, because as you were showing there with Donie's piece, you know, it's easy to demagogue the word democracy itself.",

As you rightly point out, there has been a systematic devastation to the health system here. Thirty six hospitals, not one is fully functioning. Not one. There's a handful that are partially functioning. So, Al-Aqsa, where I was, was already overcrowded and heaving before it had 400 casualties with those violent wounds of war over the weekend. So, we're losing children. Children are dying that shouldn't die, even beyond the bomb, simply because doctors cannot possibly cope among this. So, returning to that scene, it was a scene of parents screaming. It was a scene of doctors running. And it was a scene of death. We just keep returning to these same things time and again. As I say, this is now 250 days into this.

And then there was an operation in Rafah. And a lot of people in Rafah went to central Gaza. And then we saw what we saw over the weekend at the Nuseirat refugee camp, in which at least 100, obviously, the numbers are disputed at this point in time, but at least 100 Palestinians were killed. I'm getting alerts on my phone right now, essentially saying that there is another operation happening right now in Rafah.
