This was the scene in Central Kentucky, that's just north of Livingston. You saw that dark plume of smoke in the air. Officials say 50 percent of the fire has been contained so far.Keep in mind, when molten sulfur burns it releases sulfur dioxide and that gas has a really strong scent and it can cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. Officials are now urging residents near that derailment to evacuate to avoid any exposure to that toxic chemical. CSX, the train's operator, says that specialized equipment is now being brought in and used to monitor air quality in the area. Of course, we're going to stay on top of this story and bring you any new details as we get them. Meantime, we're learning new details about that car explosion that sparked fears of an attack at the U.S. Canada border yesterday. Today, officials, including the FBI, saying there is no link to terrorism with this incident. The security footage shows the car going airborne before it crashed and exploded into flames. You see it there going at a high rate of speed. This is at the Rainbow Bridge near Niagara Falls. It hits a curb and then it goes flying. CNN's Athena Jones has been following this story for us. She joins us now with more details. Athena, what are you learning?",

He did not have any nefarious intent.But what authorities believe happened is that they -- this man and his wife had planned to go to a concert by the rock group, Kiss, on the Canadian side of the border. That concert was canceled. And so, instead, they came to a casino here on the U.S. Side. This accident occurred while they were about to cross again. But as you heard from the governor, it's unclear why this 2022 Bentley accelerated such a high rate of speed, causing it to launch into the air. The good news here is that after, you know, a lot of confusion, all four border crossings shut down, three have now been reopened. We're still waiting to see how soon this Rainbow Bridge behind me opens, but we also have seen authorities out this morning, doing some fact-finding. So, bottom line here, this was not an incident of terrorism, according to the FBI, and -- but two lives have tragically been lost as a result of it.",

Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN:  President Biden has been calling on, the -- his highness, the Amir, and we had concert calls between both sides to make sure that we work together on this. And we appreciate, of course, the work done by the United States to make sure that the deal comes to fruition, and we continue to work with the United States over this. I can't speak of the details of how the -- you know, the role of the United States was formulated, but I can tell you that, of course, with the communication that's taking place all across the board, the Americans were very instrumental, especially in working with Israel over the issues of the deal.

P.J., thanks very much for joining us.As you know, Qatar is confirming that the work done by the United States to make sure this deal happens and the constant calls with the U.S. leadership leading up to this moment were very significant. How significant from your perspective was the U.S. involvement and for that matter, President Biden's role here? P.J. CROWLEY, FORMER STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN AND FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE:  Well, Wolf, part of the complexity here is you have Israel and Hamas. They're at war. And you have Israel and Qatar, they do not have formal diplomatic relations. So, Qatar provided the channel of communication. And I think the United States, including the president, you know, provided the, say, validation of the process, because as you're going back and forth during an indirect negotiation, you know, both sides have to get something of value and both sides have to know it's a certain point in this phase of the negotiation, this is far as it's going to go.",

And so, you need some statesmanship here, some risk taking, you know, to say, look, you know, we think we have a process that is beginning to work, you know, so we have the prospects that there can be multiple phases to this. You know, but at some point, you need someone to keep pushing the process forward to say, you know, let's achieve what we can and then build on that over time.

And part of that complexity is the fact that, you know, you have this negotiation going on in the midst of a conflict. You know, so you need to put intermediaries in place.As we know -- or as we think we know, not all the hostages are in one place. So, they've got to be moved into position. Who are going to be the intermediaries? The American Red Cross, for example, being critically important, are they positioned properly? And then, you know, you've got sequencing in terms of what's going to happen on the hostage front. What's going to happen on the drone front? How do you keep the forces separated, you know, during this pause? So, I'm not surprised this is taking some time to put together.",

It's a civil situation filed by an accuser against the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams.Do want to say that the reason -- and there are so many that are coming right now, but it's all because of legislation that was passed by the New York governor in November of 2022, it's the Adult Survivors Act, which says that any accuser of a sexual crime that they believe happened that, as far back as it could go, they may not be able to go to criminal court at this point, but civilly they can sue for monetary damages. And it doesn't matter when, and that's why -- the deadline is ending this week, and that's why there's a flurry of these now. But this accuser who remains nameless, but does say was a city employee at the time in 1993, 30 years ago, is alleging sexual assault, sexual battery, employment discrimination, retaliation, hostile work environment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Now, of course, Mayor Adams is a defendant as well as the City of New York and the NYPD, she is asking for a minimum of $5 million. Now, here's the response just several hours ago from Mayor Adams himself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY):  My career speaks for itself and just really, it's something absolutely that has never happened. And I don't even recall ever meeting the person who made the -- this allegation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
