Just ahead on today's showUkraine attack seven people have lost their lives and more than 80 have been injured after a Russian missile strike in Eastern Ukraine. All this, as Western nations grow increasingly concerned over the progress of the Ukrainian counter offensive, complete coverage on that just ahead. Plus tough talk. Senior U.S. diplomat Victoria Nuland meets military leaders in Niger after their coup she calls the meeting frank and difficult. All this as Niger closes its airspace to commercial flights. And rough weather hundreds of U.S. flights delayed or canceled after strong storms slam the East Coast. Hundreds of thousands still without power we'll have the latest. And in the Women's World Cup France trounces Morocco 4-0 and heads to the quarterfinals. Columbia Beach makes it too, all the football action coming up for you just ahead. But first a quick look on Wall Street where futures are pointing to a week open after an across the board rally for U.S. stocks on Monday all the major averages currently set to fall by more than half a percent. European shares lower too, all of this after an almost 2 percent tumble in Hong Kong the HANG SENG dropping amid weak Chinese economic data, details on that in just a moment. But first a double missile strike in Ukraine, the target the Eastern City of Pokrovsk. At least seven people have been killed and more than 80 injured after the Russian missiles hit a residential area. Meanwhile, Ukraine's counter offensive appears to be running into difficulties U.S. and Western officials telling CNN they're receiving increasingly sobering assessments about Ukraine's progress, our Jim Sciutto has been tracking this joins us now live. And Jim, the details I was reading in your report earlier are very concerning and a shift really from the optimistic tone we saw at the start of the counter offensive from Ukraine tells us what you've been learning? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: A marked shift, certainly since the beginning of the counter offensive, but even in the last couple of weeks. And this is a consistent read I'm hearing from both U.S. and European officials in the military, in diplomacy lawmakers as well. And they see this counter offensive largely as stalled. At this point, they have hope for change. But pragmatically, they see lasting challenges here and a couple of factors in that. One is just the difficulty of breaching Russian defensive three defensive belts, lines marked by tens of thousands of mines that have caused just staggering losses among Ukrainian forces when they've tried to breach them that's led to tactical changes, where they pulled back some of their units as a result. But there are also longer term issues here, Christina. The difficulty of training up Ukrainian forces in some of these newly supplied advanced Western weapons systems and doing so very quickly, in some circumstances, just eight weeks of training on new tanks, for instance. So trying to transform Ukrainian forces into to mass mechanized units, just hard to do in that timeframe with success. And then there is also a time pressure issue with the approach of fall changing whether there is pressure now to achieve results and a sense that that timeframe is rapidly shortening.",

The first Russian missile there was one Russian missile in the case of Kramatorsk. But it hit right around dusk when the pizza restaurant would have been at its busiest it had devastating consequences in Kramatorsk. And now here in Pokrovsk, the same popular pizza restaurant have been in there before was stopped passing through that town. Not too far from the front lines but still distant from it. There was no evidence when we were there earlier this year of any military facilities around there and by what the Russians have done or through what they've done which is fire one missile, bring in the rescue workers and then 40 minutes later fire another missile, which the Ukrainian say is not uncommon, sometimes called a double tap, although that's not the reference. That's not how the Ukrainians are specifying it. But it clearly in the Ukrainian mines is intended to cause catastrophic casualties among the rescue and recovery workers. And we know that the deputy head of the region's emergency services was killed in that second missile attack. And look at the list of casualties 81 casualties 31 civilians two of those children, and more than half of the casualties were either police or rescue workers or military on scene to try to help out seven people killed in total. One of them as I said, an emergency worker, another one, a military person, so it seems to be clear that what Russia was intending to do here and it was intentional, was that he hit a crowded restaurant when it was busy and then hit again all the rescue workers who came in to help.",

She said they had a frank and at times difficult conversation but no progress was made. Meanwhile, junta leaders from neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso also met Niger's leaders and Niger's Prime Minister said the junta want to reopen talks with the regional bloc ECOWAS. Larry Madowo joining me now live for the latest on this.

Thanks so much, Larry.Now, a brand new numbers out of China show the world's second largest economy continuing to weaken imports and exports both falling by double digits last month the numbers are shorter increase calls for new Beijing stimulus Marc Stewart has the story for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARC STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Here's where things stand. This is the third straight month that Chinese exports have declined their biggest drop in more than three years. In fact, if we break down the data even further, this is the biggest drop since February 2020. That's when we saw the initial COVID-19 outbreak impacting trade and production. So what's at play? We heard from an analyst who points out things have changed since the same time last year when exports saw a jump as the global economy started to move once again and prices were higher. There's also a feeling that things could get worse as global demand is falling and consumers question their spending levels as the world still tries to gain footing after the pandemic including fears of recessions. If we look back to last October, exports have shrunk as we saw both inflation and interest rates rise, negatively impacting global demand. And then there's the bigger picture China is the world's second largest economy. It's looking for some new energy if there's no choice but to lower prices in hopes of raising demand, the economy could be stagnant. So what about a possible solution? Some analysts want Beijing to come up with things such as incentives to help give demand a boost. Marc Stewart, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Climate scientists agree that climate change of greater than one and a half degrees could be disastrous for humanity. Well, July saw deadly heat waves and record temperatures on several continents as well as unprecedented heat.

We don't want to go beyond that as a planet for a permanent new temperature set. But we've broken this about 10 times in the past, but that was always in the winter. And this is significant because it's the first summer month that has created this new record that has gone 1.5 above what we're used to what the our sort of our Goldilocks climate that life as we know it evolved in right now. And this could be just some of the coolest summers of the rest of our lives unfortunately, because so much of this is built up over centuries into the Earth's systems the oceans absorb 90 percent of that heat, we're now seeing the numbers to match those jaw dropping you know, amounts of temperature that's been absorbed over our lifetimes right now.
