Or is he believed that that making that case, which is whether he's going to be impeached or members of his cabinet? Certainly in the House, we're going to hear talk about that. Does that motivate Democratic voters?LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it could motivate Democratic voters. I mean, when I was just talking to some recently this week, they mentioned democracy a lot. This is a part of that conversation, right? Some Republicans have said they want to impeach President Biden, that they also want to impeach members of his cabinet. And so that is definitely something that could become a reality if they win the house. Now, whether or not he's convicted, if the Senate flips, is another question, because the Senate tends to not always follow the House's lead.",

But I'm going to push back on that a little bit.First of all, a special counsel is not independent by design, they report to the Attorney General, and we saw with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump-Russia connections and the John Durham investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. Special counsels are not immune from political attacks. I actually asked the Attorney General about a possible Special Counsel back in March. And of course, not surprisingly, Merrick Garland gave a kind of non- committal answer. What he would seem to be trying to say is, we're not afraid of highly political cases. So what has changed between March and now? We all knew Trump was likely to run, that can't be it. What I have seen in reporting over the past seven years, and these highly political investigations, Hillary Clinton's e-mails, Russia, sometimes people who are not politicians, like Merrick Garland, they come to the Justice Department, and they underestimate just how politically fraught these situations are.

How do you handle this? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYSTThis decision is totally within Attorney General Garland's discretion whether or not to do it. He has to make the judgment does he think that the appearance of conflict with an election over the horizon demands that he appoint the Special Counsel, he has to decide whether it's in the public interest, that's a very general and vague standard by which to make a decision. And then he has to think about would the appointment of a special counsel delay the investigations in some way. You have to get the appointment, you know, somebody that would be acceptable, somebody who has the reputation and the actual experience to do it.
