Again, it's got better shape. Its eye is coming into a shape today. It will intensify more in very warm oceans before it heads to Taiwan. This is what's left of Trami. There's really not a lot left. It is still bringing some rain to parts of Vietnam, but cleanup continues in the Philippines after we had so much of that damage last week, and then it brought that heavy rain to Vietnam over the weekend. I mean, look at some of these rain totals. Dong Hoi with 685 millimeters of rain just over the weekend, the last two days. You could see a couple of outer bands are still swirling over Vietnam. We're not really looking at it organized in the sense of it being named anything tropical anymore, but it is still bringing some of that heavy rain. You could still get another 100 to 150 millimeters of rain before this thing finally pulls away. So, the rain continues in Vietnam. Then here's a typhoon Kong-rey that we watched intensify again this afternoon. And as it gets that eye, it's sitting on a very warm ocean temperatures and that will continue to fuel it. We are expecting it to rapidly intensify in the next 24 to 48 hours or so. You could see it peaking at that strength at 48 hours at 213 kilometers per hour for those winds in the center of the storm. So, again, incredibly strong storm as it turns towards Taiwan later in the week. We'll find these tropical storm force winds across the entire island, but really looking at those most destructive winds on parts of the south and southeast part of the island, that again could really do some damage. So, look at how this intensifies getting that clear eye possible as it's really intensifies. You'll bring on storm surge and heavy rain, especially to the east side there of the island as we get towards Thursday as this starts to make landfall. Look at some of these rainfall totals. We'll get some rain scraped to the northern islands here. The Philippines. Look at these rainfall totals again, especially on the east side of the island. Over 250 of rain possible. And then it continues to make this big turn, scraping heavy rain for parts of Eastern China, Shanghai. It could see up to 150 of rain. And then even turning into parts of Japan later on in the week.

Regardless of what happens in the U.S. election, theUnited States is undergoing a paradigm shifts in terms of how it views the relationship between economics and national security. And that does imply a trade policy that is shifting from openness and taking down barriers, regardless of trading partner, to viewing international economic relationships through a more strategic lens, right? Supply chains are being reshaped from a cross cutting just in time model to one that emphasizes resilience and redundancy from a perspective of indiscriminate sourcing to one that carefully picks trading partners, who to rely on, and more importantly, who not to rely on based on a security lens. So, given that strategic and economic rivalry between Washington and Beijing, the U.S. goal of lessening U.S. dependence on China's productive dominance will remain a priority. And likewise, the desire to build up some trade barriers, at least to prop up our domestic manufacturing capabilities will also remain a fixture of U.S. policy. So, the question for the next administration will be how to walk the line of propping up domestic manufacturing while assuring a healthy trading relationship with partners and allies to confirm that the perceived national security threat posed by dependence on Chinese production, and that includes the relationship with Europe? And the latter is more dependent on the candidate. The Harris administration will likely have a more conciliatory tone with its European economic relationship, Trump administration would approach Europe as another trade competitor.",

For example, it's unlikely that a Harris administration would roll back existing tariffs on Chinese goods. Likewise, when it comes to the relationship with the World Trade Organization, the Harris administration would be unable to abide by the multilateral bodies trade rules, because they're simply a compatible with the way the United States as economic competitiveness today with subsidies and sourcing requirements, for instance. Another case is, however, Harris administration may champion some novel policy actions that they -- but they would face an uphill battle on Capitol Hill. For example, placing carbon emissions on the -- price on carbon emissions of domestically produced goods or negotiating critical minerals agreements. So, the additional trading partners, which is something that alluded to by administration. In that vein, the Harris trade negotiators may find additional success in other areas that have alluded to Trump -- the Biden administration, like successfully concluding negotiations on the global arrangement on sustainable steel and aluminum. So, there's certainly going to be a continuation of policy, but perhaps some novel tools and we'll have to watch out for those.",

I mean, when you look at the impact of tariffs on individual goods, the effects maylook minimal, you know, altogether the trade weighted average of the tariff increases during the Trump administration went from 1.4 percent to 2.8 percent from 2016 to 2019, at least which may not necessarily strike you as enormous difference, but then you look at the aggregate and it shows that actually the significant trade barriers are being imposed would result in equally significant price increases for consumers. So, studies have shown that, for example, 20 percent across the board tariff combined with 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods would cost a typical U.S. household around $2,600 a year. And as you say, these prices would have -- these price increases would have an impact on the green transition just proportionally because China is such a significant player when it comes to manufacturing these green transition technologies. You know, end uses such as EVs or solar PVs are altogether made in China usually. The Chinese are also the best manufacturing inputs for these end uses, you know, lithium-ion batteries. You mentioned refined critical and - - refined critical minerals and materials. Again, China is the best at producing at the larger scale and at the most competitive prices. And in some cases, there are already fairly high tariff rates, but that blanket 60 percent would certainly make the green transition to the United States more difficult.",
