The men were in a pickup truck beneath the collapsed bridge where police say the frigid water made it impossible to survive. Four other workers are missing and presumed dead. Police say bad weather and the mangled wreckage of the bridge make it impossible for divers to continue their search. Meanwhile, investigators are analyzing the ship's voyage data recorder and interviewing the crew. They say the Dali was carrying 56 containers of hazardous material, some of which were damaged in the collision. Others are in the water. They also say the bridge built in the 1970s was in satisfactory condition when inspected in May of last year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENNIFER HOMENDY, U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD CHAIRMAN: It's pretty devastating, certainly, seeing not just what's going on with the cargo containers, but just looking at what was a bridge span, three bridge spans, that is pretty much gone.

Like today, if you see like a seismic area like California, the system has much more redundancy, which means that the much bigger piers and also it can take a lot of impact. So therefore, it's much more redundant in a sense for against this kind of impact. Remember, this ship is huge. It's 100,000 tons at empty. It's about 300 meters long and traveling about 10 miles per hour. It's about the speed of a bicycle. Kind of slow, but it's such a huge element. So therefore, the momentum is big.

However, we have seen other similar deadly disasters, the most recent just a month ago, involving a cargo ship hitting the Pearl Bridge in Guangzhou, China.What needs to be done to reassess the structural integrity of these older bridges here in the U.S. and, of course, around the world to update them so they're less vulnerable to accidents like this?

So it's definitely those bridges exposed to quite a risk.Now, in the 1980s, a bridge like that collapsed in Tampa Bay in Florida State. And they actually reconstructed in a much more robust way. The pier is actually, the pier is what I was talking about, protected by the island. So they built an island around the pier and also the bumper around it. So when the ships are coming through, it will actually absorb the energy and slow it down. But there's no structural system that can withstand such a huge impact, you know, just to make it slow down and hopefully lessen the risk of a collapse. Now, today, if you follow the modern bridge design code or guideline, the probability of a collapse each year is 1 in 10,000. So it's definitely a rare event, but there's definitely a risk exists. So for the older bridges, the best we can do is build the protective devices or elements around the pier. That's probably the most cost effective and the fastest way to reduce risk.",

I think that's a very important concept, something we use in the earthquake area.

Mr. Netanyahu says his country has no choice but to move into Rafah as its quote, \"very existence is on the line\". The deadly and devastating effects of war already being felt in Rafah. Palestinian health officials say at least 11 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city. Officials at one hospital say those strikes hit a home where families were sheltering and say an 11 year old child was among the dead. WAFA, the Palestinian news agency reports that residential buildings in other parts of Rafah were also targeted. And CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman joins us now from Rome with more. Good to see you Ben. So what more are you learning about Israel's decision to reschedule that meeting with U.S. officials in Washington over the planned operation in Rafah? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, we understand that this meeting is now going ahead after of course Prime Minister Netanyahu angrily canceled a visit by senior Israeli officials to discuss this operation. Now we're now in day 174 of this war, the death toll in Gaza is at least 32,570 percent of them women and children.

There's all of the Gaza Strip north of Gaza. People move down, they can move up. Now that seems rather flippant considering that many of these people have simply lost their homes completely. Much of northern Gaza has been destroyed by Israeli bombardment and those who try to venture to the north of Gaza often come under Israeli fire. Now how U.S. officials are going to deal with this Israeli approach to the situation in Gaza is anybody's question. Now we understand that when Israeli officials were in Washington this week, the Americans were suggesting that the Israelis be more pinpoint in their pursuit of Hamas' leadership. So they're not really telling the Israelis not to conduct an operation in Rafah, which of course has more than a million and a half people who've sought refuge there.

Four construction workers remain missing and are presumed dead. The bodies of two others were recovered Wednesday. Well the grief from the bridge collapse goes beyond borders. The six victims were immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. They're being remembered as hard-working husbands, fathers, sons and brothers. CNN's Gustavo Valdes reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GUSTAVO VALDES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Maynor Suazo Sandoval is remembered by friends and family as a visionary, a man who dreamed big. He said that if we wanted to get ahead as a family, we must work three times harder together, said his brother Martin, who still lives in the small village in northern Honduras where they grew up. He was the youngest of eight children and almost 20 years ago left Honduras for the United States looking for a better future. And his hard work paid off. His brother proudly says that Maynor managed to build a successful construction business that allowed him to send money home, improve the family house where his parents still live and open a couple of businesses, including a hotel. He also financed local soccer leagues. He believed that helping children have a better life would improve the chances of a better Honduras, his brother says. But his business suffered during the pandemic. He was among the group of workers doing repair work on the Francis Scott Key Bridge that collapsed when a cargo ship hit one of its pillars. The news of the tragedy was a blow to the family who struggled to break the news to Maynor's mother.

And one thing you don't hear anything about is the police.MCKENZIE (voice-over): Police can't cope, underfunded and struggling with corruption. Dash cam footage shows the criminal gangs private security are often up against. In South Africa, more than 20,000 vehicles were hijacked last year. Murders are at a 20-year high. Cash-in-transit heists are now commonplace. Armored vehicles targeted in broad daylight by heavily armed gangs. This heist on a major Joburg highway in October.",

And if you think we're exaggerating, just over my shoulder, about 20 minutes drive away, early yesterday morning, there was another attempted cash-in-transit heist, say police.And in two months or so, we'll be having a critical election here in South Africa. This will be one of the main issues on the voters' minds when they go to the polls. Rosemary?",
