It's 10(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ACOSTA (voice-over): The leader of the Wagner Group says they capture the facility, a key operations base for Russia's war on Ukraine, without firing a single shot. Those cheers you just heard are local, showing their support. The head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, also claimed to seize a military facility in another city about halfway to Moscow. That's when Prigozhin says he ordered his mercenaries to suddenly turn around. This is video of them pulling out of one town. And here's Prigozhin receiving a hero's farewell as he leaves. He says he struck a deal to end the advance on Moscow to avoid a bloody conflict. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, FOUNDER, WAGNER GROUP (through translation): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan.

Or are they cheering Prigozhin because he left their town and avoided a massive potential, massive bloodshed if the Russian military had actually gone in there hard to get him? But it does seem, on the face -- from a face of what we're seeing, that this is support for Prigozhin, and perhaps this is what Putin was worried about.But he does seem to be out of touch. The conventional wisdom has been that Putin is the guy that can pull all the strings, that has good strategic oversight. But this was a situation he let get out of control, and it's not clear how much control he still has. Is his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, still in place because Prigozhin demanded that he be forced out? That Prigozhin's troops didn't have to sign up and become part of Russia's main forces under Sergei Shoigu? Where's Prigozhin right now? Is he in Belarus? What's going to happen to him when he gets to Belarus? Is he going to be under house arrest? Is he going to be forced not to speak on TV, not to criticize Putin? None of this is clear.

We saw a couple of situations on the main highway where there were a couple of trucks parked across the highway that were supposed to potentially block Prigozhin's forces. They'd just been forced out of the way. What's bizarre in all of this is that the conventional wisdom in Russia is that the Russian leader, Putin, is respected by the people of Russia, and they tolerate whatever he does because he is powerful, he controls the situation and he keeps them safe.That's been rewritten today. As part of that rewrite, where does Prigozhin stand? What is he able to mount another angry aggression against the defense minister, against the defense minister's deputy, Gerasimov.",

Thanks so much.The actions of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his mercenaries have been the biggest threat to Vladimir Putin's grip on power in two decades. So what does this mean for Putin and Russia going forward? I'm joined now by retired Brigadier General Peter Zwack, a former US Defense Attache to Russia, and Beth Sanner, former Deputy Director of National Intelligence and CNN National Security Analyst. General, to you first. It's been a little while since you and I have spoken. We used to speak on a regular basis about what's been going on in Ukraine. But the common denominator during all of those conversations, and I guess what we're talking about tonight is Vladimir Putin and what is going on with Vladimir Putin Not that long ago, such naked aggression against Moscow would have just been inconceivable. But in the past few weeks, we've seen drone attacks on the Kremlin. People still are scratching their heads over that one. And then what we saw take place today. And then there are people cheering in the streets for somebody like Prigozhin. It just seems you just would never expect to ever see in Putin's Russia.",

The other existential fight that's going on or has been going on is inside the Kremlin and the viability of the Putin regime. Which today, I think, it may take some time, has suffered a mortal blow.In the most unlikely of ways, though, Yevgeny Prigozhin and Wagner, he's been talking and speaking. I don't think anybody could have imagined that this would happen. What he has done is he has divided the Russians. He's got them squabbling publicly. If you're a Russian citizen, you say what the heck is going on with our leadership or a soldier, let alone, where you see the Wagner Group is fighting with the military.

And of course, he's been very critical of military and defense officials in Moscow for some time now, and then he does this.And as General Zwack was just saying a few moments ago, to have these scenes of people cheering in the streets, that to me is remarkable in that those images were even allowed out of the country and that people were in the streets able to do this sort of thing.

Yes.Now, imagine you are a mid level Russian officer and you're completely tuned in all this. What's going on in Moscow? What's going on in my country? And the young Russian on the line, oh, by the way, Wagner Group, another about 40,000, nobody knows, is out. They're still dealing with a fight with a Ukrainian, with the Ukrainians who've got to be absolutely heartened by this and going to come at them even harder. Where's the tipping point? It's been a tough fight, but where's the morality and the will -- morale and the will to fight among the Russians with all this negative messaging? So, there is a lot going on. I think the Ukrainians are clever and a half and they are looking for that scene. And we'll capitalize it probably with a message to a lot of the Russian rank and file. Go home, surrender, put up your arms. We're coming. And we're going to come through and fight. You don't have to do this, Russians.

These are great experts, and my expertise is on leadership.And what we see here is this is a leader who has been in power, has fortified himself by fear, by coercion, by a sense of structure and intel, all that's broken down. He's caught by surprises. Intel is not there. He doesn't have the fear. He doesn't have the coercion. It's a perfect case study of contrasting leadership styles. When you look at Volodymyr Zelenskyy, by contrast, he rules by the affection of his people, by the sense of trust in the people, by an embedded sense of legitimacy, doesn't fear this kind of an insurrection. It's extraordinary. What that means now is he's got threats. This is now back to Putin threats inside and outside. And on the outside. It's all over the map, everywhere from China to Chechnya, everywhere from Beijing to Belarus. He's got allies that are now worried about how much they can anchor on him. Of course, messaging to Ukraine, messaging elsewhere on the outside, but inside, it's total chaos. It's roving warlords. It's not just Wagner Group. There are several other groups out there.

That's a primary concern. And I don't want to be alarmist on that, but in a strange way that many in the US government almost like a unified command for Russia, so we don't have worry about that.

And here we are a year-and-a-half later in their losing ground, not winning ground, and the massive casualties.But you're right, Prigozhin is hardly a sympathetic heroic figure, not to be confused with (inaudible) or Navalny, let alone the late Boris Nemtsov, killed in prison. Those people had the affection of the people and they were noble, heroic types. Prigozhin is a butcher and a bully. What he did, of course, in Aleppo, in Syria, he bombed a quarter of a million civilians. And his atrocities throughout Africa, this is one vicious guy. He orders the sledgehammering of people who betray him. So this is not a nice guy. The old bit about the enemy of the enemy is our friend.

You know, it's a brutal war and it's wearing them down, I suspect. And I don't see monetarily how they can withstand too much more of this just because it's gone on so long. It has to be stretching their finances very thin. And I suspect and that hurts back home. And you saw, you know, when they were rolling in that just -- I thought it was a lackluster at best attempt of the folks trying to stop Prigozhin from coming in and the Wagner group. So who knows?",

And, you know, you remember the first couple of months of the war, people didn't like it. But in fact, we're funding both sides of that war with oil contracts because we still honored those contracts. And so I feel like we're talking out of both sides of our mouth on this thing, and we should have never had anything to do with it.We should have provided economic pressure on Russia and gone with that first, gone with our diplomacy first before we led with the bullets. And I'm afraid we kind of got the cart before the horse. That's just my opinion. I'm fiscally reserved on these things. We're $32 trillion in debt, and so 114 billion unrestricted dollars to a country that's fairly corrupt to me is probably not a good investment.",

They're just everywhere. And so, you know, they're watching us and watching how we react. They're watching mostly our political movement during all this and just seeing what we're doing, because it's just like with the balloon, I don't -- I believe the most they got from that, they got a lot of technology, but they saw how we would react or not react, and they saw our military, how it would not react in our White House.
