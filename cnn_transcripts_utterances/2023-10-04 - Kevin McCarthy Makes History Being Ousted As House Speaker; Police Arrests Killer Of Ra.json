He is someone who is a -- more of a conservative pick. He was the former co- founder of the far-right House freedom caucus but he has become more of a leadership and Kevin McCarthy ally in recent years. Hence, why he ascended to the top of that Committee on the powerful Judiciary Committee But right now, House Republicans, a number of them from the Texas delegation are meeting in the Capitol and they are hearing from those exact candidates who are making their pitch and trying to make the case for why they should be the next Speaker. So, already, a lot of movement underway here. But as of right now, the House is paralyzed until they can elect a new Speaker.

It's not about Republicans or Democrats. It's about this country and to have -- and leave the ability for one individual, one egotistical maniac who wants to cause havoc like Matt Gaetz, to give him the opportunity to do that again would be a shame and completely derelict of our duties.

And one of the biggest things that I've been mentioning in the last 24 hours is, I mean, he is such a hypocrite in that he criticized Speaker McCarthy and other Republicans like me for last Saturday voting in a bipartisan fashion to put forth that CR across the floor to make sure that we can keep our government open for 45 days. Yesterday, in his motion to vacate, him and a small group, a very, very small group of Republicans joined forces with every single Democrat on the floor, including those to the far left, the ones that he hates the most.

How do you make that work, given that you are leaderless, speakerless, at this point, and Congress is frozen for at least a week? D'ESPOSITO: Well, we're definitely not leaderless. We have a leader in Steve Scalise. But yes, we need to move quickly. We need to move efficiently, and we need to move as a party. There's no reason that we should be getting into a speaker vote that lasts 15 rounds again. We need to go to conference on Tuesday. We need to come up with a plan.

So, over the last several months, they have been trying to find a legal pathwayto do this, and the Justice Department has been working with the Pentagon and the White House to figure out how they can take these seized weapons that they have seized from Iranian shipments going to Yemen to support the Houthis there and use them to support Ukraine, because obviously, Ukraine is facing pretty critical ammunition and weapon shortages at this time. Now, they have apparently figured out a way, which is through civil forfeiture. Essentially, the Justice Department has taken control over these seized weapons and ammunition, and that allows the U.S. to use them as they see fit. And so, what we're seeing now is that that process has already begun. The U.S. already transferred over one million rounds of that seized Iranian ammunition to the Ukrainians on Monday, and it is our understanding that is only the beginning. The U.S. has seized thousands and thousands of assault rifles and other weapons and equipment from the Iranians over the last several months as part of a broader campaign to interdict the Iranian smuggling network that is going to Yemen and fueling the war there. So, instead of just keeping these weapons in storage, the U.S. has taken the advice of many advocates who say, look, Ukraine could really use these. And I think that, you know, it's important for the symbolism, as well, because as you know, Iran and Russia have a partnership, and Iran has been helping Russia in its war in Ukraine, sending them drones and other equipment. So, this could really drive a wedge between the two countries now that Iranian equipment and ammunition will start showing up on the battlefield in Ukrainian hands. Bianna. Zain.",

And so, one of the big things the administration, of course, is going to be looking at is amongst these candidates for House Speaker -- are they pro- Ukrainian? Are they in favor of supporting the additional support to the Ukrainians? Right now, one of the leading contenders, Jim Jordan, he apparently is saying that he is not in favor of that. It remains to be seen whether he can be swayed or whether the other candidates will be able to be lobbied by the administration.

The bus caught fire, and so we had first extinguished the flames in order to get inside, says the spokesman for the fire brigade. We carried out a rapid intervention, which allowed us to save 15 people, but unfortunately, we could do nothing for the victims. Most of those victims were on their way to a tourist camp on the outskirts of Venice, among them -- Ukrainians, Germans, French, Croatians and Austrians. The Venice prosecutor has launched an investigation into the crash using videos of the crash to determine if other vehicles were involved and also looking into the possibility the driver, a 40-year-old Italian national who also died in the crash, may have suffered a health issue.

All that's true. But -- there is a but. And that is that there is a point of view in the Democratic Party that the worse, the better, the more chaotic the Republican caucus appears, the more likely the Democrats will win back the House in 2024. And there's evidence of that, Zain, from 2022, which is that we had an unusually large number of voters who said they were dissatisfied with the way things were going in the country, dissatisfied with Biden's performance, and voted Democratic anyway because they view the Republican alternative as too extreme.

I mean, the way in which he kind of pressures Republicans to stand behind him, to show that they're behind him 100 percent even as he's getting indicted, for example. But he doesn't really return the favor ever. You know, there's a lot of, it's one of many reasons why you can shake your head at how Republicans have continued to kind of circle the wagons around Trump at each moment. They've had an opportunity to separate from him. They've chosen not to. But look, Trump is a manifestation of what we were just talking about, that there is a big audience in the Republican coalition. There's a big portion of the Republican coalition that believes they are being marginalized and displaced by all the ways America is changing, culturally, demographically, and economically. And what they want above all, more than any specific agenda, is someone who will fight against those changes by any means available. And that's what the rebels and the House were reflecting. That is the wave that Trump has ridden to become the most prominent figure in the GOP. And it is one that ultimately produced January 6th. I wrote today, January 6th was one manifestation of that.

And that might give them more freedom to maneuver here. You know, the point about the government shutdown as McCarthy correctly understood, that Republicans would not be in a better position to negotiate for what they want after shutting down the government than they were before. So, there was really no reason to take the risk of being blamed for inconveniencing and disrupting the lives of millions of Americans. That calculation will still be true in 45 days, and it's possible that the next leader will make the same judgment as he did. Ukraine is a different story, because, you know, there is this growing isolation, a streak in the Republican party that Trump exemplifies. I mean, the fact that you have the two leading candidates in the presidential race, Trump and DeSantis, both largely opposing further aid to Ukraine. It is going to be a rocky path. I would suspect they still will find a way to do it in the near term, but the longer this goes on, the more that Republican opposition spreads and the greater the threat becomes to, in effect, give Putin what he wants by pulling back our support.",

This seemingly came out of nowhere on Friday when law enforcement in Las Vegas announced that after nearly three decades, they finally made an arrest in the murder of Tupac Shakur. This individual, Duane Davis, police described as the shot caller in this group of people that were allegedly retaliating against Tupac Shakur. Now, they showed this video from near the incident on the Las Vegas Strip again, nearly three decades ago, where this group with Tupac Shakur and one of his associates allegedly attacked the nephew of the defendant. And then the defendant got a group together to go hunt down police say Tupac Shakur and that resulted in this vehicle pulling alongside Shakur. Someone in that car opened fire, killing him and injuring the driver. But there's been this question for all this time about who actually did it. Now, this individual, Duane Davis, as you mentioned, he has not been quiet. He's been out there publicly talking about the circumstances. He even admitted that he was in the vehicle. He said that he had nothing to do with the murder, but he's not someone who's been quiet. And we actually had a former law enforcement officer from Los Angeles on CNN who said that back in 2009, this individual confessed to police about his involvement, as well, but it couldn't be used against him based on the circumstances. So, we still have that looming question, why now after all this time?
