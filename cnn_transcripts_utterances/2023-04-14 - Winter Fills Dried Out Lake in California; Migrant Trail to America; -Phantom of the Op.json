This also prohibits doctors from prescribing abortions by telehealth and getting an abortion pill in the mail.Abortion rights are shaping up to be one of the huge campaign issues heading into next year's presidential election.

This winter's historic atmospheric rivers and several feet of snow have brought with it snowmelt, turning the dry lakebed back into an inland ocean, right? It's great, except for the farmers who have been working the land for generations.CNN's Bill Weir live for us on the banks of Tulare Lake. OK, Bill, this is the opposite kind of what we have been talking about, you know, rivers and lakes drying up. This is the opposite. So, this is good for the lake, but bad for agriculture?",

Imagine a flooded area 20 ft long by - or 20 miles long by eight feet -- miles wide, that is going to get three times bigger by spring. This is this ghost phantom lake that is back from the dead now and making life a headache in the central valley of California.Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEIR (voice over): In California's central valley farmers have spent much of the last 20 years praying for rain. But then came this winter of relentless rivers in the sky. Enough to bring a long dead lake back to life and drown over 150 square miles of farmland and counting. So now, they pray for the water to stop. WEIR (on camera): It is mind blowing to realize that if you'd stood here for the last couple of generations, you'd be watching the sunset over dusty fields of cotton or alfalfa or pistachio trees. And now it is waterfront property. I had no idea Tulare Lake was once the biggest freshwater body west of the Mississippi, but it was damned and diked and drained to build a $2 billion agriculture industry. And now it's back. It's proof that water never forgets. And this may just be the beginning because behind those clouds over there, the Sierra Nevada's are so packed with snow, 260 percent above normal, and sooner or later that's going to melt, which is only going to make this flooding worse and last longer. WEIR (voice over): The last time it flooded this dramatically here was 1983, and it took two years to dry out. WEIR (on camera): You were telling me about the effects in '83?",

DANIEL L. SWAIN, CLIMATE SCIENTIST, UCLA: So, the ground has literally sunk in some places by 10 or 15 feet over the past decade. That has literally changed the topography of the historical lakebed.

And our Nick Paton Walsh and his team recently hiked the entire thing alongside thousands of migrants who traveled on foot carrying all their possessions as they navigate through dense jungle, rushing waters, and steep mountainsides. This team did this walk over five days, and the stories they found are just extraordinary.Watch.

WALSH (on camera): People, as they walk just discarding their shoes. Their real sense of the atmosphere changing now, we crossed the border into Panama. People clumping together, perhaps fearing for their own safety. And this mud is just impossible to go and get your feet out of it. WALSH (voice over): This man, who didn't want to be named, now with nothing on his feet but his resolve. Pause and imagine where you've come from if you're willing to do this, barefoot, with a woolen sweater and plastic bags. Pierce your feet or break an ankle and this mud may be your grave.
