And then he moves on and - you know, he's asked, this is at a news conference in Kyrgyzstan, are other swap possible? And he says in Russian, (Foreign Language), everything is possible. So it's not yes, we're going to move forward. But it is anything's possible. We are continuing to talk. So I think it is a positive thing. But again, not really definitive. And the two factors that he points out are, negotiations and compromise. So I guess, in his calculus, he felt that negotiations did lead to compromise, and there's going to have to be more compromise ahead. But of course, this is going to be very held behind the scenes.

Like Jill was outlining, is he going to continue smuggling arms? The Pentagon has been very concerned about what the Russians are also doing in Africa, not only in Ukraine, but across the world. All of Viktor Bout's contacts, the things that he was doing for many, many years and the U.S. did do, according to our White House reporter, here, a security assessment of whether the release of Viktor Bout would actually impact the national security of the United States. And what they found is that, they tell us that they do not believe that his release will pose any kind of threat to Americans. But of course, Pentagon officials and also law enforcement officials, who of course, put him behind bars in the first place many years ago, they are very concerned about, first of all, the precedent, of course, that it sets to release someone who was convicted a very serious crimes in exchange for someone who was taken and detained on a charge of marijuana possession, and of course, the possibility that he could reup his activities in the arm smuggling world.

Well CNN International Diplomatic Editor, Nic Robertson is joining me now live here in London. Nick, I want to get your assessment of these comments by President Putin in the last few hours saying that prisoner swaps are possible.

The conscription was, you know, a public relations disaster. He had hundreds of 1000s of people flocking to the border, the streets of Moscow even were deserted in the day -in the days after people were worried about being conscripted. The war's not popular, people are coming home dead. Families are grieving. Putin hadn't made a big deal of getting Viktor Bout released. But he's done it. And now they appear set on playing it up. And I think there's a couple of sort of key indicators here about Paul Whelan and about President Putin saying that more deals are possible. Paul Whelan was able to get access to a phone from his jail to call CNN yesterday and say that he was disappointed about being left behind. Now that plays into President Putin's hands very well. Paul Whelan sometimes can't even get to see his lawyers, can't get to see his representatives from the U.S. Embassy. So the fact that he got a phone last night, right after Brittney Griner was released, I think tells you a lot that Putin is trying to play up this issue of Paul Whelan because there must be something else that he wants, and whatever it is, that will be political capital, to replace some of that that is lost over the war in Ukraine. And I think the other indicator here is Viktor Bout himself. He knows Russia well, and he knows that there will be a message the Russian authorities want him to portray. Now he's back. I think in the short conversations reporters have had with him, they've tried to play up this issue of Russia phobia, which of course, is very popular at the moment. It's the Kremlin's narrative, the world against us. And he said, well, I didn't experience that. And he did say that that phrase, we never leave anyone behind. So I think we're going to hear Bout when he comes out, after having had more consultations with Russian authorities, amplifying the benefits to Russia, of his release. And what this says about Putin and Putin's strength, because at the end of the day, that's what's most important to President Putin, the political capital from it.",

Thank you very much for joining us.And as China's president makes moves on the world stage, he's still facing issues back in Beijing, where there's relief and happiness after China rolled back some of its most stringent COVID restrictions. There's also worry of course, and unease about the rapid change on Chinese social media topics relating to that and what to do if infected by COVID were trending. Some people are stocking up on medications. One retailer says sales of drugs including cold and cough medicines has gone up 18 times higher, and sales of face masks went up a whopping 680 percent compared to the previous year. But the loosening of COVID restrictions in China were of course sparked by landmark protests.

MITZI PERDUE, AUTHOR AND ANTI-HUMAN TRAFFICKING ADVOCATE: All right, it is an amazing gem. Back in 1622, there was a treasure ship that was going to the king of Spain. It founded in a hurricane. And it was lost for more than 350 years. My late husband, as you mentioned was one of the backers that helped find the whole treasure ship.
