Every four years, the best players from across the planet representtheir nations in an epic soccer tournament. The world cup kicking off this Sunday in Qatar is the men`s tournament. The women`s is next year, and more than one million people are expected to travel to Qatar. That`s more than a third of the nation`s entire population. This year`s tourney has been described though as the \"World Cup of chaos\". For the first time ever, it`s not being played in the traditional summer months because for the first time ever, it`s in the Middle East where the Qatari desert would have been scorching hot during that time. So, players in top leagues across the world are having to play this World Cup in the middle of their club seasons, meaning they`ll be exhausted. Also, the country of Qatar has been criticized for its human rights record. More now from CNN anchor and correspondent Isa Soares. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Before a ball is kicked at the year`s tournament, attention has focused on Qatar`s human rights record. Its stance on same-sex relationship, and most damaging to its reputation, the treatment of overseas workers drafted in to build essential infrastructure. Amnesty International claims authorities failed to properly investigate the deaths of thousands of migrant workers despite evidence linking premature deaths with unsafe working conditions in the searing heat. Qatari officials say they investigate all reports of abuse and exploitation and are committed to holding unscrupulous employers to account. When the final whistle goes at Qatar 2022, the legacy will be judged not only over 28 days of football but in the years that lie ahead. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
