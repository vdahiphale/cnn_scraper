They say the suspect then drove across the county -- to see her country, sorry, to see her before killing three members of her family. CNN's Camila Bernal reports.

Officials say that he'll meet with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday at the White House where they will discuss pressing issues including the war in Ukraine, trade, and climate change. Mr. Macron is also expected to meet with other officials throughout the week in an effort to strengthen French/American ties.Support for Ukraine will be high on the agenda at a meeting of NATO foreign ministers which begins in Romania soon. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg gave the opening speech earlier at the forum in Bucharest. Stoltenberg will be meeting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in just a few hours' time. And for more on this I'm joined by CNN's Selma Abdelaziz. Selma, I'm struck by the parallels of this. Because it was in Bucharest, I believe in 2008 when NATO met George W. Bush then said Ukraine and Georgia will be welcome to join NATO one day and then just a few months later Russia then invaded Georgia. So, there are stark historical parallels here in the context of Russian aggression. What are they hoping to achieve at the summit?",

So obviously, exactly what Selma was just saying. The NATO countries saying that that support is going to continue and it's certainly something that's been infuriating the Kremlin over the past couple of months.The thing you always hear out of the Kremlin, from the spokesman Dmitry Peskov . But of course, also from Vladimir Putin as well. Is that they essentially blame NATO for prolonging the conflict in Ukraine, for prolonging the war in Ukraine -- according to the Russian narrative at least. First and foremost, by supplying weapons to the Ukrainians which of course means that the Ukrainians can actually stay in the fight. The Russians are saying, look, the war would be over right now if NATO didn't supply all of these weapons. Obviously, NATO is saying, the U.S. is saying and the Ukrainians are saying they need those weapons to defend themselves against Russia. Just to give you an idea of how high this is on Vladimir Putin's agenda. He met last Friday with the mothers of Russian soldiers. And one of the things that he made a point of saying and he said that he believes Russia is not in a war with Ukraine but is in a war with those who are supplying and bank rolling Ukraine. Obviously, talking about organizations like NATO, talking about the West and also this is something that we see nearly every day on Russian state TV where they come out and say that they believe this is a wider conflict between Russia and the West and of course NATO is that big lightning rod organization. And once again, some of the things that the NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said today certainly are going to be reflected in Russian state media and the Kremlin is not going to like having heard that either.",

Elon Musk says Apple is threatening to withhold Twitter from its app store. That move could be devastating for Twitter -- which Musk just purchased for $44 billion. In a tweet Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter in a reference apparently aimed at Apple CEO Tim Cook. He asked whether Apple hates free speech in America. Bad blood between Musk and Cook isn't new. Musk says that when Tesla was struggling, he considered selling his electric car company to Apple. But Musk says that Cook wouldn't take a meeting with him. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment on those tweets.
