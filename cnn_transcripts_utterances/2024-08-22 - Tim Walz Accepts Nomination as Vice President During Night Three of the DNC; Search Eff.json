In fact, in a statement from the prime minister's office, he refers to the Indian community in Poland as vibrant. This is very much a ceremonial visit in addition to some of these political meetings that he will be taking place. But he's also spending time with the Indian community in Poland. And he gave some remarks today talking about some of these bigger issues facing the region, saying that he is stressing this idea of diplomacy and dialogue, adding that India in particular has been an advocate of permanent peace in this region. So very much a message of trying to create some kind of political stability because, you know, Poland, while on its own, also does share a border with Ukraine. So this is very much an issue facing Poland as well as the whole of Europe and the prime minister's presence in Poland and then going on to Ukraine.

The White House says U.S. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on the phone Wednesday on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region. Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the call. Now, a key sticking point in the negotiations is the Philadelphia corridor along the Gaza-Egypt border, which Israeli forces seized in May. An Israeli strike on a house in northern Gaza killed 12 people, including six children, among them 16-month-old twins. That's according to the director of the hospital. The Israeli military says they're looking into the incident. Meanwhile, Gaza officials say two people were killed and 15 wounded, 10 of them children, in an Israeli airstrike on a school in central Gaza on Wednesday. The IDF claims Hamas was using the school as a command center but didn't provide any evidence. Thousands of people are fleeing southern Gaza after Israel's military ordered new evacuations. A CNN analysis shows that in the past month, the IDF has reduced the humanitarian zone in Gaza by 38 percent. And it's now only about 10 percent of the enclave's total area. That has left many Palestinians with nowhere to go. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (through translator): That is so scary. We are defenseless people. Why are they fighting us? We are not Hamas.
