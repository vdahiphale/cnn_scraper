A lot of these people have been in the battleground states throughout the weekend, and in the last couple of days, they are seeing a momentum shift on the ground. They believe that something has changed in their favor.So a lot of the people that I'm speaking with, they are feeling good coming into tonight. One person, though, who doesn't really want to talk about winning is the candidate herself, Vice President Kamala Harris, is almost superstitious about not wanting to have that kind of conversation. She has been head down all day today on the phones, doing phone interviews with radio stations. She just went to the DNC here in Washington a few minutes ago to call voters and ask them to get out and vote. She has been working on getting out the vote. One person who spoke with her recently said she is not one to even get close to measuring the drapes. She wants to make sure every single vote is counted before her mind goes to that place. And right now, the Harris team, they are in work mode. They still believe they have a lot of work to do to keep their voters coming out to the polls, as we get into these evening hours, Jake.",

This is a team that has been poring over these numbers all day, much like the Harris campaign has as well.For Donald Trump himself, he didn't arrive back here in Palm Beach, Florida, until about 5:30 this morning. That came after he held that late night rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he always closes out his presidential campaigns. He hasn't gotten much sleep based on what I've heard from sources who say that he has been peppering his aides all day long asking for updates on this race and where the polling stands right now, and how the voting has been looking today. I am told one thing that they have zeroed in on is that number of early voting where Republicans have done very well, obviously a change from just a few years ago when Donald Trump was incredibly critical of early voting. Those numbers have given them a newfound confidence in the last 24 hours or so, Jake, and that is the number that Trump campaign aides are giving to surrogates in order to try to boost them and excite them going into this. Now, whether or not that confidence is warranted, Jake, remains to be seen. And I should note, I am at the Trump campaign convention center, where this is -- they are going to be having their party here tonight Trump himself will be watching the returns come in from his Mar-a-Lago club just a few moments away. There are 700, several hundred guests that are invited there and those that we are expected to be around him are names like Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Dana White, newfound allies of his that have obviously been out on the campaign trail with him as well, Jake.",

I think we should prepare the American people to think, I don't know, it'll go to Saturday like 2020 did, but we should be prepared for an election that were not certain of the winner tonight. However, because several states do promise to count faster, we're going to get some significant clues. This is the 2024 map. Votes will fill in pretty soon, right?So let's go back to the 2020 map to answer your question. As you noted, we're going to get Georgia results first of the -- of the battleground states, right? And so, what are we going to look for right away, right? Number one, how fast are the returns. Number two, how is the vice president of United States doing in the bedrock of any Democratic victory? That's Fulton County. That's the African American vote, and the close in suburbs of Atlanta, absolutely key. It was key to Joe Biden's win. You see, he got 73 percent in Atlanta, and the surrounding suburbs. It would be key for the vice president. Then for me, the biggest test here is, can Donald Trump perform in the suburbs at his 2016 levels? Watch. He's losing here in Cobb County, but with 47 percent in 2016. In 2020, he drops to 42 percent. It was Donald Trump's suburban struggles that cost him the election in 2020. So we will get some early clues in Georgia, Jake, as you come back to the 2020 map here, and then well come up to 24 right in here, about half of the vote in the state of Georgia is going to come right in here in the metropolitan Atlanta area. Yes, Donald Trump will run it up in the rural red areas. We will want to look there to see if turnout is as high as it was in 2016. And it was even higher in 2020. So, we'll get some seeds of the Trump base. But if the Trump base is turning out and the Harris base is turning out, this is a race that will be settled, Jake, once again in the American suburbs. Donald Trump won the suburbs in 2016. He collapsed in the suburbs in 2020.",

So that's less than the overall number in 2020, when we were still in the middle of a pandemic.But this number accounts for roughly 53 percent of everyone who voted in the 2020 election. And there's a clear gender gap in pre-election voter. Though I should note it is narrower than it was at this point. Four years ago. Look at this here on your screen, 1.4 million more women than men have cast pre-election ballots this year. That's actually a slight drop from the 1.8 million more women than men casting votes early in 2020. And that's partially because fewer people overall have voted early than four years ago. But even with that drop, Erin, female voters are voting at a higher rate than men in all seven of the battleground states we're watching. Look at this right here. The orange bars are female voters, and the green bars are male voters. You can see here in these key states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- female voters are outpacing male voters across the board. Erin, former President Trump, he has been reaching out to male voters in his final push.

Why these seven?Nevada is a lot different from Pennsylvania. Wisconsin is a lot different from Arizona. Why are these the seven battleground states? What makes them so unique that they're generally toss ups all the time? It is because of the greatest dividing line today in American politics, and that is education. If you look at this, see the dotted line across the top? That is the national average for the percentage of a population nationally that has a college degree. Massachusetts and Vermont, two of the blue states that are significantly above that, the percentage of the people who have college degrees, they vote blue reliably. West Virginia and Arkansas, among the states that are a good deal below the national average for voters with a college degree, they vote red. What makes the battlegrounds unique? Look at them with the exception of Nevada, which is below a little bit below, they hug the average. That's why they're battlegrounds. You have a equal percentage of people with college degrees without college degrees, so that is what unites them. Even though geographically they are far apart. Now, this is how it plays out when you look at them this way. This can also play out within the states. Come on over here and I'll show you what I'm talking about here. Let's just take Pennsylvania as an example. Pennsylvania, as you know, Jake, your home commonwealth, one of the most complicated states on the map. So what happens down here? Let's look at Montgomery County. Used to be when I started doing this, a Republican suburb. Now, it is a strongly Democratic suburb. Look at Joe Biden, 63 percent of the vote there. Well, let's take a look at education in Montgomery County. Look at the percentage, nearly 60 percent, well above the national average in Montgomery county. Have a college degree. That's why it's the clearest dividing line that's going to vote Democratic. That's Montgomery County. Then pull out and just pick randomly pick a county. Donald Trump does very well out in these rural counties. So you pick up here, Tioga County, he gets 75 percent of the vote there, right? So let's take a look and just do the comparison. Bring this back out, pop that up and look well below, right? Almost half, right, in Montgomery County it was nearly 60 percent, here is 31 percent with a college degree. So education the greatest dividing line in American politics right now. And it is -- it is the one common factor, Jake, that makes the battleground so competitive.",

John King, should we all be bracing for the kind of protracted vote count that we had in 2020, which really lasted until Saturday? Should we be preparing for that or not?",

They don't think it's going to be as long as 2020, but they do think it could take a while, especially if it's very close to some of the battleground states.One thing we do have to be prepared for is for the map early on in the night perhaps not to look like the map is going to end, either later in this night, or as we get a day or two down the road and we get final results. Why do I say that? Remember 2020. Some states count votes one way, other states count votes another way, meaning some states count Election Day ballots first. They tend to favor Republicans some states count mail in ballots first, early ballots first. They tend to favor Democrats. We do not expect the difference to be as lopsided as it was in 2020, when the mail in ballots, the early ballots disproportionately favored the Democrats but remember 2020, this is how the map ended up. And how it ends up is what matters most, how it ends, not how it begins. It ended this way with Joe Biden's big victory. But let's just go back in time to remind you this is 9:00 at night on Tuesday night in 2020. You look right here, right? So Michigan is red, Texas is blue, Mississippi is blue, Missouri is blue, right? Pennsylvania in this scenario is still blue. Ohio is blue, right? That's an unusual map. That's because some states were counting mail ballots first, disproportionately Democrat. Some days were counting Election Day ballots first, disproportionately Republican. Now, let's just go through what happened as we went through the night. This is midnight. You see, Texas went back to being Texas. It's a red state. Missouri went back to being Missouri. It's a red state, as they continued to count the votes right. You still see Ohio goes back there. Then we get to 12:00 noon on Wednesday, the next day. What has happened? Michigan has gone blue. These have gone back to themselves. Keep an eye, Pennsylvania is red here. But it's only noon on Wednesday. We continue to count the votes. By noon on Friday, Pennsylvania is blue. Michigan is blue. And I just want to take this off at this point the map is filled in pretty much where it ended. This is noon on Friday and then of course, it was Saturday morning just before noon. Results came in in Philadelphia. We're able to project Joe Biden as the winner. So is it going to be as confusing as that? You know, some people call that a mirage. It's not a mirage. Those votes are real. Joe Biden was leading in Texas. Joe Biden was leading in Missouri. It just wasn't the full pie. It was a piece of the pie. So we'll have that again tonight. Some states count in different ways because the states decide how to administer their elections. So the word of the night, just as it was in 2020, is let's be cautious. What you see at the beginning might not be what you get at the end.",
