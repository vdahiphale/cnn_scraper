      "sentences": "Today we are following former President Trump in Michigan and Vice President Harris in Pennsylvania. Two of three states that strategists say are the most consistent tipping point in American politics. The third being Wisconsin.And in a new CNN.com piece, Ron Brownstein lays out why these states are so similar and how they can almost be viewed as one state. My pow- wee or my paw-wee, I mean, however really you want to say it. You could see they'd be connected here maybe by ferry, I don't know. But historically, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, they just vote together. Over the last 100 years, they've chosen the same candidate in 17 of 26 elections. And that includes the last eight presidential elections. As you can see, Trump won the trio once in 2016, President Biden in 2020. And here, roughly 50 days out from the 2024 election, polling from each state consistently finds the candidates in a statistical tie. Strategists in both parties consider Wisconsin Harris's best bet, and Michigan, a typical stronghold for Democrats, a closer call. Let's zoom in on the state. You'll recall that in Michigan's primaries back in February, 13 percent of Democrats cast an uncommitted vote protesting Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza. Of course, Biden is no longer top of the ticket. But, and Harris hopes that fact, paired with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, is going to be the thing that gives her the edge. Democrats have seen a surge in support in Michigan's white-collar suburbs. That is certainly of note. Case in point, and this is what they're looking at, the 2022 gubernatorial election. Nearly 70 percent of white college-educated women voted for Governor Gretchen Whitmer -- Boris.",

Let's discuss with Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, a state that could be critical in this election. Senator, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. We've heard warnings from fellow Democrats to the vice president that winning Michigan specifically is going to be a challenge. Do you think her campaign is doing enough to win your state? Do you share some of those concerns?SEN. DEBBIE STABENOW (D-MI): Boris, first of all, it's great to be with you, and secondly, I think they are working very hard and really doing everything right. Last week we had Tim Walz in for two days in Michigan. On Thursday night there's going to be an amazing virtual event done with Oprah Winfrey and Kamala Harris that will be based in Michigan, in Oakland County, Michigan, where everybody's talking about the suburbs and women who care about reproductive freedom. And so we know it's a race. We have 52 offices open, and we have volunteers and efforts going on that really rival anything I've ever seen, and I've been involved in a lot of different campaigns. But I would say this is one where the energy and momentum is definitely on the side of the Harris-Walz campaign.",

The vice president was just asked about that at NABJ. She seemed to not outline any significant policy differences from President Biden in supporting Israel and its conduct in this war.Do you believe that those voters are now throwing their support behind Harris, that 13 percent uncommitted?",

And what we do is we are celebrating those who want to have a family, want to start a family. That's what this is about. And it's about who decides that. You know, Donald Trump tries to make this an issue of federal versus state.Well, we want to turn it back to the states. Well, you know what? We want to turn it back to the woman. This is not about which level of politician is making your decisions on your health care. This is about women, about the pregnant person making the decision on their health care. And that's what they miss. And I can tell you, in a state like Michigan, where we've put the protection of reproductive freedom into our Constitution back a few years ago, back in 2022, and had the highest voter turnout at any time in a non-presidential election, people of Michigan are watching and waiting. And they are extremely, extremely angry about what Donald Trump put in motion when he put in place those Supreme Court justices to repeal Roe v. Wade. And now everything that goes with it, whether it's IVF or your choice on birth control or in Project 2025, the whole question of are they going to follow you around and monitor your pregnancies? This whole thing is horrible. And women know it.",

And why this case is a bit different than others that we've seen where bail is granted is all of this information that's coming out about his obstructionist behavior. So prosecutors are laying out that after he became aware of lawsuits, after he became aware of this very criminal investigation, he was actually reaching out to witnesses and victims.That's going to be really compelling to the judge. In addition, the Cassie video that was just referenced, the argument is that he is willing to use force and intimidation in order to obstruct these witnesses. So all of that is going into the determination. Now the defense on the flip side, they're saying he presented himself willfully. He's going to be monitored. He's going to stay in a location and you're going to be aware of where he is. And there's no reason to think that he's a flight risk alternatives passport. Judge is about to make a decision, but I think this one might lean in favor of the prosecution.",

He had come out and he had said, none of what Cassie has alleged is true.Then this video becomes public. Now he's apologizing and saying, I was a different person then. And, you know, I'm sorry for what I had done. That's all leading to, can we take his word for it? Can we take his word at this moment where we're deciding whether or not he is a danger to witnesses and a flight risk that he is going to appear at the next court appearance. He's not going to use his massive amount of money and connections to leave the country and that he's not going to use that influence that he has on many people, which is the root of this indictment in order to intimidate witnesses and potentially victims moving forward.

It doesn't necessarily mean that in the indictment there has to be every single piece of information and factual aversion that the prosecutors might bring into the courtroom when the case ultimately goes to trial.There's strategic reasons to do so. Oftentimes it relates to protecting potential victims and witnesses. We also know from the prosecutor's press conference today, this might not be over. We're talking about a criminal enterprise and it's the Combs enterprise, according to prosecutors. That means there could be others who could face indictment or who are cooperating witnesses. Also, prosecutors made an overture for anyone who was a victim to step forward and to speak about their experience with the prosecution. So there's just more to the story. This was enough to get probable cause and strategically certain information was not provided.",

But these senior officials tell me that they first want to have some degree of confidence that Hamas ultimately would get to a yes on such an agreement. And importantly, they currently do not believe that they're interested in getting to a deal. So needless to say, there's a lot of finger pointing going on at Hamas, including this allegation that they recently changed the terms of the agreement related to the kinds of prisoners that would be released in exchange for the hostages that Hamas is holding. There is also, of course, the important factor of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and whether he himself is interested in a deal. As you mentioned, the vice president again reiterating that the war needs to end.
