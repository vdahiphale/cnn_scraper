And breaking news, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will be interviewed by CNN on Thursday. It comes as Donald Trump says he agrees to the terms with Harris for a head- to-head debate. An incredible rescue, a 52-year-old Israeli hostage taken by Hamas, found alive in a tunnel in Gaza by the IDF. He's now reunited with family. Meta feeling the pressure. Mark Zuckerberg says he was wrong to cave into government demands to crack down on COVID misinformation. And suiting up for space. Nokia and NASA coming together to put cell phones into orbit and on the moon. That conversation coming up. But first, the special counsel prosecuting Donald Trump has filed a reworked indictment in the federal election subversion case. Jack Smith slimmed down the allegations against the Republican nominee. It comes after the Supreme Court ruling that gave broad immunity to presidents. Prosecutors have not dropped any of the four charges that were initially brought against Trump. Our Katelyn Polantz is following the developments and joins us now from Washington. Good to have you with us, Katelyn. So, this is a new indictment against Trump, but essentially, the charges are the same as the old indictment, but Jack Smith, the special counsel, has refined the allegations.",

So, what the special counsel and the Justice Department did was they wentback to the grand jury in Washington, D.C. and they presented a newly written version of this indictment against Donald Trump. It's shorter and it cuts out things where Donald Trump was speaking in the Oval Office or in the Rose Garden, where he was getting briefings from federal officials and intelligence agents because he was the president. And it cuts out the pieces where he was directing an official at the Justice Department and trying to put pressure on the Justice Department to give his election fraud claims more air. So, all of that is removed from the case now. And this new set of charges instead frames up what the next couple of proceedings and months are going to be in federal court in Washington in this case. It makes clear the Justice Department wants to take this to trial. They want to do it in this way, and they want to keep Mike Pence too in this case, the vice president who they say, in the way that this is rewritten, was acting as the president of the Senate, so part of Congress rather than the vice president to Donald Trump as an executive branch official. So, they're trying to create some distance there to keep that part of the case alive. But it is a significant action to come and it really does put us right in the thick of trial proceedings or pretrial proceedings in this case against Donald Trump in Washington D.C. just two months the election.",

Thank you.Well, CNN has announced that it will air an exclusive interview with Kamala Harris on Thursday. This is her first since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, will also take part, and it will be part of their first interview together as a ticket. Well, Harris has faced criticism for not sitting down for a formal interview or news conference since President Biden bowed out of the race for the White House back in July. Well, meantime, Donald Trump says he has reached an agreement to take part in a TV debate with Harris, which is set to happen September the 10th on the ABC. Well, for more on these developments and joined by Eva MckEnd in Washington. Good to see you, Eva. So, just a few hours ago, the headline was how long will Harris wait until she sits down for an interview with the press? Well, now, we know the answer and it's going to happen quite soon, really. EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, in just two days, on Thursday, during her bus tour in Georgia, she's making stops in Savannah and some of the surrounding areas. And during that time, she and her running mate, Governor Walz, will sit with our colleague Dana Bash to answer some in-depth questions for the first time. During the Democratic National Convention, she sat with social media influencers, really, and understanding that she also needs to speak to young voters as well. But, you know, that is not the same, Lynda, as speaking to a journalist who is going to likely have aggressive questions about some of the policy reversals that we have seen from the vice president. So, on this vitally important issue of fracking and its implications in the swing State of Pennsylvania. At one point, she wanted to ban fracking. That is no longer her position. She has to explain that on immigration. She, at one point, even writing in her memoir very affectionately about immigrants and really concerned about the fate of undocumented immigrants during the Trump administration. She now advocates for a bipartisan border enforcement bill that does not include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. So, that is a pretty dramatic policy reversal as well. And now, for the first time, she'll be in a position where she has to answer these questions.",

The Trump campaign says that they agreed to those same conditions. Evidently, Trump's team thinks that's pretty good for him, for his mic to be muted. And that was, I think, done in part as to not throw President Biden off. But the Harris team, they want something entirely different. They don't want those mics to be muted. They want them to be live for the entire course of the debate because they don't think that the former president can kind of control himself. And so, they're hoping That he is disruptive in a way that is off-putting to voters. Now, Trump today saying that the matter has been settled, that the mutes -- the mics will, in fact, be muted when the respective candidate is not supposed to be speaking.

In the past, it has always been above ground operations that have resulted in so far eight hostages being rescued from Gaza by Israeli forces. And without a doubt, at the end of the day, this is mostly a moment of celebration for his family after 326 days of captivity. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (voice-over):  Israeli hostage Farhan Al-Qadi is taking his first steps of freedom. After 326 days of captivity, an Israeli military helicopter has landed in Gaza to take him to Israel, back to his family. Moments earlier, Al-Qadi was rescued by Israeli special forces who were combing through a network of tunnels in Southern Gaza. READ ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON:  We cannot go into many details of this special operation, but I can share that Israeli commandos rescued Qaid Farhan Al-Qadi from an underground tunnel, following accurate intelligence. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Al-Qadi is the first Israeli hostage to be rescued by Israeli forces operating in those tunnels. The seven others who have been rescued were being held above ground. An Israeli military officials said the forces found Al-Qadi alone without his captors. At Soroka Medical Center, each step brings these men that much closer to the brother they feared might never return alive. They're running toward the whir of a helicopter delivering their 52-year-old brother back into their arms. Al-Qadi has visibly lost weight. But doctors say he is in good medical condition. His family is overjoyed. It is a joy that cannot be explained, his brother Hatem says, more than the joy you get from a newborn baby. This is a man who has been resurrected. Al-Qadi, a member of Israel's minority Bedouin community, now on the phone with the Israeli prime minister, thanking him for getting him home and reminding him that other hostages are still waiting. The Israeli prime minister currently engaged in ceasefire negotiations tells him he is committed to returning everyone without exception. (END VIDEOTAPE) DIAMOND (on camera):  And, Lynda, there's no question that the clock is still -- is very much ticking for the remaining 104 hostages who have been captive since October 7th. Of those, at least 30 are confirmed dead by the Israeli government. And what is also clear is that those hostages will likely not emerge from Gaza as the result of Israeli military operations, instead, it will be a deal, a hostage deal, a ceasefire deal, the one that is currently being negotiated in Cairo and in Doha that will ultimately lead to the release of most hostages if they can get there.

Well, call it a case of meddling with Meta, the company which ownsFacebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Threads. In a letter to Congress, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that the Biden White House pressured his social media firm to censor content during the COVID crisis. The White House says it did it to help save lives, but Zuckerberg says the administration's demands were wrong. Zuckerberg also says he should not have suppressed the politically charged story of Hunter Biden's laptop during the 2020 election when Donald Trump was president. Well, Clare Duffy joins me now for more on this. Of course, when it comes to COVID, Clare, it wasn't just the Biden administration there were plenty of doctors trying to curtail the spread of misinformation.

In many ways, this plays directly into this narrative that Republican lawmakers have been spreadingthat big tech companies censor the viewpoints of conservatives. There's not a ton of evidence of that, but a lot of what, you know, Zuckerberg is saying in this letter sort of does play into that narrative, and you already see Republican lawmakers celebrating this, saying that it's proof that the Biden-Harris administration tried to censor conservative voices and pressure big tech companies. I don't think that that's exactly what this letter is saying, but it potentially could be really beneficial to them heading into this election period. I think, certainly, what Zuckerberg is trying to do here is kind of hedge his bets and avoid any perception of bias, especially heading into the election if the company ends up having to make some tough content moderation decisions about political misinformation, he doesn't want any allegations that was done at the behest of the Biden White House.

Well, the Mexican government is now pausing relations with the U.S. and Canadian embassies in the country after the ambassadors criticized a proposed judicial reform. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is pushing to elect judges by popular vote. The U.S. ambassador called that reform a major risk to democracy that could also harm U.S.-Mexico trade relations. The Mexican president says the freeze in ties is with the embassies and not with the countries. Well, Gustavo Valdes is following the developments joining us now live. Good to have you with us.

They both have said that they don't think the proposed reforms will be good for democracy in this North American zone. They fear that because these new judges only need to be -- have a law degree, there would be no vetting. They could just run for the post. It could be a problem for democracy. And even, they think, that somebody from the cartels could run for office and, you know, win the position. And that would be also a problem for Mexico, for the region. Also, these judges, eventually at some point, might have to rule on trade issues between these three trading partners. So, that is the concern from the ambassadors. Again, this is just the ambassadors. Although, today the State Department put out a statement saying that they respect the changes. They think that some reforms might be good, but the judicial reform of electing judges might not be the best. It was the same reaction from the Foreign Relations Committee in the U.S. Senate. The president this morning, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said that until these ambassadors don't respect Mexico's independence and sovereignty, there will be no communication. Lopez Obrador has about a month left in office. His successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, today said that she supports the position of the president, but we have to see what happens after he leaves office.",

And this is applied to the sovereignty of every nation. So, they're very touchy when a foreign nation, especially the United States, tries to mingle in a local politics. So, it's a little bit of mixed bag, criticizing the reform for what it is, but also not liking that the United States might be trying to impose or give an opinion on the process. Now, President Lopez Obrador, who is one of the champions of this phrase, and he has used it repeatedly over his six years as president, he has also, in occasions, especially when it comes to immigration policy or some policies from Republicans in the United States, criticize what happens north of his border.

Now, this comes one day after what Ukrainian officials are calling the largest air assault by Russia start of the war. Monday's onslaught killed at least seven people. And here you can see the multiple Ukrainian regions that were attacked. Sudan's state-run news agency says more than 130 people have died after the country was hit with heavy rains and flash flooding.

And that was after incredible, incredible work by the U.S. administration, President Biden, Vice President Harris, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Blinken. I mean, everybody has been working on this. You look at CIA Director Bill Burns. I mean, I could keep going on. The Americans have leaned in. The Americans have proven to be Israel's greatest ally, friend, supporter, and they have been instrumental in making sure these talks continue. And then you have the side of the mediators, the Qataris and the Egyptians. So, there's all these people. And by the way, think about it. You have the G7 that all wants this deal and all stood for this deal and then you have the U.N. Security Council that voted for this deal. And so, here we are at this moment, which is like this is a deal that Prime Minister Netanyahu and Mr. Sinwar are being pushed to do, and we saw that it worked for 105 and now, we have 110. And it is the time, we are at that time. We don't have other time. This is that moment. And, you know, it's a moment of bravery and boldness. And, you know, you talked about that six hostages had been rescued. In those rescues, remember, so -- one member of the IDF was killed in that. And if you think about it last week -- in the last week, six hostage bodies have been brought back. They were bullet written. People are dying. The rate of getting people back with a hostage with going in and trying to get them via, you know, the army has not brought back 110 people. It has brought back six. And now, there is Mr. Al-Qadi who got out today. And so, it's just not -- it's not a feasible way to get out hostages. And the way to get out hostages is to do the diplomatic route, and I know that this is the number one focus at this moment, because here we are at this point where they're negotiating in Cairo of President Biden and his team, they're there, they're with the teams from the Israeli side, the Egyptians, the Qataris, and I believe representatives of Hamas. This is that moment where we need political courage and we need political will. And that is what will bring home 110 hostages. But to keep going and hoping that the army can go in and get these people -- and keep in mind, this was the first hostage that was taken out of a tunnel. The rest were above ground. We believe most of the 110 are under and they are deep under and they are guarded. So, this idea that we can keep going with the military and that will bring out 110 people, six, seven people have been brought out in 10 months.",

So,the cellular equipment being built by Nokia will be installed into the spacesuit that Axiom is building and that will communicate with a network in a box equipment built by Nokia that we anticipate to be in the human landing system. And again, this will provide expanded capabilities for communications. And I just wanted to remind everybody that, you know, astronauts need air, they need water they need food. But really, if you're going to the moon, whether it's robotic or with humans, you need power, you need communications, you need navigation. So, this is critical technology, and we're looking forward to the demonstration.",

So, it's really, Lynda, at the core, it's the same network technology that you and I use every day and that's deployed on terrestrialnetworks in consumer networks, enterprise networks. So, we're taking that same technology and then, we're building a very compact, highly integrated network in a box that we integrate on the human landing system and that's really optimized for the space environment, from a size, weight, power perspective, as well as the harsh environments of the moon. And then, we have essentially the equivalent of your smartphone, but it doesn't look like a smartphone. It's really a device module that we integrate into the Axiom space suit that will be connected to the helmet mounted cameras that the astronauts have, telemetry data on the suit as well, as the voice communication system, and it will establish a wireless link between the astronaut's suit and the human landing system. And ultimately, all of that information will be sent back to Earth for mission controllers.",

We're expecting to see beautiful images from the moon, things that we didn't have the last time we were there 50 years ago. I think it will excite the public.

She jumped out of a small plane on Sunday to skydive over Suffolk, England, becoming the U.K.'s oldest ever skydiver. Bailey is a veteran who served in the Women's Royal Navy Service during World War II. And this grandmother's jump raised money for a local veteran's charity. Of course, she is no stranger to amazing feats. On her 100th birthday, she drove a Ferrari around Silverstone Race track. Happy birthday, what a way to celebrate. That's incredible. Well, next, from wonder wall to wonderful news. If you're a fan of the 1990s rock, that is, Britpop icons, Oasis have announced they are going to get back together. That next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Oasis will tour the U.K. and Ireland next year. The group announced it on Tuesday, and industry insiders expect tickets to sell out within minutes as fans clamor to hear hits like \"Supersonic\" live. Oasis shot to fame in the 1990s as part of the so-called Britpop era. The band's debut album, \"Definitely Maybe,\" released 30 years ago this week, was the start of a journey that saw Oasis become one of the biggest bands in British history. (MUSIC PLAYING) A second record, \"What's the Story, Morning Glory,\" was the U.K.'s bestselling album of the decade, featuring anthems like \"Wonderwall\" and \"Don't Look Back in Anger.\" But the Gallagher brothers became just as famous for their wild lifestyles and public arguments as their music. After years of making the front pages for their bust ups, Noel Gallagher walked out of the group in 2009 in Paris, saying he simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer. Two years later, Liam left fans in no doubt that he felt the same way.",
