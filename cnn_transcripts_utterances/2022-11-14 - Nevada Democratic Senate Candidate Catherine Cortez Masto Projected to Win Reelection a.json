These are the uncalled races right now.Let me show you where the uncalled races are. The ones that have colors on them are uncalled. There are 19. Republicans lead in 10, Democrats lead in nine. If Democrats want to maintain control of the House, they have to flip five of these red seats to blue. I'll just write this number here. Five of these red districts would have to be blue. And right now it's between California and Arizona, and Arizona is making Democrats' job very difficult, daunting, maybe next to impossible at this point. What happened overnight. There were new votes released here in Arizona's sixth county, and this looks close. It is close, but Juan Ciscomani expanded his lead ever so much against Kirsten Engel and 93 percent reporting. The one that may be the dagger for Democrats is here, Arizona's first congressional district where you see now David Schweikert 894 votes ahead. Going into the weekend it was the Democrat, Jevin Hodge, who Washington actually ahead by some 4,000 votes. But there have been vote releases in Maricopa County which have now given the Republican the edge there, which brings it to where it is right now.

If Kari Lake, the Republican, was able to win 57 percent, let's call it 58 percent, if she was able to win 58 percent, question mark, she would net, and I have this written down here, she would net 27,200 votes, OK, 27,200, which is more than 26,000. So her target is 58 percent.The problem, Don, for her -- let me swipe this out -- is that the votes have been released over the last day in Maricopa County here, she got 55 percent, Kari Lake did. And in Pima County, we'll go down here, Pima County, she actually only got 40 percent, Kari Lake did. This is a Democratic plus-18 county. Kari Lake got 40 percent there. There's some 40,000 votes left to count in Pima County here. I kept this up.

It used to cost people six, seven hundred dollars. Average families, working families who had -- who were older and had diabetes, what am I going to do when it becomes six, seven hundred dollars?
