And we start today with this momentous event in our politics lead, a historic and unprecedented indictment of a former President Donald Trump. Mr. Trump landed at LaGuardia Airport, just a short while ago. The former president expected to arrive soon at Trump Tower. He is expected to spend the night there, ahead of his arraignment tomorrow afternoon at the Manhattan criminal courthouse, where Mr. Trump is expected to voluntarily surrender. Sources tell CNN that the former president faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud that we should note the indictment remains under seal. These charges come after a years-long probe into a hush money payment made to adult film star and director Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 presidential election, and let's -- we're looking. Let's start with CNN's Kaitlan Collins right now. She's outside Trump Tower. And, Kaitlan, it's odd watching this kind of -- for want of a better term -- like O.J. Bronco coverage of Donald Trump coming into Manhattan for this criminal matter, and I know that media critics are taking issue with the way that that a lot of news networks are covering this, but I have to say, you know, as we watch Donald Trump's limo drive on the FDR, this is unprecedented. We've never seen anything like this in the history of this country.",

They have been choreographing it, Jake, talking about what are his facial expressions going to look like? What is his body language going to look like as he's arriving here? Because they have considered even potentially using some of this footage and their own campaign materials going forward.But the reality behind the scenes is the former president does not want to be indicted. He does not want to have to go before a judge tomorrow and one of the most personally sensitive cases that he has faced and one that has, of course, followed him and loomed over not only his campaign for president there at the end, but also his time in the White House, Jake. And so, certainly that has been an aspect of all of this. And there's a lot of unknowns for you and for Trump's team, and they said this yesterday they still did not know what is it that indictment? They don't know exactly what it's going to look like. One of his attorneys said he wanted to make tomorrow is painless and classy as possible . Of course, all that remains to be seen how the former president himself is going to be speaking out about this. We've already seen him attacking the judge, criticizing the district attorney in this matter. And they have said they do not believe this case has legal merits. That remains to be seen with the judge does tomorrow, and if it does go to trial, what jury would say about it all, Jake.",

You know when President Trump used to come to New York, and the intelligence bureau that I ran with the Secret Service and Chief Tom Galati, would set up a motorcade. It would be multiple motorcycles, a phalanx of motorcycles, multiple highway patrol cars, frozen routes. The entire route would be blocked before the president's motorcade hit the road.What you see here is something very different. There's a highway patrol car in the lead and a highway patrol car in the tail, the rest of those vehicles are Secret Service and staff. As you can see, traffic in the direction they're going is very light because they've got blocker cars behind them slowing down that traffic there, but you see traffic going the other way. So, there's a little less pomp and a little less circumstance being a former president, and that's just coincidental to the fact that he's a future defendant, meaning in a few moments, he's going to end up in -- a in a -- in a -- huddle with his lawyers to figure out the next day when he reports to a courthouse to be charged with a felony and a crime.",

We know this because he left his legal firm to go and represent Trump. He is reported to be a top attorney, formidable. He has a stellar reputation among other attorneys that you've spoken with, but it's notable because the attorney you've been here and talk about this on television has been Joe Tacopina. As of yesterday, he was the one on television. But there has been some infighting in the legal team and even another Trump attorney because he does have several of them right now, given the number of investigations facing him, Tim Parlatore was on CNN with me on Friday. And when I asked pretty straightforward question whether Tacopina was the right attorney to take this case to trial, he hedged a bit and noted, of course, Susan Necheles, the other attorney who is on this case, but now they've added Todd Blanche to that legal team. We are told Joe Tacopina does still remain on the team, and will be there tomorrow. But I do think it does give you an indication, Jake, that they are taking this case seriously, at least from a legal perspective, often the legal strategy and the political strategy are conflated here. So those are the people that are already here on the ground that Trump will be meeting with when he gets here, they're going to be preparing him for that very quick appearance in court tomorrow. His political team focuses on this aspect of it as he is making his way through New York.",

It's certainly not these massive languages. What some Trump advisers are worried about what he was calling on his supporters to come to protest. They were worried about it'd be something that resembled January 6th or something like that, playing out on the streets of New York. It is certainly not that here. There's almost more members of the media here than there are Trump supporters and protesters across the street by Trump Tower where he's pulling up any moment now. And, Jake, you're right, when it comes to what they're going to find out tomorrow, when it comes to this indictment. They have been straightforward that they don't know exactly what it is.

And then tomorrow, of course, he will be arraigned in Lower Manhattan at the courthouse there, in front of acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan.You see that the streets have been relatively cleared of spectators and some of the parts of this block. And, Kaitlan Collins, the lawyers for Donald Trump had been criticizing what they think is going to be in the indictment and one of the things they've been saying one of the criticisms is that even if one considered these campaign finance laws, law violations crimes, they all happened in 2016. And they argue that that that's so long ago, the statute of limitations would have given out. The complication with that is that New York law has it so that if you leave the state -- here is -- we're expecting the president's -- the former president to get out of the state. Get out of the limo in a second, and there he is. Well, that was not the camera view that his fans or his detractors were hoping for or anybody just trying to tell this story. It was a helicopter shot of the former president, the 45th president, walking into Trump Tower. In any case, Kaitlan, what I was saying was New York law has it so that if you're out of state for any duration, it's almost as if a pause button is hit on the statute of limitations running out. And since Donald Trump spent four years in Washington and has lived his post presidential life in Florida, according to New York law, it has not given out. But that is the argument that Trump's attorneys will try to make in court when they moved to have the charges just dismissed outright, Kaitlan.",

First, I would expect challenges on the statute of limitations. Statute of limitations in New York for this type of felony would be five years. There's, of course, prosecutorial arguments once that continuing wrong doctrine that the fact that the president was -- that he was the president, and that during that time he had immunity, that he was in D.C.

Well, this is evidence that we understand is directly about Donald Trump, in the mishandling of documents investigation and the obstruction of justice investigation, these two serious things conducted out of the federal courthouse. And what we understand is that the evidence that they're trying to nail down at this point in this investigation, a whole year in after that FBI search is about how Trump was handling the records and what witnesses saw. Him doing or knew he was going to be doing things like they're gathering things like notes, text messages, emails, even photographs, specifically from people who would have been in and around the estate, not just Donald Trump's political advisors, but others who work there. We've heard about subpoenas to them. But what makes this a little bit different is that these subpoenas are pushing for information. They're pushing for it now, and they're getting information.",

Give them the final documentation or get their testimony locked into the grand jury in a way that the prosecutors hadn't done before. That to us signals that you know this really could be entering its final stage here and potentially even nearing a charging decision at some point in the future.",

But there truly was nothing hush-hush about the story before Michael Cohen made the payment on Trump's behalf.Daniels -- Stormy Daniels had been talking about the alleged affair for years prior to little national notice, including during a 2011 interview with \"In Touch\", a cover story right there, where she revealed what happened immediately after that rendezvous with Trump. Quote: Here's the weird thing. He had one of my DVDs, and he asked me to sign it for him. And I did, unquote. Weird is one word. Even that wasn't the first time Stormy Daniels told that story. With us now, conservative columnist Quin Hillyer. Quin, good to see you as always. Thanks for joining us. So interesting. Stormy Daniels first disclosed her alleged encounter with Donald Trump in 2009, as you wrote in your column, when she was doing a kind of like a fake run for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana.",

And David Vitter, the Republican incumbent, had had a sex scandal with a prostitute. So they said, let's find some sex workers to run against him just almost as a lark and somebody said Stormy Daniels is from Louisiana. Let's get her and lo and behold, she said she would do it.And they were sitting in a hotel lobby going through her phone, figuring who they could get some campaign donations from and very nonchalantly. She was naming porn executives and stuff like that. And then she said, oh, wait. Donald Trump. Yeah, I've got his number right here. At least I've got his top aides number, that expletive should give me some money. And it was very nonchalant and so Democratic operative said known about it since 2009. She went on two years later to give this long interview with \"In Touch\" magazine. So why did Donald Trump in 2016 pay her money to hush up something that was already very public and quite well known? It's crazy.",

I'm 10 years later than that adds to credibility and the fact that she was telling these Democratic operatives this in 2009, and there's an email train to prove it.That tends to bolster the credibility because she wasn't doing it to try to stop Trump from being president. This was seven years before he ran for president, and she was just nonchalantly mentioning this encounter and giving the exact same details that she is giving now. That's what I'm that that sort of contemporaneous verification that at least she -- she didn't do it for political reasons. She was she was just sort of talking, mentioning Trump in the midst of mentioning a lot of other rich people that she knew.",
