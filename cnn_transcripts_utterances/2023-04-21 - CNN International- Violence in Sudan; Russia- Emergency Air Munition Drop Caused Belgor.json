But will a new ceasefire change anything on the ground? Then Western allies are meeting at the Ramstein base in Germany to discuss further military support to Ukraine and the promise from the NATO Secretary General.Ukraine will eventually become a member of the alliance and chaos and confusion on Twitter. Thousands of well-known figures are no longer verified on the social media platform. In Sudan fierce clashes are taking place in neighborhoods in and around Khartoum, despite pledges of a new temporary peace. I live pictures here of the Sudanese Capital, where it's two o'clock in the afternoon. You can see smoke there very clearly in the distance the parliamentary group RSF announced a three day ceasefire to coincide with the Eid holiday. The army says it will comply but only if the RSF abides by the truce. The violent power struggles between both sides now in their seventh day, the World Health Organization says more than 400 people have been killed. And a doctor's union warns 70 percent of hospitals near conflict areas remain close. CNN's Larry Madowo joins me live in Nairobi. It doesn't look like there's a ceasefire there, but that's what they're saying.",

Earlier this morning, the paramilitary group rapid support forces said they would adhere to this 72 hour ceasefire that was proposed by the United Nations even though the African Union wanted a one week ceasefire.A short while ago, the military now saying we will abide to the ceasefire if the RSF abides to it. But all morning we've been hearing of some gunfire, some fighting still continuing. So it's still very confusing. This says if you're counting the fourth time, there's been an attempt as a ceasefire. This one should be taken a bit more seriously because it is the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. This is the end of the holy month of Ramadan, both of these generals who are involved in this power struggle confessed to be Muslims. And this should be a holy time for the country it should be times for people to at least reconnect with families get basic supplies. That does not seem to be the case. I want to show you a video sent to CNN by Sudanese Activist who says she had to flee Khartoum to go to a safe house. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He said it was fruitful. We don't know exactly what kinds of promises were made.The U.S. went into this meeting, saying there were three key issues air defense ammunition, and what they call enablers, which are things that sort of help the overall mission things like heavy duty trucks and stuff to transport equipment. The Ukrainian side went into it specifically asking for NATO standard fighter jet. So it would seem that there is some daylight but of course, they are very clear, rhetorically, certainly the NATO side that they are in this for the long haul that they stand with Ukraine, and going to continue to tailor their response to the situation on the battlefield. I think the other elephant in the room clearly at this meeting is the issue of those Pentagon leaks how that happened. The U.S. trying to smooth things over a little bit, with its allies.
