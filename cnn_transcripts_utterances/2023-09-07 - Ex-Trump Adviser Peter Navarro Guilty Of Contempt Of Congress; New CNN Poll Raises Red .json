Former Trump adviser Peter Navarro was found guilty of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena in the House investigation of the January 6th attack. Will it send a message to potential witnesses in the multiple criminal trials Trump is now facing?Also tonight, CNN's exclusive new poll is raising red flags for President Biden's re-election campaign as it's now being held. His approval rating sinks and Democrats' concerns about his age, his priorities, and his policies are on the rise. And a full week after a murderer's brazen escape from a Pennsylvania prison, police believe he's still in the area and may have been cited once again today. How has he been able to elude a massive manhunt for so long? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And let's get right to the breaking news. The second Trump senior ally convicted of contempt of Congress for stonewalling the January 6th select committee investigation. CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is joining us right now. He's got details on this important verdict. Evan?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Wolf. The jury deliberated just a few hours today before rendering this verdict guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress. Peter Navarro received a subpoena from the committee that was investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol.This subpoena was from 2022, and he declined to cooperate. He didn't show up for their request for testimony. He also declined to provide documents that the committee was requesting. And as a result, the Justice Department said that you can't do that. You can't just ignore a lawful subpoena from a Congressional committee, and that's the reason why they brought this case. Now, one of the things that Navarro was arguing was that the testimony and the documents that were in question were actually subject to executive privilege from the former president. Of course, the former president never actually asserted that in this case, Wolf, and that's one reason why the judge did not allow for Peter Navarro to actually present that as part of his argument, as part of his defense in court. Now, Navarro faces a lot of different issues. He also -- these same documents that he refused to turn over to the committee are also being sought by Jack Smith and the Justice Department as part of their efforts to get a hold of documents that he took after he left the White House. And so you can see he has a lot of legal problems on his hands. He addressed at reporters at the end of today's proceeding and spoke about his relationship with the former president.

As you now know, as all of us know, Peter Navarro, he now joins Steve Bannon in being convicted by a jury for refusing to cooperate with your committee. What's your reaction to this verdict? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, relief, frankly. It's a just verdict, and it's important. Mr. Navarro was the trade adviser, but his role in the Trump administration was far wider than that. He authored a so- called report that the president carried around undercutting the election. He was connected with Steve Bannon, talking about the green- based sweep. He and Bannon were in cahoots, and, of course, Bannon also refused to come in and testify. And I'm sure you'll recall Steve Bannon's presentation the day before January 6th, that this is going to be very different than you think. We had a lot of questions for Navarro and for Bannon they illegally refused to answer. And I'm glad that they're being held to account. It's about upholding the rule of law.",

That's the role of the Georgia state legislature, not Congress.Now, they attempted to do this. Congress attempted to do this in the context of the New York prosecution. And it was sort of the same questions there that they did not like the nature of the investigation and tried to open a Congressional investigation. I worked for Congress.

They've seen other surveys. But if we look at the economic conditions, this is something that the White House thinks will actually help him in the long-term, all of the legislation he's done, from the infrastructure bill, to the Inflation Reduction Act, to lowering prescription drugs. But still, how have Biden's policies affected U.S. economic conditions? 58 percent of Americans believe that they have worsened them. So, talking to White House advisers today, they believe that they have a messaging challenge of trying to tell Americans that the economic policies have actually benefited them, but that is the challenge here. If Americans don't feel it, it is hard to tell them that. But inflation numbers are still high. It's leveled off, no doubt, but exact prices are high. But when you look at the choice for president, this is a stark reminder, 47 percent for Donald Trump, 46 percent for Joe Biden. Of course, he has to get through a Republican primary contest. He has many, many challenges on his own. No clear leader here, of course. This is within the margin of error. But, Wolf, if this is a reminder, a deeply divided country, a pessimistic mood hanging over this. So, for all that the president has done to try and brand Republicans as MAGA and extremists, we are effectively where we left off the last time, a deeply divided electorate. Again, though, many challenges facing President Biden, and he is trying to -- President Biden is trying to make this a choice selection, certainly not a referendum on him.

But the problem, that concern about age is very real, and it's getting more deeply entrenched in voters' psyche. When you think about the question that was asked in the poll about whether Joe Biden is a candidate who has the sharpness and stamina to serve as president effectively, 74 percent of respondents in this poll say that Biden does not. And that's actually up seven points just since March, and that's up by more than 20 points since the last election cycle. So, that's going in the wrong direction for the administration.

I mean, if you can't win in Iowa, you're not going to win anywhere else. Donald Trump is going to dominate in Iowa. It's going to be Trump versus Biden part two. There are a couple of things about this poll, though, I want to point out. There are a couple of just simple facts. This is Joe Biden's floor. In the poll you see, in many polls you see, you see kind of Donald Trump's ceiling. But this is Joe Biden's floor. This is also Joe Biden's floor. Before you put a billion dollars, and I think Axe is probably more well suited to talk about this than I am, but before you put a billion dollars, with a B, on markets throughout the country, uplifting and talking about the substantive policies and legislation that Joe Biden has passed. And so Democrats are proverbial bedwetters. We've talked about that for a long period of time. We're going to cry, we're going to pout. We do have an age problem in our party. We have an age problem in American politics. Although our House leadership is extremely young, the names that people rattle off when they talk about leaders of the Democratic Party are old. But what just evens that out is the fact that Donald Trump is old too. And so that's a moot point. It's not Joe Biden versus DeSantis or Haley. It's Joe Biden versus Trump.

These numbers and many other polls that have been out suggest otherwise. As much as I would like to agree with my friends on the left here, I have to imagine that a Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Gavin Newsom, would be polling head-to-head significantly higher than Donald Trump. And I think it undercuts Democrats' core message, which this is about democracy and the future of the American Republic and keeping a lawless man out of office if you're putting up a candidate who is actually quite weak head-to-head. But I'd say on the flip side, on the Republican, what I think stood out to me is Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, and Chris Christie all performed stronger head-to-head against Joe Biden than Donald Trump. So, there's some weakness on both sides of the top tier candidates. And I would just go back to this number we saw earlier this year.

And that will make his future movements more predictable, especially if he's becoming a creature of habit.The police are very confident that they've contained him within a three to five-mile radius. But the idea that he was seen near Longwood Gardens, when he was seen a little bit east two days ago, now he's back. Longwood Gardens is a thousand acres. But the idea that he thinks he can hide there successfully does give them pause. If they can get the dogs there, the helicopters, the horses, I mean, they're going full court press, very likely that they could find him in the next few days. He seems to still be in the area, and that's crucial if we're going to catch him.",

But when the ground is hotter than the human body, then you're not going to be able to use that technology.And also, we've now seen that video hundreds of times in crab walking. They have to consider he could be in the trees. He should be auditioning for Ninja Warrior. He could be in a culvert. He is a small guy who could push aside razor wire twice, which means he could be in those brambles. It's just really challenging because of the heat and just the density of that foliage.",

His age clearly dominated the answers.Nearly half of his fellow Democrats list that as their biggest concern, with everything else in single digits. His age is something he clearly can't change. But given that, Senator, is there any reason to think his approval numbers will get better?",

It shows how President Biden made an unannounced visit to a war zone, one not controlled by the United States, when he went to Kyiv a number of months ago. The first time a president in the modern era has gone to a war zone.And it does, in the background, describe that he left Washington at 4:00 a.m. he traveled 40 hours to get to Kyiv. It shows him striding forcefully, having a pointed conversation with President Zelenskyy, of fearlessly engaging in Kyiv. And it reminds folks that he's the sort of national leader who has pulled together 47 other countries to stand up to Russian aggression in Ukraine. That has strong bipartisan support in the Senate. Senator McConnell, Senator Schumer have both been leading our efforts to provide more support for Ukraine. But if you look at that example, and the other examples of his success in bipartisan domestic policies that I just pointed to, I don't think his age matters as much as his seasoning, his experience, his leadership, and his ability.",

Alexander, thanks so much for joining us. To what extent are drone attacks like this one on Rostov disrupting the Russian military's logistics and supply routes? LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET.), FORMER DIRECTOR OF EUROPEAN AFFAIRS, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  So this one looks like it was an attack on a Russian command and control. Some of the footage I've seen seems to indicate it landed either on or close to the southern military district headquarters. Your viewers would be familiar with that because that's the building that Prigozhin's forces seized a couple of months back. It's the hub for the execution of this war against Ukraine. That's where the operational headquarters is. This one is relatively close to Ukrainian territory. It's only a couple hundred kilometers away. The Ukrainians have managed to launch and execute much more sophisticated attacks at far flung targets, hundreds and hundreds of kilometers away, 600, 700 kilometers away to strategic bases. What you're seeing is an expansion of Ukraine's pretty potent strike capabilities with regard to drones. They're going after strategic targets, strategic bombers, command and control, logistics hubs, and they're also adapting their tactical drones to greater effect, not just small hand grenades on troops but antitank mines that could do some damage to armor capability. So, it's a continued expansion of Ukraine's capabilities to wage this war.",
