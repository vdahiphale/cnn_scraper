More than 2,000 others already canceled tomorrow, putting the total number north of 15,000 since bad weather hit last week. Airports are filled with long lines of southwest passengers trying to rebook as piles of lost luggage continue to grow. Now, while other airlines recovered from the winter storm fairly quickly, Southwest very obviously has not. Yesterday, Southwest accounted for 84 percent of cancellations among all airlines. Today, 91 percent of cancellations. And tomorrow, a whopping 99 percent.

Shares closing down again about 5 percent today. That's on top of the 6 percent loss we saw yesterday. So, investors, you see it there. Executives don't like to see their stock dropping day after day. Now, let's talk about the cost for Southwest Airlines. You have one, the cost to reimburse all of these flyers who decide they don't want to rebook, they just want their money back. So, that will be pretty significant expense for Southwest. Phil, you think about the employees who have had to work in terms of the reservation desk, manning the phones to try to provide relief and customer service, that will likely be some OT expense. And then you also think about the system that sort of appears to be at play here, the scheduling system that some of the unions have said was out of date. The update to that that the CEO said last night they're going to have to double down in terms of accelerating the plan to upgrade that. I'm told, Phil, that those upgrades could cost double digits, $100 million to upgrade that, to all sorts of financial implications here. One industry consultant said, you're looking at roughly ballpark a million customers. If an average ticket is $250 to $300, that suggests absolute value is about $250 million to $300 million. The question is, how they defray that in terms of how they -- how many passengers can they convince cannot cash out, but just hold onto their ticket, rebook, likely with some generous perks.",

But now that the country is finally opening up and cases are surging, well, other places are getting nervous. China has also stopped reporting daily COVID cases on a national level. It severely narrowed its definition of COVID deaths, only reporting a handful of COVID deaths for the entire month. Now, Beijing says, look, everything is under control, but we know that hospitals are overflowing with elderly patients. And crematoriums across the country are overwhelmed. Fever and cold medicine are scarce. So far, Japan, India, Taiwan, and Italy's Lombardi region have put some COVID testing requirements in place. Taiwan and Japan said if a traveler tests positive, they'll have to quarantine for several days. Now, as Arlette said, the big concern from some of these countries is the lack of data from China that could help detect new variants. However, the global consortium that collects a database of COVID sequences, said that China has significantly increase the data that it's submitting and it says that all sequences shared by China suggest the virus is fueling the outbreak here closely resemble the variant circulating in the rest of the world since July. But, look, it's not as if China has totally thrown open its own borders. China's borders, however, still remain largely closed to foreigners, apart from a limited number of business or family visits -- Phil.",

I mean, I think if you're a member of Congress at this particular moment, you have to ask yourself, do I really want to serve in Congress with someone who literally is a manufactured version of a person?Like, they don't even know who he is, because so much of his background has been manufactured. And I think long-term, Republicans would be wise to question whether there are many, many, many more shoes to drop here. I mean, we've scratched the surface. Some of the biographical stuff is interesting and strange, but there are some other layers to this, like, the money stuff, that I think is deeply concerning to a lot of members.

KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Well, I think what you just described is exactly why it is some of those new members from New York who are going to be less electorally stable than someone who is a known quantity and people know them and will be voting more on that. For those newer names who are going to want to cement their political careers, this is probably a bit more of a risk for them than someone from across the country, someone from another state, someone from further away. I doubt this is a story that we will be talking about two years from now, as we head into the 2024 election, with the exception of, in the area, immediately around that district. This may well be a story that comes up. So, I can understand why some members are more reluctant to talk about it while others much more eager to distance themselves.",

This administration, when I was covering them and all the things we'velearned since then, flouting the well-known rules about document preservation, but also trying to kind of create a climate of secrecy around certain things that the former president was doing -- meetings that he was having, trying to keep those from ever reaching the light of day, even as people within the White House knew that what was going on was crazy. And I think you could include Mark Meadows as one of those people. People around Trump would often see him talking to folks and reading things that were crazy and they tried to keep a lid on it. But eventually this stuff comes out. And that's what we're finding out right now. And I think there are consequences on this, legal ones, really. There's a special counsel investigation.
