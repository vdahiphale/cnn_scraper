I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, just in this hour, former President Donald Trump's campaign just announced the former president will not participate in another presidential debate. And it comes as Vice President Kamala Harris did accept an invitation from CNN to debate the former president on October 23rd. This would be their second meeting on a public debate stage and would have taken place in the final few weeks of the campaign. So after initially rejecting a second debate with Harris following his September 10th showdown with her in Philadelphia last week, Trump suggested that he might be open to another debate. The CNN debate would mirror the June debate between President Biden and Trump on CNN, which had a very similar format in which Trump and -- in this case, Trump and Harris, would field moderators questions for 90 minutes, and it would be without out a live studio audience and would take place at the CNN studios here in Atlanta. So again, just a short time ago, I spoke with the Harris campaign communications director who underscored that Harris did agree to it. And the director saying the American voters deserve to see the candidates face off again before the election. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL TYLER, DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNICATIONS, HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN:  It would be unprecedented in modern American presidential history for the two candidates who are running to only engage in one debate. So we believe that the American people deserve to see that. Donald Trump himself has said -- he said many things when it comes to debates, but he's famously said he's willing to debate anytime, anywhere, anyplace. He thinks he won both debates. So he should have no problem showing up to show off his prowess once again on the debate stage. And we think that's what the American people deserve to see. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has done it many times in the past. Even as you noted a few moments ago, he, after reporting that statement out, said that he might change his mind if he was, quote, in the right mood. So we'll have to see, but for now, the posture of the campaign is taking that there would be no third debate.

Trump's plane just landed moments ago, so we expect him to take the stage any minute.And coming into this this event, he was posting on Truth Social about the women vote and how he hopes to court them this time around. Take a look at this post where he said that women four years ago were poorer, less healthy, less safe, more depressed, less optimistic than they were when he was president. He also said, quote, \"You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it has nowhere -- nowhere -- it is where it's always had to be, and that is with the states.\" And that obviously is coming after Vice President Harris has made abortion a centerpiece of her campaign against the former president. And look, that's an important issue in states like North Carolina. This is a very dynamic state, one that is fast changing, especially in the suburbs around Charlotte that are growing exponentially. And if you take a look at the polling in the state, women overwhelmingly support Vice President Harris over the former president, 60 percent of them, in fact, in a recent Quinnipiac poll, said that they would support Harris over Donald Trump. That is by a larger margin than President Biden had in this state with women just four years ago. So clearly a concern for Donald Trump as he heads into the final weeks of this race how he is performing with women. And that Truth Social posts is a glimpse into what his message will be to them in this state and all across the country, Fred.",

And for the following couple of reasons -- number one, the president, the former president, he knows the value of television ratings. And number two, he also knows, even if he doesn't believe the polls, that Harris has been gaining some ground. There's a lot that could happen in the next month or so that could cause Trump to want to have another debate. And now we know the offer is out there. We'll see what happens.I reported earlier this week from the Harris point of view. Harris was still angling for a debate. She was undeterred by Trump's claims that he wouldn't debate her again. CNN and other networks have been trying to make a rematch happen. So why did Harris agree to this one today? We'll this October 23rd date with CNN, my sources suggest a couple of reasons why Harris agreed. Number one, she wanted to V.P. debate to go first. The V.P. debate scheduled for October 1st between Vance and Walz, that's going to happen no matter what on October 1st. Second, she wants to get Trump back on to say yes some way. And because Trump was happy with the CNN debate, because he praised CNN afterward, that may have factored into her decision to agree to the CNN offer of October 23rd. Here's one more twist, Fred. CNN is proposing this new debate happen in Atlanta, the same place where Trump took on Biden. Imagine, right, for Trump, he believes that he knocked Biden out of the race at that CNN debate. So CNN is saying, hey, come back to the same studio here at the CNN headquarters. Let's do it again. We know that as of this afternoon, the campaign says he's not agreeing, but mark me down as skeptical this is going to hold. Honestly, Fred, it's probably, it's probably 50-50.",

His running mate is going to be debating on October 1st, up against Tim Walz. That's going to be a highly viewed debate on October 1st. Is that really going to be the final debate of the calendar? It may be, but if that is the final debate, Harris will start to do town halls on multiple networks, I'm told, according to a source. So Harris is going to be out there trying to get those television eyeballs. Trump is going to want that as well.By the way, Larry Sabato, the great political scientist, just made an interesting point on Twitter. He said, yes, by October 23rd, lots of early votes will have been cast. But those are mostly by people that made up their mind months ago. Theres going to be a base of undecided voters who will still have questions by mid and late October. Even on Halloween, they're not going to know who they're going to vote for.

And in several other occasions on the campaign trail in North Carolina, the two have been together, Robinson and Trump.

They believed that it was fabricated and are believing Mark Robinson's denial of the story and saying that it wasn't real, not to take away from your reporting.

But I think the major concern for Republicans right now is this is their nominee for governor, and they have to figure out when they have shown so much support for him in the last year-and-a-half, two years, four years of his political career, they now have to figure out if they want to continue to carry that into this election and risk what that will do to the former president and his campaign, but also the down-ballot elections. So they're kind of in a tough spot trying to figure out how to navigate this very quickly. I've seen some people reacting to my Twitter saying, no, we aren't, we're fine. But the Republicans are being pretty quiet on this right now, so -- the Republican politicians in the GOP down there.

The overwhelming majority of business leaders across the country recently polled by a professor at Yale think Harris will defeat Donald Trump this November, even though just one-third of them identified as Democrats. CNN reporter Matt Egan is digging through the numbers. MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTERNow, to be clear, I'm not saying that 80 percent of these CEOs want Harris to win, just that they expect that she will. And it's worth pointing out that this is not necessarily representative of all CEOs. But it is representative of the 60 or so power players in business who are convened once a quarter and polled anonymously by Sonnenfeld, who is known as the CEO whisperer. Now, as far as why they expect Harris to win, what element here could be relating to what they think these two candidates mean for democracy, because they found that the vast majority, 73 percent of these CEOs in this straw poll, they say that Trump represents a threat to democracy. Only four percent said that of Harris, again, not even close. Sonnenfeld told me that these CEOs are, quote, horrified by Trump's leadership model. And he went on to say they depend upon the rule of law and want a president who respects the law. Now I asked the Trump campaign to respond to these findings, and the campaign's national press secretary said to me, does anyone think a straw poll of business leaders from Yale represents the views of the country? And I think the clear answer there is no, but that's not the point. The point is that despite these polls that show the race remains very, very close, an overwhelming majority of these captains of industry, they expect it's going to be Harris in the Oval Office next year, not Trump. Another important finding from this straw poll is how these CEOs are feeling about the economy, because it's obviously a very confusing time. We've seen cracks in the job market. The Federal Reserve has cut but interest rates very sharply, the first rate cut since COVID. And yet the overwhelming majority of CEOs in this Yale straw poll, 84 percent, say that the economy is headed towards a soft landing. That's what we're hoping for. That would be taming inflation without causing unemployment to spike. Now it's true that these CEOs, they don't have a crystal ball, or if they do, they haven't shared that with us. But this is important for two reasons. One, it shows a reversal from two years ago when many CEOs feared a recession was a forgone conclusion. They no longer feel that way. The other, perhaps more important reason why we pay attention to this is because it does signal underlying confidence from CEOs. And the more confident they are, the more likely they are to invest, to open new factories and new plants, and to hire more workers. And ultimately in the long run, that confidence and those investments can keep this economy chugging along. Fredricka?",

But meantime, let's bring in CNN political analyst Julian Zelizer. Julian, glad you could be with me here. All right, so we're monitoring the comments coming from the former president. We understand through his campaign that he is not taking up CNN on its invitation for a second debate against Kamala Harris. She today, through her campaign, did agree to a second debate. It would have been October 23rd. The day is still young. Perhaps the former president would change his mind. In your view, how unusual would it be that we've only seen one debate potentially from the presidential candidates with now just 45 days to go before Election Day?",

We're going to get it changed. We got to get in. When we get in, we're going to get this craziness change. Everyone knows that Kamala Harris cannot explain how she would make your life better because it's really her policies that have destroyed this country in the last three years. She was the border czar. Now she says she wasn't the border czar. It doesn't matter. She was in charge of the border, put there by sleepy Joe Biden. He wanted to go to the beach. She said, I don't have time. I've got to go to the beach and sleep. Who the hell sleeps on camera? You have cameras watching. I don't want to ever fall asleep on live television.

He is now responding in full with the invitation from CNN for a second debate with Kamala Harris, October 23rd. He there just justified, saying -- he says it's too late. The voting has already started, and he's alleging that the CNN debate won't be fair after it was fair, in his view, when it was with Biden. But again, 45 days out from Election Day, and it would be October 23rd would be the debate that CNN has extended to both Trump and Kamala Harris, and Trump there saying it's too late for another debate. Back with me now, Julian Zelizer. I also want to bring into the fold here, former Republican congressman Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania. All right, good to see you both again. All right, so Julian, let's finish up your thought. Now we hear from the former president says it's just simply too late and voting has already started. So in other words, he's saying, why bother.",

She's very competitive if not ahead in states like Pennsylvania. Very few polls suggest she lost the last debate.

I mean, I just don't know that he's capable of giving answers that would actually help them grow his support. He's done nothing up to this point to really expand upon his base.

It was done over the objections of many Republicans. This is the rule that they approved. They are requiring hand-counted ballots. Counties must hand-count the number of ballots cast at a polling place to make sure that it matches the number of ballots that the machine counted. It's a reconciliation of the numbers. I want to be clear. They are not hand-counting the results of which candidates got the most votes. But nonetheless, it is expected to slow things down, Fred. As you can imagine, when you're hand-counting hundreds of thousands of ballots, it takes time. And that's exactly why folks like Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia, and even the Georgia attorney general, who is also a Republican, that's why they opposed this move. They said it was just too late to do it. But regardless, the Trump loyalists on that board voted three to two. I've got a clip for you that I will play, Fred, of the chairman of that board. He's not one of the Republican loyalists. He's an independent. He voted against it, and he pleaded with his colleagues to stand down. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN FERVIER, (I) CHAIRMAN, GEORGIA STATE ELECTION BOARD:  The overwhelming number of election officials that have reached out to me have been opposed to this. Several things concern me about this. Number one, I do think it's too close to the election. I do. We have received guidance from the secretary of state and from the attorney general's office. They say it's not supported in statute. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
