What they wouldn't make clear is when exactly he was going to announce that.The president repeatedly saying he intended to run in Ireland last week, saying that he had made the decision, an announcement would be forthcoming soon, but when it was very much something that people couldn't repeatedly figure out very small group of advisers kind of in control of that timeline of that process of building a reelection campaign? And campaign officials now say is likely to be announced next week. Next week, marking the four-year anniversary from when president Biden launched his first campaign for presidency to defeat Donald Trump. He was successful in that endeavor, and in the years since he has these -- based on the view of White House officials, based on the president's political advisors built a very real, very substantive agenda, legislative accomplishments, accomplishments that are now being implemented across the country. And that, more than anything else, so they say the president is going to be focusing on, in the months ahead. The model is kind of out in the open. The president has been making very clear those priorities, these accomplishments and also a very clear contrast between Republicans that he knows he will certainly be running against, whether or not that's Donald Trump or somebody else, advisors don't necessarily want to weigh in, but they feel confident that based on that agenda, and based on those contrasts, they have a winning formula. But it's a formula that will certainly take developing over time. And they also underscore when you talk to White House officials and the president's political team that this will be a year of building, building up on their campaign, whether or not that's the president's travel, how they try and focus things but also building behind the scenes. The infrastructure of the campaign has largely been put together behind the scenes over the course of the last couple of months, but they will spend 2023 testing digital strategies, testing data strategies, testing voter messages and watching the Republican primary play out. And that last point is a critical one, because it was one of the drivers behind the president's decision to wait until next week to launch that campaign, recognizing that there's no real pressure on the Democratic side from any potential primary opponent. There's a recognition that the president was likely to run again, and certainly there was plenty of fighting that they were happy to watch from the sidelines on the Republican side of things. But now the president ready to engage major donors are expected in Washington at the end of next week to meet with the president's senior team. This is all building towards what people knew it was coming. I just didn't know when. The when appears to be next week. Phil Mattingly, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

According to DOD, some of those contingencies include the need to secure the embassy and perhaps the need to evacuate the embassy.Now, the Defense Department wont say what additional forces or where, but we've learned from the U.S. Defense official, that there are now several hundred marines in Djibouti at Camp Lemonnier. Those marines have an aviation combat element with them, essentially aircraft that can move marines and other ground forces in if necessary, and those forces could be used again, both to secure the embassy and to evacuate if needed, given the situation. The U.S. and that includes the State Department, the Defense Department and the White House are watching the situation in Sudan and in Khartoum very closely. According to DOD records, there are only about 14 troops based there, including 13 marines, and those would largely be embassy security in Khartoum in the capital of Sudan to move those out to secure them. It will take many more for this is and this is why we're seeing that build up in Djibouti. In terms of when an evacuation might happen, a senior U.S. official says it's not imminent and that's because they're looking for an open window and active ceasefire that holds between the two warring factions here. The best chance for that, the senior U.S. official says, might be the upcoming Eid Al Fitr holiday in the coming days, and that's what they're looking at again. That's not a guarantee it is simply the best window, it looks like the evac might be possible, Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The state news agency says a Russian fighter jet dropped what it called aviation munition during a midair emergency. The weapons fell near the center of the city of Belgorod, causing a large explosion. The blast caused a crater 40-meters wide, knocking down electricity poles and damaging an apartment building.

This comes at a pretty crucial point in this conflict when Russiahas so far failed really, to meaningfully mount some kind of winter or spring offensive. And Ukraine is said to be preparing its own counter offensive in the coming months. The critical point for Ukraine in all of this is air defense. We know certainly from leaked Pentagon documents that they seem to have a degree of strength in terms of ground forces, perhaps even an upper hand on Russia, but when it comes to air defense and its air force capabilities, that is where the vulnerability is. Take a look at this tweet from the Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov just on Thursday he says, our top priority is to quickly build a multi-level air defense-anti missile defense system. Patriots, IRIS-T, NASMS, and MiG-29 are the most recent, but not the final steps towards this goal. He says, given the Kremlin's barbaric tactics, we need NATO-style fighter jets. So, renewing that call for fighter jets so far, of course, we've only seen them getting MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland and Slovakia, not the newer sort of NATO-style jets that they have been calling for. This is a very high-level meeting. We've just seen the NATO secretary general arrive there. He just straight for basically from his first ever trip to Kyiv since the start of the conflict, where he said that Ukraine's future would be in the alliance. So I think that really underscores the two things that Ukraine is now looking for, one greater air defense capability, and two, security guarantees that would preface formal application of formal invitation to join NATO, which is, of course, what it hopes to come out of a summit in July.

CNN's Isa Soares has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It was the darkest of days in Brazilian democratic history, supporters of Former President Jair Bolsonaro taking the capital, Brasilia, by storm, breaking into the presidential palace, and other government buildings. Now, new CCTV footage exclusively obtained by CNN affiliate, CNN Brasil, of what transpired inside the presidential palace appears to bolster the claims of people who have accused the police of failing to act. Chief among them, current president Lula da Silva. LULA DA SILVA, BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  There are a lot of people colluding. It's important to say there were a lot of conniving people from the military police and there are a lot of conniving people from the armed forces. SOARES (voice-over):  The hours of CCTV footage showed police forces seemingly retreating as protesters marched on the palace, and leaving their post as rioters entered the building. Once inside, the ransacking begins. Priceless antiquities, tables, phones, almost nothing is left untouched. At the time, former policeman Cassio Thyone told me some of the criticism wasn't warranted. CASSIO THYONE, FORMER POLICE OFFICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY RESEARCHER (through translator):  Some policemen ended up not acting because they didn't think there was a risk of invasion. I don't think it was incompetence. SOARES (voice-over):  The Institutional Security Office or GSI, which handles security for the presidential palaces has also defended its officers, saying they evacuated some areas, concentrated demonstrators on the second floor and waited for reinforcements to arrest him. Despite those assertions, the bureau acknowledging its offices are being investigated, and those proven to have collaborated with rioters will be held responsible. But heads have started rolling. General Goncalves Dias, Lula's government minister in-charge of security, has resigned. CCTV footage shows him walking with some of the rioters, just feet away from the presidential office. He says he was trying to lead them away so they could be arrested. But critics say his demeanor was complacent and complicit. Back in Brazil after three months in self-imposed exile in the United States, Bolsonaro is enjoying some respite. The video league seen as a momentary win, as he continues to dodge blame for the January riots. Yet doubt remains, the new footage raising more questions than answers it provides. Isa Soares, CNN.
