And we begin in North Carolina where the Republican-led assembly moved to ban most abortions after 12 weeks, overriding a veto from Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. The vote in the State Senate on Tuesday was 30 to 20 along party lines. Just hours later, the State House also voted 72 to 48 to do the same. Governor Cooper slammed the vote in a tweet saying, Republicans are unified in their assault on women's reproductive freedom and vowed to fight back. The State's Democratic Attorney General also criticized the move, saying they are not done yet. They will keep coming until they completely ban abortion in every instance.CNN's Diane Gallagher has more. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly voted Tuesday to override a veto from the State's Democratic Governor Roy Cooper. Cooper signed that veto on Saturday, just days after the assembly rushed through a bill that would ban most abortions after 12 weeks, with some exceptions and a slew of other changes to abortion access, paperwork and reporting requirements in just a matter of 48 hours. Now, the Governor had toured the state trying to put pressure on four Republican lawmakers, claiming that their vote on this bill, well, wouldn't gel with something that they had said during their campaigns in regard to abortion access. Several of those lawmakers pushed back on Cooper. And on Tuesday night, every single one of the four Republicans that he had put this pressure campaign on over the past week, well, they voted to override his veto. The new law will go into effect in North Carolina. The majority of those new stipulations and requirements and restrictions happening on July 1st. Democrats have no further recourse on this particular bill. It is now law. The Democrats have told CNN that they plan to use this as a way to energize their base in the state, looking ahead to 2024.

      "sentences": "You know, so as I wrote on CNN.com, the Sunday after the election, the story was actually a little more complex than that. In blue and purple states, states where abortion was still legal, the reaction was exactly what you described. Governor -- Republican gubernatorial candidates, and in most cases, Senate candidates, who wanted to ban abortion were decisively defeated in places like Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and more narrowly defeated in Arizona. And in all of those states, you saw 60 percent or more of voters say they wanted abortion to remain legal. And big, big majorities of those pro-choice voters voted for Democrats, voted no on the Republicans who wanted to ban abortion.The story was very different in the red states that actually did ban abortion. In places like Florida, and Texas, and Ohio and Iowa, and Tennessee, and even Georgia, which on a state level is still Republican-leaning, Republican governors and Republican legislators who banned abortion did not face a backlash from their voters. So the question really is, which side of this divide does North Carolina fall in? Is it fundamentally a red state where voters who might nominally say they are pro-choice not consider that a sufficient reason to break from their traditional loyalty to the Republican party, or is it more like a Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania where swing voters emphatically said no to this? They'll have a governor's race next year. We'll see. But the bigger question may be, of the 25 states that Trump won in 2020, North Carolina is probably the only one that Democrats have a serious chance to contest. And I think the question will be whether a promise from Joe Biden to try to pass a national law restoring abortion rights in all states will allow Democrats to make a serious push at North Carolina, which has generally been trending away from them in the Trump era.",

As lenders are worried about their counterparties, they require higher interest rates to make loans. So we are estimating that this could raise mortgage rates by about two points from about 6.5 percent toward 8.5 percent on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. That would be a huge blow to affordability for home buyers who have already been struggling with major affordability challenges in the last year or so.

We'll put him in a coffin, cover him with the American flag with respect because he did not die in his bed as a grandpa, but he died at war and most likely a worthy death. KILEY (voice-over): The Washington Post has reported that U.S. intelligence documents suggest that he tried to trade Russian intelligence for ceding territory around Bakhmut. Progozhin denies the claims. Russia has said that the allegations Progozhin offered to spy for Ukraine are a hoax.

He also criticized efforts to remove what some consider insensitive material from new additions of works by British children's author Roald Dahl, as well as James Bond novelist Ian Fleming. Rushdie's comments came in a video message at the British Book Awards on Monday, nine months after surviving a stabbing attack on stage before a lecture in New York.Hundreds of people are feared dead and rescue groups warn of a large- scale loss of life following one of the strongest storms to ever hit Myanmar. The country's shadow government says at least 400 people are dead and an unspecified number missing after Cyclone Mocha roared across Myanmar's coast on Sunday, unleashing floods and landslides. There's an urgent need for food, water and shelter. Among the hardest hit areas is Rakhine State, where Human Rights Watch says 600,000 members of the Rohingya minority live under government persecution. Still to come, the world famous Galapagos Islands are under threat from climate change. We will look at the creative way the government plans to fund conservation efforts.

So the country is trying a debt-for-nature deal to fund conservation efforts.CNN's Lynda Kinkade explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Darwin's flycatcher, a creature that helped inspire Darwin's theory on evolution 188 years ago, sits perched on the edge of extinction. The small bird species, native to Ecuador's Galapagos Island chain, is dwindling in number. On the island of Santa Cruz, just 15 adult pairs remain. Yet scientists see a glimmer of hope. In the past year, 12 new chicks were hatched, a sign that the species will live on to fight another day, for now. This tiny comeback is helping to spur efforts to protect the rich biodiversity of the Galapagos Islands. These islands are at a perilous crossroads. According to researchers, a million plants and animals worldwide are at risk of extinction from habitat destruction, rising carbon emissions and overfishing. And as climate change warms the oceans, ecosystems and the flora and fauna that depend on them are being pushed to the very brink. As biodiversity declines worldwide, the Galapagos Islands are a litmus test. To protect this precious ecosystem, Ecuador announced a record- setting deal to convert $1.6 billion of its debt into a loan it says would channel at least $12 million a year to conserving the Galapagos. JOSE ANTONIO DAVALOS, ECUADORIAN ENVIRONMENT MINISTER (through translator): Not only will it allow us to protect 2,500 marine species, of which 38 are migratory, but it will also allow us to move towards a sustainable fishery. KINKADE (voice-over): It is one of the largest debt for conservation swaps in history. Over the next two decades, Ecuador hopes to channel over $450 million towards protecting one of the most incredible ecosystems on the planet. A move that some say is crucial, not just for the environment, but for Ecuador's survival. ELIZABETH SALINAS, TRADER (through translator): It seems to me that we must help maintain the flora and fauna and thus attract tourism, which is what keeps the country alive. KINKADE (voice-over): In late 2022, nearly 190 nations signed on to take measures to combat biodiversity loss, passing a U.N. agreement that pledges to preserve 30% of the world's land and seas by 2030. Ambitious measures that conservation groups say do not go far enough. Meanwhile some environmentalists hope Ecuador's debt for conservation model gains momentum in other parts of the world as a win-win for both economies and for conservation efforts.
