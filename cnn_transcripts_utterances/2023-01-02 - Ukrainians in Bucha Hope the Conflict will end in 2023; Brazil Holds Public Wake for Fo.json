Now we're getting reports of a deadly Ukrainian strike in the Russian occupied Donetsk region. The blast appears to have killed a large number of Russian troops. And that's according to both Ukrainian as well as pro- Russian accounts. Russian military bloggers are criticizing Moscow's military. They say the troops were housed in a building next to an ammunition dump. This comes as Russia mounts a third straight day of attacks targeting civilians and critical infrastructure. Kyiv authorities are urging residents to conserve electricity in the meantime. The Ukrainian military says dozens of drones were shut down overnight. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins me now live from the Ukrainian Capital. Ben, what more do we know about the Ukrainian strike in the Donetsk region?",

Now this vocational school was housing apparently a large number. We don't know how many roughly were there of Russian soldiers, the Ukrainians are saying as many as 300 Russian soldiers were killed and 400 wounded. Now the Russian news agency TASS is saying that 63 soldiers were killed.

They're pouring into the stadium in Santos, Brazil to view his casket lying at the center of the pitch. Pele died Thursday at the age of 82 from colon cancer. His public wake will last 24 hours before a private burial in Santos. The funeral possession will pass by the home of his mother Celeste who is 100 years old. Brazil's newly inaugurated President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will attend the wake either later today, or Tuesday. Pele's heroics on the pitch brought joy to his nation as well as the world. He had a global impact both in his sports and beyond. It is becoming goodwill UN Ambassador and UNESCO Champion for sport. We're covering Pele's wake with Stefano Pozzebon inside the stadium in Santos and Julia Vargas Jones outside of the stadium. Stefano, I want to start with you.

And only for Pele because this wasn't a club that was notorious before his arrival, Pele really made this club and that's the main feeling that the fans are telling me that they're grateful for what he did to put Santos on the map and to put Brazil on the map. But also, the feeling that Pele was the perfect kind of celebrity; he was humble, he connected with people, and he was really a natural for the limelight and like you said he had many other achievements with the UN and being an Ambassador for Brazil abroad. I want to say that more than anyone else he inspired a whole generation of young kids; especially the poor the black children that now had an idol in the 1960s, a black man that was rising to this level of stardom. That was unheard of, and that happened here in Brazil. And that's why people I want to show you are lining up for hours. We're hearing about 4500 people have already entered.

There's a gentleman that I spoke with here, Mr. Antonio (ph) he told me that he was here last night he went in, he saw Pele, and he's for a second time.

There is almost no one who shaped this body, this gigantic body more than Pope Benedict the 16th of course, who before it was Cardinal Ratzinger. If you look at his, his tenure as the Dean of the College of Cardinals as the Head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, he was definitely a powerful operator here inside the Vatican, who in many ways even when John Paul the Second was the Pope, was the one who was driving a lot of the changes in the doctrine, a lot of evolution of the doctrine indefinitely an extremely powerful figure.

Two Palestinian men were killed and three were injured during an Israeli operation in West Bank according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

Right, we're taking a closer look at what could unfold this year in the Middle East. Here are four things to watch out for. A more cohesive OPEC plus Russia's war in Ukraine has pushed some Arab oil producers closer to Moscow at the oil cartel. The war also sought Ankara's international prominences grow, but the Turkish president's grip on power may be tested as Turkey celebrates its centennial. Iran could grow increasingly isolated as an entire generation of repressed woman at home shook the foundations of the Islamic Republic. And we'll be watching Israel's lurch to the right with its new government. There's more insight in our newsletter, you can just head to cnn.com or find it all on your CNN app. Right we've been covering the protests in Iran for more than 100 days. It all started with Mahsa Jina Amini, a young Kurdish Iranian woman who died in the custody of the morality police and was accused of violating the country's Islamic dress code. Her death ignited a movement, the fight for women for life and for freedom. Regime's crackdown has been brutal, making Iran even more isolated on the world stage, but the resistance has been fixed with supporters inside and outside the country finding ways to make their message heard. One of those ways is through protest songs. Several songs are capturing the essence of the struggle. But Shervin Hajipour's Baraye really hit home. Our Nada Bashir reports on that powerful piece and other artistic acts of defiance. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice over): For my sister for your sister for our sister's lyrics inspired by a series of tweets, highlighting the many reasons as to why the people of Iran are protesting. Baraye, which means four, was created by Iranian singer songwriter Shervin Hajipour. He was arrested shortly after the song's release on charges including spreading propaganda against the regime. But the piece has since been described as the unofficial anthem of Iran's ongoing protest movement. It has inspired artistic displays of defiance across the globe.",

ADNAN MAZAREI, FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR, IMF'S MIDDLE EAST AND CENTRAL ASIA DEPARTMENT: Happy New Year. The IMF seems to have gotten more concerned since they were last fall about the global outlook. Three factors may explain this. One is the global inflation is more persistent than believed. And central banks are perhaps belatedly determined to fight it. This is raising risks of global recession in the U.S. and other advanced economies, which will easily, could spill over to the developing and emerging markets. The pandemic is not going well and especially in China and the risks of bad million, billion, million more people infected with the risk of new variants, hurting growth and commodity demand for a lot of developing countries.

The onerous restrictions have beenlifted, people were able to party and go out on New Year's Eve in China in a way that many people haven't been able to for months and months and months.

It's believed to have hit peaks experts say in cities like Shanghai, but you're still seeing seems like this in one Shanghai hospital, the lobby just overflowing with patients. And we're hearing anecdotally of funeral homes and crematoriums just being backed up with just the higher number of victims these days. On the flip side of that a lot of people seem to have contracted COVID and are getting over it. Anecdotally, I can describe one person saying they went to a movie theater in Shanghai this weekend. And everybody seemed to be coughing and apparently getting over COVID at the same time. But there are concerns now that with tens of millions of new infections, that new variant that could be dangerous to global health could evolve. So the World Health Organization says that on Friday, it held a meeting with senior Chinese health officials and \"Again asked for regular sharing of specific and real time data on the epidemiological situation more genetic sequencing data, data on disease impact data on vaccinations delivered and vaccination status\". There is concern about transparency from China. Recall that the virus was first detected in China, way back in the autumn of 2019. And with the Chinese government opening up announcing that it's not going to self-isolate anymore, no more quarantine for incoming travelers as of January 8. Growing numbers of governments are putting the brakes on travel from China to their territories. For instance, a growing number asking for negative COVID test results 48 hours within 48 hours before travelers get on the plane to their countries. And that includes the U.S., UK, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Malaysia, India, Qatar and Morocco has gone one step further.
