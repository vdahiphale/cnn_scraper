The young women who were spotters for the military -- for the Israeli military clearly caught unawares on October 7 as this attack happened. They're bloodied. Several of them are wearing their underwear. They clearly are terrified. And you know, you can't look at this and not have your heartbreak. It's fascinating that they are -- these pictures are released now. The family has said that they were keeping them private for obvious reasons, privacy reasons. But now in releasing them and thus forcing the Israeli government to release them, they're trying to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu at a moment when Mr. Netanyahu was under pressure in many different ways. Benny Gantz, whose major political opponent, but a member of the war cabinet has said that he will, by early June, leave the government if there is not some move toward a ceasefire and a plan for how they would govern Gaza. And of course, you've seen the ICC move to at least a proposal to put out an arrest warrant.",

Now, the United States is sending a team to help authorities in Singapore find out what caused the violent changes in altitude. The plane was diverted to Bangkok. The passenger told my colleague Erin Burnett that the drop was so sudden that no one had time to repair including the flight crew. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A Singapore Airlines Flight hit with severe turbulence throwing passengers and crew throughout the cabin 10 hours into the flight. The incident was so rough, lighting in the air ventilation tubing fell out of the ceiling. Food trays for breakfast littered across the floor. Emergency workers raced to Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport on Tuesday afternoon after the flight turned deadly. Traffic control on the tarmac quick to redirect ambulances and set up makeshift medical tents for injured passengers. Flight SQ321 departed from London and was en route to Singapore but severe turbulence forced pilots to make an emergency landing in Thailand. A 73-year-old British man Geoff Kitchen died on board the flight. At least seven others were in critical condition with dozens more injured. KITTIPONG KITTIKACHORN, GENERAL MANAGER, SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT (through a translator): The plane landed at the airport and the medical team was sent to the scene. Many injuries occurred so the airport had to issue an emergency plan. All our teams went to help. WATSON (voiceover): The airline has launched an investigation into the incident with the British Embassy also deploying officials to support those in the hospital. The passengers left with the question of how this all went so wrong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Wolf, it is not very rare at all -- I mean, not very common at all to see this happen. It's extremely rare, particularly, to have a death in flight. The last one I'm aware of was back in 1994. So, it's been many, many years since we've had a fatality caused directly from turbulence like this.The severity of this, you can see the passengers are injured. That can come from a lot of different things, mostly, like he mentioned before that the flight crew was not fastened in. They were not expecting it. I don't think this was clear air turbulence. I believe it was related to some activity in the area from the weather. So, it is somewhat predictable. But even at that, to be able to know -- there hadn't been any flights reported before that with any kind of turbulence. So, a lot of these injuries are not just from the flight attendants. But because of the flight attendants being thrown around the cabin can cause injuries as they land on the other passengers, and that sort of thing. So, it's a very dangerous situation and it could have been even worse than it was, I believe.",

Because then even though you still get the same movements at a slower speed, they're less dramatic. So, that's the first mitigating thing that they can do.The second thing they can do is try to avoid it. So, they read it ahead of time. They hear what the other pilots are saying it who have flown through that area. But in this case, there were no reports of that going on. So, they were trying to do that, but to avoid it. Now, the most concerning part of this is if their work in the case of the clear air turbulence. And we're working on, the FAA is working on, and NASA is working on some things to try to detect clear air turbulence. But currently, there's not a real effective way to be conclusive about whether you're flying into this clear air turbulence or not.",

And if it wasn't preventable, then they're going to be making recommendations and supporting actions that would make it preventable.

But then eventually put it back on when I expressed to him that it's not only for your safety. These seatbelts protect the people around you because if you don't have yours on and you get into that turbulence, you become a projectile and you can cause injury to others.

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this is not likely to be a game changer. But maybe we don't need a game changer because gas prices, they've actually been pretty calm lately. Now, this gasoline is coming from an emergency stockpile here in the northeast. It's called the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve. It was formed in 2014 after superstorm Sandy caused all kinds of disruptions to the energy market.Unlike the much larger strategic petroleum reserve, this is a relatively small reserve. It's never been used before. And it's actually quite expensive to maintain. That's why Congress passed legislation earlier this year requiring the Biden administration to shut this reserve down. So, this move was announced yesterday by the Energy Department. It's not really an emergency response from U.S. officials. It's really just doing what they were required to do. Now, experts tell me that this is not likely to move the needle on gas prices. Because although a million gallons -- I'm sorry, a million barrels of gasoline sounds like a lot, it's really not. It's not even enough to account for three hours of national supply. So, Wolf, this is really just a blip in the grand scheme of things.",

But I think that really where gas prices are, it's a lot better than feared.Just a few months ago, there were all these concerns about $4 gas because you've got OPEC holding back supply. Ukraine has been hitting oil refineries in Russia. And of course, the situation in the Middle East has been extremely volatile. So, the fact that gas prices have been pretty calm and down from the high has been good news. If we can put it into historical perspective. $3.61 heading into the Memorial Day weekend. This is higher, of course, than where gas prices were in the years before and right after COVID. But this is also significantly lower than where prices were two years ago. You see, in 2022, the national average heading into this holiday weekend was at $4.59. Of course, that was a year of historically high gas prices. Thankfully, there's been a lot of improvements since then. In any case, Wolf, a lot of Americans are expected to hit the roads this holiday weekend. AAA is forecasting 38.4 million people will be on the road. That is up four percent from a year ago, and that would mark the most since AAA started tracking this back in 2000.",
