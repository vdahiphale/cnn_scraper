They're saying that they want to reduce the federal deficit demonstrably while also executing a massive tax cut for the rich, doubling spending on our armed forces, as well as doing a whole myriad of other corporate giveaways. It's the return, the resurgence of trickle-down economics, and the American people don't want anything to do with that.Secondly, they're talking about constantly law and order, law and order. At the same time they want to tie the hands of the attorney general and the Justice Department, the very signature arm of our law enforcement throughout the country. So yet again it's these myriad of contradictions because they have to appease Donald Trump, first and foremost, because they're sycophants to him, while at the same time trying to appeal to an extremist MAGA base, as well as just, what is the permanent fixture of Republican politics, which is tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.",

And he was gunned down in that incident.But then I think of the last incident when I was with the NYPD, which was Frank James. You'll remember, 2022. He was riding on the subway. He let smoke grenades go and then opened fire, shooting ten people. And when you went through all of his computers and all of his chats and all of his postings and his YouTube, he had an agenda, but it wasn't connected to anything else and it didn't make sense. And as you point out, it won't always make sense. The issue with this case today is, we don't know if he had a plot or a plan, but he had a car full of things to carry one out.

And that's extreme, by the way. If you follow the latest article in the journal \"Foreign Affairs,\" you have Mike Morell, the former deputy director of the CIA, Graham Allison, a Harvard counterterrorism expert and weapons of mass destruction expert, both saying, all lights are blinking red. Quoting from the language that was used before 911. And why are they saying that? They're saying that because counterterrorism resources have been shifted away since the end of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq to problems like China and Russia while the problem is expanding. Groups like ISIS Khorasan. And think about the nine individuals from Tajikistan who were arrested in the United States over the last few weeks after crossing the southern border. Sources are telling me that they believe those nine individuals were in touch with various ISIS-K facilitators and were being inspired to do something here on U.S. soil. When I read that article, you know, the line that struck me was, \"stated intentions of terrorist groups. The growing capabilities they have demonstrated in recent successful and failed attacks. The fact that several plots in the United States have been foiled point to an uncomfortable but simple conclusion. Put simply, the United States faces a serious threat of a terrorist attack in the months ahead.\" What they're saying is, we've really got to double down and do the kinds of things we don't even think about, like working more closely with the Pakistanis on ISIS Khorasan, or even the Taliban, who ISIS Khorasan is fighting.",

It's an understanding that we are not small men, that head to toe we are different. We present with different diseases. We have different symptoms. And for so long much of women's healthcare has been dismissed, understudied, undervalued, and misdiagnosed. And many women have been told it's all in their head.For example, 80 percent of autoimmune diseases are found in women. And it can take up to five years for many of these women to be diagnosed. So what compelled me to write this book was, yes, I take care of women in many instances in the hardest moments of their life. But it was the sacred, heartbreaking stories of women feeling invalidated for things potentially even unrelated to their cancer diagnosis, shame about their bodies, where does this come from? How do we unpack that legacy and help women get the care they really need moving forward? SIDNER: You really have things in there that help advocate for yourself as a patient, which is hard to do when you're standing in front of someone who's gone through, I don't know, a dozen years of schooling to be in the position they are.
