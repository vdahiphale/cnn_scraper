The claim was involved in a blast that killed a pro war Russian blogger. Former President Trump will be on his way to New York in a few hours for his historic criminal arraignment and miracles on the war front lines.David McKenzie follows a group of doctors performing facial reconstruction surgery in Ukraine. The Kremlin says Ukraine may be behind a blast that killed a prominent Russian Military blogger and injured more than 30 others. It happened at a cafe in St. Petersburg over the weekend. Vladlen Tatarsky died in the explosion. Russian authorities have detained a female suspect who they claim was involved in the blast. And they say Kyiv and supporters of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny helped plan the attack. Ukraine suggested in fighting in Russia was to blame. On Twitter, a top presidential aide said it was only a matter of time before domestic terrorism in Russia would become an instrument of an internal political fight. CNN's Clare Sebastian is following developments joins us live here in London. What do we know about the arrest today?",

She has according to TASS been arrested in the past participating in an anti-war protest the very first day of the war last year.That's according to the Russian state news agency TASS as I say, there has been a video, Max, and that's emerged from the Russian Interior Ministry. We're not showing it to you because of the possibility we don't know for sure, but there is a possibility it could have been extracted under duress where she was asked she says look, I was at the scene that's why I've been arrested. She says that she had a figurine which exploded, but when asked who gave it to her. She declined to answer that. So that is out there. Meanwhile, of course, as you say, there's a lot of politics behind this. This is happening in the context of this war, the Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov coming out and echoing comments from the Anti- Terror Committee saying that he believes this was Ukraine. He says they've been killing people since 2014 and that he says is why the special military operation is happening. So the investigation is still ongoing we're finding out more details. But it is clear at this point that Russia intends to use this as more evidence of what it constantly claims is the criminality of the Ukrainian regime.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it certainly was, and we are seeing it already coming true as oil markets is reacting to this decision to cut production. I mean, look, you cut oil production that's going to cause oil prices to spike. And then the real fear here at the White House is that could cause gas prices here at home to go up. We know that gas prices have been such an important driver of inflation, which the White House has been struggling to tame. And so this only adds to the concerns that inflation will be prolonged. This is a more than 1 million barrels per day production cut by OPEC +, that adds to the 2 million barrel per day cut that they announced back in October.And Saudi Arabia is positioning this move as something aimed to stabilize the oil markets. Clearly what they're trying to do is also to protect oil prices, which is a major source of revenue for them. The White House doesn't see it that way. They say \"We don't think cuts are advisable at this moment given market uncertainty and we've made that clear. We will continue to work with all producers and consumers to ensure energy markets support economic growth and lower prices for American consumers\". Now you'll recall that back in October, when OPEC Plus announced that previous oil production cut, the White House was furious President Biden said that there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia for doing this. He said that he viewed it as an attempt to help Russia mitigate the loss of revenue that they were facing those consequences though, Max, they never materialized. And that is a key part of this story here. And so now we're at a point where gas prices right now in the U.S. are at about $3.51 a gallon that's about 10 cents up from last month, but still much lower than where we were a year ago at about $4.20 a gallon. So it's hard to predict exactly what the effects will be on gas prices here in the U.S. But certainly the fear at the White House is that it will send those gas prices back up, which of course, is bad politics here for President Biden could prolong inflation, and of course, all this coming as he's preparing to announce a reelection campaign for 2024 at least that's the expectation, Max.",

The controversial move comes days after Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir demanded action on the proposal in exchange for agree to pause in the government's judicial reform plans.Mr. Netanyahu's cabinet didn't say who would run the new police force that will be determined by committee in the next 90 days. The guard would be charged with dealing with emergency situations but the guard proposal has already set up protests in several cities. Critics fear it will target Israeli Arabs and if Ben-Gvir controls it could become an extremist private militia. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak calls it a lunatic step given Ben- Gvir's history of inciting racism and supporting terrorism. Still to come it was one of the first cities to introduce e-scooters on its streets, but in September, Paris will become the first major European capital to ban them over security concerns in general clutter will ask if others should follow suit. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) In the coming hours Former U.S. President Donald Trump is set to leave Florida and head to New York where he's expected to appear in court on Tuesday and Manhattan grand jury has indicted him for his alleged role in the hush money payment scheme.

Paris will become the first European capitals to ban electronic or electric scooters from the streets just over 100,000 Persians cast their vote in the referendum with nearly 90 percent of them voting against e- scooters.

      "sentences": "Well there is that question of the safety, Max, that you mentioned a moment ago not just the many hundreds of injuries that are every year either from people riding them and falling off, or indeed, to the damage done to pedestrians by these vehicles, which as you say, you'll see all over the French capital in really going pretty fast a lot of the time.There is the danger to ordinary pedestrians and these are vehicles remember that you will often see a whole bunch of teenagers on 2 or 3 at a time driven fairly recklessly, often without a helmet, and not always with a very clear sense of where they're going or how fast they're trying to get there. And that's been one of the main concerns just the shear hazard it's become across a Parisian Street, given these vehicles going back and forth, often in the opposite direction to the car traffic as well. Then there is the issue of the clutter, Max, there are those who felt and leading amongst them, of course. The Mayor of Paris that you just heard from their Anne Hidalgo, that they were not in fact, as ecological as they'd been billed as when they were first introduced, simply because they get discarded, thrown into the sand left on the side of the street in aesthetically cluttering up the streets of Paris, but also ultimately, being far from ecologically sound. That had been her main complaint but in the end, it is that huge percentage that are voted against 90 percent saying they want them gone but only 8 percent of those eligible who turned out to vote. She hailed it as a great success in terms of turnout, it was remarkably low. In the end, the people who went out to vote appear to have been this Sunday, those who were steadfastly against, and who felt that they'd become just too hazardous for the streets of Paris. But it will change we had become so used to them. They're such an important feature now of the French Capital that by the end of the summer, you can expect to see a very different looking city indeed, Max.",

Remember that when they were first introduced back in 2018 when Paris was the first city to adopt them, Max, there was very little in the way of regulation. It was a bit of a wild world out there and many different operators came in.Now regulation has been put it in Paris, for instance. Now the daily feed is capped to 15,000 for the city, and that's happened elsewhere. I think what's quite where this kind of city wide referendum and city wide ban is. But I'm sure that other capitals be looking at what Paris has done to see whether or not they should follow suit. Bear in mind, though, that they are pretty popular as well. I mean, not that many people turned out to vote in Paris for this referendum that was held on Sunday, no doubt for a number of different reasons. I need that go referred there to the social protest going on at the moment. A lot of people not venturing to the French Capital if they could avoid it generally at the moment, but there is the question of their popularity if you look at that fleet that I mentioned here in Paris, each single vehicle is used 3.5 times a day. There are a lot of people who find them really convenient, not least the young to get around the streets of European capitals. So I think the question will be whether people elsewhere will have seen that the dangers vastly outweigh the advantages, and indeed how many people turn up if and when a referendum should be held, Max.",
