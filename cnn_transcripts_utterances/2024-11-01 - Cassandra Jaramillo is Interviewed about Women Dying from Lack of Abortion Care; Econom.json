JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN BUSINESS ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": We were expecting the unexpected, and that's exactly what we got. There is a drop in this number, 12,000 jobs added net for the month of October. Much worse than expected. But what the report says is, look, we know there was severe damage in the south east of the country. It was a lot of hurricane damage. Helene and Milton, of course, that's baked into the cake here. We've also got the strikes at Boeing. So, when you look at this number, you have to keep those things in mind. It's a massive drop, of course, from what we saw in September. That number was also revised lower, down to 223,000 jobs. In fact, what we lost was over 110,000 jobs over August and September. So, the jobs market we know is cooling. It was a little cooler than we expected. We've got to look through these numbers. That's the bottom line, Sara. What we were expecting is a hit for those two things, hurricanes and for Boeing strikes, of somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000 jobs. If you add the best case back to this, we're talking around 112,000 jobs added. It's a lot less than the average that we've seen. I'm couching everything I'm saying here -",

I have had sources telling me over the past month that witnesses have been regularly meeting with federal investigators. And now I have three sources who tell me that the grand jury has been regularly convening. Now, yesterday, Kate, the grand jury heard from a male witness, as you said, who does not claim that he himself was abused by Combs, but he claims to have evidence, video footage, that he says contains footage of Combs allegedly victimizing celebrities. Now, we do not know the celebrity's names, and it's unclear what exactly he testified about and what jurors have said. But his attorney tells me on the record that he did testify in front of the grand jury yesterday. Now, this is the latest development in this ongoing saga, Kate. We know that Combs has at least two dozen civil suits against him. He denies all of these allegations. He says that he has never sexually assaulted anyone. And I reached out to his team yesterday. They did not respond to comment about grand jury proceedings. But in a recent filing, his team did say that they believe that attorneys and their accusers have been speaking to the media and telling false information to the media, which they say is going to limit their client from having a fair trial. Now, one more piece of news for you, Kate. As we got this reporting about this grand jury testimony yesterday, the government this week in a filing also says that they have obtained 60 devices from Combs that they say has more evidence that they are looking into.",

You'll look here now on November 1, it's Trump by less than a point across the battleground states.

They threaten those who speak against them with death.\"These are comments like that, that repeated talk of the enemy within - from within that have marked Trump's entire presidency of late - candidacy of late. An NPR analysis found that Donald Trump has made more than 100 threats since 2022 to go after his perceived enemies. It's also the focus of a \"New York Times\" opinion piece by prominent conservative legal scholar, retired federal appeals court judge, Michael Luttig. He says this in the opinion piece. \"There could be no higher duty of American citizens than to decisively repudiate a man who betrayed the nation when he was previously entrusted with the highest office in the land and now threatens the persecution of American citizens who have crossed him. In the almost 250 years since the founding of the nation, no president before Donald Trump has ever so betrayed America.\" Judge Michael Luttig joins us now. Judge, thank you so much for being here. What Donald Trump said about Liz - J. MICHAEL LUTTIG, RETIRED FEDERAL JUDGE: Thank you for having me on this morning, Kate.",

They were unprecedented.I cannot tell you how many emails and texts I received this morning that just said, oh, my God. And the only reply to those messages I could think of, Kate, was, yes., oh my God. Every citizen of the country, especially Republicans, has an obligation to themselves and to America to watch the video from last night, as I did before coming on this morning, and pondered those un-American words by Donald Trump before they cast their votes on Tuesday. The nation is now on notice, if it was not already. If Americans return Donald Trump to the White House after those comments about our fellow American Liz Cheney, statements that Donald Trump would make about any one of his countless other enemies from within, those who voted for him will get what they deserve. Apropos of his reprehensible words last night, of course, three nights ago Vice President Harris spoke the most powerful words that anyone running against Donald Trump could ever speak. She said, I will give those who disagree with me a seat at the table. Those, Kate, are the words of a president of the United States. Those are the words that Americans, especially Republicans and independents, need to hear and desperately want to hear from their next president.",
