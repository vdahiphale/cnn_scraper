NATO says it will boost its military presence in the Baltic Sea after the suspected sabotage of an undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia. Finnish authorities have seized a tanker carrying Russian oil, believing it may be responsible for causing undersea internet and power cable outages. Finland's President says his country is working vigilantly to make sure that critical infrastructure is not damaged by, quote, \"Outsiders\". He also says we know who did it, but adds that it's too early to draw conclusions about why. Meantime, in Russia, a secretive factory is ramping up drone production to fuel the air war against Ukraine. Clare Sebastian is following that story for us from London. Clare, we just saw a major drone attack on Christmas Day and more drones fired overnight. You've been looking into how they are managing to sustain this. What have you found out?",

Look, that's all part of a pattern that we've seen Russian drone attacks on Ukraine go up exponentially in recent months, and this is a strategy fueled by a booming defense industry. The German defense minister recently estimated that Russia is outproducing the EU in terms of weapons and ammunition by a factor of four, and that's amid significant challenges, of course, crippling labor shortages made worse by frontline casualties, sanctions.So, we took a look into this drone factory, a really critical part of this ramped up drone offensive, and it offers a window onto how they're doing this, and that includes some pretty creative recruitment strategies. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice-over): The caption \"My mom's reaction when she found out I earn more than her\", cat videos, TikTok memes, all part of a recruitment effort funneling workers into Russia's ever expanding drone program. The videos are made by Alabuga Polytech, a technical college based at the Alabuga Special Economic Zone in southern Russia, the same site identified by the White House last year as Russia's domestic Shahed factory producing Iranian-designed drones. In February, the U.S. slapped sanctions on Alabuga, noting it, quote, \"exploited underage students from an affiliated polytechnic university as laborers to assemble these attack UAVs.\" David Albright, a former nuclear weapons inspector, has been tracking Alabuga since 2022.",

OREST, UKRAINIAN DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE OFFICER (Interpreted): All students involved in the production of these UAVs live at a separate limited access compound. Once employed, they sign NDAs. Their contracts say they produce motor boats. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And yet, as recruitment efforts step up, this video from July allowed the facade to slip. Thinking of starting 10th grade, says the voiceover, joined the super elite program Air Navigation and Drone Programming at Alabuga Polytechnic and help the Stalin's Falcons. That's a new drone unit in the Russian military. Pause here and you see the distinctive serial number of the Russian- produced Shahed and the unit emblem. In July, Russia fired 422 Shahed or similar drones at Ukraine. By November, it was almost six times that, Analysis of Air Force reports and official data show. To meet that demand, Shahed production at Alabuga has more than doubled this year, say CNN sources in Ukraine's defense intelligence. And there is a new product. This is the Gerbera, a much cheaper copy of the Shahed, pictured in a video posted in July by the Stalin's Falcons, that same drone unit.

Then, less than two weeks after that, the country's parliament decided to vote to impeach the President and stripped him of his duties.But, in order for the formal impeachment process to conclude, a Constitutional Court ruling upholding that impeachment vote is necessary, but critically, and here is the problem right now, South Korea's Constitutional Court doesn't have enough judges to issue such a ruling. And it's actually the job, or the responsibility of the acting President Han to fill those remaining spots, fill those vacancies on the country's bench. But, so far, he has refused to do so, leading to this political deadlock we're seeing right now. Now, looking ahead, next in line to serve as the acting President is the country's finance minister. But, South Korea is still far from politically stable. In fact, this turmoil, this political game of musical chairs, if you will, is coming at a very critical time for South Korea. It's preparing for a new Trump administration, and the political instability that South Korea is seeing within its leadership is raising some questions and concerns about how well it can engage in diplomacy and maintain stable U.S.-South Korean ties. And the question that still remains to be answered is, how much longer will this political instability in South Korea last? And that's anybody's guess. Hanako Montgomery, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's according to the hospital's director. CNN has heard audio messages from a nurse and a journalist inside Kamal Adwan Hospital, saying it is surrounded by Israeli forces.

Sara Netanyahu, who has a 2019 conviction for misusing public funds, now faces formal investigation for allegedly intimidating a witness in her husband's corruption trial, as well as indirectly harassing the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General.The allegations were first aired on Israel Channel 12's Uvda (ph) program, the country's equivalent of 60 Minutes. Benjamin Netanyahu decried the report as a new blood libel, calling it biased and false propaganda. The Prime Minister sees it as another strand of what he describes as a witch hunt against him orchestrated by the left-wing media, and which led to him being tried for fraud, breach of trust, and bribery, charges he vehemently denies. Netanyahu asked that his trial be postponed due to the wars with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, but to no avail. In the enclave itself, the Israeli military, on Friday, said it was carrying out targeted operations against what it described as a Hamas terrorist stronghold in and around the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. Hamas has denied that it uses hospitals for military purposes, and the IDF has not offered definitive proof of its claims. Hospital director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, said in a social media post that the IDF was besieging Kamal Adwan and issuing orders for its evacuation. A few hours later, Abu Safiya said the Israeli military was burning all the operating departments in the hospital and had evacuated all displaced people and staff, some of whom he said had been arrested. Smoke could be seen billowing from the building. The IDF said troops had facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients and medical personnel prior to the operation.

So, even in the language that Trump is using, is non-sensical, but he -- like he has gotten, in a way, some results. Canada, just a few days ago, announced that it's going to spend more than about $900 million, in U.S. dollars, to strengthen the border in a bid to fight fentanyl crossing the border and undocumented immigrants. So, I've read that the Canadian government said they were going to do it anyway, but the timing is obvious that they wanted to show their hand to do something, as they're facing a 25 percent tariff threat from the President-elect.",

The makeshift boat carrying 80 people was taking one of the world's deadliest routes in the Atlantic, from points of West Africa to the Canary Islands. An unprecedented number of migrants, nearly 5,000, reportedly died at sea early this year attempting the journey. South Korea's spy agency says a wounded North Korean soldier, who was captured by Ukraine, has died from his injuries. That's according to Yonhap News. The soldier was fighting for Russia. CNN has reached out to South Korea's National Intelligence Service and Ukrainian authorities for comment. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has officially acknowledged the presence of troops from North Korea in Russia. The Chinese military says it has launched its first next-generation amphibious assault ship. The ship is only the second in the world with an electromagnetic catapult system, which enables bigger and more heavily armed aircraft to take off from the flight day. It is a landmark in China's effort to expand its navy to rival U.S. military power.

And coming into today, the S&amp;P 500 was up about 30 percent this year. But, if you were to exclude these Magnificent Seven stocks, it would only be up 13 percent. And as far as what makes them magnificent, well, there is a couple things that they have in common. One, they are all large companies, but two, they're also all AI plays. They are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, and investors believe they will be emerging as among the winners in this AI arms race.

And look, we have seen market concentrations like this in the past, to some extent, including in the late 1990s before the bursting of dotcom bubble and just before COVID. But, that chart shows you that really this level of market concentration has reached unprecedented levels. Goldman Sachs has found that the value of the S&amp;P 500, 10 companies make up 36 percent of the value of the S&amp;P 500, just 10 companies. That is the highest on record going back to the mid-1980s.So, as far as what this means, look, for as long as the AI space stays hot and these companies keep gaining in value, this could really benefit passive investors, everyone who has money on 401(k)s and college saving plans that track the broad market indicators. But, in the long run, it's not really healthy to just have a couple of companies really have to carry the load for the whole market. It would be like an NFL team that can't score without their running back. I mean, what if the running back gets into a slump or gets hurt, right? That's not a recipe for success. And you can see, the market today, the Dow is down 300 points, 0.7 percent. The NASDAQ is actually down two percent. And what is telling is that all seven of the Magnificent Seven stocks are down on the day, led by Tesla, which is down by about four percent or five percent, Nvidia as well. And so, I think this is another reminder of just how much the overall market depends on those seven names, which, again, they're all down in the red. I mean, there is almost no way the market could be up right now, because the Magnificent Seven is down. And so, Isabel, I do think that as we close the books on what has been another really strong year for the stock market, this does expose a potential vulnerability for 2025.

Now in federal custody, Combs was arrested in September after a sprawling federal investigation. He is awaiting trial on numerous charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has pleaded not guilty. Combs is also facing dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activity. Attorneys for Combs deny the claims.
