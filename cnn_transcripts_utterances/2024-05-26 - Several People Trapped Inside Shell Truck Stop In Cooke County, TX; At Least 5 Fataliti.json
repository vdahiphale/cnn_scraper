They'd also argued that financial troubles were not a motive for murder. We've yet to hear from her new attorneys, but we did hear from the family of Eric Richins, and here's the statement that they released. We are never surprised by the rantings of this deranged woman. What she did to her children's father is unforgivable and her complete lack of compassion or empathy for them is deplorable.
