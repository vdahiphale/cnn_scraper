I'm Amara Walker. This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, after more than seven months of war inside Gaza, three European nations say they will recognize a Palestinian State. What does this move by Norway, Ireland, and Spain really mean? And Iran's supreme leader praised over the coffin of the country's late President Ebrahim Raisi as huge crowds filled the streets of Tehran. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is there. Plus, one person has died and more the 100 injured during extreme turbulence on a Singapore Airlines flight. We are live in Bangkok for the latest on the investigation. We begin with an important, but largely symbolic move, which is being hailed by Palestinians and condemned by Israel -- Norway, Ireland, and Spain say they will formally recognize a Palestinian State beginning next week. While Palestinian authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called on other countries to follow suit, Israel is recalling its ambassadors to the three nations in protest. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the move is aimed at accelerating efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas while Norway's prime minister stressed there can be no peace without a two-state solution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONAS GAHR STORE, NORWEGIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Recognition of Palestine is in support of moderate forces that are on a retreating front in a protracted and cruel conflict. This is an investment in the only solution that can bring lasting peace in the Middle East. It is a strong call to other countries to do the same as we are doing today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think this really represents for these countries, Norway, Ireland, and Spain, a real sense of frustration that they are watching events that they can have no influence over, and that by recognizing Palestine State is a way to try to influence that.Powerful, political and symbolic message is how the Irish taoiseach, the prime minister put it. It's been high on his agenda. He is the new prime minister and it's been high on his agenda since he took over in office about a month so ago. He had meetings almost right away with Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish Prime Minister. So, it is an issue that has been rising up the domestic political agendas of these countries and that it's been pushed up there by that real sense of frustration and their vision of what it is going to take to change things.",

The supreme leader really at the beginning of the day, he presided over that funeral ceremony. There were a couple of dignitaries, but also the leadership of Hamas also attending that as well.And then you had that massive crowd of hundreds of thousands of people accompanying those caskets as they were taken through the streets of Tehran, and a lot of the people that we saw there, obviously, were in mourning, were in shock. A lot of them had signs with the pictures of the deceased on them, obviously, wanting to support the deceased and call for helping them. But at the same time, we also did see a lot of people who said that, for them right now, the next big question obviously is how does the Islamic Republic of Iran move forward? Of course, that was definitely something that the supreme leader was also talking about, not just today, but also even while the chopper was missing before it became clear that it had crashed and everybody on board that had been killed, saying that the government of this country, that government services will not be disrupted. And I think that is something that the government really did want to portray here today once again, that on the one hand, you have, of course, the mourning and this entire city, Amara, by the way, is plastered with pictures of those who were killed in that chopper crash. But at the same time, also, they already called for presidential elections that are set to take place on June 28 of this year. So they are trying to move forward with a succession plan, not just of course, for the president of this country, for Ebrahim Raisi, but also for the foreign minister, of course, who has been very important over the past couple of weeks and months, especially in regard to Israel, of course, just talking about Israel before as Israel and Iran nearly came to a full-on war, which of course would have had catastrophic consequences potentially for this entire region. So on the one hand, you do have this deep mourning that took place on the streets of Tehran today. And as you mentioned, will take place most probably tomorrow in Mashhad as well.

In fact, I was actually with Ebrahim Raisi in 2021, shortly after he got elected as president, in Mashhad when he held a political speech at the Imam Reza shrine. So that is where he comes from spiritually. That is where the people who support him, first and foremost, are.So, it would certainly be a homecoming, a tragic one, obviously, because he's been killed, but definitely something where we do expect also big support to be showing there as well, a lot of mourning to also be taking place. Of course, the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad and Mashhad itself so important here for Iran, so that will definitely be a massive event and we do expect a lot of people are going to be coming there and once again, lining the streets, taking part in the procession there as well. But for Ebrahim Raisi, that is really where the support that he had here in this country came from. That is where he came from. That is where his family came from.

Now, what we've seen, for instance, at today's funeral in Tehran, the capital, which is really please sort of the most important of this period of mourning, is that for instance, according to Iranian news agencies, 60 foreign delegations have shown up to participate in these ceremonies. Among them, for instance, Sameh Shoukry who is the Egyptian Foreign Minister, it is the first time that a senior Egyptian official has gone to Tehran since 2012. The Iranians are trying to show that we are not isolated despite the best efforts of the United States and its European allies, that Iran is an important player in the region.And I think everybody would agree that that is the case. So, it is to show that Iran is not a country to be messed with. It is an important regional power, militarily and politically, and that it can stand firm despite this sudden loss of key figures in the government system. Amara?",

We are still waiting for concrete results as to what caused that, but we've heard from a passenger who said that Mr. Kitchen was seated directly behind him when this all happened and that the passengers and healthcare professionals were trying to perform CPR on him in the immediate aftermath.

And again, a reminder of how quickly it all happened.

They did not like Todd Blanche, the president -- former president's lead defense lawyer. They hated Costello. They took the cue from the fact that irritated the judge, they rolled their eyes, they grimaced when he was testifying. And I couldn't read them on Michael Cohen.We'll see on the cross -- we'll see -- that -- that will be key, did they bond with Cohen. I did see some bonding moments on direct (ph). I think there are very serious, good jury. And you're right, we don't know what they're going to do. I do think the prosecution put in proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but it is a close case. There won't be an acquittal. There could be a hung jury, one juror who refuses to go along. And now, over the next couple weeks, we are going to find out the answer to that question.

Thanks so much for your time, sir.And we can get some key updates on another of Donald Trump's legal problems today, the Florida judge in his classified documents case will hold a pair of hearings. Her first public action on the case in more than a month, but rather than moving the case forward, both the hearings are to discuss motions to have the charges dismissed. The case, the federal documents case has been delayed because of a mountain of legal questions yet to be resolved by the judge. CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz is tracking these hearings for us. Hi, Katelyn. So, what are we expecting? What are we watching for from these two hearings in the case today?",

They -- these are all part of the gradual inching toward trial. So, there is lots of requests that the defendants have made to dismiss the case, to toss out whole swaths of evidence, charges, testimony from certain witnesses like Trump's former attorney Evan Corcoran.Judge Aileen Cannon has to look at each of those things. The way she is doing it is she is holding a series of hearings. This is one of only a couple she has on the calendar, stretching out into late July. But today, she is taking up one of the arguments that well, Nauta, the co-defendant of Trump in the obstruction conspiracy to hide the boxes, not return them to the federal government, to move them around. He is arguing that the case should be dismissed because he was vindictively and selectively prosecuted in this case, charge. He believes that he was being retaliated against because he wouldn't provide more information to investigators as they asked him after he had already spoken to them a couple of times. Actually, the Justice Department says, well, we charged him because he lied to us when he spoke to us the first couple of times and then he clammed up. So that is going to be the legal arguments at issue today. We are not necessarily going to hear a ruling, but how Judge Aileen Cannon is handling this case is paramount, right now, because it dictates everything, whether the case will be dismissed, whether parts of it, as Trump wants, could be cut out. And of course, how long it might take to go to trial.",

We'll see what Judge Cannon says. That is going to be a long time for now, when we get to that hearing, and there is no trial date on the schedule and there is, on top of all the things that I'm telling you that we know about and we see the documents on, there is a whole another secret confidential battle going on over the use of classified documents in this case that is also moving very slowly and that we, the media, the public, have very little window into.Right now, the defense is going to have to go document by document through the classified records that they've gotten as potential evidence with Judge Cannon to see if they can use them at trial.
