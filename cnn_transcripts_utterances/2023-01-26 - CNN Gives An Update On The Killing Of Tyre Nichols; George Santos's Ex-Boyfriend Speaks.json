And so, there is some level of justice on the way. So, what are your thoughts? REP. STEVE COHEN (D-TN): I think that the police chief, Davis, who has only been on the job in Memphis about a year and a half, did the right thing unquestionably by firing the individuals promptly. And then District Attorney Mulroy also did the same thing by having them charged with murder, too, as the top charge today. I know U.S. Attorney Kevin Ritz, also new on the job, is looking into this with the Justice Department and the FBI. Memphis has had three new leaders in the last year or year and a half with the director, the D.A., and the U.S. attorney, and they're all outstanding individuals and they have done a great job in working on this case with -- they are involved with their top people and they're working at a real speed that has been unknown, I think, in other cases like this and it has been important to do that.",

Maybe that could be classified some as cowboys.What do you think about the relationship between the police department and the community? EASTER-THOMAS:  I think that this is yet another time in which we are obligated to really reevaluate it. In 2020, the world saw so many examples of unrest across cities and communities, and the same in Memphis. We had plenty of protests and we passed so many legislative resolutions that we thought would prevent a murder such as Tyre Nichols. And so, it's our obligation now to make sure that we are assuring the community that we still are supporting our first responders to protect and serve, but we are also going to hold them accountable and make sure that we have laws and policies in place so that this never happens again in the city of Mephis.",

I call them elephant hunters. These are the guys that go out and do that proactive, pretext stop, probably very minimal supervision. Most of them probably on LAPD would just be on probation, shouldn't even be really working alone, let alone together. And that is why of the five of them, they could not figure out, not one of them, to pull the others off and say that is enough. Somebody should have managed their abusive force.

You know, growing up in Black communities, we have what is called \"jumped out boys\" many times where you have these officers who pulled up in communities that are not really just laden with police regalia. You don't really know who they are. Many times, they abusive. Their interaction with the community is not what it should be.In Atlanta, they were called the \"red dogs\" and there were legendary rap songs about the \"red dogs.\" This was a legendary police group that came in and just brutalized communities and brutalized individuals. I'm not sure that much good comes out of this style of policing, particularly, as we said earlier, when there are not procedures and protocols in place to help keep them in check. You know, to answer your question earlier, and I think we're going to have this discussion over the next three, four, five days about five Black officers, for me, it doesn't matter if the officers are Black, white, purple. It really doesn't matter. This is about systemic racism. Let's be extremely clear. This is about systems in this country which perpetuate violence and oppression against people of color. And so, whether or not you are Black, white or other within these systems, we have to deconstruct the systems and reimagine what they look like. These officers happened to be Black and they were perpetuating the system of injustice whereby Black folks are not given the benefit of their humanity. And until we actually tackle the systems because -- let me just say that a lot of people think racism is only when somebody calls you nigger. And that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about systems that perpetuate this type of oppression, this type violence, and this type of lack of dignity towards Black bodies.",
