They were shot down over the Red Sea in the Middle East by an American warship in an apparent case of friendly fire. The U.S. Central Command says both of the pilots flying an FA-18 jet like this one safely ejected from their fighter jet after being mistakenly fired upon by the guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg. An investigation is underway. Joining me right now is CNN correspondent Julia Benbrook at the White House. Julia, what more do we know?",

But U.S. Central Command is calling this an apparent friendly fire incident.Two U.S. Navy pilots were ejected safely after their fighter jet was shot down over the Red Sea on Saturday. An initial assessments show that one crew member did sustain minor injuries. Now, according to CentCom, the aircraft, an FA-18 was operating from the USS Harry S. Truman when it was mistakenly fired upon by the USS Gettysburg. The USS Gettysburg, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser, is a part of the Truman carrier strike group which entered the waters of the Middle East one week ago. Now, as I mentioned, this investigation is ongoing, but CNN military analyst and Retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton detailed the types of questions that could be asked in an investigation like this, including what the sailors on the USS Gettysburg saw, what they believed was coming toward them, and why they fired. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: When you are in a zone like this where there is combat happening at one end of the Red Sea, and then there are other flight patterns that the folks on the USS Gettysburg, the sailors on the USS Gettysburg, have to deal with, it can be pretty easy to mistake targets from one to the other. In other words, is one a friendly target, or is one an adversarial or a potential adversarial target. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, those strikes did involve the use of a Navy FA-18 fighter jet.

He spoke earlier today at a conservative event in Arizona where President-Elect Trump just finished speaking. And during that speech, Trump, among other things, said the U.S. should control the Panama Canal. CNN's Brian Abel has more on the Gaetz report.

Secondly, there's going to be a race on about whether or not the Russians will be allowed to keep their air base and their naval base in Syria. And I think you could see a bit of a bidding war to try to make sure by the United States that they don't have that option. That's, of course, Russia's main way to have access to the Mediterranean and to refuel its planes. And the U.S. has got a deep interest in making sure they're denied that access.

      "sentences": "All right. This week, the Federal Reserve dropped interest rates by another quarter of a point, marking the third cut this year and next year, the Fed suggests we could only see two more interest rate cuts. It might even be inclined to hold rates steady, since inflation remains stubbornly above the central banks 2 percent target.So what does all of this mean if you're hoping to buy a house next year? Let's discuss with Danielle Hale, chief economist with realtor.com. Danielle, good to see you. So what do you make of the Fed's expected pace of rate cuts being slower next year? How does it help anyone who's in the market of buying a home? DANIELLE HALE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, REALTOR.COM: Good to see you too, Fredricka. I think that's a really important question and one that's not terribly surprising to see the fed pull back on its expectations for cuts, even before the Fed's meeting on Wednesday, the market was largely expecting fewer rate cuts as we moved into 2025 and 2026. What's interesting is that when the Fed said now, probably only two rate cuts in 2025, the market actually decided to move a little bit ahead of the Fed. So, now, the market is expecting more like one and a half. It's going to push rates up in the near term. But I think ultimately the reason the Fed is doing this is to make sure that it can get inflation under control, and that we'll see rates go back to a declining trend for the long run. As they get back to what might be a long run average.",

So how does one plan their 2025 if they really want to buy a home, where should they be putting their priorities into, you know, trying to come up with more in their down payment because interest rates are likely to still be a little high or just simply acknowledge that, you know, their monthly mortgage is going to be more than they had bargained for.",

We expect them to go up a little bit further next year.Mortgage rates remain high, so it is going to be expensive, so you need to be prepared to put a little bit more of your budget towards your mortgage payment or, as you suggested, potentially raise your down payment to lower the amount of money you need to borrow. That's not an option for everyone, though, and I think it is important that buyers are aware that not everyone actually puts 20 percent down and there are lots of loan products out there that enable people to buy a home with less than 20 percent down. So but, obviously, with rates high, that does raise the cost. And so you want to be very financially prepared. Make sure you're thinking about what that means for your budget. Think about things maybe you can live without. And that can bring down the home price that you're looking for and help keep those monthly costs better in line with your budget.",

We expect the number of homes that are for sale in 2025 to go up by almost 12 percent, so that's going to help usher in more balance between buyers and sellers.We've seen the money supply so low over the last few years that we've been in sellers' market territory all the way back to 2016, 2025. We expect that to be the first full year where buyers and sellers have better bargaining power. Their power is more matched, and that's going to help give buyers a little bit more negotiating room at the table. It should lead to longer times on market and potentially some negotiation over prices, which is why we expect price growth to continue, but at a slower pace than what we've seen recently.",

But I think it is important to note that if you do choose that this is not the year for you. Rents are expected to hold roughly stable, so that might help you save up a little bit more to boost your down payment and home transaction fund. So that can be a good thing.It can also give you a chance to test out what a higher mortgage payment might mean. You can set aside those extra funds and build up your down payment fund very, very quickly. That can be another good option, but ultimately you can you can run the numbers. I think for a lot of households, the amount of time you're going to be in your next home, which is not always a known factor, but the longer you expect to be there, the more likely it is that buying will be, the better financial move, the shorter you expect to stay in your next home, the more likely it is that renting is, the better financial move.",
