And the basis for that, that he's offered up this company seems to have very little backing it. So, the first question I would have would be, how did he get this money? The second question would be, was he engaged in fraud? Did he make false statements to the FEC, to the House itself in his disclosure forms?Because if you intentionally make a false statement about your assets or anything else that matters, that too, could be a Federal False statement is a crime. So, I think they're going to start with that. And also, there's a possibility that he tried to evade federal a fight campaign finance laws by funneling his own money, sort of to his own company. So, those are three areas that I think the feds are going to be interested in.",

And while those cities struggle, our next guest says politicians on both sides of the aisle are using the Trump-era policy to flaunt an aggressive stance on the border without providing any coherent immigration policy.Joining me now is Zolan Kanno-Youngs. He is a White House correspondent for The New York Times. His new piece is. This is not about the pandemic anymore: Public Health Law is embraced as a border band-aid. Zolan, appreciate you joining me this morning. So, you've write, Democrats and Republicans have largely conceded Title 42 is not about public health concerns anymore. Instead, they're using it as a negotiating chip. How so? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, they're certainly not acting like it's about public health or mentioning it in the context of public health. Real quick, just to give some context here. I've been writing about this policy since the Trump administration implemented it back in March of 2020. And even then, there were doubts -- many had doubts that it was strictly -- the motivation was strictly about curtailing the pandemic. Stephen Miller, the architect of the Trump administration's anti- immigration policies, had tried to implement Title 42, which is a public health law, previously as well to try and restrict migration at the border for different outbreaks of various thicknesses, and was tucked down by various cabinet secretaries. So, there was already sort of a history of them reaching for this policy, then being the Trump administration reaching for this policy to try and achieve some of the goals that they had to seal the border to asylum seekers. But at that point, you had Democrats, including those on the Hill that really did criticize the use of this public health authority to achieve immigration goals. But a lot of time has passed now. You're now seeing that some Democrats that face tight midterm elections, actually were criticizing the Biden administration's belated attempt to lift Title 42. That includes Raphael Warnock who was saying it was necessary for border security, not mentioning public health. That includes as well in Nevada. You had Democrats there as well defending this policy, not really mentioning it in the context of public health. Even recently, you saw when there was a framework that was being worked on between Senator Kyrsten Sinema as well as Senator Tillis, a bipartisan framework. They were working on almost a trade- off to extend Title 42 in order to establish a pathway to citizenship to legalization for DACA dreamers. Again, regardless of what side you fall on, on that deal, or Title 42, it really wasn't mentioned in the context of public health. So, what you're seeing is Democrats and Republicans sort of dropping the guise of this being in the context of the pandemic at this point, and really using it either as a negotiation chip for immigration deals in Congress or to try and show voters or flaunt a certain aggressive stance in the void of any actual coherent policy at the border.",

I did some reporting on this just in the past couple of weeks and talk to an official that said that some of the plans still had yet to be finalized at this point for once this is lifted. Look, you have to understand as well, that Title 42 and immigration have been a source of division within the White House, that for especially in year one, choosing the pace of which to unwind it and what to replace it with. Really sparked divisions and confusion in the White House. So, we'll have to see what they plan going forward in the months ahead.",
