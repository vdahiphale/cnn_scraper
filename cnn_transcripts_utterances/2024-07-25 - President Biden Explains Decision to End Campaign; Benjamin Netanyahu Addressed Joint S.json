      "sentences": "Well, the Israeli prime minister certainly struck a bipartisan tone, as he sought to shore up support for Israel during his remarks to Congress. The Israeli prime minister thanking both President Biden as well as former president Trump for their support for Israel. He also sought to kind of bring the U.S. into Israel's war against Hamas, saying, our enemies are your enemies, our fight is your fight, especially as he sought to broaden Israel's war against Hamas as a battle against Iran at the end of the day.And the Israeli prime minister, as he was trying to do all of this, he was also defending Israeli military conduct in Gaza, and he was doing so not always by sticking to the facts. The Israeli prime minister at one point tried to claim that there were practically no casualties, no civilian casualties during the Israeli military campaign in Rafah. That's simply not true. I can think of several strikes in Rafah that did indeed results in civilian casualties. He also tried to portray overall the Israeli military's fight in Gaza as one that has among the lowest civilian casualty rates in the world, citing -- the one expert that he cited on this issue, a man named John Spencer at West Point, who is a total outlier as it relates to this issue. The majority of experts on this issue including former U.S. generals say that the way the Israeli military is fighting in Gaza, the extent to which it is minimizing civilian casualties is nowhere close to what the United States has done in multiple conflicts around the world, including conflicts were the U.S. itself has acknowledged that it simply did not do as well as it could have in terms of defending civilians. Now overall, the Israeli prime minister addressed a number of different audiences in this speech. He made nods to the families of the hostages, to a former hostage, Noa Argamani, who was in attendance at his speech, vowing to bring all of the hostages home. He also vowed to destroy Hamas, and it was clear that despite that nod to the hostages, it was that issue of continuing to fight in Gaza until victory that kept on coming up again and again. The Israeli prime minister vowing we will fight until we achieve victory. And what he's certainly didn't do was say that he is on the verge of reaching a ceasefire agreement and that's very notable because his focus, his emphasis on victory, on fighting until victory certainly doesn't sound like a man who is on the verge of signing a ceasefire agreement. Now it's possible, of course, that he could be trying to mollify his right-wing allies, his right-wing base in Israel before taking that step. But it's also possible that as we have wondered over the course of the last couple of weeks, whether or not the Israeli prime minister is actually committed to a ceasefire deal that perhaps he does not intend to sign a deal at all. We do know, though, that an Israeli delegation is set to depart to meet with the mediators and submit Israel's latest response. That trip, however, has been delayed. It was expected to happen on Thursday. It now likely won't happen until Sunday after the Israeli prime minister first meets with President Biden on Thursday. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv.
