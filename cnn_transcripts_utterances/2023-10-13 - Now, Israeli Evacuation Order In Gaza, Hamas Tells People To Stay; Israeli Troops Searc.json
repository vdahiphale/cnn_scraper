Hamas telling Palestinians to stay put, while U.N. officials call the evacuation impossible and warn of, quote, devastating humanitarian consequences.As more of Gaza is reduced to rubble, the Israeli military reveals it has been conducting local raids there and searching for hostages held by Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel's nearly week- long response to the Hamas terror is just the beginning, as the region braces for a potential ground invasion. Tonight, we are also learning more about the lead-up to the war, sources now telling CNN that U.S. intelligence warned of the potential for a conflict in Gaza in the days before Israel was attacked. We are also following breaking news on the struggle to elect a new speaker of the paralyzed U.S. House of Representatives. Republicans nominating hardliner Jim Jordan, after their initial choice, Steve Scalise, dropped out. Jordan's prospects in a full House vote are very uncertain this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You are in THE SITUATION ROOM. There is certainly a lot happening in the Israeli-Hamas war tonight, with the crisis in Gaza clearly escalating and Israel possibly on the brink of a major ground invasion. Our team is covering all the breaking news in the region as well as here in the United States. Let's begin with Erin Burnett. She's live in Tel Aviv for us. Erin, the IDF confirmed today they have been carrying out raids in Gaza as Israel is telling more than 1 million civilians in Gaza to evacuate.",

That seemed to be over by the time that they announced it, when they said they had done that.And, by the way, Wolf, still you have skirmishes and incidents on the Israeli side of the Gaza border. When you get to checkpoints, you see some of those are happening. Today, an IDF soldier told me that late last night, they had gone into a house, in a kibbutz, the doors were locked. They say, why the doors locked? Everything here is burned or destroyed. It turns out, as they opened the doors, Special Forces, there were still Hamas terrorists inside who threw a grenade out injuring three IDF forces. So, they do believe that there are still Hamas terrorists, some of them possibly in on Israeli side, as well as the tunnels, whether others could come through, and there are those raids already in Gaza which could presage a broader ground invasion.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we've been told by sources familiar with the intelligence that there were intelligence warnings and indications that there could be an attack by Hamas from Gaza but nothing on the level of what we saw last weekend.We have been told that in the days prior to last Saturday, October 7th, there were three distinct pieces of intelligence, two American, one Israeli, the first on September 28th. That was a report that indicated that there could be a cross-border Hamas attack using rockets. And then a couple of days later, on October 5th, a broader CIA wire that talked about the growing possibility of a Hamas attack. And then, Wolf, just one day before the attacks last weekend, there was an Israeli report that was disseminated among U.S. officials that indicated that there was something unusual about Hamas behavior. And then, of course, we know what happened the next day. But, again, those three intelligence reports, Wolf, did not speak at all to the scope of what we ended up seeing, the brutality, the lethality, the fact that Hamas militants were able to break through the wall and fly over the wall and carry out those massacres. So, sources are telling us now that the sense was that if something were to happen, that it would possibly have looked like what we have seen in the past. That's why there was not that much alarm, that maybe there would be a flurry of salvos of rockets flying out of Gaza, that they would be intercepted by the Iron Dome, that Israel could respond and there could be several days of fighting, but certainly, nothing on that level. We did hear from an administration official who told us there was no information warning about the terrorist attack in advance. So, the sense that we are getting, Wolf, from officials both here in Washington and in Israel as well, is that they thought that if something were to happen, that it wouldn't be nearly as big as what we saw last weekend, and that there was a general sense of complacency that had set in, in Israel. And, now there are growing questions of, everything that we knew, this series of warnings, plus warnings, I should say, from allied Middle Eastern countries, both to the U.S. and to Israel, whether there shouldn't -- whether there really was the appropriate sense of what could happen in Israel.

We want to warn our viewers, some of the footage you're about to see is very graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  As dawn breaks in Gaza, now under bombardment from Israel just for seven days, a sinister warning from the skies. Pamphlets from Israel Defense Forces telling all citizens in northern Gaza to evacuate southwards. We're seeing our children killed right in front of us. They're starving us of food, of water. We have no electricity, nothing. This is not a life. And now they tell us that we have to leave, and we don't know where we will end up. Hamas leaders have called on civilians to remain steadfast and stay put, accusing Israel of engaging in psychological warfare. But families desperate for some semblance of security gather their belongings. And while they are unsure of what awaits them in the south, one thing is clear. There is no guarantee of safety wherever you are in Gaza. It happened to our grandfathers, and now it is happening to us. We are being forced out. Gaza is being destroyed. Nothing is left. It's a catastrophe. More than 2 million people live in a tiny besieged Gaza Strip, still under a blockade enforced by Israel in 2007. More than half of those are now being told to move. The Norwegian Refugee Council has characterized the evacuation order, which holds no guarantee of safe return as an act of forcible transfer. In other words, a war crime. Meanwhile, the U.N.'s Refugee Agency for Palestine says that the scale and speed of the unfolding humanitarian crisis is bone chilling.",

We mustremember that Gaza has been under this closure for 16 years. People have been under occupation for more than a half century. Eighty percent of the population relies on humanitarian aid, 70 percent of the population are refugees, denied the rights to return to their homes.

The reality is the crimes committed by Hamas were heinous, taking hostages, deliberately targeting civilians. Those are war crimes. But to punish the entire people of Gaza over the actions of individuals, that's collective punishment. That is a textbook war crime.
