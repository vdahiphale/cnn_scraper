Idalia is threatening Georgia and the Carolinas, weaker but still a severe threat after unleashing its full and catastrophic impact on Florida's Gulf Coast. We are standing by for an update from Florida officials on the scope of the hurricane devastation and emergency operations now unfolding all across the disaster zone.The danger is ongoing in Florida tonight, amid flooding and hurricane damage from Tampa to Tallahassee. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer off. I'm Alex Marquardt and you're in The Situation Room. We are standing by for an urgent update from the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, on the hurricane disaster all along the state's Gulf Coast, this as Hurricane Idalia was just weakened into a tropical storm. But it is still packing a punch as it takes aim at Georgia and South Carolina. CNN correspondents are on the scene covering Idalia's devastation in Florida and the storm's assault on Georgia happening right now. But, first, let's go to CNN's John Berman in the city of Perry, where some of the worst damage from Idalia has been reported. John, you just got there. What have you seen so far?",

RON DESANTIS (R-FL)As of 6:00 today, there are approximately 250,000 power outages reported across the state since the storm hit. Their power has been restored to approximately 315,000. And that 250,000 number is actually a decline from what it was a few hours ago. So, we appreciate the rapid attention to restoring power. Clearly, the area that has the most significant percentage outages are those Big Bend counties that bore the brunt of the storm, counties like Columbia, Madison, Dixie, and people are (INAUDIBLE). There's no shortage of fuel. We have more than enough fuel in the state of Florida. If you're at a gas station that's not pumping it, largely, it's probably going to be a power issue. Those that have generators can get that back up or when the power is restored. But there is an abundance of fuel, and we made sure to have that gone ready to go. Florida Department of Transportation has 224 cut and toss crews. They've been working to clear the roadways. The Cedar Key Bridge has officially been cleared by FDOT and residents, first responders and law enforcement can now pass. Residents should follow the guidance of the local emergency and law enforcement personnel in terms of any type of restrictions that may be on that. But the bridge has been cleared by the state. All state bridges at this point have also been cleared. There is a 15 mile stretch of Interstate-10 that is closed in Madison County. But FDOT is working on that to have that back online by tonight. We have all resources -- have been deployed from Urban Search and Rescue Teams, the Florida National Guard, the Coast Guard, the Florida State Guard, Florida Fish and Wildlife. Those are going to continue until there's no help needed. In terms of hospitals, in rural areas that received direct impacts, the facilities remain operational and open to the public. And we're happy that they were able to do that. Throughout the state, there were ten evacuated hospitals. They reported minimal damage and nine to the ten will be at full operational status within the next 24 hours. And ACA is working with the one remaining, but we don't think it's going to take too much longer after that. After the storm, agency for health care assessment teams must inspect all evacuated healthcare facilities which have sustained damage before they can reopen and they are in the process of making assessments for all evacuated healthcare facilities. [18:05:10] Our Florida Department of Veterans Affairs assisted one of Florida's federally operated V.A. hospitals with safely transferring veterans prior to the hurricane, and we appreciate Florida DVA for stepping up. And that schools, 30 of the 52 school districts that closed due to the storm, will reopen tomorrow and an additional eight school districts will reopen on Friday. And Manny Diaz is calling through the remaining school districts to try to get them open as soon as possible. We appreciate everybody's hard work. It's been a lot going on over these last few days. There's a lot to do. But I think the quick response is helping everybody get back on their feet. Okay, we're going to hear from some of the folks who have been involved in different areas of this response starting with Kevin Guthrie from Florida DEM.",

He talked about those who are still without power, some 250,000 residents, but that number has actually -- that number has actually gone down.316,000 residents had had their power restored, the governor going on to say that all of the bridges in the state have now been cleared.

This is the awning at Roady's Truck Stop blown over by the hurricane, which passed directly overhead here. It made landfall as a Category 3, about 18 miles from here on the coast, passed directly overhead. With winds, it must have been 105, 110 miles an hour, and you can see the damage that it did to the truck stop.All around here, all kinds of trees are down. It was a small storm in terms of its size, so the path of destruction fairly narrow. But in that path, you see the exploded trees, trees that just don't exist anymore, they're just shredded. You see power lines down, telephone poles ripped out of their foundations, and we saw road crews out there, getting those telephone poles and getting those wires back up. And Governor DeSantis is right, the gas stations, from Tallahassee to here, most of the gas stations, we saw, were pumping gas again. It's interesting, I was speaking to Senator Rubio earlier today, and he said he praised the National Weather Service for how accurate these forecasts have become and how much that helped prepare for this. The forecast for the last five days has almost been exactly where this storm made landfall, so they were ready there, and they've been ready here inland to get this recovery going as soon as they were able. That is what they're doing now. Power is still out in some places, but people absolutely, moving about, getting the trees out of the road, getting the leaves up off their lawn, and they're ready to get back to work, Alex.",

So, the power of the storm has really gone down.Something, though that, Governor DeSantis talked about that hasn't been addressed yet, there is a 15-mile stretch of Interstate-10 that is closed between Tallahassee and Lake City, both directions. There's so much debris on the roadway, so many trees down that the roadway is still closed. Traveling across east and west across Northern Panhandle or the Big Bend area of Florida is virtually at a standstill right now. People are trying to take back roads. I'm looking at Google Earth, those back roads are all colored red, which means that the traffic is horrible there too. So maybe put that off for a day until the road crews can get that weather related tree damage down and out of the way so that we can actually get this back opened up. What's going on right now, the storm is no longer hurricane, but it will still cause some beach erosion here. There's also the potential for some tornadoes. I believe Litchfield Beach area, especially west of Litchfield Beach, may have had a tornado on the ground. I saw some debris in the air near the rotation, but I cannot find any pictures on the internet at all of any significant damage, maybe just tree limbs, maybe just leaves that were picked up by a small little spin up. And that's what we can expect today, small little spin ups. But if they're near your house, they don't seem small. So, here are the storms as they come on shore. There's a North Myrtle Beach right there seeing a pretty healthy little storm system come on shore. I would have red boxes on here if there were tornado warnings, and there are not. It doesn't mean though that you shouldn't get out of the way of these. There will certainly be lightning and still a little bit of wind from these outer bands. And, yes, almost 500,000 customers without power here in parts of Florida, Georgia, and even South Carolina combined right now. Power lines are going back up, winds are coming down. That means the trucks can get with their buckets back up and put those lines back up. But it will take some time for those one or two or three customers that are way out on the end of the line that could still take weeks. There's your rainfall across parts of the Carolinas. That could cause some flooding. I'm really worried about that after dark. You can't see that the road is flooded and you drive into it. So, be careful tonight with that as well. Alex?",

What it has allowed us to do is now that the bridge is open, Cedar Key, we immediately in the Yankeetown, an (INAUDIBLE), which also was heavily hit. We began search and rescue fairly quickly after the storm passed today in those areas with my deputies and their skiffs and their airboats. And we were able to rescue a few people that had stayed there. You know, we're fortunate today that both Cedar Key and the Yankeetown area have only been made aware of two very, very minor injuries. And I think those were from falls of those that had stayed in and in their homes with water coming into their homes. But Cedar Key is a resilient community. We've been through many of these storms and, actually, in reality, even though we had the historic storm surge today, that they're resilient. It hit a lot of our businesses, a lot of our homes in Cedar Key but they will come back and they already are. They're working hard. We have some extra help in our Florida Sheriffs Association Task Force is amazing in Florida as a sheriff. We share together and help each other out. We have a group of about 40 special office deputies from Polk County, from Sheriff Judd's county, with us to help both in security and in further search and rescue and even some of the cleanup that we'll be doing fairly immediately.

The folks here really heeded the warnings and got out of the way because they were concerned that this storm was going to bring a lot of water to this area. And to take you back this direction, as we walk toward the river itself, you can see businesses have really prepared their sandbags all along this area to make sure that the water that they were expecting from the river didn't go in these businesses. And we've talked to people who worked around here their entire lives. They were concerned about the water and the storm surge. They've been seeing what's been going on in Florida. The one thing they did do was they closed the port, which is out here, and they shut down the bridges, which is just over there. So, that's been shut down since 2:00. We've also been told the airport, all flights have been canceled. But everybody's sort of wondering whether or not at 7:00 the rain and the winds are going to come in. Honestly, Alex, look at what we're dealing with right now. There's barely any wind and the water looks so calm out here. This is the calmest we've seen the water. So, I can tell you people have been cheering at the fact that they've seen this hurricane sort of break up. They're hoping the worst is past this area.

Alex, she told me she's never seen the water come up this high and certainly not on this street. So, here in Crystal River, they've done several water rescues, people who have had to be evacuated from their homes, the local fire department deploying airboats to the area. Once you get over to that way, the water begins to recede, but it's been just really rapidly shifting with every passing hour as the tide moves in and out. And some more of this water comes in.

And I asked Senator McConnell after that July incident, whether this incident here, his freezing moment back in Capitol Hill, had anything to do with that fall back in March. He would not say at that time other than the fact that he is feeling fine. And, Alex, that's what his office is also saying. They're saying he is feeling fine and trying to indicate that he's still moving ahead with the schedule, Alex.",

He's had difficulty clearly hearing reporters' questions, going back to earlier in the summer.He fell again in July. He's had significant falls in the past where he's dislocated his shoulder. And then -- then most recently, these, quote/unquote, freezing episodes. But again, I want to emphasize this is what we see, you know, just as we were talking about, that the aides are not that surprised by this. His doctors may not be surprised by this either. These types of things may be happening more often. This may be something they're aware of. Again, for example, a Parkinsonian-like syndrome, once the medication start to wear off, you could have a period of freezing. It gets better when you take your medications, and, you know, someone will soon very lucid again and have no problems, but again, it is a long list that can cause these types of symptoms.",

We left right after the rains cleared.And on the roads, as you get closer here to Perry, and Perry the storm passed right overhead here, we saw trees down all along the roadway. We saw awnings at restaurants ripped apart, a McDonald's awning that was smashed. And then ultimately, we got here to Perry. And like I said, the storm made landfall in Keaton Beach, 18 miles south of here on the coast, and passed directly overhead. In Perry, you can see the McDonald's sign there, passed directly overhead. When it came over Perry, it was about 85 miles per hour and caused all kinds of damage, telephone poles twisted there, pulled off their mounts and like I said, lots of tree damage, lots and lots of tree damage. Ultimately, we found this gas station where I'm standing right now, a truck stop actually. It's Rodie's (ph) truck stop. And the diesel station where the trucks drive through just was ripped up, completely ripped up and pushed over with the -- I can't get over the bricks, just the brick work and the twisted metal pulled off its foundations and now leaning completely on its side. You can see the force of even the 85-mile-an-hour winds how damaging that can be. And I think it's important to remember, as we've been saying now for a full day, the wind damage wasn't the real problem from Hurricane Idalia. It wasn't the winds or the rains, per se. It was the storm surge a little bit south of here that was potentially devastating and record-breaking. And those fishing communities, which are much more sparsely populated than Perry, where I am right now, which is about 7,000 people, down by the water, you're talking about several hundred people. But those fishing communities are dealing with the cleanup from that enormous storm surge, and that will take some time, Alex.",

You have some folks who are trying to move their case to federal court. You have other people like Ken Chesebro and Sidney Powell who are saying, we want to move ahead on this speedy trial timeline, we're ready to go to trial essentially in October. And then you have the Trump team that's been very adamant in their filings so far that they have no interest in trying to go to trial in this case in October, and would fight any effort by the judge to make them do so.
