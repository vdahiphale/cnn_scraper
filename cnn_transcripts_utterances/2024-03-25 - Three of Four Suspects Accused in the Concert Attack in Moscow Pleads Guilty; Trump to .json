Our thanks to Clare Sebastian joining us live from London.In the coming hours, Donald Trump will have two major legal threats colliding in New York, the critical deadline to pay a massive bond in his civil fraud case, as well as a possible new trial date for his delayed criminal hush money case. CNN's Zachary Cohen has the latest on both cases from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER: If Donald Trump cannot secure a bond in his multimillion dollar civil fraud judgment against him by Monday's deadline, he could see the New York attorney general start the process of seizing his assets. That's things like his bank accounts, things like his properties, all things that Donald Trump does not want to see prosecutors take away from him. But look, Trump personally owes over $450 million as a result of this judgment. He has indicated and claimed that he has enough cash to pay that to support a bond. In that case, his lawyers have corrected him saying, no, he does not have that amount of cash on hand. But ultimately, if he cannot put up the money to postpone by Monday's deadline, that is when you could see the attorney general start to eye other things to make up for that cost. And look, experts say that prosecutors have already taken some steps to potentially signal that they are going to move to seize some of Trump's assets and properties in New York should he be unable to post that bond on Monday. Those are things like one of his golf courses in New York and another private estate that he has there. And at the same time, Donald Trump is also expected in court as proceedings continue as part of his New York criminal case. Now, this case deals with the hush money payments that were allegedly made to porn star Stormy Daniels. These were payments allegedly made to cover up an affair between Daniels and Trump prior to the 2016 election. This trial, this case was supposed to go to trial. The trial was supposed to start on Monday. But instead, we're gonna have another pretrial hearing. This is where Trump's attorneys will try to postpone a trial for as long as possible. They will argue that discovery issues require further delay. The district attorney's office in New York has argued that no further delay is needed. So ultimately, we're gonna have to see if a judge in this case could give more insight and more detail about a possible trial start date. It's already been delayed through at least mid-April. But it's possible the judge sides with the D.A.'s office and gives us a trial date in New York before the 2024 election. Zachary Cohen, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

[03:09:53] CHURCH: So in the hours ahead, Donald Trump faces two major legal threats. First, a deadline for the posting of that $464 million bond in his New York fraud case and also a possible hush money trial date. So let's consider the first. What happens if Trump is unable or perhaps unwilling to secure that bond and what decision might the appeals court make about whether Trump has to post this bond or perhaps a smaller amount?",

The defendant's financial resources, the potential harm to the plaintiff or the defendant and the public interest. So we either keep things as they are or he has to post a bond. If he has to post a bond and does not, then the question is what. So the collection process may then get started and it is immediately enforceable. Steps have already been taken by the attorney general in New York to place lien and start a collection process. So there will be immediate consequences and impact on his finances, the former president's finances, brand and any effect also on his credit rating. The course of action on the part of Letitia James, the attorney general, would be to move against as liquid assets as possible. That is the lowest hanging fruit such as financial accounts, bank or other financial assets. And then as we have read in various sources, she may move to seize some of his real estate properties.",

And what I hear from Israeli officials is that this could take between, I don't know, a day to three days, because those details need to go from Hamas representatives in Doha who are negotiating to the person who really calls the shots. And this is Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar in Gaza, who is in a bunker some hundred feet under the ground. So this takes a long time until the message gets to him and until he gets the message back.(END VIDEO CLIP) CHURCH: Meantime, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is expected to meet Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant at the White House in the coming hours. An official says they will discuss the urgent need for more humanitarian aid to reach desperate civilians in Gaza and efforts to get the remaining hostages held in the enclave released. CNN's Kevin Liptak has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: This week is shaping up to be a critical one, not just in terms of the trajectory of the war in Gaza, but also as a major test of American influence on the Israelis as this conflict proceeds. And what you'll see this week is two very senior level delegations coming from Israel to Washington to meet with top Biden administration officials. The defense secretary from Israel left Sunday and plans to meet Monday with senior members of President Biden's team, including the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, also the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and the Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Those discussions are expected to center around Israel's weapons needs as it continues to go after Hamas in Gaza. And then later in this week, you'll see a separate delegation led by Ron Dermer, a top confidant to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss the situation in Rafah. That's the southern city in Gaza that Israel says is necessary to invade, to launch a ground invasion, to go after Hamas. And that has certainly caused a lot of consternation here at the White House, certainly a lot of concerns about the 1.4 million Palestinian civilians who are sheltering there. What President Biden and his top officials have said is that Israel should not proceed with that ground invasion before they come up with a credible plan to protect those civilians. And the White House says it hasn't seen such a plan yet. And you'll remember last week, President Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu and told him to dispatch this delegation here to hear American alternatives to a ground invasion. Now, since then, Netanyahu has really doubled down on those plans and said that, in fact, it is necessary for the IDF to go into Rafah on the ground to root out Hamas. And certainly that has caused a great deal of concern among President Biden's team, including the Vice President Kamala Harris, who spoke about the situation in Rafah in an interview this weekend. Listen to what she said. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: We have been clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any major military operation in Rafah would be a huge mistake. Let me tell you something. I have studied the maps. There's nowhere for those folks to go. And we're looking at about a million and a half people in Rafah who are there because they were told to go there, most of them. And so we've been very clear that it would be a mistake to move into Rafah with any type of military operation. RACHEL SCOTT, ABC NEWS SR.

You also hear calls for President Biden to increase diplomatic pressure on Israel.So whether or not those consequences, that response comes up in the meetings this week, certainly remains to be seen.

Nearly 300 were initially reported as being held captive, but the Nigerian government insists that all of the children are now safe. [03:45:06] The state's governor says he met with the families of the children, and the students will be hosted at an official dinner on Monday, but added that one teacher had died after developing complications while in captivity. Joining us now is CNN's David McKenzie in Johannesburg. So, David, what is the latest on these kidnapped school children in Nigeria now released? DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well Rosemary, you look at these images of the children who were basically paraded in front of the governor on Sunday. This is a very good moment for the families of those who've been agonizingly waiting for more than two weeks to get word of what happened to their children. A few weeks ago, you had these gunmen on motorbikes coming early in the morning, a lot of them, in fact, to take on this primary and secondary school and take away more than 100 children. And this is a chronic issue in the part of northwestern Nigeria, Kaduna State. Now, according to the government, this was a search and rescue operation. They found the children in a neighboring state, at least more than 100 miles away. But there were talk from the loved ones of those children who were abducted, saying that they had been reached out to by the bandits, as they called in Nigeria, and that a more than $600,000 ransom had been asked for. The government is denying that any ransom was paid, but they did say this was a successful operation to get those children back, Rosemary.",

Some of those girls are still in captivity.But this is a chronic problem that speaks to the lack of security and governance in large parts of the northern and northwestern parts of Nigeria. Successive presidents have promised that they will figure this issue out. But as we've seen in recent weeks, just a few days before these children were taken from their school in the morning hours, there was another incident in the northeast of Nigeria where more than 200 people were kidnapped. Those people haven't been returned. And again, despite the promises of the government and themselves and them congratulating themselves for getting these children back, there is no sense that this chronic issue has been addressed. And more than 1,400 students, it's believed, have been kidnapped since those 10 years ago where the world was shocked by those Chibok girls taken. Rosemary?",
