Police have been asking for any relevant surveillance footage over the past few days.In fact, this flyer was sent out around the community in the last few days. And it does ask for anyone's security camera footage or video doorbell footage between the hours of 05:00 p. m. on Saturday, November 12 and 12:00 p. m. on Sunday the 13th. And of course, in between those hours is when we know these four people were killed. Now, this is a press conference where people are really hoping for more concrete information, but I'm being told this is a chance for police to kind of explain their process as well. What is happening in the course of the investigation without a whole bunch of details? There are unfortunately have been a number of rumors swirling out there that they've had to dispel, and one of the families of one of the victims, Kaylee Goncalves spoke to CNN this morning about that issue. Here they are. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But just this department as a whole, I think the chair proctor in Camden County, I mean, frankly speaking, I'm tired of having to go down and do civil rights cases in little Camden County, Georgia. There is a problem there.As I stated in a press conference, it's exhausting being black and having to deal with law enforcement in Camden County. And so we hope the full weight of the investigative body at the Department of Justice comes and looks at that place from top to bottom. I mean, if you look at Mr. Hobbs' incident, Victor, what I want people to realize is not only did they beat him and assault him, but then they lied about it. They communicated those lies trying to get him more time to the United States Probation Office. I mean, this is something that is readily allowed. This is systemic --",
