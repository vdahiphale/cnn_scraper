And I think that really depends on how that goes. Its really going to set up the situation for House Democratic, Senate Democrats coming up next week in the White House is responsible. Again, the campaign has been keeping the same talking points, you know, say he was tired, he was traveling a lot. You know, there's no excuse behind that for a sit-down interview with a journalist.

Max, things are moving very quickly this morning. Tell us about the process to move from one prime minister to another. MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  So we're about to see Rishi Sunak move out of Downing Street. He'll head up to the palace. He'll resign. The palace in front of the king and then Keir Starmer will come in and be appointed and then hell move into Downing Street. There'll be speeches on both sides. There is this unique thing, though, Paula, well, for that moment between the resignation and the appointment, the king is running the country. So an absolute monarchy for about ten minutes, probably. But I think what we've seen here is in some ways, isn't a massive shift. You still got a center ground prime minister, but it's moved to the left slightly, and by a landslide. So the British public have completely flipped in many of their voting patterns, even in Scotland, with the Scottish national party has seen its vote collapse. There's been a lot of change here and a triumph for Keir Starmer, because the last election, the Labour Party had the worst showing that its ever had now its got one of its best showings. But you have underneath all of that something very interesting going on. You're seeing the hard and the hard left also having successes. So, the Green Party getting four seats, whereas is extraordinary, Nigel Farage, who was honestly very close to Donald Trump, winning a seat. But also he got the conservatives collapsing. You're going to see the hard right having an influence on the new conservative party that comes out of this. So, it's not to say the hard-right haven't had a role to play here in the same way they have in other parts of Europe. It's just not as defined, but we have got now a centrist government which has moved slightly to the left.",

He's made massive promises about what he can afford to do, such as bringing public services back to what they used to be none of which is affordable.So this isn't the same as Tony Blair in 1997 coming off a huge wave of optimism, and celebration. This is Keir Starmer saying people have voted for change is pretty much against the conservative party. And what people used to have. And he's going to change things, but it's very difficult to see how he's going to be able to afford it, and he doesn't -- if you actually look at the votes, he didn't have that many votes across the nation, but he did very cleverly worked through the system, the first past, the post system, which is what we've got constitutionally here, which allowed him tactically to win.
