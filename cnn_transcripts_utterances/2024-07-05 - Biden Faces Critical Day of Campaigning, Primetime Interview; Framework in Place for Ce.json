I'm Jim Sciutto in New York.Just a few minutes from now, President Joe Biden will leave the White House for a day that could reassure many skeptical voters or potentially deliver a death blow to a wounded campaign. It has been eight days since Biden struggled in the CNN presidential debate, raising serious questions about his fitness to lead in a second term. Today, the President will hold an afternoon campaign event in Wisconsin, then sit down with George Stephanopoulos for his first televised interview since the debate. Joining us now is Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Larry, always good to have you on. You sit down with a lot of voters through the years in this cycle and many others. And you do a lot of data gathering. I wonder, what would you define as a success tonight? Well, what does Biden need to do to change to change the dynamic right now? LARRY SABATO, CENTER FOR POLITICS DIRECTOR, UNIV. OF VIRGINIA: I don't think he can change the dynamic with one interview, I suppose you'd say stop the bleeding. And the bleeding has been bad, Jim. I mean, we've been looking at all the data coming in, all the surveys, some public, some private, and it's bad. And Democrats need to understand that things are not stable. And it is no longer close, the race between Biden and Trump no longer close.",

So you're comparing apples and oranges here, the Vice President is well known, many of these governors, people have a glimmer of who they are, but they don't have any strong opinion on them.So it would be a matter of doing what some have suggested having three, four or five debates in various places around the country, getting them better known, and then we'd have an idea of where they stood relative to one another.",

This comes after yesterday's call between President Biden and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A senior administration official tells CNN the deal is, quote, very consistent with the one President Biden proposed publicly in May. That is three phases, the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the release of all living hostages, and the eventual reconstruction of Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem. Jeremy, I asked the same question yesterday. How much closer are they this time with the proviso that things could fall apart, again, as we've seen before. But what is your stance in your reporting in the last 24 hours as to where this is moving?",

I don't say that lightly. But I also say it with a lot of caveats. And that is to say that nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to, and what is coming now, this next phase of negotiations, detailed negotiations over the implementation of this agreement, the sequencing of the releases the identities of the Palestinian prisoners, to be released by Israel in exchange for those dozens of Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas.All of that is what's now set to be negotiated. And all of those issues are very thorny, very difficult. And not only is that phase of negotiations expected to take somewhere between two to three weeks, according to one source, familiar with the negotiations, who I spoke with. But we know, of course, that the outcome of those talks is far from assured, a ceasefire deal is far from guaranteed. But it is notable that we have now gotten to the point where a senior administration official is comfortable with saying that there is effectively a framework agreement between Israel and Hamas, although neither of those two parties seem willing to publicly say as much, instead there appears to be quite a bit of kind of cautious optimism at this stage. And what we'll be critical to see is how these first days of negotiations in Doha, Qatar, between Israel and Hamas is mediated by the Egyptians and the cutleries, how exactly those unfold. They will be critical to seeing if indeed a deal can be forged as they work through so many of those difficult issues in the days and weeks ahead, Jim.",

And the things that you heard some of what he went through, he is on a vegan diet, regular exercise, mild strength training, meditation one hour daily, and support sessions.Pretty rigorous, but also very doable. But again, just these lifestyle changes alone, he was actually able to reverse the signs of cognitive impairment. Most patients, Jim, I'll tell you, when they get the diagnosis, they're told there's really not much we can do. You have to get your affairs in order.

So in that sense, there are these glimmers of hope in the world of pharmaceuticals as well, to give you some context, how effective are they? Well, you look at does something slow down cognitive decline? Can it stop the progression of cognitive decline? Can it even reverse it?With these medications, it was really about slowing down the progression, about 29 percent with this particular medication. So again, these are patients who are told look, there's not much more to offer here. So here's a medication and infusion, it comes with risks, brain bleeds were did happen, and some of the patients are in the trial. And they happen more than you saw in patients who got placebo. So these were real brain bleeds. And these are what patients have to sort of balance, the potential benefit of slowing down cognitive decline with potential risks. And I'll point out they're very expensive as well. I mean, you look at our healthcare budget. Jim, we spent $4 trillion a year on health care. Do you think about these medications, they cost tens of thousands of dollars for these single medications alone. That is the offer that a lot of patients get. But that's a large part of why I wanted to present this lifestyle trial by Dr. Dean Ornish, because again, within five months, the body is very biodynamic, the brain is very biodynamic, it can get bad quickly, and it can improve quickly as well.
