The race for the White House entering a new phase that's making some Senate Republicans rather nervous.Also tonight, President Biden just won a key endorsement from the United Auto Workers Union as he and Trump ramp up preparations for a divisive rematch. Team Biden seeking to bring the Democratic coalition together amid protests and discontent among progressives. And my exclusive interview with Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, opens up about his Jewish heritage, warning of the dangerous rise in anti-Semitism across the United States and joining the world in remembering the horror of the Holocaust. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, the Trump and Biden campaigns are in a full scale pivot to the general election just hours after the former president's double- digit win in New Hampshire. Trump and Biden allies now convinced that the fight for the GOP presidential nomination is effectively over. But Trump rival Nikki Haley says, not so fast. CNN's Jeff Zeleny has more on where the race goes from here.

LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes. This is a very significant political endorsement and coming just the day after President Biden's campaign, unofficially said this was the start of the general election. Heading into this general election, if there is a matchup, in fact, between President Biden and the former President Donald Trump, there are going to be some blue-collar workers and these kinds of union workers that both candidates are going to be fighting for. And these are the kinds of voters that are going to be sort of making the decision of what direction some of these rust belt states end up breaking.

And also in terms of Muslim voters, mass deportation that the former president is talking about. So, he can do some comparing and contrasting here. But I think it's up to him at this point to explain to these younger voters what he is trying to do and how difficult it is.

You need to talk to these people.So, on policy, Joe Biden can say he is the most pro-union president in American history, certainly in modern history. He's right about that. I would say this on all of these issues. One of the things you get when you travel and you talk to Democratic voters who have disappointments with the president or disappointments with the state of the country, maybe it's inflation, maybe it's something else, they want to see him. They want to see him. So, M.J. is right. He's getting these protests right there right now. But sometimes you've got to go out and take it. Take your lumps, but also make your case.

We're seeing it just at our markets, on our streets. It's just -- it's so pervasive.So, the message is, I understand how you feel. I know a lot of us, I've said this before, we feel alone, we feel unmoored. We have never seen anything like this. And it's just -- it's a tough feeling to have. But we need to push back on it. And so part of the work that we had done prior to October 7th was the first ever national strategy to combat anti-Semitism. And, luckily, we had that plan in place. And, luckily, we have Joe Biden, who's president, Kamala Harris, who's vice president, because they really pushed to have this plan. And so we were able to not start from scratch after October 7th. So, we've done in terms of keeping people safe, funds for security, education, fighting what's happening online. But what I'm focused on is coalition building, because, as you know, Wolf, a lot of our traditional coalitions have frayed and it's not a good thing to happen. We need to bring these coalitions back. And so I'm doing a lot of work, a lot of public speaking, a lot of things behind the scenes to get everyone together, to get everyone to understand that this hate is all connected. And you know you're from Buffalo. The horrific shooting there at that market that targeted black people, that was buying a valid anti-Semite with this so-called ridiculous replacement theory. So, that's what people need to understand. This hate is connected. We all need to push back together against it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Other Republicans simply don't want to break from the Republican nominee, don't believe that his bipartisan deal should move ahead. Some frankly are saying that going ahead and giving Joe Biden victory on this key issue is not what they want it this moment when immigration is dominating the presidential race. Now, this all comes as Republicans on Capitol Hill are grappling with the fact that Donald Trump is atop the ticket. Yesterday are more Republicans who are now endorsing them. But in the Senate in particular, that are still concerns about his electability, particularly in those swing districts and swing states in which Republicans need to keep control of the House and also win back the Senate next year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): I'm going to support the Republican nominee. And that nominee is going to have to go after that middle ground or you don't win. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): After a primary, there needs to be a broader appeal then just to primary voters, you can't win with just your, your own base. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I think when you look at the structural problems of President Biden with the electorate versus that of Trump, I think Trump has a better hand. But there's a long way to go. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: And even as House Republican leaders are falling behind Donald Trump, the number one and number two Senate Republican leaders still not endorsing him. That includes McConnell, who has had a sour relationship with Trump since the aftermath of January 6, as well as the number two Republican, John Thune, who said he would eventually support the Republican nominee.
