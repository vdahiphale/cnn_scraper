So that's very concerning. It is ironic and pathetic in a way that North Korea is now resorting to asking aid from -- asking North Korea's help on this, but I think it's -- North Korea has a runaway nuclear program. They need technology for nuclear-powered submarines, for their satellites and so on. So this exchange, this cooperation is very concerning.",

So, what's interesting is what China's response is going to be all about this, because it's going to make North Korea less dependent on China if you can also rely on Russia for aid and technology and so on.So we'll see what China's reaction is. But, yes, Kim Jong-un is, he already, the environment was favorable for North Korea in terms of their nuclear missile program, expanding it. The United Nations Security Council could not do absolutely anything about this because Russia and China refused to help, refused to implement sanctions, and refused to pressure North Korea.

I want to start there before we dig in a little bit more on Ukraine and the idea of what we're seeing and what it means near term and longer term with this meeting between these two leaders. What's your sense of things?LT. COL. ALEXANDER VINDMAN (RET), FORMER EUROPEAN AFFAIRS DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Thanks for having me on. So I wouldn't overstate too much what this meeting means. Certainly, it means that Putin is in somewhat of a desperate situation, trying to acquire munitions that are severely depleted during this war effort. A lot of this would have been coordinated ahead of time, so he had some promises in that regard. It's not entirely clear what the Koreans are getting in turn. Probably something in the form of advanced technologies, probably something in the form of hard currency. What's striking to me is that Putin didn't attend either the BRICS summit. The South Africans said that they couldn't guarantee the fact that they wouldn't take action against him. He didn't attend the G20, but he's meeting, he's flying all the way from Moscow to Vladivostok to meet Kim Jong-un. Not a good turn of events for somebody that positions himself as a world leader. But I think the fact is that the Ukrainians are going to see some North Korean munitions start to arrive in the war effort.",

What they decided to do is not spoil long-term objectives with a communique that could have derailed the rest of the bargains that were struck.So it is somebody that watches Russia and Ukraine very closely, I would have expected to see a much, much firmer stance. But in terms of substance, there was a lot that the president delivered. And, frankly, the U.S. continues to provide support, the west continues to provide support.

I don't know if I would expect that much of a lull in the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. I think in the northern and eastern parts around the Kharkiv, Luhansk, it does get -- it's going to get probably a little bit more difficult to fight.I think in the south, that is an area that tends to be drier. We could very well see a fairly high level of fighting all the way throughout that scene. So I wouldn't overstate the amount of time left. I think it's probably somewhere -- I've been in this region. I think it's probably somewhere closer towards the very tail end of this year before really weather kind of seeps in and bogs down armored vehicles. But it's also not an armored vehicle fight. This is infantry, light infantry assaulting across fields. I think the fact is there will still be a high degree of fighting.",

As long as I was going to be on that list, President Trump and his henchmen were going to keep me off.Tuberville is doing the exact same thing. He is politicizing promotions. He is having a disastrous effect on readiness. By the end of this year, it's going to be over 75 percent of general officers and flag officers will be on hold. Imagine a football game in which the head coach is out for a season, because we've already been eight months into this. No leadership, it's going to be for the Joint Chiefs, for elements of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chairman of the joint chiefs. It has an impact. For a little while, you could cruise on. But eventually it has an impact on readiness. It has an impact on how the military interacts with the rest of government. I was up in D.C. visiting with friends, military officers serving in the Pentagon. It cascades down to the colonel level and below. It has a major effect on readiness. It's going to have an effect on retention. And this is, this is an attack on U.S. national security. And it's not just Senator Tuberville. It's the entirety of the Republican establishment that refuses to challenge him. This needs to end. It is affecting the U.S. national security. It's affecting soldiers' lives.

They've got a whole series of specialist tents.  They have got 24 doctors -- 25 doctors, 48 nurses already. Thecapacity of this field hospital is 30, but as we've seen when we've been up into the hills, the numbers of people injured are climbing because these mountains up there aware the need is greatest, Phil and Poppy, and they are highly inaccessible. So at the same time, the military is also sending significant numbers of helicopters up into the areas that have been cut off in order to bring people down and get them treatment. If the people have been sadly killed, then they will be left in place for the time being because the purpose of this Moroccan emergency operation right now is triage, it is to find the people who can and should be helped, get the most injured immediately to the established hospitals, stabilize them here. They can expand this facility if they need to. They're also building just beyond these tents, a very substantial accommodation area, a refugee camp effectively of tents, to accommodate people who are coming down out of the hills. Many of them also, people staying up in the hill. So the next phase for the military may well be to try to get accommodation tents and other support up to people into those more isolated hill areas. But quite naturally, the Moroccan people in the initial stages, particularly in that 72-hour period when people stuck under buildings have a chance of survival have been angry about what they said was the slow response of the Moroccan government to their predicament.
