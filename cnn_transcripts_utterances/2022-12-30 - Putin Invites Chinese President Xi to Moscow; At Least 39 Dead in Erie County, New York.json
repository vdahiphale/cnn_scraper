Ukrainian officials acknowledging in the city of Bakhmut, which has been the scene of some of the most intense fighting of this war, both sides, both Ukrainian and Russian sides are taking heavy casualties as this battle has raged on for weeks, actually months. And also along the entire eastern front, it appears that the Russians have been using a lot of their heavy firepower. In the southern part of the country, in the Kherson area, we've seen another intensification of Russian bombardment on that area recently liberated from Russian forces. Jessica?",

But at the same time, the Chinese have been hesitant to back Putin militarily.China is one of the biggest arms manufactures on Earth. But to-date, to the best of knowledge of intelligence agencies, the Chinese have not provided the Russians with much in the way of hardware or ammunition. In fact, the Russians have had to turn to countries like Iran and North Korea for the supplies they need. The Chinese, even though rhetorically they support the Russians and seem to accept the Russian excuses or rationale for this war, they do not want to be the object of western sanctions. So, in theory, it is a partnership that provides benefits to the Russians, but on the ground here in Ukraine, it hasn't really made much of a difference. Jessica?",

During this time, of course, the families, the community has been reeling, even one family, the Goncalves family, who has been very outspoken about the fact that there have been very little developments in this case and police the entire time have been consistent in saying, stick with us, there are strong leads in this case, we're not releasing information to protect the integrity of this investigation, and they've been steadfast with only really announcing very few details. But today, we understand there is going to be a press conference. The nature of that press conference, rather, and exactly what is going to be revealed, police are not saying. They're just saying that they are going to be sharing some developments today and we expect major developments to come out. Jessica?",
