We want to turn down to business news, the U.S. Federal Reserve releasing a highly important interest rate decision later today against the backdrop of fresh tremors in the banking sector, and still unresolved debt ceiling crisis. Jay Powell and company still widely expected, though, to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point. But they could signal a more cautious path going forward to watch that space. And a lot is at stake here and so lots of questions about the policy road ahead. We have new concerns that the banking turmoil in the U.S. is far from over and that'll surely factor into the Fed's decision making, shares a regional banks pack West and Western alliance tumbled well over 10 percent Tuesday shows have both remain under pressure today. And the U.S. regional banking sector as a whole is now trading at its lowest level in three years. And amid all of this uncertainty, U.S. futures are actually higher after Tuesday's more than 1 percent rob you can see Europe is in the green as well. And a data dump doesn't and they are just released numbers show U.S. private employers adding almost 300,000 jobs last month. For context that is more than double expectations.

So yes, despite the Regional Bank stresses that you've mentioned leading into this, the labor market itself, the general macro economy is still in pretty good shape.

All of that suggests the economy is slowing down. But we're largely a consumer driven economy and consumer driven around services, consumption 70 percent of economic activity, that side of the economy is still kind of chugging along, more or less. OK, so the Fed is kind of weighing these two signals, parts of the economy are certainly slowing down housing itself is in a recession, but the consumer side of the economy is likely in their mind robust enough to suggest me one more hike, maybe two more hikes are where we should be going.

So our concern really would be excess tightening meaning of defense, lifting its policy rate, you would expect banks to tighten lending standards, you would expect loan growth to slow but now there's a number of factors weighing on smaller in Regional Banks beyond just a tightening cycle, which the risk is then banks pull back credit a lot more.

They want a certain amount of jobs available for writers and they want equal pay amongst all writers and fair pay. And essentially, the two sticking points that we're still hearing about is the amount of writers in the writer's room and the residuals from streaming. The studio saying that they feel like they do not they shouldn't have to staff a ton of writers if it's not needed for a particular show.

The Kremlin, we know has said that this was an assassination attempt on President Putin. Even though we know that President Putin wasn't there at that time, he was at events in St. Petersburg, hundreds of miles away from the Kremlin the day before that he was working today, not in the Kremlin, but it is residence, some long distance from the Kremlin just outside of Moscow. So what we know, those are the details but it's, of course, what does it all mean, that's causing concern, and Ukrainians have been putting their position very clearly and say that they use all means inside Ukraine to defend their territory. They're saying that they don't have any knowledge of what happened at the Kremlin, and they're saying that they believe that this is a trick to be expected of our opponents. They say that the Kremlin is trying to use this purported attack by what the Kremlin claims are to Ukrainian UAVs to build up more support for the war in Ukraine, particularly ahead of the very important Mayday Parade on the 9th of May, just a few days away, where there are huge Victory Day parades as they're known across citizen Russia most the biggest one at outside the Kremlin on the Red Square with a fly by. Usually, a Russian aircraft overhead, a very big event on the Russian calendar, because it commemorates the loss of tens of millions of Russian lives in the Second World War. So these are the pieces of information that we know. So Ukraine is saying that it believes that this is Russian propaganda. We have looked at the video yet, but cannot independently verify. We do know that witnesses near the Kremlin at the alleged time of this attack have said that there was some kind of small explosion, a loud bang, a big clap that was heard. So at the moment, it's perhaps wise to take a pause on the authenticity of this video. Partly because we know the Kremlin has such a bad track record on what it claims to be the truth it was in the past often use what's called false flag events. So to give it an excuse for another type of attack, a counter attack of their own description. All of this is unclear.
