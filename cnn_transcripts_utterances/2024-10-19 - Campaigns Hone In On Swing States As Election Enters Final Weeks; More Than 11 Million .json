We'll have much more on that and join you, Kaitlan, in a moment. But first, the race for the White House in this country heating up on one of the final critical weekends of campaigning. With just 17 days until the Election Day, both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are rallying voters in key battleground states, states that will be critical in determining who wins. Harris barnstorming both in Michigan and Georgia today while Trump is in Pennsylvania. And the stakes in these closing weeks couldn't be higher. Polls showing razor thin margins, the campaigns looking to build winning coalitions. Voting is already underway in 42 states, more than 11 million ballots cast so far. CNN's Steve Contorno and Priscilla Alvarez are following all the action on the campaign trail. Steve, you're with the Trump campaign in Pennsylvania. So what is his message to voters there?",

Events like these are often billed as an opportunity for him to talk about the economy and inflation and all these concerns that many voters are carrying into the election.But Trump, when he gets on the stage, regularly says that he doesn't think the economy is the top issue. He thinks that it's immigration. Meanwhile, his campaign has stopped running ads linked to immigration and is instead pumping tens of million dollars into advertisements talking about Vice President Harris's past support for certain policies supporting transgender individuals. And then Trump has also maintained these intensely personal attacks on the former, or excuse me, on the Vice President. He did so yesterday during a stop in Michigan. Take a listen to what he said.

And third, this is one of the reasons why Georgia is no longer a red state, but a purple. And it's a county that Joe Biden, President Joe Biden carried in 2020 and allowed him to get to the White House.

Rarely are these close calls in midair.This incident was on Wednesday, but is just now coming to light after new data from flight tracking site Flight Radar 24. It shows an American Airlines flight lining up to land at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas when a private Cessna 182 started to turn toward the commercial flight, putting the planes nose to nose. Flight Radar 24 says the American flight passed over the Cessna, separated by only 400 feet. We're talking a little more than the length of a football field. The air traffic control recording from LiveATC.Net details that the American pilots received an in-cockpit alert of an impending collision called a resolution advisory, which requires immediate action by the pilots. Now, this investigation is just beginning, but the FAA says the Cessna was operating under visual flight rules. That does not require constant communication with air traffic control. You may remember that Austin was the site of another near collision. In February of last year, a FedEx flight nearly landed on top of a departing Southwest flight that was obscured by dense fog. Investigators said the quick reaction of the FedEx crew saved the day, and the lone air traffic controller in the tower simply could not see the problem playing out in front of them.

And you wrote an op-ed for \"The New York Times,\" and you're talking about what Sinwar's death means, and what goes next -- and -- and what happens next year, what could be next? I want to just quote from that. You said, if Mr. Sinwar truly was the obstacle to a ceasefire agreement that U.S. officials, including President Biden, have claimed that obstacles now gone and the Biden administration must press the Netanyahu government and remaining Hamas officials to end the war in Gaza. Of course, that is not something Netanyahu seems to have been listening to, necessarily. He was saying, this is not the end. This is maybe the beginning of the end.

And that is, in fact, what we saw.I think there were some efforts to kind of suggest that the operation that Israel eventually carried out in Rafah was somehow not as bad as people feared. But we actually heard from the former Gaza humanitarian envoy, David Satterfield, when that operation was ongoing, that the casualties and the destruction was as bad or worse than the Biden administration feared. So I think they were faced with the fact that Netanyahu, once again, rolled right over their red line, and they were forced to come up with a rationalization for it. But I think this problem goes back to the fact that they continue to say what they want. And Netanyahu then does whatever he wants, and there are no consequences. This is a problem of -- of this relationship. The United States imposes zero costs on Netanyahu and on successive Israeli governments, not just over the past year, but over decades of this conflict.
