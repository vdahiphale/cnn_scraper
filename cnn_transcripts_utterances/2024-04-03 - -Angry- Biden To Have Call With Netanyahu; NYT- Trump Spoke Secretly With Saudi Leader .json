Plus, new video from inside the raid on Diddy's home and the new reporting on the interviews the feds are now conducting. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"In just a matter of hours, President Biden will be speaking on the phone with Benjamin Netanyahu. It's their first phone call since the deadly Israeli airstrike in Gaza that killed seven people, innocent aid workers with Chef Jose Andres's World Central Kitchen, a strike that Chef Andres now says was the deliberate targeting of his workers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSE ANDRES, FOUNDER, WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN: This was not just a bad luck situation where, oops, we dropped the bomb in the wrong place or not. This was over 1.5, 1.8 kilometers with a very defiant humanitarian convoy that had signs in the top, in the roof, a very colorful logo that we are obviously very proud of. That's very clear who we are and what we do. What I know is that we were targeted deliberately, nonstop until everybody was dead in this convoy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These are people who travel in some of the world's biggest disaster zones with the purest of missionsNow, Israel is blaming misidentification for the attack. But CNN analyzed video and images of the aftermath, which show the attack, appears to have consisted of multiple precision strikes. The question now is whether this could serve as a red line moment for the president. So far, Biden has expressed his frustration, his outrage, his heartbreak. But will that evolve into a changed stance on his support for Israel? What we know for sure is that a senior administration official says the president is angry that he'll be -- quote -- \"expressing his frustration\" -- unquote -- tomorrow to Netanyahu directly. So, what exactly does that mean, expressing one's frustration? And will Netanyahu even care? But for the president's critics and the tens of thousands in critical states who have voted uncommitted or what was the other one? Uninstructed in primaries, frustration expressed may not be enough. And new tonight, we've learned the pressure on Biden extends all the way to his personal residence. \"The New York Times\" is reporting that First Lady Jill Biden has privately urged the president to end the conflict. According to an attendee at a meeting with Muslim community leaders last night, the president said that the first lady had been telling him to -- quote -- \"stop it, stop it now, Joe.\" I want to bring in CNN contributor Evan Osnos. He is the author of \"Joe Biden: The Life, The Run, and What Matters Now.\" Also here, CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier. I'm so glad that you're both here. Let me begin with you for a second, Evan, because the president is angry, ready to express his frustration, we're hearing. You have talked one on one with the president at length in recent months.

Look, as we know, in a diplomatic call like this, we're not going to get every detail about what they talked about, but one thing to look for is whether you see any changes on the ground afterwards in terms of access for humanitarian aid.For instance, does the IDF provide escorts to humanitarian workers to be able to operate more safely? Does the Israeli government talk about evacuating people from Raffa? These are the kinds of things that will give us a sign of how far President Biden is willing to go in putting pressure on the Israelis.",

They have, however, been asking Israel behind the scenes, asking the IDF to be more precise, and this gives them ammunition to say you're not living up to your promises, you're not living up to your own ideals of accuracy.We're paying attention to this because it was a foreign aid convoy and everyone knows Chef Jose Andres. So, unlike when the Israelis say, oh, it was a U.N. convoy and they were lying, they can't say that this time. And they have their own internal reporting that one side of the IDF knew where this convoy was, but another part of the IDF systematically targeted these three vehicles down. Andres describes how the vehicles were spread out over a one-mile area. The first car got attacked. Everyone ran out of that, went to the second car. The second car got attacked, they ran to the third. The third was obliterated, and they were all killed. Can you imagine their terror? And so, this has happened to U.N. aid workers, but now we're all finally paying attention to it in a way that the White House will be able to say to Bibi Netanyahu, you've got to change course. But Netanyahu is hoping that he'll have a Trump administration in a few months, and the Netanyahu government is allowed to stay in office for three years as long as Bibi can keep his right-wing coalition together.",

That that means something.And I think what it is a sign of is of real frustration. You know, when I talked to the president not too long ago about the war, you could see it in his body language. There is a level of -- it's a problem that he has not been able to solve. And you could see it in the way he talks about it. He said, Israel had at the time -- he said, don't underestimate the desire, as he said, to go after Hamas with every ounce of capacity. And he said, but that doesn't mean it should be continued, it doesn't mean it should be right. And what he's walking is this line between putting pressure on Israel in a way that his political career tells him to. And look, I know that there are people who say, why isn't he calling Bibi Netanyahu out more aggressively, more powerful, more forcefully? Why is he breaking with him? Because his view today has been that the way that you can get them to do anything is by working with them, not by arguing publicly against them. But I think we're approaching this point now, as Kim said, in which the events on the ground have become so unmistakably contrary to American interests and values that this is reaching the point where you're going to see a more forceful -- a more forceful response from it.",

Evan Osnos, Kim Dozier, thank you both so much.And now over to Trump legal world, where Special Counsel Jack Smith is delivering his sharpest rebuke yet against Judge Aileen Cannon in the classified docs case, in a filing just late last night, Smith saying Judge Cannon had ordered briefings based on -- quote -- \"fundamentally flawed understandings of the case that has\" -- they call it \"no basis in law or in fact.\" Now, in plain English, what does that mean? Special Counsel Smith is telling Judge Aileen Cannon that she has no idea what she is talking about. So, what's this all about? Well, Judge Cannon requested jury instructions from both sides. No, you didn't miss anything. The trial has not started. No, they haven't even picked the jury. I mean, the trial date itself is written in pencil, not ink. But Jack Smith wants the judge to reject Trump's claim that he cannot be prosecuted because he transformed somehow classified documents into private property under what's called the Presidential Records Act. Now, last month, the judge seemed to signal that she thought that defense was absurd. But then, here's a confusing part for Jack Smith's team, she asked for jury instructions that would say the opposite. So now the big question is, where do we go from here? Well, National Security Attorney Brad Moss is here with me at the magic wall. As I understand it, Brad, we have got three options here, three doors. So, what is behind door number one? What happens if Judge Cannon does not agree with Special Counsel Smith?",

That's why Jack Smith outlines this in the beginning of his filing, saying it is vitally important that the court promptly decide whether the unstated legal premise, this idea about the Presidential Records Act underlying the recent orders, does, in the court's view, represent a correct formulation of law. They're saying, this is what Jack Smith is saying, you've got it all wrong. You don't -- you certainly don't understand how this Presidential Records Act works with respect to the Espionage Act. Trump's whole legal theory is garbage. If you send this to a jury like this, jeopardy will have attached.

The government must have the opportunity to consider appellate review before jeopardy attaches.

In the Cassie Ventura lawsuit, she filed under oath that Mr. Combs had her carry his pistol wherever they went together in her purse. Again, all things that Combs has denied. But when you're hitting a large property like this, that has cameras that can see you coming from a mile away, that can monitor your movements inside, where you have reports of guns being stored there and guns being carried there by people, your tactical plan is probably going to include a show of force which has a tactical advantage in case you face gunfire, and we've seen that before, and at least a psychological advantage when you're trying to conduct a raid with the element of speed and surprise so evidence isn't destroyed and so you don't meet resistance.
