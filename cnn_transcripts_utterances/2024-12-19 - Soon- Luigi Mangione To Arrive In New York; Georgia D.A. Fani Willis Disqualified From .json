      "sentences": "Hi, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD.And we are following three major legal stories today, from New York to Atlanta to Avignon, France. We start with accused healthcare CEO killer, Luigi Mangione, who is on a plane right now heading to New York after waving extradition in Pennsylvania earlier today. That's him that you see getting on the plane there in an orange suit. Now once in New York, Mangione is expected to appear before a federal judge in Manhattan, where he faces four federal counts including murder through the use of a firearm and stalking charges in the death of Brian Thompson. Those charges are in addition to the ones he already faces in New York, including first-degree murder and 11 other charges. Now, just hours ago, Mangione was led into a black unmarked SUV, clean- shaven and quiet after back-to-back hearings in Pennsylvania. The local prosecutor says Mangione will not face firearm and forgery charges in Pennsylvania until the charges against him in New York are resolved. CNN's Brynn Gingras joins us now from the helipad in Manhattan where Mangione is expected to arrive shortly. Brynn, just walk us through what we can expect to see in the next several hours. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bianna. So we're expecting Mangione, that plane that you talked about, leaving Pennsylvania. We expect it to land at an airport here in New York. And from then, he's going to be transported in an NYPD helicopter to where we are right now in the southern part of Manhattan. And from there, you can probably see behind me, there's a lot of police vehicles, both the NYPD are here, the FBI are here. We know after you just mentioned the unsealing of that federal indictment that he will eventually be in federal custody. Not clear if that actually happens at this very moment here at the heliport or once that happens once he's in 500 Pearl Street, which is the main courthouse where he will eventually face arraignment. So this is sort of the movement by movement of what is happening with Mangione at the moment. So at this point, we are still waiting for him to get on that helicopter and then make his way here to the southern part of Manhattan, and then it's just really a short drive to that federal courthouse. And like you just said, he is expected to first face those federal charges, those four federal counts of murder through the use of a firearm, two stalking charges, and a firearms offense. In addition to that, we know that there is an arraignment at some point as well of those state charges, that indictment that was instilled earlier this week on Tuesday, those 11 counts, including murder one and murder two. So the mechanics of all this still sort of being worked out. Who takes precedent? Well, obviously the feds take precedent, but they go first, and then at what point the state goes, that's still being all worked out. But certainly, we know that he is in New York momentarily and will be at this heliport making his way to federal courthouse soon. Bianna?",

Well, the indictment still stands, but Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis will no longer be prosecuting Georgia's election interference case against Donald Trump. A state court of appeals disqualified Willis after finding there was, quote, a significant appearance of impropriety over her relationship with a fellow prosecutor. Trump and other defendants are accused of crimes related to their efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Now, in order for the case to continue, a new special prosecutor would need to be appointed. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins me now live from Washington. So in theory, the case is still alive, but what are the -- what's the likelihood at this point, Katelyn, that this case will indeed move forward with a new prosecutor appointed?",

Let's start with this appeals court disqualifying Fani Willis from prosecuting that Georgia election interference case against the president- elect now, at the time former president, and overruling the sitting judge in this case.

      "sentences": "So I'll tell you this, Bianna, that'll be an open question subject to debate. But what I can say, it is an unusualruling. And let me say why I say it's unusual. Number one, what they did that is the appellate court in a two to one decision. That's how courts go. The majority prevails. Three Republican justices, two saying it was in fact the wrong decision by the trial judge not to disqualify. One saying it was perfectly proper. But here are the two reasons. Number one, they are disqualifying, based upon what is called an appearance, an appearance of a conflict of interest. Now that is different from an actual conflict of interest. Well, what's the difference? The difference is just as you would note it in layman's terms, because of this financial arrangement, she hires her boyfriend, there was the, right, the indication that because of the hiring that she was profiting financially. Now the judge ruling it, you know, while that could be an appearance of impropriety in bad judgment, it certainly is not an actual conflict of interest, right? So, usually, and they say this in the ruling, the dissent does, over 43 years, there's not been on the appearance of impropriety a disqualification, that's number one. Number two, an appellate court usually doesn't sit in all -- in every judgment, right, doesn't review the entire judgment that a trial court makes. They look for whether there's what's called an abuse of discretion. That means that the discretion that you exercise as a trial of lower judge, was it so improper as to require a reversal. And they say, yes, it was. This is a unique case. And so for those two reasons, people can argue as to whether it was the appropriate decision, but I could tell you from a legal perspective, it was an unusual decision. And now we'll see whether or not it's appealed to the Supreme Court and what happens then.",

What happens to not only Trump now, but does this also apply to those 14 others that were charged in this case?",

You see it, Luigi Mangione charged with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson where he waived extradition this morning. And then things moved quite quickly, getting him on a plane from Pennsylvania here to New York, where he'll then get on to a helicopter to Lower Manhattan, and will be brought in for arraignment. In addition to the 11 charges, we now know that he's facing four federal charges, in addition to the 11 state charges he's facing. And walk us through these charges, because they're murdered through the use of a firearm, through stalking charges, and a firearms offense. What happens, Joey, once he is arraigned?",

      "sentences": "So a few things. First is it relates to the state charges in New York. He'll be brought right to New York court, whether that's thisafternoon, Friday or Monday remains to be seen. And he's what's called arraigned. That is he's given the opportunity to be told what the charges are with the presence of counsel, whether he's aware of what the charges are. And arraignment is notice, right? Given notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard. I suspect that he'll plead not guilty. Thereafter, as it relates to the state case, his attorney will get discovery that is the evidence relating to the case, will evaluate that evidence, will make any and all motions. In English, that means they'll challenge the evidence, see what can be used in front of a jury, what can't be, and then it's game on. There'll be a trial or they won't. At the same time, you asked about the federal charges, and people may question, well, how is that possible? It's possible because the state certainly can levy charges, right? But also, the federal government has an independent obligation, an independent authority to exercise in this case, and they're doing that by saying you violated federal law as well. And so the question is going to be whether federal takes priority over state, whether the state goes first, and how that dynamic looks. And those will be discussions with federal and state prosecutors. But I think the core thing to remember here, Bianna, is that because of the federal charges, he now faces, right, potentially the death penalty as opposed to a situation where in state court, New York State does not have that. And so we'll see what happens as that develops and what state prosecutors do in working with each other.",

And as we see him walking to that NYPD helicopter. Let me ask you about those federal charges, because, as word came that they were looming, in addition to the 11 state charges, Mangione's attorney, Karen Agnifilo, issued a statement. And here's what she said. The federal government's reported decision to pile on top of an already overcharged first-degree murder and state terror case is highly unusual and raises serious constitutional and statutory double jeopardy concerns. We are ready to fight these charges in whatever court they are brought. Karen, obviously, is a well-seasoned and well respected attorney and prosecutor here, former prosecutor here in New York. What do you make of her argument?",

      "timeStamp": "12:15:11",
      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "So -- yes, so I'm one, Bianna, who makes of it that prosecutors charge in a couple of ways. Number one, they charge based upon the relevantconduct and what they believe the conduct shows. Number two, they charge based upon what they believe they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. You can argue, and it will be argued, in a court of law as to whether or not it was terrorism. That doesn't operate as a bar to prosecutor's charging. I do think strategically it was a wise move on their part for a couple of reasons. Reason number one, when you charge terrorism, generally speaking, in any prosecution, you don't have to establish motive. That means you don't have to explain why someone did something, you just have to explain that they did it. If they would have just charged second degree murder, they would have just had to establish that he did, Mangione, shoot and kill, right, this CEO at the specific time and place in Manhattan. None of the things relating to motive would really be something that would have to be litigated. By putting terrorism at issue, prosecutors are going to be now allowed to talk about everything and anything relating to his motive, his prior history, his psychology, what he was thinking, the manifesto. These are generally things that us defense attorneys would move to exclude from a jury's consideration. Why it's prejudicial judge, it's not relevant, we don't -- the prosecutor doesn't have to prove it, they're piling on, it's improper. Those arguments from the defense are now taken off the table. That's the first thing. Number two, when you look to charge in terrorism, many believe it was. You know, some have said, well, it wasn't in the light of day. He was the only one on the location at the time. That's not relevant. The message that the shooting and killing sent, that's the relevant consideration in terms of how you're attempting to shock the public, to influence the public agenda, to coerce the narrative, to change policy, that's what the terrorism is based upon. So like any case, Bianna, it'll go to court. A jury will make a determination of 12 members, whether it's proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and if it's not, it's not. But they certainly, that is, prosecutors thought they should charge it, and they did. Finally, what that does, that being charging terrorism can also give him a life without parole mandatory sentence. And that certainly is appropriate in terms of punishment, because as I just explained, New York State does not, repeat, does not have the death penalty.",

First of all, the accusers and right to anonymity to be waived, and then the videos to be shown in court. All of that has meant that the impact of this has really gone far beyond the borders of France. As to what actually happened here in court today, there were large crowds outside, as there has been almost every day for the nearly four months of this trial. Men and women who come to support Gisele Pelicot, again, as she arrived, shouting \"merci madame\" to her arrival. And again as she left, thanking her for what she's done by achieving this, whatever the sentence is handed down today, the fact that the trial was made public has led to this sort of societal reckoning. The question of how this number of men could have come into someone's home, found an unconscious woman, and not thought to raise the alarm or alert anyone or turn away themselves, is remarkable? And it's a very uncomfortable question that's really been placed before wider society. We heard those sentences handed down. The only man who did receive the maximum sentence being sought was Dominique Pelicot himself. All of the others received lesser sentences, as you mentioned. And that's led to a great deal of outrage outside the court here today. There were shouts of rapists, we see you, as proceedings got underway, and when at least one of the men who walked free today because of a suspended sentence walked out, he was jeered fairly violently by the crowd, even as he tried to hide his face. We also heard beyond the strong words of Gisele Pelicot herself that you played there a moment ago. We also heard from a lawyer representing Dominique Pelicot, the husband, again, the only guilty man here today to be handed the full 20-year sentence. This is what he said. BEATRICE ZAVARRO, DOMINIQUE PELICOT'S ATTORNEY: The Criminal Court of Vaucluse has given its verdict, sentencing Dominique Pelicot to 20 years in prison. Mr. Pelicot has taken note of the decision. And we are going to take advantage of the delay, which has given us 10 days to decide if we will appeal this decision. At the moment I am speaking to you, no decision has been taken.",

So this is where the reality is starting to bite. What happened yesterday was that Musk did a long 70 tweets screed against this bill. And the argument that many Republicans are saying is that they just won a massive, what they see as a massive election victory on the basis of tearing down a government which many millions of Trump supporters don't trust and don't really care about. So why would they turn around and then pass a bill of $100 billion of spending? Of course, that doesn't take into account the dynamics of the existing Congress, where you have Democrats in the Senate. And the fact is, some of them are saying that Johnson can't pass a bill in the House without Republican -- without democratic votes because the Republican majority is so narrow. So Trump and Musk, in many ways, have led themselves into a corner here. It's very unclear how they get out. A lot of Trump Republicans are now saying, why don't we just shut down the government until the end of January -- January the 20th when Trump is inaugurated and start again?

With the arrival of winter, the rains, the need for shelter is rising. Respiratory illnesses are rising. And people are sometimes going without food for days. Of course, a ceasefire deal could improve all of this, bringing an enormous flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. We know that those negotiations, of course, are ongoing.

Really showing little desire, serious desire to bring this war to anend imminently, instead saying our soldiers are gaining territory every day, we're moving forward. And what stood out to me is that, at least on one front, it appears he and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine have reached similar conclusions about an immediate ceasefire. And here's what they both said. Putin today said a ceasefire means giving the enemy the opportunity to consolidate its positions to rest and receive the necessary equipment and ammunition. Similar talking points we've heard from Volodymyr Zelenskyy as of late. What stood out to you from Putin today?",

It was four and a half hours of flattering toVladimir Putin, of asking him very comfortable questions. It was Vladimir Putin's moment when he was trying to show the Russian citizens and also the world that he is very, very strong, that he is victorious. And what this press conference was about -- was about, if we talk about the situation in Ukraine, if we talk about the war, which is actually devastating, not only for Ukraine, but for Russians as well, that he wanted to show to the population that Russia is winning this war. And he could not talk about any, you know, any steps that would be bad for the interests of Vladimir Putin, because this was a moment he wanted to proud of himself. He wanted to talk about the inflation that is, yes, problematic, but still lower than in other countries. He wanted to talk about economy, which is -- which is perfect, as he was describing it. He wanted to talk about Oreshnik, which you have mentioned earlier, the weapons that he invented, his engineers invented. Because in this particular period of time, he thinks that he can actually be much wiser, much more smart, much more strong than Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And this is because of Donald Trump coming into the office. And he hopes, as I understand it, because I follow him for so many years, he hopes that when Donald Trump gets there after 20th of January, he gets - - Vladimir Putin gets a good deal.

Unfortunately, this is truth. Losses of lives of those who live in remote, far away regions and villages. So the inflation, the prices are very, very important right now on this stage. But what we can see is that Vladimir Putin has his principles that he would not -- he would not give up. For example, he is maintaining on that Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. And unfortunately, the Western partners of Ukraine are listening to it and they are not bringing Ukraine into NATO. So what we can expect is maybe an idea, by the way, which is actually OK'd by Donald Trump, idea of peacekeepers, European peacekeepers in Ukraine. So this is a thought that may be acceptable and is acceptable, as I understand it, for Ukraine, for Europeans, many Europeans, but not for Putin so far. This is the topic that may be negotiated, Bianna. This is what they can sit and talk about. And Vladimir Putin, of course, will try to get the highest price for himself. So let's see what would be the position of Ukraine and everything now depends on European allies of Ukraine, how strong they would be in these negotiations, because Donald Trump, as I assume, would not -- would not be strong here for Ukraine.
