      "sentences": "Good evening from St. John's, Newfoundland.A lot has occurred since we broadcast from here last night at this time. In fact, right behind me, two of the ships involved in the search for OceanGate's Titan submersible, the Canadian Coast Guard vessel, Terry Fox and another ship, the Skandi Vinland have just now returned here to port. This is them coming in just moments ago. The Canadian Coast Guard ship, Ann Harvey is expected here within the next hour or so and Titan's support ship, the Polar Prince is due back in here sometime in the overnight or early morning hours. Polar Prince left here, as you know, a week ago, just today, a week ago today traveling the more than 400 miles to the site of the Titanic disaster. It was to be Titan's first trip of the season down to the Titanic. Polar Prince sails under the Canadian flag and this afternoon, Canada's Transportation Safety Board announced it is launching a probe into the doomed expedition, which resulted to the death of all five people on board. Also today, the Odysseus 6 remotely operated vehicle which located the wreckage yesterday made another trip to the ocean floor to map out debris fields. The company spokesman saying they expect similar missions to continue searching and mapping out the field, that that's going to continue for at least another week. However, he said that any attempt to actually recover or bring up anything from the bottom would be a larger operation involving different equipment that's better suited to lifting bigger and heavier objects. Meantime, a Pentagon official tells CNN's Oren Liebermann that the Navy's deep ocean salvage system, which only got here, Wednesday is being pulled out of the area, as are other navy vessels and equipment. Naval personnel, however, will continue to assist the salvage operation we're told. Also today, we learned far more about what \"Titanic\" director and deep sea explorer, James Cameron talked to us about last night on the program, namely, the concerns surrounding Titan's carbon fiber hull, concerns that were raised directly and repeatedly by a number of people to OceanGate's CEO, Stockton Rush who died on the Titan. We knew last night about a 2018 letter that was drafted by several sub experts, which warned of possible catastrophic outcomes. But tonight, you're going to hear from a man called Karl Stanley, who operates submersibles out of Honduras. He emailed Rush in April of 2019 after diving aboard Titan with Rush and hearing cracking noises that got louder the deeper they went. In the e-mail, he warned Rush not to give into pressures from investors or others to start taking paying passengers on board. And I'm quoting now from his e-mail that rush received: Imagine this project he said, was self-funded and on your own schedule, would you consider taking dozens of other people to the Titanic before you truly knew the source of those sounds? Again, he was not alone in his concerns. Joining me tonight, CNN's Miguel Marquez who has been reporting from here all week. First of all, let's talk a little bit more about the investigation now into the tragedy, what do we know about it?",

And UW personnel did not provide any verification or validation of any OceanGate equipment as a result of those tests.\" And the school's Applied Physics lab told CNN, its staff only worked with OceanGate on a different shallow diving steel hulled submersible. Boeing firmly told CNN the company was not a partner on the Titan and did not design or build it, declining to comment further. NASA whose collaboration Rush raised frequently told CNN it \"consulted on materials and manufacturing processes for the submersible,\" but \"did not conduct testing and manufacturing or any approvals.\" Titan was not certified by an independent firm, and in 2019, the company put up a blog post defending that decision. But two months later, after a test dive in the Bahamas, OceanGate publicly raised the name of one of those certification companies saying the dive was validated by a representative from Lloyd's Register.

It has got seven thrusters on it and this is what it's going to descend all the way down to go to that debris field and start mapping everything out there.It has got a couple of robotic arms. So, it could pick up things along the way if it wanted to. But mainly, it'll be there to take photographs and video and record where everything is. There are two debris fields in this area and the Coast Guard made the point of saying they're not in the area of any other Titanic debris, like you have over here near the stern. So they'll have a clean area in which to work. And they're going to try to record not merely the things that are on the ground, but ultimately, investigators want to be able to get things that might also be floating before they float away, because some of this will be slightly buoyant.

It was designed as you pointed out to move and pick up on the movement of enemy submarines.If you could hear where they are going and sort of triangulate that position, you know, where one of the enemy's key assets is. Basically, how it works is that sound travels incredibly well underwater, and because of that, if a few of these sensors pick up on a noise, they can triangulate exactly where it is. For example, if all three picked up on noise at the exact same time, it must be equidistant from the sensors and you'd know where that spot is. But if it's not, it will take the difference in time to zero in on a location, and that's effectively what happened in this case. They used it to narrow down on the search location. The reason it didn't end the search immediately or to move it from a search and rescue to a recovery is because it was not definitive that audio of the implosion that was picked up by the Navy. They didn't know it was an implosion, though they pass the information on to the Coast Guard. It was only several days later when an ROV got down there and they got eyes on the debris that they put those two pieces of data together and realized that noise that they'd heard was the implosion of the submersible.",

      "sentences": "Yes, of course. So there were two red flags that I had when I first looked at the design of this vessel. And the first one is exactly what you mentioned. It's the fact that a lot of the strength of this pressure hole relied on the material carbon fiber. We know carbon fiber as a lightweight and incredibly strong material that is used for many applications today.However, once you start putting it into saltwater, it changes its properties. The reason for that is because that saltwater can create and augment what we call galvanic currents, which is basically the traveling of electrons between different types of materials. The carbon fiber gets its strength because these sheets of interwoven threads of long strands of carbon are then alternated with layers of epoxy, and it's this sort of layer cake effect that gives it its Total strength, right? A croissant is neither bread nor butter. It's both. Carbon fiber is neither carbon strings nor just epoxy. It's both. And so when these galvanic currents start to affect the epoxy in between the layers, it starts to break down that layer of glue and those multiple layers of glue in between them, which dramatically reduces its strength. It is possible to use carbon fiber underwater --",

And it's the carbon dioxide that becomes the problem much more quickly.As much as we like to think that technology has advanced, and it has in many ways, when it comes to removing carbon dioxide from an area -- from an enclosed area, we actually haven't made that much progress in the past 100 years, and our methods are still the same. We need a material that looks a lot like kitty litter and there are a couple more advanced methods. But they don't take up a much smaller volume. And in the case of Titan, in order to keep those five passengers alive for 96 hours, they would have needed enough material to fill about half of a standard bathtub. This material then gets insulated, heavily insulated, and needs to also be coordinated with the airflow inside the submarine. And based at least on the publicly available photos, there were no structures attached to this vessel that meet those volume requirements to give those 96 hours. I would be interested in seeing the internal diagrams for the breathing system by the company, but those have not been released.",

They've obviously, said they're going to take appropriate action, and I think we all know what that means, if they see there's a threat posed against them. The latest that we've heard is from Yevgeny Prigozhin himself, who's posted on social media in an audio message, saying that his forces have now begun entering the Southern Russian region of Rostov. Not the city itself yet, but the region. It's the region that one of the regions that borders Ukraine.

Questions are being raised half a world away about how a vessel crammed with more than 700 migrants, capsized and sank in the Mediterranean off the coast of Greece last week.Now, hundreds of people are still missing. Survivors and their relatives spoke with CNN, say, the fault lies with errors made by the Greek Coast Guard, whose officials deny the charges. Jomana Karadsheh has been investigating the story. Here's her report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The desperate, exhausting weight for the promise of a new life in Europe. These Pakistanis crammed into a small room by smugglers in Libya. Some of them believed to be among the hundreds presumed dead. These last images before they embarked on their ill-fated journey. About 750 refugees and migrants were packed into this fishing vessel bound for Italy before it capsized off the coast of Greece. Only 104 survived. And with them, the harrowing accounts of what they'd been through. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I can still hear the voice of a woman calling out for help. You would swim and move the floating bodies out of your way. KARADSHEH (voice-over): The Syrian survivor spoke to us from Greece. He asked for his identity to be concealed for security reasons. His another accounts obtained by CNN not only contradict the official Greek version of events, but point to fault on the part of the Greek Coast Guard. (on-camera): Greek authorities who watched and were in communication with the boat for an entire day insist that it was not in distress and refused assistance. Our investigation tells a very different story. (voice-over): Just before 1:00 p.m. on June 13th, the boat was first spotted by the E.U.'s Border Patrol Agency, Frontex, which says it notified Greek authorities of a heavily overcrowded fishing vessel. Those on board were in distress, lost at sea with no food or water for days, according to survivors and activists in touch with the boat throughout the day. At about 7:00 p.m., an activist in Italy recorded one of the calls, capturing the horror on board. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Can I notify the coast guard that six people died. KARADSHEH (voice-over): As activist repeatedly relayed calls for rescue to authorities, two merchant vessels approached the boat instructed by the Greek Coast Guard to provide the boat with food and water. But as darkness fell at 10:40 p.m., a Greek Coast Guard vessel moves in. Now the only ship on the scene. Three hours later, the haunting last words from the boat to the activist group alarm phone. \"Hello my friend, the ship you send is...\" and the line cuts out. What happened next is likely to raise more questions as the investigations continue. Survivors tell us it was a botched attempt by the Greek Coast Guard to tow their boat that caused it to capsize. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): They decided to throw us a rope, so the guys at the front tied it. They towed us, the boat tilted to the right, and everyone was screaming. People began falling into the sea and the boat capsized. People couldn't get out from under the boat. KARADSHEH (voice-over): The Greek Coast Guard have declined our request for an interview, but in previous comments, they've denied towing the troller saying when the boat capsized, \"We were not even next to it, how could we be towing it?\" Instead, they blamed a, quote, \"A shift in weight, probably caused by panic\". For years, Greek authorities have been accused of systematically and violently pushing back migrants and refugees. Video like this one released by the Turkish government captured the now well-documented practice. Grace denies. This deadly incident is not just about what they may have done, it's also about what they didn't do.",

That is dealing with a serious increase in arrivals this year because these countries don't want to deal with rescues and arrivals. And, of course, the concern is, that this is also putting these vulnerable people, putting their lives at even more risk at sea. Anderson?",
