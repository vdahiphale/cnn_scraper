Now, the White House included both issues in a $40 billion supplemental funding request, but hardliners in the House who oppose more money being sent to Ukraine have demanded it be stripped out. This could tee up a potential showdown in the Senate where both Democrats and Republicans want to see both items in a short-term funding bill. The deadline to avoid a government shutdown, of course, is the end of the month.",

We know this because of a new court filing from the special counsel in that case, David Weiss, that suggests this is related to his 2018 gun purchase. Hunter Biden had previously reached a deal on a charge of possessing a gun while using drugs. That deal completely fell apart in court last month, you'll remember. Kara Scannell was live in the courtroom as it fell apart. She also broke this news for us yesterday. It's a significant deal. People read the headline or listen to this headline this morning and they think, what? What's the news from this? Where does this go?",

That's that pre-trial deal that they struck before to avoid the prosecution on this, and that they're going it move forward. So, that's pretty serious. If they move forward with the same charge that they've reached this deal on, that's a felony. That has ten years statutory maximum in prison. It's not often brought as a standalone charge, but he had the possession of this gun for 11 days in Delaware while he was on drugs.",

We've been talking about it all morning and the fact that it could be a troubling sign for Democrats and the president's hope for re-election in 2024.Biden's approval rating sinking to 39 percent. Nearly 60 percent of voters think Biden's policies are making the economy worse. And close to 70 percent of Democrats, they want somebody else to run for president. His overall approval among Democratic voters also slipping in the last month. With us to discuss, CNN political commentator Van Jones and former Obama campaign manager, and former Obama White House deputy chief of staff, Jim Messina. And, Jim, I want to go to you straight away because this week you -- I think playbook broke the news about a slide presentation that you had, which tries to counter a lot of Democratic anxiety tied to the perception that a lot of these numbers seems to underscore, including a line, quote, \"historically, we are blanking bedwetters. We grew up in the '80s and '90s when Republicans won elections all the time. Democrats had their hearts deeply broken when Hillary lost and people didn't see that coming. And so, you know, we continually believe every bad thing people say.\" I understand where that's coming from, and kind of the genesis of it.

What really is correlative is the policies this president has gotten done, the things he has to run on, the matchup versus him versus Donald Trump, those are the things that we kind of looked at. We said, just -- let's put aside all the political spin and let's just look at the data. And if you look at the cards that Joe Biden's campaign has versus the cards that the Republicans have with Donald Trump, you'd rather be Joe Biden and the Democrats.And so, yes, it will be a close election. It's an American election. All elections are very close. But you'd rather have the very popular policies Biden's running on versus the Republicans who seem to want to focus on very contentious issues like abortion, like other things, that are taking rights away from Americans.

They have the largest buy ever done this far out to African American and Latino communities, as well as young voters, which is their base. They've got to go make that point. Their super PAC, which I am helping with, launched a $13 million ad buy in the battleground states yesterday. They are economic messaging to do exactly what you guys are talking about, explain to voters what he has done, why it's good for them and, most importantly, voters want to know what the future is. Voters want to understand what his plan for the future is. And that's what the campaign is doing.Do they have a messaging challenge? Yes, of course they do, but they're taking it straight on and going straight at it in a way that, you know, is earlier and bigger and more robust than the 2011 Biden -- or Obama campaign, which, of course, was incredibly well run, as Van talked about earlier.",

It takes a while for people to feel better. The rate of inflation has come down but prices have not yet come down. And as I've said before, people's number one enemy is not Joe Biden, and it's not Donald Trump. The number one enemy is the check-engine light. The check-engine light. Because when that thing comes on, you're going to have to spend a thousand bucks to even find out what's wrong with the car sometimes, and you don't have it. And so you've got a lot of people driving to work. They're just worried about the check-engine light. You're got a lot of people who are just literally $100 or $500, a blown tire, a persistent cough that they're scared to go get checked out. Their insurance won't cover it, the checkup. But also, what if something's wrong? You don't have the money. People are dealing - are afraid of check engine lights and coughs. And until somebody makes it clear that not only they understand that they're fighting for them, until the prices come down a little bit, not just the rate of the increase, but the prices, we are in some real vulnerability. And what I saw in 2016, every time I came on and said, I think Donald Trump is stronger than we think, I got beat up in 2016. But those of us who were, quote/unquote, bedwetters then were right. And so what I would say is, do not underestimate the pain out there. Do not underestimate the real sentiment that may be worse than these numbers even show. And let's get out there as Democrats and make the case. But it's not just about the talking, it's about the listening. I don't think people think we're listening to the pain. And if we don't listen and reflect the fact that we're listening, they will send us a message that we don't want next November.",
