Hello, and welcome to CONNECT THE WORLD. We are live in Dubai. Israelis and Palestinians traded strikes in the skies and there are fears the latest tensions could spiral further. Overnight militants fired rockets from Gaza, sending a message after Thursday's deadly Israeli raid in the West Bank. Israel says most were intercepted. Israel struck back, hitting what it says was a Hamas rocket site. Outside the Al Aqsa Mosque today, Palestinians protested the Israeli raid.

      "sentences": "Yes, Eleni, so this all started yesterday in the morning hours when the Israeli military conducted what asome rather unusual raids in -- unusual because when the military cresting's operations they don't do so in broad daylight. They do so in the early John hours or early night, and they often don't actually entered the gym in refugee camp itself. But they say that they had intelligence that it group was planning an imminent attack, so that is why they decided to undertake this unusual raid in Jenin. Unusual because typically when the military conducts these operations they don't do so in broad daylight. They do so in the early dawn hours or overnight. And they often don't actually enter the Jenin refugee camp itself. But the Israeli military saying that they did so because they say they had intelligence that an Islamic jihad group was planning an imminent attack. So that's why they decided to undertake this unusual raid. But in that ensuing firefight, at least nine Palestinians were killed, and while Hamas and Islamic jihad have claimed some of them, we do know that bystanders, civilians, were killed as well including a woman in her 60s. And then a few hours later, in short of ensuing clashes and other areas, a 10th Palestinian was killed. That makes it the deadliest day for Palestinians in over a year in what's already been a very deadly year. I mean, just in the first -- we haven't even completed the first month of 2023, and 30 Palestinians have been killed so far, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Now the Palestinian Authority reacted quite quickly and angrily. The Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas calling it a massacre and then taking the drastic step of severing security coordination with Israel. Now this is something that the Palestinian Authority has done in the past. They did so in 2020, but it is seen as a very drastic move. The U.S. State Department reacted saying that they didn't think it was the right thing to do. And then a few hours later, as night fell, that's when we started to see the action in the sky. Missiles were launched from Gaza towards Israel. They are about several rockets in total launch. Israel says most were intercepted or landed in open areas. There were no injuries reported, and Israel responded by striking what it said was a Hamas rocket making launch site. Obviously this is raising tensions and fears over further violence to a level we have not seen in quite some time, despite the fact it's been a rather violent and tense year. And it's coming also right as the U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is expected to land here within the coming days, preplanned meetings with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, but now his visit is carrying a much, much higher significance -- Eleni.",

And that shows the importance that the U.S. government placed on this al-Sudani who they say is a key or was a key figure in the funding and expansion of ISIS in Africa region and beyond, including all the way to Afghanistan. And it speaks again to how the targeting of the terror act as well as terror financiers and go between is becoming increasingly important when it comes to the operations on the continent. The last time I remember this name coming up was late last year with the U.S. Treasury linked al-Sudani to several figures here in South Africa allegedly part of a financing cell of ISIS. So this was a kill or be capture operation, according to U.S. officials. But they said that they met resistance. At least 10 other ISIS members were killed in this. And ISIS is not a particularly formidable force in Somalia. It's more al Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab, so I think it's more the transnational linkages that this particular individual had as to why they went to these lengths for a successful targeting of al-Sudani -- Eleni.",

And tragically many of the bodies of these police officers have not been able to be recovered. So that is what led to the situation to boil over yesterday, when we saw protesters and police among those protesters, attacking first at the prime minister's residence as he was returning from a regional conference in Argentina, and then when he actually landed in the Port-au-Prince airport, that they went to that airport and essentially tried to attack him. Some said they wanted to negotiate with him, but very clearly they felt -- his advisers felt that his life was at risk. He was escorted out of the airport, rescued essentially, by special forces, and then they have taken to this undisclosed location. So the situation remains at this point that the prime minister of Haiti does not feel safe, is not safe in his own country at this point.

Of course, Haiti has a long history of foreign interventions and some of these protesters that we have heard from, from the gangs or on the other side of this, say that foreign intervention would only rile up the situation even more if you had foreign troops coming in.
