This hour, a dramatic new prisoner swap the United States securing the release of 10 Americans, including six wrongfully detained in Venezuela for years. This deal includes the extradition of Leonard Francis aka Fat Leonard, former military contractors who orchestrated the largest corruption scandal in the history of the United States Navy. Coming up, who else is involved in this exchange?Plus, a top Harvard review board accused of allowing a double standard drawing the line on students in plagiarism but not being so clear on plagiarism questions related to the school's own precedent? And leading this hour, just one day after the Colorado Supreme Court disqualified Donald Trump from his 2024 ballot, the former president is asking the US Supreme Court to stay out of a different dispute having to do with immunity questions in the federal election subversion case against him. How was all of this playing in the 2024 race? Let's bring in CNN Alayna Treene and Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez. Evan, the Colorado Supreme Court said last night that Trump is not eligible to be on Colorado's ballot because the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution bans insurrectionists from holding office. The U.S. Supreme Court is going to decide whether that ruling stands ultimately. What might this mean for the 2024 election?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, what it means is that it puts the Supreme Court squarely in possibly deciding how this election goes forward, right? Not since the Bush v. Gore decision in 2000 have we had the Supreme Court so squarely in the middle of essentially the election race, and that's what we have. I mean, you look at the timeline that we have ahead of us, the former president has until January 4 to file an appeal. We don't anticipate that he's going to do that for a few more days. But he -- we do anticipate that he will go to the Supreme Court because January 5 is the deadline for Colorado to start to certify what names are on their primary ballot.Of course they go -- the primary voters in Colorado go to the ballot box on March 5th. So, somewhere between now and then we anticipate that the Supreme Court will speak will say something about whether they're going to take this up and review this decision by the Colorado Supreme Court, and possibly maybe render a decision. Of course, Jake, you know that they're also taking a look at other things as well. And so, one of the things that is really striking about this, though, obviously, Jake, is that we have a number of these 14th Amendment challenges that have been going around the states, from Michigan and Minnesota, New Hampshire, all have failed. This is the first state Supreme Court that has now said that the former president is an insurrectionist and also that the 14th Amendment means that he cannot stand on the ballot.",

And so, if the Supreme Court takes us up now, it really means that there's a possibility that Jack Smith will be able to put him on trial in federal court here in Washington sometime perhaps in the late spring. And that's not what he wants.He wants this delayed perhaps to come close to the election or perhaps 2025 when there's a chance that the former president could pardon himself, of course.",

Well, this has happened because we've had a year of people who are ostensibly running against Donald Trump failing to take the opportunity.

Israel's Mossad director, Qatar's Prime Minister and the CIA director, meanwhile, meeting in Warsaw earlier this week, with a source describing the meeting as positive. Israel putting a new proposal on the table. Another week long pause in fighting in exchange for the release of about 40 hostages, sources told CNN and Axios. Israel would also release more Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli official telling CNN that Hamas is asking for more heavy duty prisoners than before. Until recently, Hamas vowing not to open any negotiations, unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all. MICHAEL HERZOG, ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.: They were hoping for a permanent ceasefire. But I hope that under the pressure of what we're doing on the ground, plus pressure from the Qataris, they will agree to do a deal but it's premature at this phase. DIAMOND (voice-over): Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also coming under significant public pressure to reach a deal after Israeli soldiers mistakenly shot and killed three hostages in Gaza. Netanyahu telling the families of hostages he dispatched the Mossad director to Europe to advance the process for the release of our hostages, vowing to spare no effort on the matter. But he is also promising more war. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Whoever thinks that we will stop is detached from reality. We will not stop fighting until all of the goals that we have set are achieved, the elimination of Hamas, the release of our hostages and the removal of the threat from Gaza.",

We'll basically have to wait and see.You know, Venezuela, needless to say, is a very important country for the U.S. to have working relations with, particularly given the huge numbers of people coming from Venezuela to the U.S. southern border.

He is his fixer, and the ultimate dealmaker. And to see the extent of this, you only have to look at the press release, in fact, that the Venezuelan government put out in the last few hours. They call him our Diplomat saying, that he was kidnapped, Jake, by the United States for more than three years.And you only have to look at the moment in fact, you're looking at there now. And the moment he landed in Caracas today to see the importance off him to Nicolas Maduro, he received almost like a hero's welcome with the First Lady. And then if we have the little video there of Venezuela, Cilia Flores and other high ranking members of the Venezuelan government there to greet him. Now he was arrested just from context for our viewers back in 2020 in Cape Verde while traveling from Venezuela to Iran, his jet actually stopped in Cape Verde to refuel and that's when he was apprehended and extradited to the United States. He was charged with money laundering and bribery, siphoning off some lumps -- something like $350 million from Venezuela as part of a scheme to bribe government officials. On top of that, Jake, he orchestrated a corruption network that enabled Maduro and his regime to significantly profit from food imports. In other words, using food as a form of social control. Now, context here is important for our viewers. For Maduro, Jake, this is a when he shows the United States who was MJ Lee said who is sanctions on Venezuela in October, that he's sticking to his promise of freeing American hostages. Domestically, it plays well too because he shows those who backed him, the Chavistas that loyalty matters. And with an election, perhaps around the corner it may play well as well with his base, Jake.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, Claudine Gay's career is under a microscope. And now she's speaking facing accusations of plagiarism. Now Gay recently submitted corrections to two papers that she wrote as a professional academic in 2001 and 2017. However, there are clear examples of plagiarism that occurred in the 1990s when Gay was studying for her PhD at Harvard. And one example, Gay's 1997 dissertation lifted one paragraph almost verbatim from another, from another source without citation.That offense appears to go against Harvard's current guide on plagiarism, which you stated earlier, Jake. Harvard's plagiarism policy says that students who submit work without clear attribution to sources will be, quote, subject to disciplinary action up to and including requirement to withdraw from the college. Now the first publicly identified instance of plagiarism by Gay comes from a failure to properly cite sources in a 1993 essay. These instances of plagiarism were first reported by the Washington Free Beacon. CNN's analysis led by my colleague Emstek (ph), confirmed some of the main allegations in that reporting. Now Harvard's top governing body said in a statement last week, it became aware of plagiarism allegations against gay in late October, an independent review found a few instances of missing citations, but no violation of Harvard standards. However, it's not clear whether that review included Gay's 1997 dissertation. Neither Harvard nor Gay have commented on the allegations of plagiarism from the 1990's. CNN reached out to Harvard with a list of questions but the school declined to comment. In a previous statement, Gay said, quote, I stand by the integrity of my scholarship. Throughout my career, I have worked to ensure my scholarship adheres to the highest academic standards. And we should note that the plagiarism allegations against Gay were first circulated by conservative activists. And one of those activists has also criticized Gay on Harvard's diversity policies. And Gay's most outspoken critic hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman has also highlighted the plagiarism charges. And he's argued without evidence that Harvard only hired Gay to fulfill diversity requirements. Now plagiarism experts that CNN spoke to stress that this is a very complex issue. These experts were divided on whether Gay's omissions weren't any punishment, but none of them called for her to be fired. And they noted it's quite rare for academics to be fired for plagiarism.

These types of plagiarism reviews, they can take anywhere from six months to two years. This one not even two months, another criticism is that there's a double standard, one set of rules for the students, another for the president of the university. I do think we should emphasize though, that these flames have been fired and fueled by activists, not activists who are really concerned about academic citation methods, but right wing activists who are trying to push out the presidents of ivy league schools who they feel are too liberal.One last point here, Jake, remember when you talk about plagiarism, it really falls into two different categories. One is copying without attribution. There's also the more serious allegation of stealing someone else's ideas. And in this instance, these allegations of plagiarism are really all in the former camp. So yes, sloppy citations, but no, not ideal theft (ph). Jake?",
