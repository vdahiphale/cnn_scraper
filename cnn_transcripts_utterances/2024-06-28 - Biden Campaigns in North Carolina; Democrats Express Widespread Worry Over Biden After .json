He will be delivering remarks at a rally in Virginia. And we, of course, are going to monitor both President Biden's event and that event later from the former president. First, though, let's go to see in a national correspondent Kristen Holmes, who is at the location for that Trump event. Do we know yet what we will hear from the former president later this afternoon?",

They think that he had a win last night. Remember, Donald Trump and most of the people around him view everything as a winner and a loser, and they believe that they were the winners last night. What they prefer for him to do it get out on the stage, take a victory lap, of course, but then go back to the messaging that they want to hear from him. Now, whether or not that's going to happen, of course, will remain to be seen. This is the first time that Donald Trump is going to be surrounded by a group of his supporters. And that is traditionally when we start to see him go off on those rants and riffs that his team had specifically been hoping to avoid on the night of the debate. Now, it is interesting just to note we are in Virginia, a state that Joe Biden won by double digits in the last election, a state that has been blue for multiple cycles, but that the Trump team insists is at play. Now, I have talked to some people who are actually working on the political structure and strategy for Donald Trump, who say, look, this is not something that we believe is one of these key battleground states. But we are seeing a level of movement in the state that we are hoping in our deepest desires that Donald Trump would be able to flip. And, of course, he is appearing here with Governor Glenn Youngkin, Republican who met with Donald Trump just about two weeks ago. Youngkin is a more moderate Republican. So there is, of course, some hope that that would help Donald Trump in this state as he tries to reach voters outside of his base of support. But from what I'm seeing here, everyone who is actually attending this rally is a die-hard Trump supporter.",

I'm thinking of his sister, Valerie. That's pretty much where it starts and finishes in terms of the people that really know him best and that he listens to. So, beyond that, if you even get a bunch of Democratic leaders saying they're -- what they're not saying, trying to convince him, I think the most important two people are those two people. That said, what you're hearing from Democrats on the Hill, what I think a lot of us are hearing from Democrats in text messages, is, they're trying to look past the president's performance last night, which is very hard to do, let's be real here, and focus more on his policies and his agenda and his vision for the future and contrast that to some of the things that former President Trump said last night. Now, whether voters will be able to make -- to look past, that remains to be seen, but that's what you're hearing from official Washington,though I will say, Governor Healey in Massachusetts just talked to some reporters at the Statehouse and said it was tough to watch, which is not exactly what -- that's a bit further than you're hearing people in Washington go.",

And I think last night we saw about 10 examples of Biden being Dukakis, meaning this was a complete wipeout for Biden. And it started when he came out in a zombie-like state and he had a glazed look from time to time and had almost zero ability to fire back. For example, when Donald Trump talks about Afghanistan being such a huge embarrassment to the world, why didn't Biden immediately come back and say, what about January 6 and really hammer him on that? So it was just a night of missed opportunities for Biden, and the optics were terrible. So yes, the Democratic Party is scratching their heads and trying to figure out what to do next.",
