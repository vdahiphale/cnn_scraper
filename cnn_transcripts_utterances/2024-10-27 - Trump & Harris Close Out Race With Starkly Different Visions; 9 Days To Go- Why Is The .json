Now some of it is just suspense, we are nine days out already, nearly 40 million votes have been cast. So some of it is just people cant wait to find out which way this is going to go when we really do not know based on it any of the data we have. And this really is on a knife's edge, but also over and over. Voters for both candidates were telling me this does not feel like a normal election. It feels like something much more, existential. It feels like a crisis and a lot of ways. And so you have both -- both Harris's supporters and Trump supporters saying they really do not know if our democracy will continue. And we have a data on this also from our Wall Street Journal national poll that we released this week, 87 percent of voters said that they believe that the country will sustain permanent damage if their candidate does not win this election.

They are confident they have spent years building out an operation that is going door-to-door, are finding people and I've been -- we've all been went out with them. It's true, they are finding those frustrated voters who might have gone Republican, but for Dobbs, they exist and Democrats have found them. Republicans are really running I'd say on this energy they have that peoples everywhere they go, they're finding people who never would have voted for Trump before, but have come into this argument that he things are better when he is in charge, peaceful will occur in the Middle East when he is in charge, an argument that Democrats really have not had a good answer to this -- this dynamic where he goes to Michigan and says, I'm going to make peace, TBD the details, and it works on people. So they're all -- all these atmospherics that keep going Trump's way. Then you look at the data, then you look at the turnout Democrats have, they are still in a position to win this. And they remember, is this 2020 or 2022 because they do remember 2022.

I mean, she was unvarnished. She was candid, you know, yesterday and that arresting speech, I think pointed in both criticism of which she described as a double standard between Harris and Trump. But also, I think when that speech turned to reproductive rights as well, it really was one of the more sort of emotional and on parts of the speech. And let's be clear, you're right. This election very much could be defined by a gender gap and to see the different ways that Democrats are also trying to appeal to men. There was a difference yesterday and the way Michelle Obama tried to appeal to men, than former President Obama, just weeks ago it was a shift from scolding and almost admonishing men and flying sexism could be at play between men who are hesitant to vote for Harris and Michelle Obama yesterday saying, look, reproductive rights is not something that will exclusively apply to a woman at her speech, almost imploring meant to imagine their wife also going through an emergency situation and because of the restrictions on reproductive rights that we've seen. I think that speech is something were going to look back on here, particularly because of how it represents the gender gap that were seeing.

And what Democrats need is for women to be a very large percentage of the electorate in the past, there are always like 50 to 53. Men are like 47, women turnout more, but this time, Democrats need a really big turnout among women. Maybe like 55 percent, 56 percent of the electorate, in order to make up for the -- really the losses that she suffered among groups that should be with her Black men, Hispanic men.So I think that it's not too late.

KANNO-YOUNGS:  Absolutely and look, I've talked to Republican strategists who have said there is a political vulnerability right there. If you're the Trump campaign talk about the economy, you could have talked about the border and sort of a record number of border crossings over last couple of years. But instead, were increasingly seeing the former president portray America with this sort of dark have this dark description of America. You saw him describe it as a garbage can last week. You've talked -- heard him talk even more about enemies within using the military to target political enemies, just emphasizing the sense of retribution that would occur if he were to make it to office.
