Matt Gorman, former Tim Scott presidential campaign senior adviser also back with us this morning. Thank you, guys, for starting us off on a really big election day. Kristen, let me -- let me start with you in terms of, you know, what we heard from Trump there. That, of course, was his speech yesterday after the Supreme Court decided that he was going to stay on the ballots. But he's talking all about how well these cases, these legal cases would get -- anyone else wouldn't be able to win. I can win. I -- I've heard you talk about this in the past. Like, sure, it seems to have worked well. I mean, Ron DeSantis would say it worked well for Trump in the primary election. But this is really -- today is really about the start of the general. And it seems like it would cut very differently. What -- you talk to voters all the time. How do you understand this?",

So today, as we are looking at Super Tuesday, he's likely to have a very good night. He's likely to really cement himself as the presumptive Republican nominee with these wins. And in all of this, even as somebody like Nikki Haley has tried to make the case over and over, as you saw in that clip, he's a loser. He's got all this baggage. What are we doing?
