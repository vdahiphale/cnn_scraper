This story and many more coming in right now on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. So, any moment, opening statements in the biggest defamation trial in a generation are about to begin. Dominion Voting Systems suing Fox News for defamation seeking $1.6 billion in damages. In this sketch, the Fox lawyer seen on the right. The Dominion attorneys on the left. The company said the network perpetuated false claims that Dominion machines rigged the 2020 election despite repeated efforts by Dominion to correct the record. This morning, the jury of six men and six women was seated, 12 others picked as alternates, and it appears that nine of the 12 jurors selected from New Castle County, Delaware are people of color. Joining us now, we have CNN Legal Analyst Norm Eisen. He is a former White House Ethics czar, and he served as a special counsel for the House and Donald Trump's first impeachment trial. Norm, first, I just want to get your take on the makeup of this jury split evenly between men and women, nine of the 12 jurors are people of color.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a live look at the White House Rose Garden, the podium there. Any moment now, President Biden will speak and sign an executive order to make childcare more affordable and accessible. The order includes 50 directives across nearly every cabinet-level agency to fix the so-called care economy. And if you're a parent, you know all too well, the high cost of raising a child today.Have a look at this. The average price for childcare for one child currently ranges anywhere from $5,000 a year all the way up to above $17,000 a year. That means some families spending as much as 19 percent, 1/5 of their income for childcare for one child. CNN's Phil Mattingly is at the White House awaiting the president. So, Phil, an executive order, what do we expect to hear and what do we expect that to actually cover that order? PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. there's two pieces of this, right? There -- this is the reality of the aspirational not having a clear pathway. Hundreds of billions of dollars for child care, for home care, for teachers, for care workers that the president proposed during the start of his administration pushed, for repeatedly over the course of a series of months of negotiations on Capitol Hill, and ended up not making it across the finish line. Now, with Republicans in control of the House, there's no sense that that dynamic is going to shift anytime soon, and so the president is acting on his own. Now, what this will do will be far short of what administration officials really wanted when they started this administration, understanding how pervasive and an economic issue this is for millions of Americans, for families, for parents, kind of across the board. However, it is trying to leverage the power of the federal government to try and address some of these issues on a smaller scale way. The president directing every agency of the government to try and figure out a way to funnel existing funds -- existing programs into lowering childcare costs and to helping on areas like home care and to incentivizing teachers and caregivers. Is it what they laid out and wanted in the beginning? No, but it is something that they believe they have the purview to try and accomplish right now. Jim, there's a bit of a roadmap here. Earlier this year, the Department of Commerce with $50 billion in new funding, to incentivize the building of semiconductors, added a provision in there that any company that wants to be able to utilize that funding has to include childcare. That's something administration officials are looking at here. So, a couple of pieces of this, more than anything else. So the President wants to emphasize he still cares deeply about this and wants to get something passed. But in short of that, he'll be signing the executive order, Jim.",

The more serious charge is first-degree felony assault, which could see him spend the rest of his life behind bars. The community has been outraged over what happened. We saw fellow classmates of Ralph Yarl leaving their high school classes today for a peaceful unity march demanding action. We know that Ralph has survived miraculously, this -- the shooting, getting shot twice in the head. He is home and recovering.

There you see him nodding after a fellow journalist told him in Russian \"everybody is rooting for you.\" That moment of optimism though was fleeting. CNN's Matthew Chance has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): This is the first real glimpse we've had of Evan Gershkovich for weeks really since he was detained on suspicion of espionage in March. And you can see he looked pretty calm and relaxed. U.S. diplomats who have now been granted consular access say that he appears to be in good health and seems strong. The court though in Moscow rejected his appeal to be released on bail or for his custody to be downgraded to house arrest. Instead, Gershkovich will stay behind bars at the notorious Lefortovo prison in Moscow to await his trial -- well after the decision. His lawyer spoke about how he's holding up inside, reading classic Russian novels one said, and watching cooking shows. The U.S. Ambassador though was much more critical, saying how troubled she was at seeing what she called an innocent journalist in the circumstances and calling on Russia to set him free. And meanwhile, there are new concerns being expressed about another prominent prisoner being held in a Russian jail. Lawyers for Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption campaigner serving an 11-and-a-half-year prison sentence now say he's been beaten up in his jail cell and separately is facing more criminal charges. That comes after the Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was sentenced to 25 years for treason sparking more international criticism but underlining Russia's continued lurch towards authoritarianism.

The Washington County Sheriff says 65-year-old Kevin Monahan fired two shots from his front porch, one of them hitting her car.And just in. A spokesperson for Rust movie productions tells CNN that the filming of that movie will resume this week in Montana and Alec Baldwin will return to finish the project. Production came to a halt in 2021 when cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was fatally shot after a prop gun that Baldwin was holding fired a live round during a rehearsal.
