      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington. There is a lot going on this morning.Right now, up on Capitol Hill, university presidents are getting grilled by lawmakers in the wake of those pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses. In the Turks and Caicos, the head of the government there is addressing the arrest of five Americans for allegedly bringing live ammunition onto the islands, more on that in a moment. And we're watching the arrival right now. We're going to show you live at the White House, watching the arrival of the Kenyan president and first lady at the White House. It's the first official state visit for an African leader to the United States to the White House since 2008. And we'll have more on those pictures in just a moment. But first, we begin with the trouble on tap for Ticketmaster. The Justice Department is expected to announce a major lawsuit at any moment against Ticketmaster's owner Live Nation, accusing the concert giant of operating a monopoly. The government alleges Live Nation have used its industry dominance for years to stifle competition and rip off fans. That issue was on full display in 2022 when Ticketmaster glitches, blocked millions from purchasing tickets, you remember this, to Taylor Swift's Eras tour. As Swift might say, karma is a congressional hearing. That fiasco led lawmakers to grill company executives up on Capitol Hill last year. And CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz joins me now. And, Katelyn, that's further evidence that I don't write all the scripts when they work in the Taylor Swift pun there. But this is a big deal and it affects millions of Americans who are just really frustrated with buying concert tickets these days and other live events,",

      "sentences": "Yes, the dominant provider of tickets for concerts across the United States, Live Nation and their subsidiary, Ticketmaster, they are not out of the woods, Jim. In this situation, they are expecting. There is a very large expectation of the Justice Department and several states are going to be filing a lawsuit against them, essentially accusing the company having a monopoly, monopolizing the sales of tickets to consumers, having a situation where consumers are paying too much, paying in service fees and also that musicians and venues end up in this endless cycle, locked in to using Ticketmaster as their ticket provider.Now, there was quite a lot of blowback both political and in the public sphere after there were glitches when the Taylor Swift Eras Tour tickets went on sale last year for that tour. That was quite a significant situation, but we have been looking, expecting a lawsuit like this for some time by the Justice Department. Now, we have also, Jim, heard from Live Nation leadership in the past about how they have defended their pricing models, how they operate and sell tickets that they do it in all-in, and that they are often allowing prices to be set by artists and the teams around them and that they are very proud that they've been able to cut out scalpers from the process, but that ticket sales and the way that the resale business for Ticketmaster also works, all of that, Jim, it could be leading in the process. It could be leading in the process. It's a very important component in this lawsuit to quite a bit for this company of trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble.",

Thanks so much.Coming up in about 30 minutes, Senator Amy Klobuchar has been leading the charge against Live Nation up on Capitol Hill. She will join me to talk about that in just a short while from now. So, stay tuned for that. Now, to the White House, as we were just showing you just a few moments ago, President Joe Biden and the FIRST LADY, Jill Biden, are welcoming the Kenyan President William Ruto and First Lady Rachel Ruto. Their official state visit marks 60 years of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Kenya. You can see the pomp and circumstance on the South Lawn of the White House as we speak, as they're striking up the band there. And with me now to talk about this, Amanka Anku, she is the Africa practice head for the Eurasia Group, and CNN White House Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez from the South Lawn of the White House for us. Priscilla, I hope you can hear me tossing to you over all that racket there in the background. But what are we expecting from today's visit?",

Now, looming over the pomp and circumstance around me is China's influence in Africa. This factor in scheduling this visit has been China's influence in the region as the U.S. and China jockey for economic and geopolitical influence. [10Now, they are going to discuss a range of issues in their meetings today. That includes elevating Kenya from a regional to a global partner, as well as private sector investments and the importance of democracy. And they're also going to announce a spate of commitments to that end, including unveiling a document known as the Nairobi Washington visit, which caught vision, I should say, which calls on creditors to help and alleviate the financial burden of African countries, but also designating Kenya as a major non-NATO ally. So, clearly, the two countries trying to strengthen their alliance here today, and, of course, Jim, in 2022, President Biden said that he was, quote, all in on Africa, but he hasn't been able to visit like he committed to do as he has also had to grapple with multiple foreign conflicts. So, today, the two will continue their discussions during this three-day visit, including a state dinner this evening. Jim?",

The other thing that is going on with Kenya, obviously, a very important U.S. partner, I was there with Barack Obama when he visited the country when he was in office, but Kenya is devoting peacekeepers to the situation in Haiti right now.

And I think the U.S. was surprised when the Russia-Ukraine conflict started, there weren't that many -- there was some sort of countries that didn't explicitly align with the U.S. And I think that has set off a concerted effort to show the region that the U.S. really cares. And, of course, you know, China is lurking in the background. So that's the context for this.Now, why Kenya? The bigger countries, economies in the region, South Africa and Nigeria, are a little bit more problem children right now, right? So, South Africa has been very clear about disagreeing with the U.S. on Ukraine, on Israel, and on Iran. Nigeria had an election where the president won with just 37 percent of the votes. Lots of Nigerians will be kind of screaming at the U.S. on social media. So, Kenya is a safe choice.",

A part of what a lot of African partners have been saying is that the U.S. hasn't put economic transformation front and center in its relationship. It's been a lot more value promotion, and that's where China was starting to gain an upper hand because it was funding more infrastructure projects, and people saw it more as an economic partner.And this is an attempt to say, look, you know, you'll see a lot of what Ruto is doing on this trip has been, you know, he went to visit Coca-Cola office. There's been announcements of a 1 billion investment from Microsoft and UAE. So, there's, there's a lot of focus on economic cooperation.",

Presidents from UCLA, Rutgers and Northwestern are testifying before the House Education and the Workforce Committee following protests and rampant reports of discrimination.This is the same committee that blasted university leaders from Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT for failing to condemn anti-Semitism as well as harassment and bullying on their campuses. Penn President Liz Magill, you'll recall, stepped down just days after that hearing. We'll continue to monitor the hearing and bring you any headlines as they happen. Also happening this morning, the leader of the Turks and Caicos is speaking out as five Americans face stiff prison sentences for allegedly bringing ammunition onto the islands. In case you were not aware of this, bringing ammo to the Turks and Caicos is strictly forbidden and tourists who violate the law could face up to 12 years in prison. And several Americans have been caught up in this. Let's discuss now with Republican Congressman Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma. He's part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who recently traveled to the Turks and Caicos to push for the release of those Americans. Congressman, thank you very much for being with us. Very important story, what's your reaction to what the Turks and Caicos leadership is saying right now? What do you want to see done? REP. JOSH BRECHEEN (R-OK):  Well, I want to see justice, Jim. And that's what every American needs to be paying attention to, justice. Does the punishment match the infraction? And they passed a law where it's a no tolerance policy. And when you use the word, ammunition, I see on the visual Ryan Watson from Oklahoma, my home state, Senator Mullin's, home state. When Senator Mullin began to dig into this and begin to reach out to the State Department and try to intercede, I called him and thanked him for doing that. And then he said, you know, would you be interested in a trip potentially? I said, absolutely. Justice for these families has to occur. And I'll take Sharitta Grier for a moment, African-American grandmother from Florida, a surprise Mother's Day gift from her from her daughter. So, she has five grandkids. She's never even fired a firearm. She packs this bag that I guess held the firearm and some bullets. And she runs for a quick trip with to celebrate Mother's Day. I mean, this woman is almost in tears. ABC's reporting on the conditions that she's, you know, dealt with. And it's astounding. She's never even fired a firearm, didn't know the bullets were in there. And when we use the word, ammunition, let's make sure we're clear. These are a few shells. In one case, it's two bullets, facing a 12-year minimum sentence, incarceration. By the way, their prison system is sanctioned by the United Nations. That's of note for humanitarian conditions.",

This was a 6-3 decision written by Justice Samuel Alito.And, basically, this was a case where the lines had to be redrawn in South Carolina. This involves districts one and six of the congressional districts down in South Carolina. It's a coastal region near Charleston. And there was a dispute that a race had factored too much into the mapmaking process. When this went to trial, it was said that no race didn't factor in, they were mostly looking at politics, Republican verse Democrat. And today the Supreme Court says that that reasoning stands, that there's no reason to believe that race was the factor for redrawing these lines. Now, interestingly, this ruling centers on the congressional seat held by Republican Nancy Mace. So, this really, at least for right now, dashes the hopes of Democrats to pick up potentially another seat in South Carolina. I will note that even though the Supreme Court is upholding this map and it will be in effect for the 2024 election, they are allowing the legal challenges to continue on this, not on the race part of it, but another claim that these black voters had made. So, there's still the potential that this congressional map could get blown up. But for now, this congressional map that was disputed as disadvantaging black voters, Jim, it will stay in place for the 2024 election, potentially beyond in a 6-3 decision from the Supreme Court.
