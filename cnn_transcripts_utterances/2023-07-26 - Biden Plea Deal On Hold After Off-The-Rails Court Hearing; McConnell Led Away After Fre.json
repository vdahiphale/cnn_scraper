What happens now?Plus, McConnell's health scare today. The Senate minority leader appearing to freeze, unable to speak as he tried to hold a press conference. We have new reporting ahead this hour. And a woman who worked for serial killer suspect Rex Heuermann speaks out, saying he used to brag about skinning animals and blushed when other women were in the room. This is the sheriff in the case shares new details about Heuermann's life in jail. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a debacle. A federal judge catching the president's son Hunter Biden and his legal team completely off guard, blowing up his deal with the Trump- appointed prosecutor. Hunter Biden walked into court this morning, thinking it was fait accompli, this was easy, this was just a sort of an open and shut, it's done, he'd be walking out with a plea deal. The deal, he would be spared jail time for illegal possession of a gun in exchange for pleading guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges. But that is not what happened. In a move that clearly stunned both the Biden team and prosecutors, the judge called the deal into question, even saying, well, is it even constitutional? Now, CNN was inside the courtroom during the hearing. Biden was seen looking down as a prosecutor was detailing his personal struggles, his earnings, his tax troubles. But then things went south, the deal started to collapse. And at that point, it became clear that Biden was blindsided. He appeared agitated and worried, according to our reporters who saw him in the room. His brow furrowed as he huddled with his lawyers. How in the world did it get to this point? And you walk into a room, this is when everything's already done and agreed to, and this just is pushing paper. But that's not what happened. But how did Hunter Biden and the DOJ not see this coming, not foresee that a judge could have serious questions about the deal? And Republicans on Capitol Hill are having a field day with this stunning development, further fueling the conspiracy theories they have about the DOJ being biased and working for the Biden White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC): It collapsed because it was a sweetheart deal from a family that is being protected, Hunter Biden being the main character. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): Hunter Biden is getting a sweetheart deal that no other American who wasn't rich and had a father as a president would ever get ever. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): If you believe the whistle-blowers and what they're saying, no, this was a sweetheart deal, it was corrupt in terms of how it was handled. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

After a federal judge said she was not ready to accept it. President Joe Biden's son arrived at federal court today prepared to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges, and to strike a deal to avoid a felony gun charge.

MURRAY: The plea deal was set to cover Hunter Biden's tax transgressions over a five-year span, his drug issues and his firearm possession charge. Prosecutors say Hunter Biden failed to pay between $1.1 million and $1.5 million in federal taxes. And they highlighted his substantial income from Ukrainian and Chinese energy companies, saying, he did in fact have the funds available to pay his taxes in certain years, but he failed to do so. Instead, prosecutors say he spent wildly on personal luxuries and expenses. (END VIDEOTAPE) MURRAY (on camera): Now our team in the courtroom today said the judge did address Hunter Biden at the end of this wild hearing, acknowledging, I know you wanted to resolve this, saying, I'm sorry, but saying that she has to be careful in her handling of this.

It's something of a high-profile matter, let alone when this very low profile.The attorneys go to great lengths to make sure that this plea colloquy moment goes very smoothly. Why? To avoid a debacle such as this. But it seems very clear that from the judges perspective, it was not entirely clear that one thing that really was really the end all, be all, for a case like this in part, which is, with this cover any future prosecution? Did he essentially have a kind of immunity in which he would not be privy to prosecution in the future? The full scope of the plea was not articulated in a clear enough way for the judge to know and one more additional point here, Erin, normally a judge is not involved in what's called a pre-indictment diversionary program, where the government essentially says, look, you say on the up and up, you will greet our terms, and we are not going to actually charge you with a crime, but we reserve the right to do so. In this instance, it appears they were asking for the judge to sign off on that in advance and, essentially be a part of the group that decides whether or not Hunter Biden actually has abided by those terms.

No, she was concerned about separation of powers, and having a role almost as a third party to an agreement between the prosecution and the defense, and she wanted to understand, it seems to be, that as any other defendant ought to have the right to know, what are you signing up for? You are giving up an enormous amount of rights when you say you're going to plead guilty. You don't have the appellate rights. You don't have a jury of your peers.

JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, first of all, you're right, it is very difficult to watch somebody have an acute event. And I think what Senator McConnell had was a cute neurologic event. It's important to remember that he had a concussion four months ago, which is basically a traumatic brain injury. And about 10 percent of people who need to be hospitalized for a traumatic brain injury, like Senator McConnell, will suffer from a post-concussion seizure. I think that is what we watched. The staring straight ahead was really a very, very stark and actually very difficult to watch. I think he had to the kind of seizure that this is sometimes called an Epson seizure.

So, I think we really know that he had quite a severe injury back in March.But as for how he would be evaluated now, I think it depends on whether he has had this episode before. If this episode has happened in the weeks and months after the event and has been investigated already, which would typically be with full neurological exam and scan, CT scan, and MRI scan, then there might not be any reason to repeat it now.

All of this coming as tensions are rising between North Korea and the United States, and the fate of that U.S. soldier who crossed into North Korea is unclear. Will Ripley is OUTFRONT.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A massive show of force in the North Korean capital. Pyongyang, marking 70 years since the end of the Korean War. A time for North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, to project nuclear power, with a powerful patron signaling support. China, sending its highest level delegation to North Korea since 2019, the first since COVID restrictions plunged the secretive state into near total isolation, led by a senior communist party official with close ties to President Xi Jinping. Russian President Vladimir Putin sending his defense minister to North Korea, a visit to strengthen Russia, North Korea military ties, the ministry says. Two high level visits by Russia and China, coming at a crucial time for Kim's regime, rapidly rising tensions with the U.S., North Korea's longest ever ICBM tests, a barrage of ballistic and cruise missile launches, a rare stopover in South Korea by a nuclear capable U.S. submarine and one week ago, an American soldier surprised sprint into North Korea. U.S. Army private, Travis King, the first active duty U.S. service member to cross the heavily armed border in more than 40 years. The Korean DMZ, the demilitarized zone, is one of the most heavily fortified border areas in the world. That's the reason why you have barricades and spike strips, and all of these military checkpoints, to try to prevent people from being able to go in or come out. I've made several trips to the North Korean side of the DMZ, including this visit in 2015. Is there a real danger here of something breaking out? Yes? That ominous exchange with a North Korean soldier came true last week. A U.S. soldier sprinting across the military demarcation line during a tour of the heavily armed joint security area. GEN. ANDREW HARRISON, DEPUTY COMMANDER OF THE UNC: Clearly, we are in a very difficult and complex situation.",

I think 16 or 17 leaders will attend. Last time, 43. When President Biden extended invitations African leaders, all were invited attended, 49 leaders. So, Russia's isolation actually is, I think, not getting addressed by mass disinformation in the Global South, by visits like this that tried to play up the allies he has left. With regard to the PRC, obviously, we engage the PRC and would find it deeply problematic, as would so many countries in the Global South if military assistance were provided. But right now, again, our focus is to solidify and maintain the solid allied coalition that has existed since the beginning of the full scale invasion. And you see in the wake of Russia's really horrific and devastating decision to pull out of the Black Sea grain initiative, real revolution in a lot of developing countries and the PRC is very mindful of what public opinion and developing countries indicates. Indeed, the PRC is one of the major recipients of wheat that had been coming from Ukraine, from the Black Sea. So, we are hopeful that in the dialogue that exists in North Korea, and every place else, that Beijing is raising its voice and its concern over what Putin is doing. And we would note also that when Putin struck Odesa in the wake of my visit there, it was actually the Chinese consulate that shook and, itself, was damage in those strikes.

It's one of the world's largest suppliers of green, corn, wheat, everything, right? Was known as the bread basket of the former USSR for a reason. The World Food Programme gets 80 percent of its grain from Ukraine. And Michael Bociurkiw, who I had just mentioned, also wrote, Administrator, quote, as much as words of condemnation from austere body such as UNESCO have become a customer response to Russian aggression, words don't repel missiles the way the Patriots do.

I've just been up on Capitol Hill all day today engaging senators about our next request for, you know, additional resources on the civilian side which, of course, will be coupled with security assistance. So, the last thing I'm going to do on behalf of President Biden's preview where that assistance will go. But it's very clear that now that Odesa is a target, that thinking collectively among allies and partners to Ukraine about what the next step is is very important. And I would say that out of the Vilnius summit, the Ukraine NATO Council was created and actually had an emergency meeting this week in light of Russia's decision to pull out of the Black Sea grain initiative, to discuss what additional defenses are needed.",
