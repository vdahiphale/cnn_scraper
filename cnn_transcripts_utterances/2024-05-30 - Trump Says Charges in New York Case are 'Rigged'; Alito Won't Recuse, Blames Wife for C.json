What might happen if Donald Trump wins in November. All right, 6 a.m. here in Washington. Live look at New York City on this Thursday morning, and cloudy there as those jurors get underway with their work. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It is wonderful to have you with us. Jury deliberations about to resume in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial. And we're getting a better feel for what those seven men and five women are focusing on and how the former president may be preparing -- Or maybe he's just preparing his supporters -- for a bad outcome. After deliberating for more than four hours on Wednesday, the jury is now reviewing four pieces of testimony they requested: Michael Cohen and \"National Enquirer\" chief David Pecker's descriptions of an August 2015 Trump Tower meeting; Pecker's phone call with Trump in June 2016 about former \"Playboy\" Playmate Karen McDougal; and Pecker's testimony about not finalizing Trump's payment to the \"National Enquirer's\" parent company for McDougal's life rights. Jurors also asked to rehear a portion of Judge Merchan's instructions. Trump seemed to be trying to lower expectations about the pending verdict.

I mean, they're also, you know, hammering this in a memo, out this morning from Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, which tells me this is kind of a focused political strategy, more than a legal one. But Elliott, let's start with what we are going to go and hear from the jury later on today here in court. The jury is going to read here, I should say in court later today.

Now, it's absolutely the question of intent. And back to this August 2015 meeting. To be clear, Donald Trump is charged with falsifying business records in the first degree, which requires falsifying business records to conceal or aid in another crime that other crime here, either being campaign law violations or tax violations. In order to prove any of that, you have to prove that Donald Trump is at the center of it, knew it, put it in motion, or actually, you know, engaged in the act himself. This August 2015 meeting is critical to that for prosecutors, because they're Donald Trump is said to have spoken with Michael Cohen, his former fixer and lawyer, and David Pecker from \"The National Enquirer,\" where they sort of hatched the scheme, as prosecutors allege. You've got to put Donald Trump in the room. That's the room that allegedly he was in. And it's clear that jurors are focusing in either direction, to be clear. It's not necessarily that they're leaning toward convicting him, but they just want to know what happened in there. And it was quite telling that they asked about that specific moment.",

He has an acquittal, it will be a huge de for Donald Trump, as we know. If he doesn't, you know, it will be interesting to see what happens six months from now. I mean, it's a long time between now and when voters go out to vote, and whether it's on their top list of priorities, that one of the candidates is a convicted felon or perhaps was charged on a number of counts, but not on, but acquitted on others. I think, you know, the jury's clearly taking their time. They're taking this seriously. Thirty-four counts a lot. I covered the John Edwards trial, and there were only six. It was very similar to this trial. It was a six-week trial, and the jury deliberated for two weeks. And in the end, they had a mistrial on five counts and declared him not guilty on one. And it took them two weeks to get down to that. It's -- there's a lot hanging on, especially when it's political people, when there's like -- and he wasn't even -- he wasn't even a candidate. He didn't move past the primary. So I just think, like, we could see them deliberating for a while. They understand the gravity of this, and it's a lot of material to get through.
