We're going to bring you his remarks as soon as they happen live. But first, we have new developments on Donald Trump's cabinet. It is official, Kristi Noem, the South Dakota Governor who boasted about a lot of things, including Donald Trump. Of course, there was some controversy about her shooting her dog. She will be nominated to head the Department of Homeland Security.Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, the first non-Jewish nominee since 2011, for Ambassador to Israel. He has said some things about Palestinians that are pretty derogatory. He is going to be nominated there. And then John Radcliffe, who served in Trump's first administration as Director of National Intelligence, is expected to lead the CIA. Then we get to the Department of Defense, former Fox News Anchor, Pete Hegseth is being tapped to run the Pentagon. Hegseth is a decorated army veteran with an Ivy League education. He's also a conservative firebrand who has pushed conspiracy theories surrounding the January 6th attacks, the COVID pandemic and more. Listen to a taste of it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Back on 911 (ph), he was a student at Princeton, so his worldview was shaped by the Bush era wars. After college, he maneuvered out of a job at Bear Stearns to get into active combat in Iraq. He earned two Bronze Stars. When he came home, he ran a veteran's advocacy non-profit, briefly tried to run for Senate against Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota.But his path to the Pentagon really ran through the \"Fox &amp; Friends\" morning show. Trump loved watching Hegseth on the show. He invited Hegseth to dinner at the White House back in 2017. So I can explain this pick in two words, Dana, woke military. Hegseth has rallied and ranted against the Pentagon's adoption of so-called social justice policies. He's argued that woke policies are hurting military recruitment. He came out with a bestselling book titled \"The War on Warriors\" earlier this year that was promoted endlessly across Fox. And he said he agreed with Trump when Trump said, we need to get the woke generals out of the military.",

Tom Holman is the Border Czar. He left Fox on Monday. Hegseth left Fox on Tuesday. This is all happening very quickly. I mean, literally, Hegseth gave his notice to Fox within the last 48 hours, and it's a head spinning change for him.He is going to be overseeing a department that has about 3 million employees. He has seven kids and recently relocated to Tennessee. He is first and foremost a television star, but we know that's what Trump cares about. He watches very carefully. We'll see how much opposition though Hegseth faces in the coming weeks since his selection has caught so many people off guard, even some Senators saying they barely know who he is. I remember Dana, when I was working on a book in 2020 called \"Hoax\". I talked to a lot of sources inside Fox and they told me that they felt like Hegseth produced his show, hosted \"Fox &amp; Friends\" specifically to appeal to Trump. Hegseth would look at his phone during the commercial breaks to see if Trump had tweeted anything he had said yet.
