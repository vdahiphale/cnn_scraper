The Special Counsel, Jack Smith, laid four federal charges at his door, stating in a 45-page document that the former president conspired to defraud the United States in his attempts to overturn that election, it ultimately led to the January 6th attacks.

The Trump people, the people whoare completely on his side are basically saying, this is just political. This is all about, you know, weaponizing of the Justice Department, weaponizing the government. And let me just read what it says. The response is, these un-American witch hunts will fail and President Trump will be re-elected to the White House so he can save our country from the abuse, incompetence, and corruption that is running through the veins of our country at levels never seen before. From a legal perspective, we just said that, you know, if he's convicted it could be 50 years or so on all charges, which is -- which would be the rest of his natural life behind bars. What would you say, and I know this is political, but from the legal perspective to that kind of defense by the defendant?",

The indictment is detailed, it references contemporaneous notes by people who were in communication with the former president, including Vice President Pence, about the pressure that the former president was pushing -- putting on him to obstruct the certification of the legitimate electors. It recounts in detail all of the actions taken by Mr. Trump and his co- conspirators to perpetrate the subversion of the election results. And it shows how he was told repeatedly by advisers, including the attorney general of the United States, who he appointed and other top officials at the Department of Justice and in the White House Counsel's Office that the theories that were being promoted as for why what he was trying to do was possible, that those theories were completely unfounded, he was told repeatedly that he had lost the election. And so again, if you look at the evidence, at least as presented in this indictment, and a grand jury found was supported by evidence to the standard of probable cause, it's really impossible to come away with the conclusion that this is anything but a just prosecution founded in evidence.

My suspicion is that the Special Counselcharged only Mr. Trump in this indictment, notwithstanding having identified other co-conspirators in order to maximize the chances that this could be brought to a trial in the most expeditious fashion. Mr. Trump will, I believe, argue that he needs more time in order to re- litigate certain issues like whether there was election fraud. His attorney also had suggested in his remarks yesterday that that was something that they wanted to pursue. I suspect that the judge presiding over the case may well say the question of whether there was election fraud has been litigated repeatedly in the state courts and it has been found repeatedly by those courts that there was no fraud. So, there's no need to allow Mr. Trump and his lawyers in this case to pursue those issues again. If the judge were to take that position, then I don't see a reason why this needs to be a delayed any longer than the timeframe that the Special Counsel is likely to propose. There will be many witnesses in this case that. It is a complex case. And so, it will take a good deal of time to try. But I don't see any reason why it needs to be prolonged indefinitely, or certainly past the election to re-litigate issues of election fraud, nor frankly, is there a basis for saying that because it was delayed this point that it needs to be delayed further.",

And even in other cases of extraordinary public importance, judges have been able to find jurors who meet that standard. With respect to the judge, she does have familiarity with events of January 6th. She has sentenced individuals who are committed convicted of crimes related to January 6th riot.

Now, as you also know, and I understand that there are many who -- or some rather who are criticizing the grand jury or the Special Counsel and their collective actions in this instance, what I would say -- or rather point folks to is the statements made by the Republican minority leader of the United States Senate, Mitch McConnell, who just moments after I deliver that speech and the verdict was ultimately rendered, said in a floor speech that he believed that President Trump was practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of that day, and of course, stated the understanding here in the United States that is long governed our constitutional system, which is that former presidents are not insulated or immune from legal liability from the criminal justice system or from civil liability. Again, those are the words of former Republican -- or rather current Republican senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell. And so, again, from my perspective, the decisions made by the Special Counsel are decisions that he and the grand jury will, of course, defend during the course of this particular case.

I started the piece with the story from several years ago. I am a high-risk obstetrician, a maternal fetal medicine specialist. I was in the hospital working a shift on labor and delivery, and I was called emergently to our triage unit, just our small emergency room that we have for pregnant patients. And there, I found a patient who was about 20 weeks pregnant. She had a very high fever and she wasn't breathing well. And the story that she told me was that she had started to have symptoms of urinary tract infection, which is very common in general but is very, very common in pregnancy. She had gone to her doctor and gotten a prescription, but when she went to the pharmacy, they wouldn't fill it. Then, she wasn't very clear on why, whether there was a trouble with payment or identification, but she just didn't her medicine. And over the next few days she started get progressively sicker. Back pain, started to contract and she eventually called 911 when she became short of breath. When she came to see us, we very quickly were concerned about a kidney infection, which is something that happens if you have an untreated UTI. And also, can lead to preterm labor or even respiratory distress, breathing difficulty if it's really uncontrolled.",

KARKOWSKY: I hesitate because I can't fact-check any of this. But I will tell you this. Ballpark, a day and a half bill like $2,000 to $3,000. But you add ICU level care, which is what we often managed to provide on a labor and delivery unit for somebody who is experience preterm labor and needs that higher level of nursing, higher level of doctor care, it's often $5,000 a day, right? So, it's very cost-effective to prevent that kind of admission. Even at the same time, I'm really, really proud of my team that can assemble and often does assemble so quickly for a patient who is sick and brings so much expertise and so much passion and so much devotion. You know, I've got a team that's obstetricians and anesthesiologists and the NICU team, we are ready. But you are right, we are very expensive.",

One of the chapters in my book, my book that came out one week before the pandemic, which would not recommend as a marketing technique, just in general. My longest chapter is about systems. And systems always sound like such a boring topic, right? Paperwork and rules and work flows and algorithms. But I think what I am hoping I have shown in that chapter is that it is also people's lives and people's time and people getting sick or people getting what they need because of those rules and algorithms and administrative burdens. And this has been something that as I have become more experience in medicine, as I become somebody who manages more and more of my colleagues, I am starting to see the bigger picture and I am trying to put that together in my writing to show all of us, to show all of you so that we could have these conversations. So, it's something that I talked about in my book.

How is this overlooked? DR. KARKOWSKY: I have to tell you that I think is sort of the curriculum that I learned in med school, right? Immediately after learning all of the pharmacology and all of the anatomy, you start working with patient, and the first thing that you start to learn is that nothing that you need to do is helpful in any way until you can get it to the patient, right? And then, getting it to the patient is its own discipline. Its own sort of academic pursuit. It's an own complicated experience. And I think for patients, they are learning that as well.

What I can say is this, the American health care system -- and when I talk about that I don't just mean me or a hospital or even a clinic, I mean all of it. Your insurance provider, their claims adjusters, every single one of us who is adjacent to how health care gets both provided but also paid for and approved and disapproved, all sorts of things. It's a massive multitentacled beast of an industry, right? Most of which is there to help you, but like any large system, I think, has to make rules. I sometimes compare to like the military, except unlike the military, you are all going to end up in it at some point because it's very rare to not be a patient at some point in your life. And there's going to be a lack of transparency and orientation to the processes which are going to govern your life, often when you are at your most stressed or feeling your least well, unable to handle them.

KARKOWSKY: Yes. I work in New York State. In New York State, and I feel very blessed by this. If every single pregnant patient is insured, done. Eligible for Medicaid. I feel very, very lucky in this setting. I never have to worry in that way. Postpartum coverage could be better. Preconceptual coverage can be better. But once they're pregnant, and because I exclusively take care of pregnant patients, that's all of my patient population, and I still see this tremendous burden. It's not just about being uninsured. I think everybody who has insurance handles this, how many phone calls did you have to make to get to a specialist? How many forms did you have to fill out to get your right medication? How many times did you press the wrong number on a phone tree and you spent another hour waiting for somebody who really knew what the right answer was and could provide you that expertise?",

It's very, very hard to estimate time cost. It's very, very hard to know a much time people are spending. But I will say this, I see how we fixed other things. So, for example, the way that we pay attention to maternal mortality and morbidity. The way we pay tension to not delivering babies before 39 weeks at a very good reason, causing complications of early term birth. The way we do that is we pay attention. We publish metrics. We grade people. We sort of shine light on the subject and we also make that knowledge public. We tell people this clinic has an A plus. This clinic has B minus. Where would you rather go? And I guess I wonder if there is any room for calculating time costs and requiring a metric that reflects that kind of time. Maybe something that we would do across the country so that people would know, this place is a place that values my time and has soothes the way. This place doesn't.

KARKOWSKY: I do think there's something here that we haven't discussed, which is cost. You know, the United States pays more, overall and per person and, you know, as a percentage of GDP for health care than anywhere else. And there are ways in which we get less for it, right? There's -- our maternal mortality is awful. Our maternal mortality for women of color is truly shameful. And we spend more money than anyone else. And some of this, I think, is from the complexity of the system we are in. We don't have a single payer. We don't even have a single payer per region. We have a capitalist marketplace, right, mostly combined with public insurance, which is a very large player. And so, I think it's just a very strange and complex scenario and one that's very, very hard to drive, one that's very hard to drive change in because it's really complicated. There is a fair amount of government interference but there's also a fair amount of just market forces. And because of the unique mix that we have, we have some wonderful things. I am really proud of my team that could gather and provide amazing care in under an hour for our sick patients, but we also have these cost, which is that everybody's got six different forms because if six different insurance companies and seven different pharmacies and nobody has come to any sort of agreement or standardization. But the cost, I think, is real and a real driver. And I don't think it is wrong to want to bring that cost down. I mean, we all pay for, that right? We pay for premiums. We pay in the federal budget. Bringing the cost down is something I think we are going to have to do. It is just that sometimes companies make the decision to bring the cost down by making the administrative burden higher, and that only works if you don't count the administrative burden as a cost.",

We love our patients. We spent a long time becoming good at this work, and this work is very, very hard. But it is also true that many of us spend hours and hours and hours on administrative burden. You know, these are tests that they don't bring revenues, they are not billable for the most part. And so, because of that, depending on what setting you work in, they may or not be supportive.
