He's been very public about his addiction problems. Now, this will all take place before Judge Maryellen Noreika. She is a Trump appointee, someone that was unanimously confirmed by the Senate and a longtime attorney here in Wilmington. So she will oversee this plea hearing. The prosecutors are expected to go through the elements of these crimes. She will have an opportunity to ask Hunter Biden questions. So we may hear a little bit from him today in court as he answers her questions about what he did. And he admits to the guilt of this crime entering this plea of guilty. Now, we may also learn from prosecutors, or potentially Hunter Biden's team, some more details about this plea agreement. Now, our sources tell us that prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence of probation for this tax misdemeanor charges. Each of those charges could carry a prison sentence of up to 12 months in prison. And as you say, this could potentially resolve this five-year running investigation into Hunter Biden's finances.
