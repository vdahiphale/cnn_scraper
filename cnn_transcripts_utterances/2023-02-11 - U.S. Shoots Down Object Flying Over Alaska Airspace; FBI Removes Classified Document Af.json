As we left the city yesterday, there was a very strange moments with utter, unadulterated panic. A rumor had spread in the crowd that a dam had broken nearby and the floodwaters were about to hit the city. Not true, I should stress at all, but it causes intense panic where we were, people to flood into their cars to try and rush out on a blocked road. And then afterwards, when the calm has set in, locals began chasing men they thought were in fact thieves who may have used that opportunity to try and rob an abandoned building. This is the breakdown, I think, of the initial trust and good humor amongst everybody trying to get through this moment as resources don't arrive as it is clear, buildings will still be uninhabitable that there is really no future amongst the wreckage of the buildings of Antakya that have been damaged by the quake. Anger will begin to grow, recriminations possibly struggle for space, in what shelter there may be. We began to see a bit of that, echoes of it today, possibly in the Austrian army saying it's pulling it's people out because of security concerns, not against them, but between different groups in some of the quake areas. A struggle on top of the current one for the Turkish Government as well, and one that just deepens the anxiety and misery of those courts, millions of them, in these quake-ravaged areas.

In the latest instalment of Disney versus DeSantis, Florida lawmakers approved a bill yesterday turning control of the land around its Orlando area theme parks from Disney over to Florida's governor. For 55 years, Disney has operated the 4, essentially its own government with expansive control over its property. Power that once DeSantis signs the bill will soon be his.Keep in mind, the five-member board that Disney appointed to control that district is going to be replaced by one that DeSantis gets to pick himself. The governor called on lawmakers to strip Disney of its special governing power last year after the company vowed to get his so-called, \"Don't say gay\" law repealed or struck down by courts. In a statement to CNN this week, the president of Walt Disney World Resort said \"Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world. And regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit us each year.\" We want to dig deeper now on this with Richard Foglesong, he wrote a book about Disney's influence in the Sunshine State, called Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.

More than a million people across the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia could see flooding this weekend.Let's get the forecast with CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. Good morning, Allison. ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): And good morning. Yes, the unfortunate part with a lot of this rain is that some of these areas have completely saturated ground, and that's going to lead to flooding in some of these spots as the rain continues to slide in. Now, we've got flood watches in effect for areas of Georgia and Florida. But more states may get added to these flood watches in the coming hours as that rain spreads. The concern at least in the areas where we do have the flood watches, look at how much rain has fallen in just the last 48 hours. You have widespread four to six inches here from that little bit of a stretch. And now we're going to be putting more rain on top of it. Here is a look at the main system, as it will slide up to the north and east along the east coast in the next two to three days. Yes, we could even end up seeing some snow in areas of the southern Appalachians overnight tonight as those temperatures do drop back. Another concern in addition to the flooding is also going to be the potential for severe. You're talking cities like Orlando, Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Tampa. The main threats will be isolated tornadoes, and also damaging winds. But even outside of that target point, winds are also going to be a concern farther north. Areas of South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, looking at wind gusts up around 40 miles per hour. That's important, because as that ground is saturated, you get those gusty winds that can bring down some trees, leading to some power outages and blocking some of the roadways. We also have winter storm warnings and -- advisories in effect for some of the areas of the southern Appalachians, where yes, it may not necessarily be a lot, Boris and Amara.
