The High Court says it will fast-track consideration, of Trump's claim that he's immune from prosecution, in his election case. Plus, Rudy Giuliani in court, today, with a jury is set to decide how much he'll pay, for defamatory lies that threatened the lives of two election workers, lies, I should note, that he is still pushing outside the courtroom. Also, the pregnant woman at the center of a flashpoint, in America, right now, has just left her home state, to get an abortion, as the Texas Supreme Court has just ruled against her. We'll have the latest. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we have exclusive reporting, in the Trump classified documents case. A phone call that, apparently is of interest, to Special Counsel, Jack Smith, from the former President, to a former longtime employee, at Mar-a-Lago, who was there, for key conversations, surrounding that case. More, on that important reporting, in a moment. But also, we have major news, about the nation's highest court, on Jack Smith's second case, against Donald Trump, which the Special Counsel is warning could be delayed indefinitely, if the justices don't intervene. He's asking them to move, and to do so quickly. Now, the Supreme Court has agreed to at least put its consideration, of whether or not to hear that case, on a fast-track. At the heart of this is Trump's argument that he's immune from prosecution. By doing this, Jack Smith is essentially leapfrogging, past an appeals court, on the matter, where it was likely headed next, likely trying to beat Trump at his game that we know his lawyers are at least pursuing here, of delaying his legal troubles. Jack Smith is arguing that quote, \"Nothing could be more vital\" to our democracy than holding a former President accountable. The Supreme Court responded, just hours after he made that filing, and gave Trump's team a deadline, of nine days from now. Trump's claim has been that Presidents are exempt from being prosecuted, in federal court, for crimes that were committed, potentially, while they were in office. He has now until December 20th, to respond to this expedited ask, by Jack Smith. He responded to Jack's Smith's filing, unsurprisingly, by criticizing him. He does so, on a near-daily basis, saying that he is quote, \"Attempting to bypass the appellate process.\" Here's what his legal team has argued previously, about the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Jack Smith is basically trying to, to go over that and say, \"Eventually, this is going to go to the Supreme Court, I might as well go to them now.\"What do you make of the fact, Tem that they went, and the Supreme Court justices responded, quickly, not necessarily of what they're going to do with the case, but to at least fast-track whether or not they will hear the case? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, JANUARY 6 HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE: I think it's a positive sign, for Jack Smith. I think this shows they're taking it seriously that they're going to act swiftly. And I think it makes it all the more likely that in the long-term, we're going to hear -- get it to a quick resolution of this case. I mean, it's clear the former President wants to have it both ways. Kaitlan, as you know, before Judge Chutkan, he was asking her to basically stay all deadlines, as they were going up with the circuit, trying to slow things down there, because he says he needed a higher court to rule, because he would be harmed, if the case went forward, and he was ultimately found to have immunity. Jack Smith is calling his bluff. He's basically saying, \"If you really think you have immunity, let's go to the ultimate decider now.\" And I think that's a good move here. It's bold. But I think it's what's required. Because if you have a delay here, I think it's likely that will -- President Trump would never see a day in courtroom, if he wins the presidency. COLLINS: How do you think the court sees this? I mean, you have been on the other side of the Trump delay tactic. They don't shy away from it. They openly acknowledge that this is a tactic of theirs, to delay this past the election. How do you think the Supreme Court looks at this? VANCE JR.: In our own experience, in litigating to the Supreme Court, in trying to obtain Trump's tax returns? First of all, the -- every court at every level treated it seriously, the District court, the Appellate court, the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court, in terms of moving the case, in its calendar. So, I think they -- I think they will treat this as a serious issue. I don't know how they come out. But I do you think that they will -- they understand the importance, and the timing of Smith's request. And I think they will respect that is my guess. But I -- but how they rule on it? If, in my view, if they're looking at Supreme Court precedent, I think I know how they would rule on it. I really don't know what they're going to do.",

I mean, is that something that is at all likely here, you think? AGANGA-WILLIAMS: I think it's unlikely that Justice Thomas would recuse himself. But I think the calls, for that consideration, are very appropriate. The Committee had messages between Ginni Thomas, and the Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, about the very issues that President Trump is charged with. And she was expressing her support, for overturning the election results, to Mark Meadows, as he was playing train conductor, for all kinds of folks, trying to get messages, to the White House. I think, if you imagine the same scenario, and you found out, for example, that Judge Chutkan's husband was involved with these issues, I can guarantee you the former President will be calling for her, to recuse herself. So, I think, here, when you find the facts as a justice here, his wife having access to the White House? And she doesn't have access, in my opinion, because she was somehow purely a conservative leader. It's because of who she's married to, which is a Supreme Court justice. And I think it does undermine the Court's independence, to have Justice Thomas weighing in, when his wife was involved, in the same orbit of criminal conduct.",

He thinks that that court is politicized, and will tip to his favor. And obviously, Jack Smith doesn't think that. I certainly don't think that. And I think it's a great strategy, Kaitlan.

He's just not able to say that. You have one of the key witnesses, ran the Freedom Caucus, and was his last Chief of Staff. And so, that's right inside the wheelhouse. And so, that's another reason why he's worried, about these people that have access to his phone, or he's talked to, on the phone. Kaitlan, you covered him for a long time. And you had sources, inside the White House, that were always concerned, about the President's morality, and his judgment, relating to what was legal and what wasn't legal. And I think Jack has evidence that proves a lot of illegality, on the part of the President. And so, the question I was going to -- would love to ask Cyrus, or others is, are they able to submit proof of what the President did with the Supreme Court? Or is this a procedural case, in front of the court, in terms of what's going on, with immunity, while you're president? And so, I think that's that issue, because if Jack comes out this thing, with five or six smoking guns, I'm just wondering what justice who wants there to be impartiality, and wants to preserve the American democracy, how they would feel about those facts, if they unfolded?",

Look, Kaitlan, I had the news given to me that I had an ectopic pregnancy. That means that the fetus is not viable. And that means that if you don't terminate the pregnancy, you could die in the process. And so, I know what it's like, to get that heart-wrenching news. Her news is much worse.

Making her give -- taking away her choice, taking away her right, taking away her ability, to get health care, in her own state? I've heard so many people say online, cavalierly, casually, \"Oh, but why didn't she go to another state?\" Do you to know what it's like to have to terminate a wanted pregnancy, and not be able to go and lay down, in your own bed? Not be able to go cry, into your own pillow? Not be able to lean on your friends, and your family, and your village, where you live? Not be able to go to see your doctors? To have to go out of state, stay in a hotel, incur that cost, incur those extra days of missing work? Do people understand what that takes, having to leave your village, in order to have to go vouch for your life, and take care of your own health, somewhere else? That is cruel. That is inhumane. That is certainly not American. And it's certainly not God's will. Shame on those politicians in Texas, telling this woman, what she can or cannot do. And I want to remind America, that it's not just Texas. It's also Deborah Dorbert, in Florida, the woman who had a fetus, who had a baby that had no kidneys, and who was told that child was certainly going to die. And she couldn't get an abortion, in Florida, and had to hold that baby, in her arms, for 90 minutes, as that baby gasped for air, and died in her arms. And it's 14 other states that have laws like this that are incredibly restrictive. And so, for people who think, maybe this is just Texas, or maybe this is just Florida? No. Every woman in America should be indignant, at the idea that politicians are telling us, and telling doctors what to do. Criminalizing doctors? Criminalizing doctors? Criminalizing women?
