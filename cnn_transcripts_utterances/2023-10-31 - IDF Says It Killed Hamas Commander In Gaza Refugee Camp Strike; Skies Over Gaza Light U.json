So, following that Israeli strike on a refugee camp, the largest refugee camp in Gaza. We are now seeing this and we understand that there has been rocket fire in the skies over Gaza as well.All right. Let's talk more about all of these developments. We're joined now by Senior Columnist and Editor at The Jerusalem Post, Yaakov Katz, and we are also joined by White House and National Security Correspondent for The New York Times, David Sanger. Yaakov, first off, the Israeli military now claiming that it killed a Hamas commander, one who was responsible for the October 7th massacre in this strike on the Jabalya refugee camp. Obviously, it did so at the expense of civilians living there. We can just see with our eyes the collateral damage. What do you make of what we're seeing? YAAKOV KATZ, SENIOR COLUMNIST &amp; EDITOR, THE JERUSALEM POST: Look, Israel warned that this, unfortunately, is what's going to happen because of the way the Hamas cynically embeds itself in civilian infrastructure. And for that reason, just over three weeks ago, after the October 7th massacre inside Israel and Hamas' invasion, Israel spent three weeks trying to urge, and about 90 percent of the people who reside in the north of Gaza move to the south where there is that American and Egyptian-led humanitarian effort. But with that said, Israel needs to be able to defend itself. It needs to take out these terrorists. Ibrahim Biyari, who's the commander of Hamas' central Jabalya battalion, was the target and was taken out of, in this strike. He was responsible for sending those Nukhba Hamas terrorist operatives into Israel, who, as Secretary of State Blinken just today testified before Senate and spoke about what they did, gouging out father's eyes in front of their children, cutting off limbs of children in front of their parents, cutting off the breasts of the mother at the kitchen table, and then sitting down to have a meal, right. So these people needed to be taken down. And unfortunately, and this is tragic, right? This is tragic what's happening in Gaza, but there's one side to blame here, and that is Hamas for failing its people and also attacking Israel.",

And notably we're getting word from our team at the White House that the White House sees indications, despite the bombing we saw at the Jabalya refugee camp, that Israel is trying to protect civilians there. I'm curious what your read is of how the White House is handling this response. They're obviously concerned not only about the deaths of civilians, but Israel's endgame in Gaza, and what happens if they succeed in eradicating Hamas.",

      "sentences": "And Yaakov, we saw Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, he was on TV yesterday and he was making the case for Israel. Do you feel that he made that case and I wonder sort of what observers are thinking? Did he make the case soon enough to be effective and has he been making the case for Israel enough globally leading up to this? What do you think?",

      "sentences": "Look, I think Netanyahu probably should be out there more making the case for Israel. This is one of the first times that he's spoken up publicly. We know that he has that ability of an orator and he knows how to speak. So he could be out there doing more of that.But he's been quite silent since the outbreak of these hostilities and probably (inaudible) with the fact that he feels somewhat responsible, even though he doesn't know how to take that responsibility personally. But what I think we need to keep in mind is that on the one hand while the world tells Israel, yes, you, of course, not only have the right to act in self-defense, you are obligated to act in self-defense. But then the other hand - with the other hand, literally says to Israel, but don't kill any civilians. And unfortunately, in this type of combat and in this type of urban warfare and in the use that Hamas makes of civilian infrastructure, right? So when you're going to attack a building like what was attacked in Jabalya, and there are tunnel networks, there's a whole underground city in Gaza. There's what we see above ground in Gaza and then there's the below Gaza City. That city, when you attack a building, if there's going to be a tunnel network there, abscise. And while Israel can do everything it can, and I know that it does, to try to protect those civilians. And that's why, for example, it gave them three weeks notice before coming in. What military gives notice, right? When Hamas invaded Israel, last I checked, they didn't tell the 1,400 Israelis who live in those kibbutzim and those communities along the border, hey, we're coming to kill you, right? They just came in and butchered them. So I think that what Israel did shows a whole other standard in the way that we fight as a country.",
