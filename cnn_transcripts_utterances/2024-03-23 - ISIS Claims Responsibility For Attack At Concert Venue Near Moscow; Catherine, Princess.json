I mean, it's just, that's just the way it's done.You've heard people talk about this duty to warn thing, which is basically a policy that the U.S. government has that when we receive threat information regardless of where it's happening in a place like Russia where we have, of course, grave significant policy differences with Vladimir Putin. And the Kremlin, nevertheless, the United States, and most of its Western allies have a policy of sharing intelligence even with a country like Russia. So, you know, the only explanation is, of course, though the information was passed. It's clear that Vladimir Putin simply mocked it, rejected it. It's unclear at this point is whether the FSB or the other Russian intelligence services actually believed it and we're trying to advise President Putin otherwise or whether they took the same line and said no this is some attempt at, you know, a provocation or some ridiculousness. So, that's unclear, but what is clear is, is that Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin had this information or had information that was very similar and they should have taken better measures.",

So, it'd be easy for him to say, yes, Ukraine.Unfortunately, of course, for Putin that theory simply makes no sense, the Ukrainians it wouldn't -- this is the last thing that the Ukrainians would want to, this is the last look that they would want to try, to try to perpetrate. They want to, you know, we're terrorists. They don't want to say that, they want to say, look, we are simply a country that is under attack, under invasion by Russia. We're not killing innocents like terrorists do. So, it doesn't make any sense on a variety of different levels for Ukrainian. It makes a lot of political sense for putting to say that though.",

And so, that gives perspective. This is the mail, the Daily Mail, big selling of course, it's the same lot as the mail online. And this is how they've chosen to go with it this morning. But it's a mainstream newspaper: \"I'm well and getting stronger every day. I'm going to be OK.\" But the thing I want you to focus on, look at the different commentators that they've got. For once, she must focus only on herself. Richard Kaye, \"A terrible crisis for monarchy, but it will survive this.\" And Amanda Plattel, \"How do all those vile online trolls feel now?\" That pretty much in a way sums up the three legs of this stool, of this story. On the one hand, the personal, the family, the medical. On the second, the constitutional, the monarchy, the big questions of what role plays.

Let's take a look at what was in this bill that funds the remaining portions of the federal government, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, Labor. You can see just the full breakdown on your screen there. And now, that the government is finally funded for this fiscal year, we can take a step back and just talk about how tumultuous it was. We saw lawmakers sprinting up to these deadlines to pass short-term extensions multiple times until we finally got until this point. Kevin McCarthy lost his job over his handling of government funding back in October when he was ousted as speaker. Speaker Mike Johnson, it now faces a threat from Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene for over his job. We'll see what happens there. But look, funding the government in a divided Congress was always going to be difficult. Republicans have a narrow majority in the Senate, in the House, Democrats control the Senate. But what made it more complicated was that Republicans tried to include a number of partisan measures in this government funding process, and that set up a real showdown between the two chambers.

Republicans, on the other hand, are able to say that they got however many amendment votes last night, and they secured a commitment in the Senate to vote on a bill that could potentially overturn a Biden administration rule on car tailpipe emissions.

At the same time, the House only has a two-vote majority right now, and this could drop down by one by mid-April when Congressman Mike Gallagher resigns his office.

A lot of people have number four seat, Auburn making a deep run in the tournament. But Yale was not intimidated. The Ivy League Champion Bulldogs roaring back from a 10-point deficit midway through the second half.And junior guard, John Poulakidas, hitting a big shot after big shot, finishing with 28 points. His step back three with 210 left, gave Yale the lead, lead and they never looked back. The Bulldogs win the second NCAA Tournament game in school history 78-76. Unfortunately, Yale's band could not travel with their team to Spokane. So, the University of Idaho's marching band stepping into help. They quickly learn the Yale flight song. They wear Yale t-shirts in the sands. Very cool move. But Yale and the band representing them will be back in action tomorrow against San Diego State as well. The third time turns out to be the charm for the Grand Canyon basketball team, the number 12 seated antelopes win their first March Madness game in three appearances, upsetting fifth seeded St. Mary's 75-66. The final, Grand Canyon will face number four Alabama in the second-round tomorrow, with a berth in the sweet 16 on the line. We've got eight more games on the schedule today starting with Dayton in Arizona at 12:45. You can watch all the action across our sister networks TNT, TBS, and TruTV. And Iowa star, Caitlin Clark's road to a national championship starts this afternoon with a first round matchup at home against Holy Cross. This single elimination tournament means that every single game can be the last for college basketball's all-time leading scorer or one game closer to the final four to tip off at 3:00 Eastern for that one. And you know the big 10 Championship guys on the women's side average 3 million viewers. It was one of the most watched games of women's college basketball history.
