Just after lunchtime, the market turned turtle, not a huge loss, but a bit of a grumbling, a bit of post-prandial indigestion we thinks from the market as we go into the weekend. The events that have been talked about today: President Zelenskyy telling the Canadian Parliament it is not enough to choose the right side of history, you have to lead. US autoworkers are expanding their strikes against General Motors -- GM and Stellantis. And AI is not the enemy of journalism, a potential friend says, my sit-down guest, the CEO of Axel Springer. On a Friday, yep, live in New York, September the 22nd. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business. Good evening. Any moment now, the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will hold a joint news conference. As you can see, the scene is set, the podiums are ready. Now we just wait for the president and prime minister, because Ottawa is the latest stop on Zelenskyy's world tour. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And again, when President Zelenskyy talks about leadership, he is hoping to be able to rely on Canada to put a little bit of pressure on the other allies who may be a little bit more reluctant. Having said that, given his speech in Parliament, I lost count of all the ovations, Richard. This is the easy part, coming to Canada is the easy part. He is among friends and among a very large Ukrainian diaspora as well. At issue here, though, is that fraying alliances and given what we've heard in the last week, both some in Europe and some in the United States, it will become a tougher sell. I do want to note that in Parliament, he used the word genocide. Again, he wants to make clear that he believes there is an equivalence between, you know, the worst genocides that we have seen in the last century and what is happening in Ukraine right now. He is hoping to underscore that, both in Canada and with allies so that when he asks for more military aid, when he says that more military aid needs to arrive more quickly, that he will actually get a response that he likes. This has not been an easy week for President Zelenskyy. The best thing that happened, Richard likely, was that audacious bold attack on the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet. It was quite a night in Crimea with that Russian-occupied territory, really not knowing what was going to happen, and all of those missiles were not intercepted, not all of them, at least by those Russian defense systems, and that is truly significant. I can tell you what Ukraine and even Ukrainian-Canadians here in Canada is they want to be seen to be on that winning side, the bolder they look, the stronger they look, the more they look like winners, the more they believe they can actually elicit more of that military aid. That is going to be announced here in a few minutes.",

It seems though, in this case that the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet, Richard was hit by storm shadow missiles, or the equivalent because they had a French version of that missile as well. Some of the videos that have been coming out, Paula, sort of alluded to this a little bit. The Russians were saying that they had intercepted most of the missiles, but apparently, one had struck the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Judging by some of the videos that we're seeing coming out of Sevastopol. And, you know, we have to keep in mind that the Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol is actually right in the center of town, as is the port, the military port there as well. So there were a lot of people who are out there, there were a lot of people who were taking videos as this was happening, some of those videos strongly indicated that that headquarters was hit by two missiles, in fact, rather than just by one. So certainly, the Ukrainians are celebrating this as a very important attack to them. They said on the one hand, it is, of course, very important for them to hit the Russians in their centers of logistics and in their centers of decision making, as well and that is something that you're absolutely right, it has been happening a lot over the past couple of weeks, we've seen that strike on a submarine that was in a drydock, a landing ship that was in a drydock, also a very sophisticated surface-to- air missile system taken out by the Ukrainians, and then also a Russian military airbase, all of that in occupied Crimea. And I was able to speak today, Richard, to the commanding general of Ukraine's offensive in southern Ukraine and he says that strikes like that are absolutely key for his forces. They raise morale among the Ukrainians. He says they cause confusion among the Russians, but also on the battlefield itself, he says it makes a difference. He says if they take out a commander somewhere in the rear echelon, that means there is not going to be a chain of command. And there could be disarray on the frontlines, which saves Ukrainian troops and makes it more difficult for the Russians to operate. And also, at least to a certain extent easier for the Ukrainians to attack -- Richard.",

At the same time saying that he fully expects this war to go on, at least for many more months, perhaps many more years. Listen, Richard, this is a tough situation, because as you say, the more that the West continues to arm Ukraine, the more Russia will punch back. And I think what is significant, as well as even if you look at the pattern of Canadian military aid, a lot of what they're giving is what, you know, Fred has been describing over there, from wherever it can come from, whether it comes from US stockpiles, and Canada is paying for it or whether it comes from Europe, it has a lot to do with those precision missiles and that is something that Russia obviously is watching closely, and will continue to punch back hard on.",

But usually how it's set up is there is a target, usually the union just picks one automaker to go after.

Interesting today, of course, Poland has been rowing back somewhat, with the Polish president basically saying that this Grain Deal, that is the great export problem that they've got with Ukraine can be solved, and reading between the lines, there's now a new seriousness coming from Poland, that whatever disagreements they have, must not be allowed to get in the way of the very crucial issues that Russia could take succor for this.

So, we've been really deep into it.The three words that for me capture this week are conviction, collaboration and caution. Conviction -- I mean, the number of people that come now, the intensity of the discussions about how to drive real action, whether it's in food and agriculture or heavy industry, or in, you know, energy systems and so forth. I mean, it's deep. There's a big recognition that, yes, you need to make your own commitments. But the way to make progress is when we collaborate together across value chains between the public and private sector. But also, as you correctly put it, it's about caution. This is really hard as people get into it. People that signed up for targets are realizing in many cases, they're difficult. They worry about being attacked from the far left and the far right. And so, I do think that while people have enormous conviction and there is much more of a sense of collaboration, there's also a tempered caution about just how hard this is going to be in the years ahead.",

I think when it comes to investing in new technologies, or helping consumers like to move to electric vehicles,we absolutely need carrots of the kind that's in IRA. But I think in to help decarbonize value chains, like in steel, or cement, or all the things that we need to do in our economy, it would help -- if we could mobilize more towards some form doesn't have to be attacks, but some form of a price on carbon and some regulatory elements that are not so burdensome, but encourage people to take the right actions. And so, I think you see Europe taking much more of a stick approach. You see the U.S. taking much more of a carrot approach. There's probably learning from both that would help us push things forward.",

      "sentences": "Well, Richard, thanks so much for having me here today. I am just back from four days inNew York with climate week and very inspired by some of the conversations I had. And many of the themes from the week connect directly to that question which is how are we going to scale sustainable aviation fuel which is the single most important lever as we talk about the airline industry advancing toward net-zero. And I think the themes from the week that resonated with me are commitment into action, moving local solutions and scaling them into global solutions. Taking, you know, what many talks about as a business imperative and building it into the business. And so, at Delta, we're hard underway with all of those themes. And they all connect back to the question which is, can we do it? And I think the proof is in the data at this point. So, Delta is doing what it can within its control. You, you know, you talked about single-used plastics and that's clearly important from a consumer viewpoint. But more importantly, behind the scenes we're committed through our cross divisional carbon council to save 10 million gallons of jet fuel every year through our own initiatives, through how we operate. Through lightweight in the aircraft. And then simultaneously, every year, we're taking more delivery of SAF. And you're correct, we are a long ways away from this -- the SAF that is needed to get to net-zero. But we're starting to realize that, you know, we've done everything right to date when it comes to SAF. We've got, you know, we've got the demand signals there through offtake agreements. There's  investments and these startups and most recently, Delta announced a new SAF hub in Minnesota which is bringing big name players that represent the value chain. And we think that's the next meaningful step forward when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel is for every company that's behind SAF and frankly, every company is behind SAF because they need it for their own corporate travel. But for those players to come together and say, what is it going to take when there's optimal conditions when we have the right incentives? But when we also have the right access to both downstream and upstream players?",

Delta has a great partner through our refinery to be able to say,tell us what you know about what it would take to convert a refinery. And it's certainly challenging. That's for sure. We've heard other major oil and gas companies talk about the challenges of bringing sustainable aviation fuel to market in a profitable way. But I think simultaneously the learnings from the refinery is that, you know, we can't just wait for the product to show up or hope that it shows up or let the volatility potentially of the cost, just show up that we need to work as far throughout that value chain as possible. Delta is a great loved brand and we have incredible assets through our people. And so, we believe that that same power that we brought through buying that refinery and helping change the landscape of jet fuel for ourselves can be replicated in the sustained aviation fuel market.",

It's going to take a little while, but that we are an industry that has a plan. And every year, we're going to make progress against that plan. And we're going to route ourselves in transparency as well as data to try to show where -- are today, the progress that we're making. And we fully believe it's an industry in progress over perfection. We have to get started now. We can't wait to 2050.
