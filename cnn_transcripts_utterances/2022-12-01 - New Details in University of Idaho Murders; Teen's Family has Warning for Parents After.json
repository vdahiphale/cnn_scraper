If you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.U.S. President Joe Biden will host French President Emmanuel Macron in the coming hours at the White House's first state dinner since 2019. The two leaders hope to strengthen their alliances and discuss trade, Russia's war on Ukraine and climate issues. Plus, more than 10 million Americans are under winter weather alerts along the U.S. West Coast. Some places are expected to get 2 to 3 feet of snow. Officials are now saying they can't be sure if four brutally murdered University of Idaho students were targeted. They've seen conflicting information in this case. But police saying earlier they believed the killings were the result of a targeted attack. The murderer is still at large and no suspect has been named as students return to school this week. A candlelight vigil was held at the University of Idaho on Wednesday night. Students came together to remember the four classmates who were killed more than two weeks ago and heartbroken parents remembered their children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN MOGEN, MADISON MOGEN'S FATHER: You see how good people can be when something terrible happens. They make you feel loved and supported when it's important. STACY CHAPIN, ETHAN CHAPIN'S MOTHER: Make sure that you spend as much time as possible with those people because time is precious and it's something you can't get back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We don't know if they're going to scrap zero-COVID altogether but certainly these are heartening signs for the people of China who have been living under, you know, these incredibly draconian measures for almost three years. You know, the rest of the world has got on with living with COVID, not China where this zero-COVID policy has been in place.We then have these protests that have, you know, sparked around the country, you know, on a scale not seen for a generation in China. This has really spooked the government and as a result, you know, we are seeing in the last day or so an easing of restrictions in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing among others. People are heartened to hear from the vice premier in charge of pandemic containment. Saying that the government needs to adopt a much more human centered approach. Let me read to you what she told the Xinghua News Agency. Sun Chunlan said: with the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China's pandemic containment faces new stage and mission. There was no mention whatsoever, Bianca, of zero-COVID. She just spoken to the national health commission which has also indicated that China's policy must be rectified in dealing with COVID. So, people are heartened. People are hopeful. We saw scenes today of people driving, riding their bicycle, I should say, through Guangzhou, just bordering us here in Hong Kong. You know, yelling out unsealed. We are unsealed. These are roads that had been barricaded. But certainly, there is a feeling that things perhaps are changing in China. The government obviously hoping that by giving the concessions that maybe the protests will stop.",

This is what the tree looked like previously. Energy saving lights on the new tree will be powered by a generator instead of the city's power grid.

The emphasis really on climate and some of the other interests the couple have and want to express, really, whilst they're here. The lovely conversation has been overshadowed by this race row back in London. A guest at Buckingham Palace grilled about her heritage. She kept on repeating that she was from the U.K. but a senior royal aide asking where from Africa they were from, where their people are from. It was a very awkward interchange. And that senior royal aide has had to step down and an investigation is underway. We'll wait to hear the results of that investigation. Max Foster, CNN, Boston. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
