You get a sense there from that picture of the water. Eight inches of rain fallen already in Atlanta. They're expecting several inches more. We spoke to the mayor, Andre Dickens, from Atlanta just a few minutes ago. He wants people to stay home, stay inside, do not go out on the roads. It's just not safe at this moment. They've also been conducting rescues in Atlanta over the last several hours. People trapped in that water. Now, that's something that Florida has been dealing with since yesterday. The storm made landfall in the big bend area of Florida, but the storm surge all up and down the west coast of Florida peninsula, as far south as Clearwater. Now, with me now is the mayor of Clearwater, Florida, Bruce Rector. Mayor Rector, thank you so much for being with us. We have seen some pictures from Clearwater and the Clearwater Beach area. I mean you had some real surge. Tell us what happened.",

So, double what had ever been recorded in Clearwater.And that caught a lot of folks, old-timers who have lived on Clearwater Beach, by surprise. Really throughout our Tampa Bay regions, throughout our island. Our island's along Tampa Bay.  And - and so it was historic. And being, you know, over 100 miles away from the center of the storm, that was kind of unbelievable that we would have the kind of impact we did hear last night. BERMAN: And isn't that what is so extraordinary about this storm, 100 miles away from the center. It made impact well up the coast from you, yet you still saw record storm surge. Seven feet.

And it was too late at that point for our first responders to get to most of them.We did rescue some people last night, but I know there were two or three dwellings on North Beach of Clearwater that we - we just had to let burn.

He would - he was scheduled to be appearing at noon where he was going to be arraigned and presumably be entering his plea of not guilty, but he has just arrived, as you have seen in the video. The mayor, on his public schedule, had said today that he would be meeting with several of his top officials. You know, part of his effort to make sure that he is letting New Yorkers know that he is hard at work running the city, even though he is facing these very serious federal charges. But as you saw here, it is almost 9:00 in the morning. The mayor just walking into court. We're trying to get clarity on what exactly is going to happen because we're still hours away from that scheduled hearing. So, we're trying to get clarity on whether there's been a shifting on the schedule. But showed up with his security detail, gave a thumbs-up and walked into the court. We're going to - we're going to be in there in just a few minutes and we'll get some details of what's happening inside. But I just, you know, want to note, the charges are serious, corruption, bribery, soliciting of donations, and accepting illegal donations from foreign nationals. We've heard both from the mayor and his attorneys. They say that the mayor has done nothing wrong. Regarding the airline upgrades and some of the gifts that he received, his lawyers say that they were nothing more than that, just airline upgrades. And that a lot of what is alleged in this indictment happened before he became mayor. But that's a critical part of this indictment because Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney, says that what the mayor did was sell his office, his authority, and his power. And that once he took office, he gave direction and pressured city agencies to make sure that they were granting favors and giving favorable treatment to some of those donors. That is what the U.S. attorney is alleging here. And that is what Adams is pledging to defend himself of. It is going to be a tough road ahead because the political implications of this are significant. More than 30 city and state lawmakers have called on him to resign. And we are now hearing from our sources that Governor Kathy Hochul is taking a serious look at the powers that are granted to her, the power to remove the mayor from the officer.

He sort of strode through that. And he also said earlier, you know, kind of with some chutzpah, like, I am innocent. I am going to fight this. Can you give us some sense of what these charges are and how serious this is? JEREMY SALAND, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: Serious is an understatement. I mean it's incredibly serious and it's - grave is appropriate. We can go pull out a thesaurus and think of a lot of words because if there is a conviction, this is not one of those cases where you say, you know, maybe I get probation, maybe there's some sort of supervision or condition of his release.
