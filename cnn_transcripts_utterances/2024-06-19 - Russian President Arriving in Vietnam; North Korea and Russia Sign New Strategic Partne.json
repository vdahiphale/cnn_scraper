The Russian president arrives in Hanoi after agreeing to defend North Korea in the face of aggression and vice versa. Endless extremes. Heat waves, wildfires, and ferocious floods bring destruction around the world. Family fury. The loved ones of those who died in two Boeing plane crashes, asked the U.S. Justice Department to impose a $24 billion fine. And Fortune favors Southeast Asia. The region's top 500 firms recognized amid strong growth, young workers, developing supply chains on some really great beaches. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, in the coming hours, Vladimir Putin will meet leaders in Vietnam on his second leg of his Asia tour. The Russian president arrived in Hanoi in the past few hours, hot on the heels of his trip to North Korea, where he signed a new strategic partnership with Kim Jong Un. The pair promised to provide mutual assistance if either one of them is attacked. President Putin called joint drills involving the U.S., South Korea, and Japan \"hostile\" acts and said Moscow is not ruling out developing military technology with Pyongyang too. Will Ripley has all the details from Hanoi.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera):  And now, we are here in Vietnam, a nation that prides itself on this notion of bamboo diplomacy, strategic autonomy. They say bamboo diplomacy because bamboo trees grow here aplenty and bamboo is known for its ability to bend without breaking. Vietnam is hoping that they can accommodate Vladimir Putin and they can be flexible, but that it's not going to break their relationship with not just the United States and much of the west, but also Japan and South Korea. What Putin is hoping to achieve here is basically two pronged. One, he wants to demonstrate to the world that it's not just North Korea, but that Russia still has allies here in Southeast Asia. That's why he flew directly to Hanoi despite the misgivings of the Vietnamese government, it was a logistical decision more than anything else to come here. Certainly, it wasn't Vietnam's first choice. But also, he wants to figure out if Russia can continue to grow its cooperation with Vietnam in areas like oil, gas, and nuclear energy cooperation, potential military deals, because Russia supplies the vast majority of Vietnam's weapons. And also, how to figure out if they can maintain these defense and energy ties and perhaps even grow trade without violating western sanctions that Vietnam certainly does not want to do that, Julia.

While it's sunny here in Bogota,where I am, you have extreme rainfall, both north of here, so Central America, and Southern Mexico, where we're seeing the first impacts of these new tropical storm, Alberto. Starts with an A. It means it's the first of the season. We're going to have a long hurricane season in the Caribbean, and this is just the beginning and the appetizer of it. And then, we're seeing extreme rains also down the Andes, to the south in Ecuador, for example, which has so far recorded over a dozen deaths due to landslides, mudslides, and catastrophic rains. And these, I think, Julia, tells us two things. It tells, one, that extreme weather events are here to stay. There are new reality that are hitting all across the world over the last few days. We at CNN have brought you reports from Greece to Italy, New Mexico, Texas, here where I am in Latin America, but really, it's the entire globe that is overgoing an endless fever. And the second is that Latin America itself is particularly exposed to extreme weather events because for reasons that have to do with the infrastructure, physical infrastructure, so roads, houses that are built in a way that are not so resilient, but also for governments who feel that they don't have the resources to ask for them to safeguard their people. And that's why sometimes those authorities are urging dramatic calls to -- for their citizens to shelter in place. Take a listen to what they're being told in San Salvador. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LUIS AMAYA, CIVIL PROTECTION CHIEF (through translator):  I want to repeat this, if you are asked to evacuate, do it. If you live near a slope, move to a safe area.

These families are asking the Justice Department not to hold anything backin pursuit of really aggressive criminal prosecution against the Boeing company and several of its former executives, including its former CEO. And they're asking for the Justice Department to impose a $24 billion fine against the Boeing company, in addition to the personal criminal charges against those former executives. And this all stems from allegations that Boeing covered up safety issues that it encountered over the last several years, and that resulted in several safety lapses that we've seen over the last several months. But this dates back, like you said, to that deferred criminal prosecution agreement that Boeing company reached with the Justice Department back in 2021, which related to those two deadly crashes that killed 346 people. The family members of those people are now the ones pushing for the Justice Department to pursue this additional criminal penalty, saying they violated their promise to improve safety conditions on their 737 MAX aircraft, saying that this recent string of safety lapses clearly indicates that they didn't follow through with what they promised. And so, now, it's time to pay up and pay a big, $24 billion. Those still won't cover up -- cover the expenses and the amount lost by the Boeing company as a result of some of its recent issues.

But also, a prosecution and an eventual trial for these former executives can happen before that statute of limitations runs out.

SCHOLES (voice-over):  Mays was as dominant in the field as he was at the plate, winning 12 Gold Gloves. In Game one of the 1954 World Series, his over-the-shoulder catch was considered the key point in the Giants' shocking sweep of the Indians, and has gone down in history, as one of the game's most memorable catches.",

But when you findsomething like that in a world series, they had to pick a highlight and they picked, I guess, that one for the highlight. SCHOLES (voice-over):  In 1958, Mays made the move out west with the Giants and batted a career-high 347. Seven years later, Mays had one of his best seasons, clubbing 52 home runs, winning a second MVP award. During the 1972 season, the 41-year-old was dealt back to New York to play for the Mets and what became the last at bat of his career, Mays hit a game-winning single in the 12th inning of game two of the 1973 World Series, putting an exclamation point on a one-of-a-kind career. But perhaps even greater than his performance on the field was the legacy he left off it, playing his first major league game just four years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier, Mays helped to carry the torch for future black baseball players and athletes, and he inspired his community for generations to come. BARACK OBAMA, (D) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: A few years ago, Willie rode with me on Air Force One. I told him then what I'll tell all of you now. It is because of Giants like Willie that someone like me could even think about running for president. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And yes, they've gone from day one today six and they're the first team through to the knockout stage. Let's show you how they did it because they looked good again on Wednesday against Hungary. A 2-nil win, as you say, Julia, this one played in Stuttgart. Germany taking the lead in the first half through Jamal Musiala, his second goal of the tournament. He is rapidly emerging as one of the big stars of the game. A personal moment for him too, scoring in his hometown. Second half Germany made it 2-nil thanks to Ilkay Gundogan. They've now scored seven goals in two games, which is a record for them in the group stage of a European championship tournament and they still have a game to go. So, Germany playing really, really well. Scotland haven't won a game in the euro since 1996. Back then, it was against Switzerland. So, they would have fancied their chances maybe again today, especially when Scott McTominay put them ahead there on the first half. But the Swiss drew level rather clumsy defending here by the Scots, but that is an absolutely fantastic finish from Xherdan Shaqiri. We're seeing a lot of brilliant goals scored from outside the area in this tournament, that was certainly one of them. The Scots thought they could have won it. They hit the post there through Grant Hanley, but he was denied by the woodwork. So, one-all, final score here. And as you say, Scotland still have the chance maybe to progress. They'll be playing Hungary in the last group game, but they're going to have to win that. In this tournament, the top two in each group go through, but there are opportunities for some of the third-place teams to make it as well, which makes it all very uncertain until the group stage is done and dusted. But it means a lot of opportunity for teams as well, Julia.",
