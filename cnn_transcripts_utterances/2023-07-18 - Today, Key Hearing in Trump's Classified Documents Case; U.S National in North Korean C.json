And they're going to be handling a few things. Number one, what are the procedures governing classified documents?

That will be a legal fight over the next couple of days. Scheduling, when is this dang thing happening? And I think that's a big fight. Maybe we get an answer on it today. Probably not, but we'll talk about that a little bit later. And, again, it's the first hearing in front of Judge Cannon. Now, she, as you may recall, and as people may recall, is a federal judge who got blasted, sort of eviscerated for an opinion she issued some months ago that was really seen as just getting the law and the facts just quite wrong in this case and got overturned by the appeals court.

And this is a pretty high sensitivity and high import matter that they would expedite. Now, something important to know, Phil, is that the whole trial team doesn't need to be cleared necessarily just to start. They could proceed if just one of Nauta's attorneys got a security clearance. Now, Nauta would kick and scream about that and say, I want my whole team to be able to debate the evidence here.

Trump and his associates have a broader goal, to alter the balance of power by increasing the president's authority over every part of the federal government that now operates by either law or tradition with any measure of independence from political interference by the White House.

They've got personnel already, spreadsheets with personnel already outlined. They've got policies outlined as well. So, they're looking to really give Trump essentially a menu from which to choose from on day one.

I know this is fast-moving and you've got people to talk to on the phone.Right now we want to shift over to Will Ripley, who's live for us in Taipei. And, Will, I want to start with what you've heard, at least up to this point in these early moments about what actually happened, but also some context given your experience in that area of where this actually is, what may have actually happened here based on when you've been down there.",

How is the White House handling a moment like this with potentially another detained American in a place where we don't have the best at diplomatic relations at all right now?",

So, you would have U.S. officials talking to counterparts not in North Korea necessarily, but whoever they have in that region to try to get an understanding, for example, with United Nations Command as to who this person is, what the circumstances were around them crossing into North Korea.So, these are questions that we have currently and ones that the White House is trying to answer with U.S. officials, in touch with officials abroad on this situation, including in this situation where we know this was a U.S. national who was on a tour, again, one that is open to the general public and trying to understand what the circumstances were of this person crossing this demarcation line. So, of course, Abby, there are a lot of questions here. It's a fast- evolving situation and one that the White House and administration officials are going to be working around the clock to get their arms around as they try to find some resolution here.",

As I've covered the White House over the course of the last couple of years, I think every month or two, I would check in with the NSC, say, hey, I know you guys have tried to open lines of communications with the North Koreans, has there been any progress? The answer has always been a very firm and unequivocal no, saying that there is still an opportunity there, they are still willing to talk, but there has been no reciprocation at any point.I'm wondering, as we try and figure out what exactly happened here on the ground, the context of the relationship right now with the escalating missile tests and obviously no communication, whatsoever, who would the U.S. officials have talking to the North Koreans in this moment as they try and figure this out?",
