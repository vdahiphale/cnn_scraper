Now this is very close to a place called Kupyansk, which is an active front line, where the Russians have been pressing over the past couple of weeks. And the Ukrainians have been trying to hold them back. The Ukrainian authorities are saying that dozens of people have been killed. But of course, it is still very early going on. There will be rescue and recovery operations in full swing down in that village. It is called Hroza. And Ukrainians are saying that, in that village, both a shop and a cafe were hit. They are saying that both of these are civilian areas. The early indications that we have from the Ukrainians is also that several children are among the casualties. Unclear how many of them were killed and how many of them were wounded but again, right now, those operations are still in full swing so the authorities there are saying that they are still trying to come to grips with all of this. At this point in time, it still is unclear who was behind it. However Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, he angrily blamed Russia for this attack, saying that it was a Russian crime, as he put it. Of course, Volodymyr Zelenskyy right now is on a visit to Spain to meet with European leaders, trying to drum up support for Ukraine in the wake of the United States, of course, being in limbo about whether or not to provide Ukraine with the aid that it says it needs and when that aid might. Come So right, now a devastating attack on a village in Eastern Ukraine near an active front line. But certainly, still very much a civilian area. Ukrainians are saying that their operations to try and save people who might still be under the rubble there is very much underway -- Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They would've been in the stores. They would've been perhaps enjoying a cafe or a coffee in the cafe, that sort of thing. So what we've heard from, I think, Ukraine's defense minister, really echoes what we've been hearing from President Zelenskyy as well. And he has said, look, when it comes to defending Ukraine -- and he's talking specifically about this attack, from terrorist attacks by Russia-- he says we need to have a coordinated effort and support from all of our allies and partners to be able to stop this. And it's really clear that what he is saying there is that the tremors, the political tremors from the United States that perhaps will cause interruptions in ammunition supplies to Ukraine, this is not helpful. So he is talking specifically about U.S. politics in relation to this attack and saying, the only way to defend against this is having joined up all partners working with us effectively in a coordinated way.",

He previously asked for another $24 billion  for Ukraine. Now he is worried that approval for those funds will be delayed by what is happening on Capitol Hill. Mr. Biden's planning to lay out his case in a speech to the American people. So what are the options at this point?

And now, with the race for speaker uncertain, several candidates being people who are typically opposed to funding for Ukraine, like congressman Jim Jordan, there is a whole new layer of uncertainty about whether or not Congress will approve additional funding. The president yesterday saying very clearly, it does worry me, talking about the race for the Speaker of the House and the impact that it could have on the future of Ukraine funding. But at the same time, expressing confidence that the majority of House and Senate members do want to continue funding to Ukraine. The problem is, whoever Speaker of the House, controls the floor, controls what bills come up for a vote. And that, of course, will be crucial. We will get a chance to see President Biden today at noon in the Oval Office with his national security team. I expect we'll hear comments from him expressing why it is so important to keep funding going. But there is, as you mentioned, this broader speech the president previewed. We don't know exactly when he will be delivering that speech. But what he has made clear is that he believes that he will make the argument that it is overwhelmingly in the interests of the United States to keep this aid flowing, not only for Ukraine but for Europe, for NATO as a whole. We have heard him make these arguments time and again. And yet, what we are witnessing is certainly a drop in support in the American public for this funding to continue. But nonetheless, White House officials privately expressing hope that a majority of members of Congress continue to want to see this aid flow and they also believe that the American public, as a majority, is still on their side.",

So if there is no supplemental bill passed, here if there is no additional funding, the U.S.' ability to help Ukraine in the medium and the long term is severely degraded if Congress doesn't step in here. On the other side of that coin is the drawdown authority. There, we have about $5.4 billion  left. And that is what the U.S. can pull from its own Department of Defense inventories and send Ukraine. That is the short term solution. That is how Ukraine gets what it needs right now. But even that has a drawback and that's because, although there is more than $5 billion in that pot left, essentially, the U.S. has only about $1.6 billion in the money needs to replenish and restock what is sent under that authority. So it is a real question of whether the U.S. will use that entire $5 billion or more, given that it can't replenish all of that because that money comes from somewhere else. It is a bit in the weeds there. But it is a fundamental question on how much more the U.S. is able to give if it does not get more money from Congress fairly soon here. There are maybe a couple months or several weeks' worth of equipment and authority and funding left to give. But that is certainly not a long term solution. It is not even a medium term solution. And it is hardly a short term solution. Now President Joe Biden did say they are looking at other ways to find funding here. But even that is not expected to keep this going and keep the aid going in the long term. So this is a serious question facing the administration and the Pentagon right now -- Becky.",

But, Becky, the question is, at what point does it change human behavior? And what is making this worse, obviously, is the globe's reliance on fossil fuels.

That is well above the Paris accords but it is well below the worst-case scenarios of 4.8 degrees that we were talking about just a few years ago. But, Becky, it's really interesting; there are dozens of countries now. If you look at their GDP growth in relation to their falling carbon usage, it has been proven, again and again, around the world, that you can decouple your economy from old fossil fuels and still grow the economy there as well. In countries like Sweden and Finland, that trend is like a yawning alligator, the gap between those lines. Even in places like Egypt, it's starting to separate as well. So it is just a matter of time. But of course, the petrol states, both in the Middle East and petrol states in the United States that are producing these old fuels, are not going gently away. So I think the great story of our time will be that that transition and the fight over how soon it happens, most economists say we are beyond -- we're not going back to that fossil fuel economy.

The U.K. itself, 4.5 percent. OPEC 13 countries are responsible for 4 percent only. Lower them, one country, the U.K. So that is one context to answer that part of your question. The other part about what the oil and gas industry -- I will speak for what the oil industry is doing-- we really don't need to look further away than where we are today doing this interview, Abu Dhabi. Look at ADNOC, global leader in emissions reduction; stretch targets, drive, force behind it, leadership to get to decarbonizing the oil industry in Abu Dhabi, a model to be followed.

You go to Angola in the south, I was there a month ago. I'm seeing the penetration of renewable energy, how they are reducing flaring. There is a lot being done. So to blame the oil industry, which is actually responsible for modern civilization, what we have today is all thanks to the oil industry. Yes, we have to do more and we are planning to do more.

We're leading oil companies around the world, like the likes of Aramco, ADNOC, the BPs, the Shells are all collaborating very closely in order to work together to reduce emissions. That is something that is really important for us to see. The oil producers really are putting their words into real actions. No source of energy can provide what the world will need in the future. It, is again, monumental what the world will require in the future if the world continues to grow at this rate that we are seeing, 2.9-3 percent GDP annually. If the world population continues to grow, every form of energy will be required, including renewables. But renewables, let's be realistic, are something from a very small base.

He is saying about 500 (sic) are dead so that is almost one in seven people there apparently have been killed in the strike. He said what was happening in the village, there was a wake underway in the cafe for a deceased villager.

That means every part of that tiny village is going to be touched by this, as will be the rest of Ukraine, because this is one of the biggest attacks, as you say, perhaps the biggest since the attack on a railway station in Kramatorsk early last year. There have been other Russian attacks similar to this, that have struck cafes, popular cafes and shops, fairly close to where this incident took place.

And I do just want to get your sense of how theRepublicans might lean going forward when all is said and done. Polling certainly shows a weakening of support for Ukraine funding, particularly amongst Trump-supporting Republicans. But across the board, in the latest Reuters Ipsos polling, when asked whether Washington should provide weapons to Ukraine, 41 percent said yes; 35 percent said no. And that 41 percent of support is actually weakened somewhat. This Republican Party sort of chaos and what happens next will have -- certainly not just conceivably-- could have an enormous impact on whether the U.S. continues to support this war, correct?",

It is still relatively close, even in some aspects of the Republican Party.There was a recent \"USA Today\" poll of primary voters in New Hampshire, which is one of the early primary voting states. So will have an increased influence in the presidential nomination process. You had a plurality say they did not want any more funding for Ukraine. But it wasn't far off from the marker that said -- it was about 40 percent or so that said they would support continuing funding for Ukraine. Often, it also depends -- and we do polling and we looked at polling in this -- how you phrase the question; there is continued support, more often, for military provisions, to actually support Ukraine militarily so that they have the resources and tools and equipment to defeat Russia. As compared to economic and humanitarian assistance, which does drop a little bit further down amongst public sentiment. Many Americans believe it is in the best interest of the United States to continue to provide the military equipment necessary. But there is a little bit of a differential when you get to other types of support. You're right, though. Amongst the broader electorate, there still continues to be support for it. And even in a majority of Congress. They were, just a few weeks, there was a vote on Ukraine assistance. And a majority of even Republicans in the House voted for it. And support for Ukraine is nearly unanimous amongst Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who, to this point, have been driving lots of this process.",
