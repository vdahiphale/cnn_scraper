      "sentences": "Yes, Erica and Victor, it's overwhelming for them, right, for the staff, for the nurses, for the doctors, the fact that this surge of RSV -- which you guys said -- very common illness among children, but it's really going to new heights this month in particular.At this hospital here behind me, they're seeing so many kids come in that they're actually having to treat them in the hallways, and they're having about 15 to 25 borders as they call them per night. Now a border is a child who can't get admitted into the hospital so they have to actually spend the night in the hospital beds that are meant to just be just for triage. So, that's the situation that they're dealing with. They kind of showed us a graph of the numbers that they're seeing in relation to COVID -- which of course, has been the issue mostly for these hospitals in the last few months. Well, October is the first month that the number of RSV cases have outnumbered COVID cases. So again, this isn't just a problem in Connecticut. Certainly, it's an issue here, but the CDC said yesterday, cases of RSV are surging all across the country. Here I'm standing actually in an area where the governor has been in communication with the hospital, the National Guard, the Department of Public Health, and they are thinking about setting up a field hospital right where we're standing, just in case the issue gets worse. Now what they're fearful of, guys, is when influenza cases go up, then they have to also deal with that in addition to the RSV cases that they are already seeing. So, the number one thing they're telling obviously patients no matter the age, get a flu shot to hopefully keep those influenza cases down. HILL: So important because we have heard too there are predictions including from Dr. Fauci this is going to be a flu season that is definitely worse than last year's was. Brynn, appreciate it, thank you.",

      "speaker": "BIANCA NOBILO, CNN CORRESPONDENT",
      "sentences": "No, we just have Penny Mordaunt who was the first ever female Secretary of State for Defense here in the United Kingdom. She's also impressed lately when she's been in the House of Commons deputizing for the now Prime Minister in name only Liz Truss for her sense of humor, her authority and her charisma as she performed behind the dispatch box.But it's interesting that she's entered the race. Because there was chatter earlier on that she might try and position herself as more of a kingmaker. Because if recent tallies are correct, she is trailing behind the other two big beasts that are vying for this position. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and the favorite of conservative lawmakers here so far, and that blond elephant in the room, Boris Johnson who according to all reports is expecting to put his hat in the ring for a return. But we know that Johnson doesn't like to lose, so if it doesn't seem he can meet that threshold of 100 MPs supporting him, then perhaps he won't put his name forward. But the entry of Mordaunt into the race is interesting. Because she gets her support from the center ground which means she's likely to shave off votes from both Sunak and Johnson. And as far as the Johnson camp is concerned, they're trying to make the argument that Britain won't tolerate another Prime Minister who is not elected by the public at large -- because Johnson was the last one to be elected by the public at large back in 2019. And he's the obvious choice to bring the party back together. But you would be forgiven for raising an eyebrow at that remark because this is a Prime Minister whose downfall was in dramatic fashion with 148 of his own lawmakers voting against him in a vote of no confidence. There's still a parliamentary investigation into whether or not he broke rules and lied to Parliament that could see him suspended. He's definitely still a controversial choice and one who inspires just as much love as loathing within the Conservative Party.",
