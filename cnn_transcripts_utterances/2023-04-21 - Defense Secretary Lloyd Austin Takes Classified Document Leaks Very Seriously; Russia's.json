A U.S. official tells reporters in the pool traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that they'll get those 31 Abrams tanks to Germany next month to begin a 10-week training course for some 250 Ukrainian forces.Now, remember you -- Abrams tanks were only announced back in January and we expected it would be the more advanced M1-A2, a process that would have taken months but a necessary, essentially concession to other NATO allies were waiting for the U.S. to move on tanks before they moved in their own. In the end, the U.S. shifted courses that have taken a long time to send in the more advanced ones. They said they would send an older version of the Abrams tank, dramatically accelerating the timeline here, and that's what we're seeing play out. Those 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks, again, will begin training next month for Ukraine to get those on the battlefield as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, with Ukraine defense contact group going on, we're seeing other countries make their own announcements. Leopard 2 tanks from Germany arriving into the fight, Challenger tanks from the U.K. and an announcement from Ukraine and Germany that Poland will host a facility for repairing Leopard 2 tanks. So, you see this combined effort, and that's very often what we've seen at these sort of Ukraine meetings, to get Ukraine the capabilities it needs as the fight drags on after them -- after the year mark.

We are getting new information in this morning about how the Russians apparently bombed their own city. Russia's state news agency says one of Russia's own jets accidentally dropped the bomb during a midair emergency over the City of Belgorod. There's a loop video of it happening right there. Now, the City of Belgorod is just over the border from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the second most populous city in Ukraine. The blast created a huge crater. We have pictures of the crater right there, you can see how big that crater is. Also said to have damaged several apartment buildings. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Kyiv for us this morning with the latest. The Russians call it a midair emergency, an accident, Ben.",

Sources tell CNN that may be due to modifications to the firing mechanism in the gun that he was holding. This year, is that gun matching the description of the one that was used in the incident? Baldwin, as we know, was charged earlier this year in the deadly shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.CNN Entertainment Reporter Chloe Melas is here with more on this. Chloe, what can you tell us about how Baldwin is responding to this long litany of things that happened?

Then they were able to get the Special Prosecutor Andrea Reeb to step aside, right? Then the D.A. recused herself. You know, Luke Nikas, the attorney for Alec Baldwin, who was criticized by Andrea Reeb, she called him a big shot, big city attorney. Well, you know, he's thrilled that this has happened, releasing a statement to CNN. Although there are still, you know, there's still an investigation, a petting investigation by the New Mexico D.A. So, we are just a few hours away, Sara, from the status hearing. We are going to be hearing. It's also going to be streamed on YouTube. It's open to the public. We are going to be able to hear what is being said. Alec Baldwin is not expected to be attending. He's currently in Montana filming \"Rust\". Ironically, the news came out yesterday, the same day that everyone was back filming, minus Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the movie because that's part of a wrongful death lawsuit. Many people asking me why would they go back and film? And that is so that Halyna Hutchins; widower can get that settlement. But this is a really big move, Sara, but I still want to point out there is a criminal trial, right. Hannah Gutierrez Reed she still faces to manslaughter charges. Her attorneys telling CNN that they believe she'll be exonerated. But we have that trial. Could the fact that Alec Baldwin's charges are being dismissed help her? And I want to point out, now that Alec Baldwin, his charges are being dismissed, could we see other people being charged if the gun was modified? Why? By who? What was for -- what was the purpose?
