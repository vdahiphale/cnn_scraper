Can influencers actually move the needle with young voters in November? But leading this hour, Donald Trump just minutes away from his very first campaign event since the major shakeup in the 2024 race where his Democratic rival is no longer President Biden. What will Republicans do with all those Let's Go Brandon t-shirts? If your name is Brandon, might be a good time to get some personalized swag. Price to move, let's go straight to CNN's Kristen Holmes, who is in Charlotte, North Carolina for Trump's rally.

At one point, he called her as dumb as rocks. But in a call with reporters yesterday, he actually was much more on message attacking her record, not just as vice president, going back to her time as a California prosecutor.That is exactly what his team wants him to do, to stay on message and to continue linking her to Biden's policies, particularly when it comes to immigration, inflation, crime. They believe that they can make a case that she is just another arm of Biden when it comes to these unpopular policies. But of course, as we know, Donald Trump tends to go off message. And usually he uses these rallies as an opportunity to test various kinds of messaging to see what the crowd reacts to. And you have to remember, Jake, this is a critical time for Donald Trump because really a race to define Kamala Harris. Harris is hitting the ground running as we know, Trump is going to try all of that he can. It's not just going to be him, it's going to be a social media army, it's going to be his campaign to define who Kamala Harris is in Republican terms, in the terms they want to define her as. They want to fill that void of knowledge that people have about or don't have about Kamala Harris with negative imagery, with, again, links to things that are unpopular about the Biden administration. But time is running out, they're up against the clock. So we'll see what he does tonight when he takes that stage and really starts to lay out those attacks and that plan for running against Harris.",

But it's our views on standing up for freedoms for, you know, against book bans, for banning book bans, making sure that we're standing up for reproductive rights and, of course, standing up for voting rights and civil rights.

Obviously, when I think about her vice presidency, I break it up into that pre-Roe, post-Roe, because after 2022, it allowed her to focus. It allowed her team to focus.Of course, she brought new people on from that first year where there was a lot of infighting and dysfunction, but it allowed her to focus her message, travel the country, talk to people about abortion, and really get her name out and make herself the lead messenger on that. Something that, at first, she was kind of reticent to do because she didn't want to be pigeonholed, but she really leaned into that, and it allowed her to really talk on these loud stages and give her something to combat, give her an ability to bring back that prosecutorial message that she has leaned on so much in her career. And so, I think that there is a market difference between the vice president that you're seeing now and the vice president that you are seeing in 2021. But the tension point is going to be for her over these next three years to make sure that infighting does not come back, particularly as she tries to join the Biden campaign now with her own, or the post-Biden campaign now with her own campaign. That tension is still going to be there as she really races into November.",

But what's happened in the narrowly divided House Republican Conference is that they have been found -- Republicans have found themselves at odds with one another.

As a result, they've been unable to pass several of these must pass measures, even though the Republican leadership had intended on doing so.
