All the justices on the top row backed his immunity argument. Three of them, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, were appointed by Trump himself. Joe Biden warns this sets a dangerous precedent because presidents aren't kings and no-one's above the law. The president took aim at the Supreme Court over its series of inflammatory decisions.

They have to be allowed to do their job. PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Supreme Court partially siding with former President Donald Trump in his ongoing January 6th case, ruling that former presidents are entitled to some immunity from prosecution for official actions, but not for private conduct. In the 6-3 opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority. At least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. The president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts and not everything the president does is official. The president is not above the law. The high court, though, leaving it up to lower courts to determine which actions are official and therefore immune. Roberts writing: Other allegations, such as those involving Trump's interactions with the vice president, state officials and certain private parties and his comments to the general public present more difficult questions.

The 6-3 majority conservative court, a court that was carefully, carefully curated by Donald Trump when he was in office, is willing to stretch the boundaries of the law in order to, in many ways, advance a Republican agenda, a conservative agenda. Donald Trump brags about the fact that he hand-selected these justices so that they could do exactly what they're doing, which is delivered to him win after win after win. You have to look at this case in the context of what happened on Friday when this court essentially said a federal obstruction statute could not be used to prosecute those individuals who we witnessed with our very eyes a storm and break into the Capitol, those insurrectionists.

In particular, what a far-right French government would mean for Europe and for Ukraine. DONALD TUSK, POLISH PRIME MINISTER (through translator): This is all really starting to smell of great danger. Not only the results of the first round of the French elections, but also the information about Russian influence and Russian services, many parts of the radical right in Europe. BELL (voice-over): Long seen as a fringe party, considered too toxic by some to be electable, its move to center stage has led to calls for the country to unite against it ahead of this Sunday's second round of voting. Which will see an unprecedented number of races between three candidates representing the far right, the left-wing New Popular Front Alliance, which came second, and Emmanuel Macron's centrist Ensemble Coalition.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A long-hoped-for reunion after months in detention, removed from Israel's devastating military onslaught on Gaza, forced instead, they say, to face unspeakable horrors in Israeli detention. We were being tortured in ways I cannot describe, Faraj says. Only God knows what we have been through. I swear to you, it was the kind of torture nobody can speak of. Overwhelmed, it is almost too painful for him to account. They play with your emotions, he says. They would show us photos of our relatives' bodies, pictures of our families and children, and say, look at your children, we killed them. They would show us pictures of our wives, our sisters, and tell us that they had taken them and done this and that to them. For Faraj's daughter, her father's safe return is all that she has been praying for. I'm very happy, she says. Never in my life have I been without him, not once in seven years. Inside, the relatives of those released on Monday frantically call loved ones to share the news. They told him they had killed us all. He still can't believe we're all alive, this woman says. On Monday, Israel's prison service said that it was not aware of these claims, adding that all prisoners are detained according to the law, and that all basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards. The Israeli security officials have previously told CNN that they have been made aware of torture tactics being used against Palestinians within Israel's prison system and are investigating. Some 50 Palestinian detainees were released by Israeli authorities on Monday. Why they were originally detained, we may never know. CNN's inquiries to Israeli authorities went unanswered. [04:25:00] Among them, the director of Gaza's largest hospital, al-Shifa, released more than seven months after Israeli forces first raided the hospital and detained him. We were beaten and tortured almost every day. My little finger was broken, and I was repeatedly struck across the head, causing me to bleed several times, Dr. Abu Salmiya says. The torture taking place in Israel's prisons is near daily. The decision to release Palestinian detainees has sparked fierce backlash among some Israeli officials. Top ministers were reportedly out of the loop, and everyone from the opposition leader to the far- right security minister called it dysfunction and national security malpractice. But the Israel Security Agency, or Shin Bet, says it was forced to release some detainees due to a shortage in prison space. Whatever the reason, Monday's reunions were a moment of relief for many families in Gaza. Mahmoud Ali Baida (ph) says he was detained for more than eight months in Israeli prison. Look at my legs, he says. They wouldn't give us anything to treat our rashes. Many have spoken of the little food and water they received while in detention. Others say they were denied medication, including insulin for diabetes. For a month and a half, I was blindfolded, handcuffed and forced to kneel, Wael Mansour (ph) says, highlighting the deep scars left on his wrists.
