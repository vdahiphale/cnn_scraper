That is Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The House is about to vote to kick her off the House Foreign Affairs Committee.She is speaking right now saying, yes, she's a Muslim. Yes, she's a refugee. Yes, she has said some controversial things, but she says she's a proud American and her views should be considered by Republicans and Democrats alike. Let's listen? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): Louder and stronger, and my leadership will be celebrated around the world as it has been. So, take your votes or not, I am here to stay, and I am here to be a voice against harms around the world and advocate for a better world. I yield back. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Republican led House is about to vote to kick her off the House Foreign Affairs Committee. She says it is retribution. She says it is unfair. She says it is un- American. But she says it is no surprise to her, tracing Donald Trump's support of the birther movement. The Republicans who said Barack Obama as president was secretly a Muslim.Let's get to our chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju. Manu, this vote, you just heard the defiance from Congressman Omar. The vote that will take place in moments is a key test of the new speaker Kevin McCarthy. He has a very narrow majority. And many of his members are a little squishy about this.",

Now, McCarthy did tell us yesterday when he came back from the White House, it he has quote, new questions about Santos. And that was one reason why he supports the decision of Santos to get off of those two-House committees that he had made that voluntary decision to step aside there.But McCarthy would not say what those new questions were. Whether they're about his campaign finances, which of course, appears to be part of this investigation into him going forward. But McCarthy has so far not called on him to resign. Even though we've heard Republican after Republican back home, New York Republicans, including some in the delegation here in the House, asking for his ouster. McCarthy is still not going that far, not just because he needs the votes for Ilhan Omar or even to get elected speaker. But also, John, as you know, if he stepped aside that would be problematic, could flip - that district could flip to be democratic, and the tightening McCarthy's already very narrow majority.",

You could figure that out right there. Let's bring the conversation in the room. With me to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Dana Bash, CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson, and Seung Min Kim of the Associated Press.So, we can show you the House floor. They are now voting. This is the full House voting on whether to remove Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It is a big act. The Republicans say Democrats did it. Now we're coming back to it. Dana Bash, you've covered Congress for a long time. Number one, you know what Manu - you know the job Manu is doing, which is spectacular. Asking the right questions of the right people. There will be people out there saying, you know, why you asked these questions of George Santos. While he's been elected, and he won't answer questions that need to be asked. This vote. This vote. There were qualms from a number of Republicans say OK, Democrats did this to Marjorie Taylor Greene, Democrats did this to Paul Gosar. But they were evicting her from the committee because she said some controversial reprehensible things, antisemitic things, which she has apologized for. There is a difference even some Republicans say and yet it looks like this vote was succeed. DANA BASH, CNN CO-ANCHOR, STATE OF THE UNION: Yes. I mean, listen, she sat right in this chair where I'm sitting for our show on Sunday for State of the Union, and she admitted to ignorance on a lot of the tropes that she was parroting, and said that she learned from it. You talked about Republicans who - some of whom, three of whom actually had said that they would vote with the Democrats. They wouldn't kick her off the committee, and now they have flipped back. We haven't talked a lot about some of her fellow Democrats who were and still are very unhappy with the statements that she's made. Right before she went on to the floor, Congresswoman Omar joined in co- sponsoring a resolution with some moderate Democrats and Jewish Democrats, specifically recognizing Israel as America's legitimate and democratic ally and condemning antisemitism, which might sound like a no brainer, but it was untold after many, many weeks of negotiation to try to get her there. So that some Democrats, all Democrats likely will feel comfortable in voting the way they are right now - for her basically.",

She wants to be there as it happens. She wants to stare down the Republicans as they vote to kick her off this committee.And I'd mentioned Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Democrats kicked her off committees because of some reprehensible things she said, and she turned it in her lane of American politics into celebrity. She raised a ton of money out of it. Here's my question. Let's listen to Congressman Omar first. She seems very determined, fine, you're going to do this to me, guess what, I'm not going away. I'm going to have even a louder voice. And here in this speech, she very pointedly talked about leaving war torn Africa, coming to America as a refugee. She says that should make her welcomed as an American. Instead, she says this Republican Party wants to shun her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. OMAR: I am Muslim. I am an immigrant.

Huge objections and opposition and anger that and what she said in the past, Dan Goldman is also a new member of Congress, but he's not new to Washington. He's familiar with this. Listen, what he said earlier today about yes, yes, she has said things that offend me and more, but? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): Look, as a proud American Jew, you know, I'm not thrilled about the antisemitic comments that she and many others have made.

She has been governor for a month, and we just showed the photo of her standing at the White House lectern. Republicans might like her as the chief defender of Donald Trump.

KING: The interest as we play out. All right. Now, we're going to move on to this. New more, much more aggressive strategy from the president son Hunter Biden's legal team. Remember, Hunter Biden is under investigation by the US Attorney in Delaware. Now his lawyers are trying to change the narrative. They're asking state and federal prosecutors to investigate conservative activists, including Steve Bannon, Rudy Giuliani over Hunter Biden claims, those folks and others illegally weaponized his personal information, purportedly found in a laptop that Hunter Biden left at a Delaware repair shop. Now the letters do not acknowledge the laptop belongs to Hunter Biden. But it is the first time the president's son publicly acknowledged the personal data does belong to him. CNN's Evan Perez joins our panel. I'm baffled by this one. Abbe Lowell is part of Hunter Biden's new strategy. He has represented a lot of political clients, if you will, over the years and he is aggressive. He is a boxer if you will. But what are they up to here?",
