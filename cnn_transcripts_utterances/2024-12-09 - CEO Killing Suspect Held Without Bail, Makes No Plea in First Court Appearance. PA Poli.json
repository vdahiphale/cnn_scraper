Brian Todd, thanks very much, we're going with our CNN's Shimon Prokupecz in New York.So, what's the process now Shimon, for getting this guy from Pennsylvania to New York, for him to face charges here? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, one of the first things that the NYPD needs to do is actually charge him with the murder. And to do that they need some more direct evidence perhaps Anderson, like the gun. Once they get the gun back to New York, they can send it up to their lab in Queens. And there, their ballistics unit, they can test fire the weapon, compare it to the shell casings that they get from that test fire to what they found at the scene, and that will give them direct evidence of his alleged involvement in the murder. So it's more evidence, more direct and more for legal reasons that they need some more information before they go ahead and level the charges against him for the murder. Once that is done, he will have a hearing there in Pennsylvania before a judge, and he can either waive extradition or he could fight extradition if he fights extradition. The district attorney there said in the press conference, I think he said something like 30 days or so. If he doesn't fight extradition, then it's a much quicker process. And then the NYPD would simply be able to take him, bring him here. They'd have to book him here and then he would appear in a Manhattan criminal court. So we could be days away. We could be a month away. It all depends on when they file the charges and what he decides in terms of whether he's going to fight the extradition -- Anderson.",

He's a little bit different but he did seem to have this obsession about a healthcare industry that was getting too large, too powerful, and too greedy, which led him to strike out. Let me tee up the question, though. He murders the head of the largest healthcare company in the United States allegedly, and then flees to Pennsylvania with plenty of cash, a weapon still ammunition. What was next?

The reason New York is not charging him, yes, there's a lot of legalese that has to happen but our detectives don't want to charge him yet, because once you charge him the absolute right to counsel attaches. Now, we can't question him. It's like his right to counsel right now is qualified. We read the Miranda and we ask him, would you waive? He can waive because the right is qualified at that time. Once we charge him, the right is absolute. We can no longer talk to him even if he wants to. This is why this delay in charging. We want to talk to this guy. You heard Pennsylvania, they didn't charge him initially. When the news first broke, he was not charged.

Now, Commissioner Miller asked a very good question. What was next? He started -- Pittsburgh is well west of Altoona, he's heading back to New York as he approaches Altoona, Pennsylvania. I wonder how much ammunition was in that backpack. Last thing I want to say is this. You can't help but smile when you think a kid six months out of the academy makes this collar. Let's think about what did not happen in that McDonald's. He didn't have a chance to draw that weapon to commit suicide, which he may have been prone to do.

Well, that came to an end over the weekend when rebel forces seized control of the capital city Damascus, toppling the regime, raising fears of a power vacuum during a time of increased tension in the Middle East.Now, there are major questions tonight about what happens next, namely who will actually lead the new Syrian government. The Assad regime's outgoing prime minister met with rebel forces today and agreed to hand over power. A transitional prime minister has not yet been named. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says the United States will work with all groups in Syria. Though civil war has raged for more than a decade, rebels launched a renewed offensive less than two weeks ago, cutting across the northwest and capturing the capital in a matter of days. Celebrations as well as looting broke out in the streets. For years, reporting from Syria was all but impossible. That changed over the weekend as journalists, including CNN's Chief International Correspondent Clarissa Ward, returned to document the excitement, the relief of the Syrian people. Clarissa joins me now with the latest. So, talk about what else is happening on the ground. What have you been seeing?",

They said that they are confident that actually the red section, the so-called red section, does not exist.That all of the detainees who were held in Sednaya were actually released on December 8th by 11:00 a.m. And the White Helmets, that group of rescue workers who you saw desperately clawing through the rubble, trying to find this so-called red section, have now come out and said that the search is effectively over. It has concluded. But I think what this really speaks to, Anderson, is the total chaos and confusion as people are trying to work out what is real, what is not, what is rumor, what is fact. I spoke to one woman who was looking for her brother, a man called Abdukalak (ph), and she said, all we want to know is if he is alive or not. That's all we want to know. It should be.
