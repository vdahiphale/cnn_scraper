I'm going to wake up each and every day with the same thing that drives my opinion of what needs to be done -- solving these problems -- and that's what I'm going to do.

How do you think this ends at this point? I mean, all my sources, from what I can tell, think we are heading straight for a shutdown. Are -- do yours agree? JACKIE KUCINICH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, THE BOSTON GLOBE (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, they surely do, Kasie, and there is every reason to believe that. Right now, what the House is going to work on today and what they're set to work on this week are bills that will do nothing to prevent a government shutdown. It's these four spending bills and they're just trying to get it onto the floor to be debated. They don't even know if they have the votes to pass these priorities that conservatives really want that are dead upon arrival in the Senate and certainly, at the White House.

And to that point, we're kind of starting to get a sense of what the Senate is trying to do to avert this catastrophe, which it sounds like may involve now passing something that is actually relatively clean. It might leave Ukraine aid aside, it might leave disaster relief aside, and just keep the government open for 45 days. That actually could put McCarthy in a tough spot.

It was dubbed \"Crab Trap\" designed to coincide, they said, with a meeting of the senior leadership of Russia's Black Sea fleet. They say that as well as Adm. Sokolov, 33 officers were killed and 100 others injured. Really significant. This would be the decisionmaker of this huge grouping of ships -- submarine personnel on the Black Sea. It also underscores the increased, I think, capabilities of Ukraine's intelligence and long-range strike capabilities -- significant as they continue to lobby for U.S. long-range weapons. As for whether or not it will affect the level of attacks in the Black Sea, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Navy says these are continuing but described it as like a chicken running around without a head. So, making the point that without this admiral in charge, things are somewhat chaotic. It's hard to know exactly, though, has this is going to play out over the course of the hostilities -- Kasie.",

President Trump has been indicted four times and while he can keep any guns that he may already own, he is not currently allowed to buy one. Here is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Their website says, quote, \"A person who is under indictment or information for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year cannot lawfully ship, transport, or receive a firearm or ammunition.\" Whoopsie. The aide later clarified that President Trump did not buy the gun and he deleted the tweet. The president has also been taking to Truth Social to post a variety of claims which I will discuss with my next guest. Joining us now is CNN's Daniel Strauss. Daniel, thanks so much for being here. So this gun flap -- it's a small example, but it is a reminder that even though the former president seems to be Teflon with GOP voters and seems to be on a glide path to the nomination, he is under indictment. And if he's running against Joe Biden in a general election he is going to be a candidate on trial. It's not something I don't think that we are discussing every day. And like I said, it was a small example here in this gun shop but it says something really big. DANIEL STRAUSS, CNN NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER (via Webex by Cisco): Yeah. I mean, it's not unusual for candidates to -- for presidential candidates, especially in a Republican primary, to visit a gun shop. But it is unusual and it is new ground for the country for a general election candidate to be facing indictment and have to juggle both trials and those indictments and the regular sort of requirements of campaigning. Those are going to be the two major obstacles that the former president is going to have to deal with should he get the nomination to be President of the United States in 2024.",

So the other thing Daniel that I want to kind of -- I want to try and make sure we cover this with a certain degree of perspective, but I want to put up a graphic that we made that just has a couple of the things that Donald Trump has been out there saying in recent days on Truth Social.The first, he suggested that Gen. Milley, the top U.S. general, should be executed. He argued that Comcast, owner of NBC, should be probed for treason. He also called Nikki Haley, a rival in the primary and his former U.N. ambassador, \"Birdbrain.\" These are things that we don't necessarily focus on that much the way we might have in previous campaigns. And I understand why, right? But taken together, I think they underscore again the nature of the campaign that he is currently running and the way he thinks. And I think it's just worth showing and reminding voters across the country that this is potentially one of their top two choices for President of the United States, Daniel.",

He writes -- again, he's upset with the coverage generally. But he writes, \"...almost all dishonest and corrupt, but Comcast, with its one-side and vicious coverage by NBC, and particularly, MSNBC, should be investigated for its country threatening treason.\"This was enough to get the White House -- or the Biden campaign, I should say, to respond. Actually, I think it was the White House -- Andrew Bates -- talking about this and basically saying that Freedom of the press is a fundamental constitutional right. Abusing the presidential power and violating the constitutional rights of reporters would represent an outrageous attack on our democracy and the rule of the law. You know, I think -- I think worth underscoring -- in the -- in the event that Trump were to get reelected, which if he becomes the Republican presidential nominee, considering the divided nature of our politics is not an impossibility, there are very real questions about how he might use the apparatus of government to go after his stated enemies.",
