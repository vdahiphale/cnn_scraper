You know, just 1 or 2 percent, less than 5 percent of the time this happens.Think of it like this, Phil, when you're -- when you're operating really anywhere on the body, the possibility of infection and bleeding is always there. When you're doing prostatectomy, removing the prostate, which is what the secretary had done, you can get fluid that's leaking from around that area where the operation was done, that can lead to infection. But the fluid can also accumulate in your abdomen. If you have fluid in the abdomen and it's pushing on the outside of your intestines, for example, your intestines do not like that and your intestines will essentially become paralyzed, so you're just not moving your intestines anymore, and that's why you have to have this tube placed into your stomach. You got to do all these things. You've got to drain the fluid in your stomach, but you also have to put these tubes into the abdomen to drain that fluid as well. That's the infected fluid. So, it's a process. A few percent of the time it happens, known but not common.",

And this may sound counterintuitive, but if you do an operation, that basically means, hey, look, we think this thing is localized. We don't think it has spread. We think we can get it.So, having done an operation is actually a good sign in the sense of his overall prognosis. But take a look at the numbers. I mean, prostate cancer is a common cancer among men. One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. One in 41 will die. When it comes to Black men, for all sorts of different reasons, the numbers are much higher even. So, close to two times more likely to be diagnosed, 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed and 2.1 times more likely to die. So, for all sorts of different reasons, from genetics to the fact that screenings aren't done as often in Black men, all sorts of different reasons, the numbers are higher. But for Secretary Austin, given that it sounds like he was an early prostate cancer, besides the complication, it sounds like the operation went well -- meaning they got the cancer out. The prognosis should be good.",

They have to be able to anticipate those things. And what happened in this case, the door flew open, a flight attendant got injured. She was trying to get the door closed. It was very loud. It was very windy inside the cockpit. Headsets came off. The first officer's partially came off, the captain.

Of course, Biden was in the White House with Barack Obama then. So when he was elected in 2020, he happened to land in the middle of another big financial crash, the COVID crash, and instituted a much more robust middle class focused response effort that really owed a lot to these three characters and the rise of that brand of populist economic policy.",

I think one of the things that stopped Warren and Sanders from winning the democracy nomination in the White House was that too many people were scared of this idea that they are too far left -- they are too radical. But, you know, Biden is the furthest thing from a radical. He was able to take up a lot of policies and get them implemented.So, certainly, you know, if I look at his policies today, industrial policy bringing jobs back, the big stimulus after COVID, he even came out in the State of the Union Address last year and proposed a billionaire's tax. This is pretty progressive. You don't expect that from moderate Democrats. But at the same time, I don't think he's lost the kind of centrist normie politician bearing that got him elected in 2020.
