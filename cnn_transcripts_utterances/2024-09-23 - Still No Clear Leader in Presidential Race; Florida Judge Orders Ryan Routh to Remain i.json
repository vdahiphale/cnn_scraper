He said more than 320 dead and they are expecting the numbers to continue to rise with children and women among them. And certainly, this is perhaps the most intense day of strikes going back many years in terms of death toll. I don't think we can reach one that high until unless you go back to June of 1982 for the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. What we've seen is a series of intense strikes starting just before dawn in south Lebanon, then moving to the Beqaa Valley to the east of here, and also they're hitting an area that have never been struck before. And as a result of this, and as a result of the warnings broadcast by the Israelis by breaking into Lebanese radio stations and text messages, we've seen this massive exodus. It's not an evacuation because that would suggest some sort of organization. This is a chaotic exodus of tens of thousands, if not more people fleeing to the north. The roads are packed, apparently people have just pulled over to the side and given up, trying to reach any further north, because there are so many people driving on both sides of the highway headed to Beirut. There are even reports of a woman giving birth in her car because she -- they could not move any further. So, definitely, I think, you know, is this the brink of war or is this war itself? I think if you take the entirety of today's events in terms of the number of Israeli airstrikes, Hezbollah strikes into Israel, the death toll, it certainly does amount to what I would say is the opening day of what could be yet another war between Israel and Lebanon. And I say Lebanon because this is not just with Hezbollah, many people here feel that Israelis in the process of the Gaza-fication of Lebanon. We are seeing the same process they played out in Gaza, whereby intense airstrikes with huge death tolls, warnings for people to leave, basically to cleanse the south of its population -- look, much like what we saw and are seeing now in Gaza itself. That certainly, the fear is that this is a prelude to some sort of ground operation by Israeli forces. We've heard Israeli officials say time and time again, they want to move Hezbollah's fighters north of the Litani River, which is about 25 kilometers north of   the border. How that's going to be accomplished without massive destruction and a huge death toll is hard to imagine, Isa.",

So, what we did this year, because of anticipating the possibility of this happening, MedGlobal partnered with the Ministry of Health and we set up and purchased the -- what we're calling the command and control center where they were able to  dispatch 2,800 ambulances on Tuesday alone when the beeper explosions happened. So, this is kind of aligning the work to help the Ministry of Health organize its dispatches and patient referrals.

But one thing that is different from any previous campaign is the fact that abortion rights is different than four years ago. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, this is the first presidential election where that is an issue. We've seen the impact in the midterm elections. So, that is something the Harris campaign believes will play to its benefit here. But for all of the millions and millions spent in advertising, it's remarkable that it is as close as it is. So, the ground game, organization efforts that all makes a difference as well. So, buckle up for a very close six weeks.",

Routh is the suspect in thismonth's assassination attempt of Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. Prosecutors say he wrote a letter detailing his plans. In one passage, Routh said, quote, \"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you.\" Well, the evidence was collected from a box that the suspect apparently delivered to a witness, and a fingerprint on tape used to attach a rifle scope collected from the scene. Our Randi Kaye is in West Palm Beach, Florida, and joins us. So, Randi, prosecutors revealing a lot of pretty chilling, I think it's fair to say, details.

Lebanon has suffered its deadliest day since the 2006 war, following extensive airstrikes by Israel on what it claims are Hezbollah targets. At least 356 people have been killed and more than 1,200 wounded. That is according to Lebanon's health ministry. The IDF is urging Lebanese civilians around 30 kilometers east of Beirut in the Beqaa Valley to evacuate, you can see that, as it prepares to hit more Hezbollah targets. Scenes like this show really heavy traffic in Southern Lebanon as thousands of people flee their homes and head north. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is at war with Hezbollah, not the people of Lebanon. Well, earlier I spoke with the European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, and I started by asking him about his take on Israel's strategy in targeting Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.

Because the plans for -- by some settlers of re- colonizing Gaza would create there the same problem like in the West Bank. The illegal colonization, the illegal occupation of the land, the illegal pushing out the Palestinian people. I'm saying illegal because I'm here at the United Nations General Assembly and there are United Nations resolutions about it and there are rulings of the International Court of Justice very clearly stating the illegality of this occupation. And what I'm saying is going to become a second Gaza is because a number of casualties, a number of buildings being destroyed increases. It's always because they are fighting against terrorism. And certainly, they have the right to fight against terrorism. But it cannot be an excuse for destroying civilians' buildings and killing civilians, and occupying land. And it's clear that this government, which is calling openly Judea and Samaria to the West Bank is in a strategy of little by little grasping land, expanding occupation, incorporating land, and with the final purpose of fully annexation of this illegally occupied territory, colonized territory.",

No, green doesn't go, doesn't fit. That's an example. And it's clear that on the other side of the border there are 2 million people starving. So, we continue asking for ceasefire knowing that both sides seem to procrastinate, looking for reasons and excuses, but not to reach an agreement. We have to reach peace in the Middle East.

Fantastic. And at last, an emoji really representing how many of us, including myself, feel at the end of the day or even at the start of the day. This face with bags under its eyes is one of eight new emojis coming to our smartphones next year. Unicode Consortium approved the latest emoji lineup, which is the nonprofit organization overseeing global emoji standards and new releases. The exhausted emoji face was crowned the most anticipated emoji in the world. Emoji Awards explains really why. Receiving more than 60 percent of the vote. The purple splatter, pictured, if we can bring it back, in the top right corner, where -- we can bring it back to you, came second place, and third place is the shovel that we showed you earlier. Let's bring in Clare Duffy with more live from New York. I mean, look, the exhausted face, I think, we speak -- bags speaks to so many of us, not just at the end of the day, Clare, but at the beginning of the week. Just talk us through these emojis and why those are needed.",

Look, I do think it's kind ofinteresting the back story about where new emojis -- how new emojis are created and end up on our devices. You have this nonprofit, the Unicode Consortium, that every year takes in suggestions and new concepts for emojis, and then, once a year, puts out this list of emojis that it recommends that they get adopted across our devices. And then, once this list comes out, the operating services, the IOS and Androids of the world, can make some tweaks on these designs before we'll ultimately see them show up in our phones. And it is interesting because these emojis do actually have a lot of impact on our communication. One sort of interesting nugget from this year's editions is that tree without leaves, the creator of that emoji concept, said it was designed to talk about climate change and about drought. So, while a lot of these things seem kind of goofy, there is actually a deeper meaning there and it will influence, potentially, the way that people talk about and communicate online about these subjects with these eight new emoji additions. The Unicode Consortium has now approved a total of 3,790 emojis for use across devices. So, sort of an important service, sort of silly story, but an important service that this nonprofit is facilitating for everybody.",
