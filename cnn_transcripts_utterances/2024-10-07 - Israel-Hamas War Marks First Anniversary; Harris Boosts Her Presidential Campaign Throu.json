You are watching CNN's Newsroom special coverage of the first anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attacks on Israel. And I'm Rosemary Church.And we begin with a somber milestone in Israel where the country is marking that one year since the deadly attacks by Hamas on October 7th. Commemorations are being held to remember and honor the 1,200 people who were killed that day, the first event taking place early this morning at the Nova Music Festival site, where the final music track of the festival was replayed before a minute of silence. Ahead of the anniversary, images of the hostages were projected onto the walls of Jerusalem's Old City. As of today, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office says there are a total of 101 hostages in Gaza, including 35 believed to have been killed. The mother of one victim had this heartbreaking message.

Stand before you today dear family wanting to shout that I'm not miserable because none of this actually happened. I'm still in denial. I'm being asked how it feels a year after but I'm still stuck on October 7th. The world keeps going but to me time has stopped. Still waiting to see you on the list of survivors. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You now need a ceasefire with Hezbollah to get a ceasefire with Hamas. It complicates the situation.The government's narrative is that they're trying to de-link it. They're trying to tell Hezbollah, cease and desist. We'll deal with you, Hezbollah, and then we'll come back and deal with Hamas, and whether that's military, whether that's a deal. But I think there's a real sense in the country and perhaps an assessment by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Yahya Sinwar in Hamas doesn't want to negotiate over the hostages yet, so he's moved on to Lebanon. But the reality is, I think for most people, there's a real sense that another layer of uncertainty has been opened here. Another front in the killing where huge numbers of civilians are being killed in targeting another terror group. They're targeting Hezbollah, but in fact a lot of civilians are being killed. In Gaza, you know, almost 42,000 people have been killed there. The government believes 17; 18,000 of them might have been Hamas, but, you know, officials, health officials inside Gaza, say that a large number have been women and children and the elderly. So all of this does not sort of mitigate towards a ceasefire deal. And I think that's the sense that people get at the moment, that we are further away from a ceasefire deal with Hamas to get hostages freed than we were a couple of weeks ago. And adding to that the escalation of tensions with Iran. Iran's ballistic missiles on Israel less than a week ago, Israel expected to respond for that. It all speaks to escalation and not getting back to that issue of the hostages. And obviously that is so painful for the families who still have hostages being held, be they dead or alive.",

And it's not just disinformation, you know, in the news media or at the popular level. It's the fact that the disinformation is being, is coming from the former president of the United States and the leading nominee for president on the Republican side. So it's incredibly damaging. But I think the question is, who is persuaded by this? And also, which voters are repelled or turned off by this?And what we're seeing in Donald Trump is a man who continues to try to speak to what is a powerful but limited base. And it suggests certainly that in Pennsylvania, where he was, he's really trying to stoke that enthusiasm amongst his base, ensure that they get out and that they deliver those votes. I don't think that we're going to see undecided voters. They're undecided for a reason. And part of the reason is because they lack some confidence in Donald Trump, but they're also not persuaded that Harris is their candidate. So I don't think the disinformation plays to that really important set of voters. And this is a state that we know Harris is up maybe one percentage point. It is a dead heat. Pennsylvania couldn't be more important in this election and so really right now getting those letters to the polls. You know, this is also an extraordinary moment. We've seen a devastating hurricane. Today is the one-year anniversary of the attacks, the Hamas attacks on Israel and the beginning of what has been a devastating year in the Middle East, something that really matters for certain Americans in key swing states. So I think today in particular we're going to see Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, she has that interview that's playing tonight on \"60 Minutes\", trying to speak both to the people who are suffering the effects of the hurricane in North Carolina, a state that matters a lot, but also trying to speak to their ability to deliver stability in the United States, stability in the Middle East, and also to economic growth. And for Kamala Harris, you know, a vice president in a leadership that has done very well in the economy, but in which those results are felt unequally, that message is not getting across. It's now really not getting across for reasons beyond their control in North Carolina, continuing to signal that she can lead, that she can deliver economic growth that matters for white male voters in particular will be absolutely essential and also demonstrating leadership in what is a very volatile time globally and especially in the Middle East.",

I don't think that those voters are really being persuaded to change their minds by these media blitzes, which isn't to say they're not important.Remember, go back to that first comment I made. It's about getting the people that are already on Harris' side or on Trump's side to really feel the passion to turn out and vote. It's essential to demonstrate the solidity of their leadership to continue to reinforce that message for Kamala Harris going deep on reproductive rights and abortion rights is critical. But will it lead white men in Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to decide that they will turn out and vote for Kamala Harris? This is really critical. In those three swing states, you have roughly 80 percent give or take depending on the state of voters who are white. They break for Donald Trump. And getting the white voters that really still support the Democrats to feel confident, to feel that they can trust the Democrats, that's what is critical, and that's why that ground campaign is so important right now.",

So it's a delicate line electorally.I think on the broader questions of policy, the two candidates, Harris and Trump, are clearly very, very different. But Harris and Biden are much more similar. We'll only really know how significant those differences are between the vice president and her president if she's elected in November. So this is a difficult road to toe for her. But, you know, go back to the basics. The economy is very strong. The jobs report that we saw just last week was phenomenal. Unemployment is low. Inflation has come down to about 2.5 percent. And so the numbers are all very good at a time though when people feel the impact of that hurricane, when the numbers are not universally translated to facts on the ground, prices are still high. So it is a difficult context for Vice President Harris. But again, the fact that with such a short lead way she is up very marginally, but she is still up in those three critical swing states is very impressive. But this is undoubtedly a race that is just going to be unknown, the result of that unknown until that very last vote is cast and counted.
