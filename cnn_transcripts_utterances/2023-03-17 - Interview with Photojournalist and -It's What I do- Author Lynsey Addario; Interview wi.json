Security Council's permanent five members has meant in the past that he's been able to go to New York and speak to the U.N. Security Council, stand at that podium. A member of the G20, he's been able to go and meet with other G20 leaders. In European countries, in the past, that's going to end as well. President Putin has put high stock in his ability to be the leader of a powerful nation and to stride the international stage and exert that powered and influence and at health. That is no more. Now, the Kremlin says that the ICC has no writ with them. And it's clear with from within the walls of the Kremlin this is not going to have a real impact on Putin. But it is designed to get in his mind and to alter the way that he thinks about the war in Ukraine. His future world after the war in Ukraine is now prescribed. Meeting the U.S. president, for example. Now, completely unimaginable. And he puts a huge stock in that. He's always wanted to negotiate directly with President Biden over the war in Ukraine. So, it radically changes his outlook and sends a huge message to anyone fighting for him in Ukraine. And that is what Ukrainian officials are saying, Russia essentially, according to a prosecutor general in Ukraine, Russia essentially a criminal state.",

The recent, kidnapping of four Americans in the country has once again brought the issue into focus. But the quick response by authorities has left some questioning whether Mexicans themselves are forgotten. And it comes as the country continues, of course, to be plagued by cartel violence. Let's dig into some of these issues now with investigative journalist, Peniley Ramirez. She joins me now from New York. And thanks so much for doing so. I mean, Americans getting kidnapped is always going to get attention. But Mexico's national database of missing and unlocated persons currently list more than 112,000 Mexicans has disappeared, many say the numbers actually way higher than that. And of course, many are undocumented migrants in Mexico are routinely taken for ransom or trafficking. How do the cartels impact the lives of ordinary Mexican? PENILEY RAMIREZ, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, FUTURO INVESTIGATES AND CO-HOST, \"USA V. GARCIA LUNA\" PODCAST: Well, Mexico has been suffering crisis of violence and people disappeared since the last 20 years, more than 20 years. And -- look, according to official data, just in Tamaulipas, they placed the state where these four Americans were kidnapped, more than 10,000 people are still disappeared. And Tamaulipas is not even the worst place in Mexico with the disappearing crisis. Jalisco is the worst place in Mexico. Mexico right now is the deadliest country in the world to be a journalist. Even worse than other countries in war like Ukraine, and this is official data that we just to see if last year from Reporters Without Borders. So, you have a country when the -- they lit -- the violence, it's like, the way that we operate and we live every day. 10 women are killed in Mexico every day. You see that more than 30,000 people are killed every year. Last year, for example, the Mexican government were saying, oh, we managed to reduce by six, seven percent the death rate.

Well, I was in one of them. And after me, several older journalists have been documenting how Mexico has becoming more protagonist, and the shame about the fentanyl production. And there is an important context of this. Before Mexico became such an important place for the production of fentanyl, this was happening in another place of the world that we now know really well which is Wuhan, China. The -- exactly the place where the COVID pandemic has started. So, after the lockdowns in China, during the pandemic, all the production was moved to other places, especially to Mexico, because there you will receive in a lot of the small parts that you will use, and then you'll produce it there. So, it's crazy that you have the Mexican president saying that there are no fentanyl labs, and you have the journalists documenting this.
