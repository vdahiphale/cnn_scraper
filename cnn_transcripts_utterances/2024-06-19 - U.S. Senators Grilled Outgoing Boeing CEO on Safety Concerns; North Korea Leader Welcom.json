I'm Eleni Giokos.Just ahead, U.S. senators blast Boeing's outgoing CEO for safety concerns and what they call a culture of retaliation against whistleblowers. Plus, North Korea's leader welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin as the pair look to send a signal to the West about their deepening ties. And a warning about an online scam costing Americans billions of dollars, victims and their families share their harrowing stories with CNN. Welcome to the show. And for the first time, Boeing's embattled CEO has answered directly to U.S. lawmakers about the company's troubled safety record. And he also came face to face with the families of passengers killed in two Boeing crashes. Dave Calhoun endured a grilling from Republicans and Democrats alike at a Senate subcommittee hearing Tuesday. In one tense exchange, Republican Senator Josh Hawley questioned Calhoun about allegations that Boeing has cut corners, putting profit over safety and retaliating against whistleblowers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): We've had multiple whistleblowers come before this committee and allege that Boeing is cutting every possible corner on quality and safety. Not just in the past, but now. They've alleged that you've eliminated safety inspections, that there are fewer in quality and there are fewer inspectors doing quality inspections out there. They've alleged that when they raised quality issues and concerns, they were reassigned. They were retaliated against. They were physically threatened. That doesn't sound like attention to quality to me. And yet you're getting paid $33 million a year. Extraordinary.",

On the back of his testimony, very heated, tough questions. But I want you to take me through your sense of how he was able to field some of these questions. And of course, just hours before his testimony, you had that new whistleblower coming in with very serious allegations, basically proving that no real change has occurred in Boeing when it comes to safety.JEFFREY THOMAS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, AIRLINERATINGS.COM: Look, indeed, it was a very brutal hearing. And David Calhoun was honest as upfront, taking responsibility and is adamant that there is a culture change. And that's -- that's been my sense from engineers and workers that I've spoken to at Boeing that, yes, change is certainly underway. And since they had those special staff meetings, worker meetings in -- in February of this year, there's been 30,000 suggestions put forward by staff on improvements that Boeing could make right across the board. So they're working through those now to the whistleblower allegations that just surfaced. They came in yesterday. Boeing hasn't had a chance to respond to those and to investigate exactly what they're about. But look, whistleblowers are very, very important. No question about that. But several whistleblower claims that have been made, including one that 787s would fall out of the sky, have been found to be not correct and have been slightly exaggerated. So we have to -- we have to treat them obviously with great respect and examine them in great detail.

Farther north, the site's fire has grown to 10,000 acres or 4,000 hectares and has not been contained at all.And in the area of fire in northern California, it's about 20 percent contained, but has prompted evacuations in surrounding areas. CNN's Natasha Chen has been following the Post Fire and has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the post fire has burned more than 15,000 acres, just one of about 10 wildfires burning throughout California right now. The Post Fire on the north side is pretty well secure at this point, but on the south side, there is a lot of work to be done, especially along the southeastern perimeter, where there is very rough and rugged, steep terrain. The Los Angeles County Fire Department says they are for the first time employing the sheriff's department boats to take fire crews across the lake to get to that southern perimeter. We watched as several hotshot crews were brought to that perimeter, taking everything they can with them. They have all of that medical equipment, basic life support so that if something should happen, they can take care of themselves and basically do the best they can in the middle of nowhere. Now, this fire caused evacuations for more than a thousand people from a state park over the weekend. It grew very quickly. The difficult conditions include high wind gusts and high heat. There should be a little bit better wind, wind and weather conditions as the day progresses. However, there is expected to be more heat coming by the next weekend. And so the work that needs to be done now is really containing what they can. As fires continue to grow larger, more quickly, the fire public information officer here tells me that their strategy is really to bring in more crews to work on attacking the fire more quickly so that they can wrap this and hopefully be ready for the next fire.

And this also demonstrates that our security is not regional, it's global. What happens in Europe matters for Asia, and what happens in Asia matters for us.

Those sanctions, by the way, would explicitly prevent the kind of weapons transfers that both the U.S. and South Korea say are already happening from North Korea to Russia.Russia, as we know, consistently rattling the nuclear saber in Ukraine. And this is another card that it can potentially play here. North Korea said to be dramatically increasing its nuclear arsenal. It has very few scruples when it comes to threatening the West. So this is a way that President Putin can send a message to the West of just how much Russia can be a global spoiler here. I think it was very telling just how much his letter ahead of this visit in North Korean state media talked about confronting the West. So the optics really matter here.

And in that video, he is making two claims.First, that the U.S. is withholding weapons and ammunition shipments. And secondly, that Antony Blinken, in the last time he visited Israel, he had this candid meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu, he says, and that he assured him, as you mentioned, that he is working day and night to remove what was described as a bottleneck. Now, the White House was asked about this yesterday, and frankly, they seemed a little bit bewildered. The press secretary said that genuinely, they did not know what the Israeli prime minister was talking about, because they say that there is only one single shipment that has been held up right now for further review. This shipment is one of 3,500 bombs, roughly half of them are 500- pound bombs, the other half are 2,000-pound bombs. And specifically, the Biden administration is worried about these kinds of weapons being used in a dense urban environment, specifically like Rafah. And so they have held it up to make sure that Israel doesn't have access to this kind of weapon to be carried out in that kind of an environment, because obviously the U.S. has urged Israel to be more careful when it comes to civilian casualties. These 2,000-pound bombs, especially, will leave a massive crater in the ground, they will send shrapnel potentially hundreds of feet away. These are not precision weapons, and Israel is not always that interested in precision. Even yesterday, they dropped two bombs on the Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Gazan officials, killing 15 people, including women and children, and they didn't even say who they were targeting. Now, the secretary of state was asked about these comments from the prime minister yesterday, and he said that, look, all of the shipments, with the exception of this one, are moving as normal. But he was pressed specifically by one journalist about whether Netanyahu was telling the truth. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Again, I've been as clear as I can possibly be. I'm not going to talk about what we said in diplomatic conversations.

I mean, there's an absolute lack of deterrence here.[03:54:54] The Department of Justice did announce last month, for example, that it arrested two men, Chinese nationals, that it accuses of laundering tens of millions of dollars on behalf of pig butchering scam groups through the U.S. and then into the Bahamas. But they can't get, they say, at the actual scam operators, the kingpins of this. When you go to the Thai border with Myanmar and you look across this small river and you see these giant office parks, which are effectively slave factories that are getting electricity and have cell phone towers aimed at them from the Thai side of the border, you get a sense of how massive these operations are. And Thai law enforcement authorities, they insist they can do nothing across that international border, that jurisdiction. However, the Thai Telecommunications Regulation Commission has told CNN that it has ordered Thai telecommunications companies to stop sending wireless signals across these borders. Yet they say that they've seen the syndicates shift their activities to using other technology like Starlink to try to send their messages out. So, basically, there is no deterrence, nothing to stop these groups from spamming people in the U.S. and in other developed economies. They're never going to get punished for it, thus far, and they prey on the loneliness of their victims, who eventually, some of them, sadly, fall for this type of attention.",
