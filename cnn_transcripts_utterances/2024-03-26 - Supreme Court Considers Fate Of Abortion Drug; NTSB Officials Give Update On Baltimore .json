So all eyes will be on this case to see what the justices do. But right now, Jess, they do appear poised to likely use this off-ramp on a technicality, possibly this issue of standing, and not get into the more significant question of access to Mifepristone and abortion medication.",

She is a lecturer in law at Yale University and also a staff writer for \"The New York Times\" magazine.Emily, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. Is it fair to say that, at the heart of this case, is how justices view the FDA, it's credibility and its judgment? EMILY BAZELON, STAFF WRITER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" MAGAZINE: Yes, that is really important to the case. The idea of challenging 24 years of approval of abortion pills is pretty dramatic. And I think that's why you see a lot of pharmaceutical companies coming in on the side of the manufacturers of the abortion pills to say, wait a second, the FDA sets our national rules for regulating drugs. And if you pull the rug out from under them, how do we know we can rely on the FDA's judgment as we develop and research new medication.",

It has the potential to be a broader decision than Dobbs, right?Because turning the issue of reproductive rights towards the states that meant that there we're still many states where reproductive rights it's we're protected. But a ruling limiting Mifepristone that would impact the entire country, right?",

I mean, we have 16 states now where abortion is nearly banned completely or only available up until six weeks of pregnancy. But in the rest of the country, abortion is often still freely available, right? You have a split between red and blue states. If the FDA's approval of Mifepristone cannot stand, and the court, for example, rules that women everywhere on the country cannot receive abortion pills by mail anymore, that's going to be -- have a major effect on women nationally. it's certainly not limited to states in which the politics of abortion is in favor of a ban.",

We had a system for collecting data about complications from this drug, called adverse events.For 15 years, we collected extra data. We saw that the drug was very safe, overwhelmingly safe. And based on the reports we were receiving and lots of studies that mounted over the years, we decided to loosen the rules. That is the standard process that the agency follows. And if you think about this from the perspective of other drug companies, they're saying, well, wait a second if we can show that a drug is more safe over time than when it was first approved, that's important for our ability to market the drug. We want the FDA to be able to update its determinations.",

Because the question of whether the plaintiffs actually have standing came up over and over again today.And if the court rules that they do, it's quite possible that we'll see more cases where, let's say that the standard of proving harm is watered down to a degree, is that a fair assessment?",
