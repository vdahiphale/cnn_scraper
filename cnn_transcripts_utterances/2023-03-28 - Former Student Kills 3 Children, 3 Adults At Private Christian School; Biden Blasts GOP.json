We have an increasing proportion of the United States that has been directly touched by gun violence. Abby, these mass shootings is tragic as random, as horrifying as they are. And I will say, as a parent, putting my kids into school today, right, I had to take an extra moment before letting them enter those school doors. As horrible as these are, the reality is that there are more than 100 people that die every day across the United States from a gunshot wound. And most of those are not these random mass shootings. Most of those are suicides and homicides. And we are not going to get mass shootings under control until we also deal with the drivers of those other types of gun death. This is to me a commentary on what we, as American society, tolerate, both allowing the rage, the sadness, the hopelessness to proliferate that drives people to pick up a gun and hurt themselves or others, and the fact that it is so easy for those who have those horrible intentions to access a gun in a moment of hopelessness or despair.",

It's this capital city itself.It had earlier on got a bit violent following clashes between the police and some of the more ultra-elements of the demonstrators. Police are now standing by on the outskirts of the -- of this major central square here in Paris, Abby. And that's because they fear that as night sets in and this has been the pattern elsewhere, there'll be again, these groups of ultras of extremists that will fan out into the other streets, chucking rocks, and then they have this back and forth kind of street fighting that we've seen over the last 10 days. But I think what's important about these demonstrations is twofold. One is that the numbers are a bit down, which is difficult for the unions to confront, although they admit that the numbers are down. And that is because it is becoming harder and harder to get people out to go on strike. Not because they're not motivated, Abby, by their anger at these new reforms coming in from the Macron government, but because they have been on strike on and off since the middle of January in many cases, and they're running out of money at home. Life is getting very difficult for people on strike. And the other aspect is that this is a done deal in terms of the legislation largely. It is almost certainly going to go onto the statute book. It's likely to be enacted by the end of the year. The unions have called for dialogue with the government. The government's agreed to that, but not to any kind of discussion about a U-turn. So ultimately, then, the only option available to certainly the very hard line opposition here is the sort of street protests and demonstrations that we can see here, Abby.",
