Any moment he's going to be coming out to address the latest jobs report out just this morning. Employers added 311,000 jobs in February. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6 percent.That job -- those jobs gains are more than what many analysts expected and a sign still of a strong -- that strong hiring continues despite the ongoing efforts, of course, by the Federal Reserve to cool things off to tame inflation. Wall Street is reacting to this report. You can see right now. The stocks are down. Stocks are well, it's like mixed as we're looking at kind of stable in the moment. Matt Egan and M.J. Lee are standing by for us. Joining us right now for a look at what this all means as we wait for the President. Matt, on the report, what stands out most to you?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it's amazing that the economy is still adding this many jobs, right, despite the Federal Reserve's war on inflation, despite all of the historic job gains already on the books, people are still getting hired at a rapid pace. So, 2 -- 311,000 jobs added in February. You know, this is how strong the jobs market is.As you can see on the chart, hiring slowed significantly in February. And yet, it still came in at a very strong level, a level that was well above expectations. So no sign of a recession here at all. The unemployment rate, it did tick up to 3.6 percent. But remember, that is coming off of a 53-year low set in January, a massive improvement from that spike in early 2020 that you can see on your screen. And one of the reasons that the employment rate went up is because more people are looking for work, which of course is a good thing. When you dig into the numbers, you can see that a lot of sectors are continuing to add workers rapidly. Leisure and hospitality, retail, health care, government, all of them adding jobs. There was some job loss in construction and also in, I'm sorry, in transportation as well as information, information that is media and tech. We know about that. Now, everyone wants to know what does this jobs report mean in terms of whether or not the jobs market is overheating and what that means for inflation. I think it's mixed here because on the hot side, hiring obviously was very strong. I think on the cooler side, we did see wage growth slowdown month over month and that should ease some of these fears from the Federal Reserve of a wage price spiral where high prices causes people to demand higher wages, which causes higher prices, it can become a negative feedback loop. Still big picture, Kate, I do think that today's report keeps alive the risk that the Federal Reserve ends up going big again at its next meeting later this month with a 50-basis point rate hike.",

      "sentences": "All right, we'll stand by to stand by for that one. Matt, thank you.M.J., what are you hearing from the White House on this morning and what are you expecting to hear from the President when he speaks any moment now? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know, Kate, I can tell you that here at the White House, officials were hoping for a number that was more in the mid-200. As Matt laid out, this certainly beat expectations and outpaced expectations, but what they were able to avoid was a situation like back in January when we saw a whopping more than 500,000 jobs added. That was frankly shocking to even a lot of economists. But look, I think what we can certainly expect the President to express is confidence and touting this as good news that there is really resilience in the U.S. economy and certainly talk about how much all of this is a sign that the U.S. economy has made so much progress, particularly since the peak of the pandemic. But as Matt was saying, you know, one of the reasons that the jobs report is so critical and important is because it is a data point that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is watching so closely. We just heard him earlier this week basically indicate that if we continue to see signs that the labor market is extremely hot, then yes, it is very possible that the central bank might go back to more aggressively raising rates. And of course, just goes without saying for this White House, the state of the economy and inflation in particular, now that is just one of the most important political issues for them and that is why they are watching all of this data coming in so very carefully.",

It's not going to get down to the Fed's target overnight. It's going to be a process, it could be a bumpy process, but we're clearly headed in the right direction. There's also some data points in this jobs report that support that positive story.So for example, wage growth, which is still robust, is starting to come down, consistent with some amount of disinflation. So really I think it's a Goldilocks report. Really strong hiring, really strong labor force participation, and some good news for the Fed as well.",

All I can say is that we here at the White House think that this is a very strong report. We're optimistic about where the economy is now and we're optimistic about where the economy is going, particularly as all of the bipartisan legislation that the President passed last year starts to come into effect.The infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, all of that is coming in the next several months and years, it's going to build on the momentum that we've created over the last two years.",

At the core of this case, it really is a paperwork crime, an alleged crime nonetheless, but it's also going to be prosecuted under pretty novel theory.
