So when we -- when I said it's a failure to challenge our assumptions, meaning the assumption that, hey, that's going to be addressed or that's going to be covered by state and local.So earlier this week, I convened a call with all of our special agents in charge of all of our field offices. And I expressed to them, listen, we need our state and local counterparts. But we also have to be very direct, very clear about what our expectations are about what we need from them. Whether it's a particular asset, whether it's a particular number of personnel, we need to be very clear so that they have an understanding of exactly what we you need from them. That is -- that's on us. We need to be better communicators and articulate exactly what we need to mitigate any challenges, concerns, or anything that we identify during that advance process. And so I have full confidence in our SACs in the field. I have full confidence in our -- in our state and local counterparts, that moving forward now, we're not going to have this assumption that, oh, we think that they have it. No, we're going to -- we're going to work together. We're going to have good, hard, fierce conversations about what we're going to do.

We calibrate based on that threat. We evaluated a threat stream that we have and we put our Secret Service counter-sniper personnel out there. And looking back, it was very fortunate that we did. But the former president will have counter-sniper coverage moving forward, as will the president, the vice president, Senator Vance.

I understand that did not happen in this case and hasn't been happening for some time prior. Is that something you think was missing here? Is that something you might review and bring back? And do you also think the Secret Service is too reliant on state, local and federal? I mean, you have on 2,000 HSI agents helping in events coming this fall. That's a third of their workforce and it takes a lot from state and locals as well. So, first, would you bring back the PowerPoint? Do you think there should have been more planning?

I can tell you that there was a police -- a police meeting.With respect to the PowerPoint, I certainly think that visuals are always good. I think that if we're not using it, we certainly will. But that goes back to my -- my direction that we have to be very specific about -- about what we're communicating and what our expectations are moving forward. With respect to the reliance on state and local law enforcement, listen, there are there are 700,000 full-time law enforcement officers, over 700,000 full-time law enforcement officers in the United States. The majority of prosecutions in the criminal justice system in the United States are done by state and locals. That's a result of criminal investigations that they do every day in their communities to keep them safe. One hundred, over 130 or 135 -- 135 officers died last year serving their communities, federal, state and local. Forty-seven of them died by violent means, gunfire. There's not overreliance on them. They're out there every day securing their communities. They know the terrain. They know the people. More importantly, they know the local laws. If you are in a state where it's open carry, we're going to rely on them to enforce local laws. I, as a federal agent, cannot go out there and enforce the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I need those state and local law enforcement officers. So I would push back on that. With respect to leveraging other federal partners, when we were in the Department of Treasury and I was a brand-new agent, I would stand post during a campaign year with agents from ATF, IRS Criminal Investigations. You know, we were all one big happy family. Customs, customs moved over to DHS, just like we did. So we do this every four years. We rely on those partners. We use them during national special security events, like the Democratic National Convention, the United Nations General Assembly, the presidential inauguration. Those are whole-of-government security operations, which the Secret Service is the lead planning for. And we're going to bring in partners from across the government. I don't feel that it's an overreliance. It's something that we have done going back to our days at Treasury. And we're going to continue to do that. We need those partners and we need those state and local officers.",

      "sentences": "Listen, that's not -- that's not for me to weigh in on. But what I would tell you is, you know, there's also a lot ofdiscussion about, why should the Secret Service do criminal investigations? And what I will say is this, We were founded in 1865 as an investigative entity. It's in our DNA. I firmly believe that the best protection agents learn those skills being criminal investigators. You learn how to interact with people. You learn organizational skills. You learned to be analytical. Those are all traits that you need to have when you're on a detail. Moreover, if you look at where we are today, buildings, communities, everything is interconnected. And so we have a particular expertise in cyber and in cybercrime and critical systems protection. And so when you overlay that, that investigative skill set that we have, you know, it's more than just securing the president or our protectees in a brick-and-mortar setting. It's also protecting them from things that make them vulnerable due to cyber. And so the only way to learn that -- those skills to be able to detect, to be able to analyze, to be able to make sure that we are hardening not only cyber systems but hardening a building that is fed by cyber systems, the only way to gain that experience, that knowledge is to be able to do criminal investigations. Additionally, it is within our investigative authority to follow up on threats. People make threats to the president and the people we protect every day. We need to have that domestic and international network of field offices to be able to track down those threats. And if necessary, bring those people to justice and present them to a U.S. attorney's office. So this -- this -- you know, I know there's been a lot of talk, should we or shouldn't we, should we do this? Should we be in DHS? The bottom line is this. If you want the Secret Service to continue to be the Secret Service and be effective at what it does, it needs to be doing investigations and it probably needs to be in the Department of Homeland Security until Congress or others have an opportunity to weigh in.",

And he seemed to put a little more flesh on the bone about that where he was kind of describing the process about what that would look like. Because as Senator Josh Hawley challenged him on this, he was saying, essentially, that there would be accountability, but that he wasn't going to do it in kind of a slap-dash kind of way. And here, he laid out that if there were violations, the accountability would be -- there would be an investigation. If the investigation found violations, that would be referred to the Office of Integrity. They would meet out whatever the punishment might be and it seems like, up to the point of firing someone. So he sort of laid that out. He's clearly trying to thread a needle here, too, between dealing with the fact that certainly this is an organization with a morale problem, no doubt, following what has happened. He pointed out that heroism was present that day. And he's also trying to create this idea that there is some transparency. He's saying, I'm telling you what I know based on what I know at this point and these are extraordinary circumstances. Normally, I wouldn't comment on an investigation, but I'm doing it in this case. SANCHEZ: To that point about transparency, he actually provided a timeline of even before July 13th, what it was like for Secret Service to send in an advanced person, some of the procedures that they went through. And he also provided some details that we should ask our experts about.

And when I hear Acting Director Rowe talk about the failure to question the assumptions or the assumptions that are in the field, I do appreciate the fact that he has gone out, has made a mandate to special agents in charge in the field to eliminate those assumptions, right? But to me, that is -- you're starting to move the needle towards a systemic problem with the protective model. Because we have agents that are out there doing these advances. We heard that timeline of how long the preparation was for this event. If we're making any type of assumptions with local law enforcement, other key stakeholders within the security plan, that is, you know, you creating that intrinsic potential for failure. And we cannot ever have that again. So eliminating those assumptions is absolutely critical. And with that, to your point, is the communication, right? You cannot have bifurcated communication between local and -- local, state and, you know, federal agencies all working in unison. That can no longer be the norm. The new norm has to be a unified approach to communication, a unified approach to roles and responsibilities when it comes to executing a common security plan.

As a Secret Service agent, you know, yes, when you violate a policy within the Secret Service, there is a penalty structure that's to that. My question is, were there penalties -- I mean, were their policies that weren't even in existence, is this more procedural? And you know, of the procedural side of thing in that communication and the structure with local law enforcement and how do we work together? Those are more procedural, not actual policy. So I think that what you're going to see coming out of this are two things.

Tensions, of course, on the rise since the assassination of Hamas' political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, who was buried today in Qatar.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, we just learned from the Pentagon's deputy press secretary that the U.S. is going to be making a number of force posture changes in the Middle East.In light of this increased threat by the Iranians, given that it is widely expected that they are going to retaliate for that alleged Israeli assassination of that senior Hamas figure into Iran earlier this week. Now the deputy Pentagon press secretary declined to detail what exactly those force posture changes would look like, other than to say that it is essentially going to be an attempt to bolster the security of not only Israel, of course, but also U.S. forces who really have a footprint all across the Middle East and in Iraq and Syria, of course. And so this is going to be an attempt primarily to bolster their air defense systems, which, of course, are going to be necessary if Iran does decide to launch some kind of large-scale ballistic missile attack, like they did back in April. It also is expected to potentially involve the movement of all of the naval assets in the region right now, including the Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group, which is currently in the Gulf of Oman, but could be moved a little bit closer to the area here, including Lebanon, if the situation calls for it. But, you know, the U.S. has a lot of assets in the area right now, including amphibious assault ships in the Eastern Mediterranean. So they are pretty prepared at this point to respond at a moment's notice. But still, additional reinforcements here are probably going to be sent in, just given the likelihood that this Iranian attack is going to be potentially larger and even more complex than what we saw in April.",
