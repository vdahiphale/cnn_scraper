This is a place where with 53% of the vote uncommitted is doing significantly better, 21% of the vote and, you know, you go back to 2020, this was a place where Joe Biden really struggled. Bernie Sanders got 45% of the vote in that primary despite the fact that he only got 36% of the vote statewide. So, the fact is, it's doing better in those well-educated liberal areas, but it's not necessarily doing significantly better outside. And, you know, you go to, let's say, again, the northern part of the state. What do we see here? We see 14% for uncommitted in a less liberal area. We see it again up here, Iron County, 11%.

It's the administration because they're the ones actually dictating the policy here. I think that they should really consider coming out. Now, Biden said a couple of days ago that he thinks the ceasefire could come towards the end of the week. If that doesn't happen, they might want to consider coming out in full force and actually saying it is time for a ceasefire. And that is not just saying it is time for a ceasefire for Israel. It is time on both sides. This is not your time, Hamas, to rally your troops to go and attack Israel again. Hamas and Israel, you need a ceasefire, and we need to get the hostages back.

And they have chosen not to do those things.I think that if -- even if there were to be a ceasefire, you still see lingering kind of holdover feelings, I think, feed into a larger perception of Biden as out of touch with the base. Now, that is expressed here among an Arab-Muslim community. That is expressed among young people in a different way. That is expressed among Black voters in a different way. But it's a larger feeling of a disconnect between administration and base. But I do think the political question is connected to the policy question here, right? They were using the system to make a statement about what the Biden campaign is doing right now in terms of its support and connection to Israel. And I think the biggest critical political factor here is what do they do next on the policy front? And if there is a messaging question, can they find themselves responding to the expression of pain that these folks are consistently telling them?

What would be much more concerning to me, because this is a little bit of a low-risk protest, right? Because it's a Democratic primary. You're not actually voting for Donald Trump if you vote for uncommitted. It's a different question when you get to the fall.

They're not going to do that, and she mentioned that in her conversation with Laura.But if they were to carry this through November, this would be a huge concern for Joe Biden. Look, those numbers we're seeing right now, 46,000 Michigan people voted uncommitted. That's a significant number. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by around 150,000. In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump by around 10,000. So, 10,000 votes could sway the difference. If these uncommitted voters keep this passion going through to November, it could be a huge warning sign and a big problem for Joe Biden. I'm not certain they're going to do so. But we heard also from Debbie Dingell, congresswoman from Michigan earlier, she has been sounding the alarm to this administration for quite some time. We have to address the situation. The Arab-Muslim community in Michigan is crying out for this. And the younger community in Michigan is doing so as well.

Look at the polling here. Donald Trump dominating California. Look at this. A 40-point lead. He'd get all the delegates out there, way more than 100 delegates.How about in Texas? Winner-take-most. Eighty percent of the vote to just 19% for Nikki Haley. So, the two biggest prizes on Super Tuesday looking very good for Donald Trump, and this is part of something that we're seeing in the calendar going forward because tonight in Michigan, you know, Nikki Haley is getting about a little less than a third of the vote. That ain't likely to happen in a lot of states going forward because take a look at the choice for GOP nominee nationally. Quinnipiac University, a recent poll, look at this, 80% of the vote for Donald Trump, just 17% for Nikki Haley. Marquette University Law School poll, look here, 73% of the vote for Donald Trump, just 15% for Nikki Haley. So, California and Texas, next Tuesday, very large leads for Donald Trump. It's part of a larger pattern where we're seeing very large leads for Donald Trump nationally.",

We've got CNN contributor Lulu Garcia-Navarro, \"Bloomberg\" political and policy columnist Nia-Malika Henderson, CNN political commentator Karen Finney, and Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton.I am dying to hear what each of you has to say about this because what we're seeing tonight, yet another race, and yes, Trump was successful, but to Abby's point, I mean, he could have been more definitive in his win. Lulu, let me ask you about this because he was expected to win. Nikki Haley is saying, look, I already told you, Super Tuesday is where I'm going. She's vowing to stay in the race. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: She is going to stay in the race. I have long said I am not exactly clear who is her constituency in the Republican Party. I mean, this is the thing. This is a Republican primary, and we've seen her be very strong with independents, we've seen her be very strong with people who identify within the Republican Party as moderates or liberals. I don't know exactly who they are but, apparently, they are people who support Nikki Haley. And yet, and yet, here we are and you see that polling and you see that she has no path going forward. And so, all the speculation is, what if something happens to Donald Trump? What if, you know, the legal issues come over and sort of throw him out of the race? The problem with that is, I'm not convinced that Nikki Haley is the person that they're going to turn to. And so, at this point, she is someone that the Never Trumpers really like.

Abortion, despite the fact that abortion does very well in those ballot measures, 49% of Americans said that abortion was morally wrong in the last poll that we had in IVF back in 2013.

And they also understand that Joe Biden and Democrats would much rather be talking about the abortion issue than the economy, than the border, than national security, than crime in the streets. These are issues that he is underwater on against Donald Trump. And they would much rather be talking about abortion.

And you know that abortion is the kind of most potent issue on this. I think Republicans have put themselves in the pickle of their own creation. The evangelical pro-life wing that has captured specifically the legal arm of the Republican Party and really driven the party on this issue is out of step with what the majority of Americans are. We continue to see that pop up in state after state after state. And so, when you have, you know, the reason that Senator Duckworth can do this on the Senate floor, the reason why this continues to be something that gives Democrats hope for November, is because Republicans haven't even kind of decided where they want to go going forward. To your point, they are embracing a national ban and their wing of evangelical forces that on to candidates.

Two hundred and forty were taken hostage, 134 of those are still held hostage, and this could end today if Hamas does exactly what they should do, which is release the hostages.And it's also important to know that the Palestinians in Gaza are also victims of Hamas. This is a tragedy, an epic tragedy that has been perpetrated on the people of Gaza and the people of Israel by a terrorist organization, Hamas. It lays at their feet. COATES: Certainly, the idea of addressing the death toll and what is being experienced, those who remain as hostages and those who are confined to the area, is part of what is behind the protests and the humanitarian discussions that really has to be tackled in terms of what goes next and what happens next. I do want to point out to you that there is some new reporting by our CNN global affairs analyst, Barak Ravid, and he is reporting tonight that the Biden administration is giving Israel until mid-March, which is two weeks away, really, to commit in writing to abide by international law while using U.S. weapons. And here is the consequence if they don't. If they don't, those weapons, the transfers will then be paused. I'm wondering, should the U.S. consider pausing military aid if this reporting is true?",
