Runoff parliamentary elections are underway in France as the far-right works to build on its first place showing in the first round. And we were live in Paris. And as Israel marks nine months since the deadly Hamas terror attacks, there are signs of progress in negotiations to see more hostages released. With his key primetime interview behind him, President Joe Biden is set to make campaign stop in another key battleground state later today. Now, Mr. Biden is defiantly staying in the presidential race, even as another Democratic lawmaker calls for him to step aside. Here's CNN's Arlette Saenz with more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The most recent lawmaker to do so was Congresswoman Angie Craig from a swing district in Minnesota. She wrote in a statement on Saturday that the president's debate, as well as what she viewed as a lack of a forceful response from the president himself in the days after had left her to believe that he would be ineffective in campaigning and beating Trump in November. Now, the president has pushed back on the idea that top Democrats want to see him leave this race. But he has been consulting his senior team about the way forward in this campaign. The president dialed into a phone call with the co-chairs of his campaign on Saturday morning. Senator Chris Coons, one of those co-chairs, told CNN that the call lasted for more than an hour and that the president sought honest input and advice from that team about the best path forward in this campaign. Coons is expecting that President Biden will try to have more direct engagements like town halls or press conferences to send -- get his message out to voters, but also try to quell some of those concerns about his stamina and fitness to serve. Now, the president will be campaigning in Pennsylvania on Sunday. He will attend a church service in Philadelphia before attending a campaign event in the Harrisburg area. But President Biden still is facing so many questions about the future of his candidacy as the pressure within his party has continued to build since that debate.

He should be sharp, precise, and energetic. Just like he was in the debate.\" Now, Donald Trump is certainly just stirring the pot with this social media post. But look, when we talk to people near and around his campaign, they believe that his easiest path to victory is for Joe Biden to remain in the race. So, perhaps what we're seeing here is some restlessness from the former president, as this story and focus remains on Joe Biden now for a second week, especially with so many key important dates on the horizon for Donald Trump. He has a rally on Tuesday in South Florida, another later in the week. He is going to name his vice president any day now, and a little over a week from now, he will hold his convention in Milwaukee. So, perhaps the question is, how long can he allow for this story and this focus to remain on Joe Biden? Steve Contorno, CNN, St. Petersburg, Florida. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Judge Aileen Cannon also agreed to hold briefings on whether she should pause the entire case in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. She set up a two-week schedule to hear those arguments.The former president faces a total of 40 criminal counts related to the retention of classified documents, including national defense materials, so sensitive it required special handling. Trump has pleaded not guilty. But the Supreme Court's decision last month -- last Monday granted broad immunity to presidents for official acts. Now, trial courts will have to assess whether Trump's alleged conduct is official or not. The high court decision will likely have an impact on all four criminal cases against him.

For three weeks, protesters have demanded an end to soaring living costs and to government corruption. They're also demanding accountability and justice from the police.According to human rights groups, security forces have killed at least 40 unarmed protesters in the past few weeks of unrest.

This is the England-Switzerland game. Fifty minutes from time and that's when the Swiss take the lead through Breel Embolo, and Switzerland's fans sent into delirium. But could they hold on to their lead? Well, the short answer would be no, because five minutes later, it's Bukayo Saka who shows all his class, wonderful finish there, right into the corner, beautifully placed into the net for one. All this match going to extra time, then penalties.And a heartbreak for the Swiss as Manuel Akanji sees his country's first spot kick saved, everyone else scored, and it's Trent Alexander- Arnold to win it for England, and the Liverpool man does not disappoint. Another great escape for the English, who's head coach Gareth Southgate celebrating victory now in his 100th match in charge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's Stefan de Vrij with a superb header to level the match at one apiece. Unsavable head, a brilliant technique. That's Dutch delight. And Dutch delight turning to Dutch elation and euphoria. Minutes later, uncertain defending and it's Holland ahead. Cody Gakpo will claim it as the ball crosses the line. It was ruled an own goal in the end, but Netherlands with a 201 victory. They book a spot in the semis. So, those semis are now set at the Euros on Tuesday. We're going to get all eyes on Spain and France as they go head-to-head in Munich. La Roja looking to become champs of Europe for a fourth time. And in the other semi, it's England taking on the Netherlands in Dortmund. A huge amount to look forward to this coming week.
