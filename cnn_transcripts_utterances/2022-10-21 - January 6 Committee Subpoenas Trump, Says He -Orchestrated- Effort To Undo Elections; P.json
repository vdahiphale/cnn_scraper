Plus, new audio tonight in OUTFRONT from the front lines. Newly drafted Russian soldiers saying they haven't been paid, they have no helmet, no flack jackets and no basic training. And he is the world's richest man by a long shot. Is he about to have major influence on two massive global conflicts? Why the Biden administration is now considering teaming up with Elon Musk. It is exclusive CNN reporting this hour. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, Trump subpoenaed. The January 6th committee in its most aggressive move yet officially serving the former president with a subpoena for documents and testimony about the insurrection. It is a ten-page document. Got it here. And it lays out the committee's findings. It makes it clear, they say, that Trump is the, quote, central figure in the committee's investigation. They say, and I quote, we have assembled overwhelming evidence including from dozens of your former appointees and staff that you personally orchestrated and oversaw a multipart effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and to obstruct the peaceful transition of power. That crucial word \"obstruct.\" Trump's attorneys responding tonight saying they will review the subpoena. They put a legal statement out. Quote, we once again that flouting norms and appropriate and customary process, the committee has publicly released a copy of its subpoena. What's interesting at this hour so far no word from Trump himself. You know, he always has a lot to say about this issue. I keep this. This is his letter. When the committee voted to subpoena Trump last week, he wrote this 14-page letter to the chairman of the committee, Bennie Thompson. It's got pictures in here of his crowd size for the January 6th rally. He rants in all caps in his opening line, the presidential election of 2020 was rigged and stolen. It goes on to say despite very poor television ratings, the unselect committee has perpetuated a show trial. As he continues, 14 pages, a lot to say, ranting and raving. And, yet, nothing like that tonight. Just the letter from his lawyers. It all comes on the same day that Trump's former top adviser Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison for defying the January 6th Committee. The judge saying as he delivered that punishment because Bannon showed, quote, no remorse for defying Congress and that others must be deterred from committing similar crimes. And that's not the only major development in an investigation involving Trump tonight. There's so many things happening. \"The Washington Post\" has important new reporting, saying that the most sensitive classified documents seized from Mar-a-Lago include information about Iran's missile program and highly sensitive intelligence-gathering aimed at China that could expose how the United States gathers intelligence, the sources and methods. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT. And, Evan, there's a lot happening here as the former president receives this subpoena from the January 6th committee. What is the latest?",

One is on November 4th where he is being ordered to produce just a wide variety of documents, communications, signal encrypted messages from a number of people including people like the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, some of his former allies like Mike Flynn, Rudy Giuliani.And, of course, the committee goes through the list of the allegations against the former president, some of which they say are supported by people in his administration, people inside his own White House. And I'll read you just a part of what they say. They say, you were at the center of the first and only by a U.S. president to overturn an election and obstruct the peaceful transition of power. And what the president is also being asked to do is to appear for a deposition on November 14th. This would be behind closed doors, he would be taking questions from the committee staff, from committee members. The committee in their letter to the former president point out that there are some of them who are former prosecutors who will be doing these questions. And as you pointed out, the former president's legal team says they are going to review the subpoena. We don't anticipate, Erin, that there's going to be a lot of cooperation if the past is prologue.",

And now he's asking the Supreme Court to come in and stop the Fulton County grand jury from taking his testimony.The argument that the senator is making is that because he is a sitting senator, he's protected by the constitution's speech or debate clause. He says that the efforts that he made speaking to officials there in Georgia to try to overturn the election results there were part of his preparation for January 6th and his effort to object to the certification. So, that's what he says he was working on at the time. And, so, obviously, the 11th Circuit has already said that, look, you do have those protections as a senator, but they are not just unilateral, that there are some questions that you should take from the grand jury. So we'll see. The request went to Clarence Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas. And we expect that he is likely to refer it to the broader court. And then we'll see what they decide -- Erin.",

They're from Maxar. We're just going to tell you what they're looking at. This is an antitank fortification that right now runs more than a mile long, four rows of cement pyramids with a large trench behind them. It's in eastern Ukraine. Russian media outlets are dubbing it the Wagner line, referring to the Wagner Group, which is a Russian mercenary group known for its brutal and inhumane tactics. Now this new video and satellite images are also revealing that this trench digging, all of these, these concrete pyramids really have just happened in the past few weeks. It's all in a Russian-occupied town in Luhansk, which is one of the four regions Putin has illegally annexed. One Russian media outlet says that the Wagner Group plans for it to go 135 miles. The strategy, the reason for such a massive buildup is unknown right now. And President Zelenskyy is, at the same time, ramping up warnings that Putin is preparing for a false flag attack. Zelenskyy claims Russian forces are mining crucial parts of this dam that you're looking at on the Dnipro River. The Ukrainian president saying Putin's goal is to frame Ukraine for the attack on the dam. It is an event that would devastate the city of Kherson, could leave hundreds of thousands of people in nearly a hundred towns and cities underwater it. It would also leave Ukraine's largest nuclear power plant and the largest in Europe without any water that is needed for cooling. It would also risk the lives of many thousands of Russian soldiers, including the newly mobilized and the wholly unprepared troops from Putin's draft. These troops are now increasingly talking about their dire situation. So, I'm going to show you a video that is shared on Telegram which is where many Russians post. It purports to show discontent among Russian soldiers. Take a look.

I think what's more important is what it indicates. And what it indicates is the Russians are now almost everywhere except for Bakhmut where you were just looking in the defensive position. I think they understand that they've lost the initiative right now. They're desperately trying to draft these new troops in, build up a new army.

This was something that they were forced into when they understood the situation on the battlefield, and they simply had not prepared for this in any rational way in terms of putting aside the right equipment, stockpiling what you needed.

But I still think it's unlikely.And I think Putin is also calculating that we're going into winter. He is really hoping that the oil and energy crisis that is going to strike Europe, that the hardships that are going to come because of the sanctions and because of the difficulties, he's hoping that the political will to continue to help Ukraine is going to go by the wayside on the side of the West, certainly on the Europeans.
