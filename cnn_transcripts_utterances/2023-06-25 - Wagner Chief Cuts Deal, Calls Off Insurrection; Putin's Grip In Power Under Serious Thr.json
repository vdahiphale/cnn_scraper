They armed a column of vehicles that Prigozhin had sent from Rostov-on-Don in the South to Moscow.They've been seen turning south, driving back south. Prigozhin himself disappeared off into the night from Rostov-on-Don. Allegedly, we're told, because that was a part of the deal, on his way to Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has taken an interesting role here, apparently leading the negotiations to head off what could have been a very, very bloody situation. And we know how bloody it could have been because Ramzan Kadyrov's Chechen forces, that Special Forces pulling back overnight from Rostov-on-Don, fierce fighters like Wagner, very well battle hardened. So that could have been a tough fight. But the fact that Lukashenko made this deal and not Putin, the fact that Prigozhin thought that he could rise up and have this insurrection and challenged Putin's authority, albeit, complaining about the Defense Minister, shows that the war in Ukraine is giving opportunity to opportunists, thugs, if you will, private military contractor leaders like Prigozhin who see an opportunity for perhaps more power and more influence, and not to have their troops signed up to Russian military control. So the immediate aftermath is just going to be unclear for some time, I think. But the effects on the ground, the roads are being patched up, the troops are disappearing. So the immediate threats, they're dissipating.",

What happens to a lot of their fighters and what happens to the future of the Wagner group as well, but also, quite frankly, Wolf, to Yevgeny Prigozhin's entire gigantic business operations in many fields that he has around the world.First of all, we know what we heard from the Kremlin, from the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov yesterday, where he said that the Wagner fighters, because of their achievements on the battlefield and because. You know, for many Russians, they are quite well respected. I think we saw that on the ground yesterday, with a lot of people cheering on the Wagner fighters as they were leaving. A lot of people congratulating those Wagner fighters. They do have a special status among many Russians, that they can then sign up to join the Russian military to get -- become part of the Russian military structure and infrastructure. And that was something that the military leadership in Russia has been pushing for for a while. The Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, he came out a couple of weeks ago and he said that the private military companies all have to sign contracts with the defense ministry. Now, Yevgeny Prigozhin had said that he wasn't going to do that, and that was certainly one of the things that also escalated, if you will, the big fight between those two individuals, between the Defense Minister and between Yevgeny Prigozhin, but only one of those things. But the big question now is, what happens to Yevgeny Prigozhin's gigantic business empire? You're talking about dealings in Africa, if you're looking at diamonds and also gold, but also training African forces. There's a huge military footprint that Wagner has in Africa, in the Middle East as well. And then one of the things that we haven't looked at also far is the media empire also that Yevgeny Prigozhin has. He's, of course, one of the people that the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election. And was indicted for that by the United States. So, Yevgeny Prigozhin going to step back from all of that, from his exile, that it realistically is in Belarus? Is he still going to play some sort of role? What's going to happen to the immediate commanders that he had as well? A lot of them in their own right play, a big role in the military operations of Wagner, not just in Ukraine, but elsewhere as well. There are definitely a lot more unanswered questions than questions that we've gotten, but of course one of the things we have to keep in mind is that this is a situation, as Nic said, that was defused very quickly yesterday. Certainly, a lot of the details aren't known yet and a lot of the details will be ironed out. But one of the things that we can say that for Yevgeny Prigozhin who seemed as though he was at the height of his power, with the big role that Wagner was playing in Ukraine, definitely a very hard and very steep fall for him in a very short period of time, Wolf.",

And the fact that Shoigu was attempting to co-opt, Prigozhin group and other -- and any of the other groups that are professional -- or the mercenary groups, if you will.It shows just kind of the tension that exists. But one other thing, Wolf, I'd suggest, this ain't over yet. There's still things happening. We have not seen the end of the kind of dialogue and dysfunction between Prigozhin and others like him, toward the Minister of Defense and Mr. Putin. It certainly shows a weakness at the senior leadership of the Russian government, and that's Mr. Putin himself. He has been harmed significantly by this, and the walls are closing in in a bunch of other areas around Mr. Putin in this so-called special military operation.",

Yesterday morning, he was being called a traitor. By yesterday afternoon, there's no accountability whatsoever.As far as the members of the Wagner Group, Wolf, I'm going to put it in perspective. These guys were considered even as brutal and as unskilled or unskilled and untrained and unprofessional as they are, they were some of the best within the Russian Army. So asking them to join normal infantry units would be like asking a ranger or a Delta force or a SEAL to just go to some infantry unit and spend the rest of their time on the front lines. It's just unfathomable from a military perspective what might happen to the Wagner group in the future, and that's why I say this isn't over yet. There is going to be internal rebellion within the military, within the army itself, not just at the senior leader level. There's a lack of trust now in all of the leaders of the Russian force, especially Mr. Putin by the soldiers wearing the uniform.",

But for embattled Russian President Vladimir Putin, this crisis could have a lasting effect on his ability to lead Russia.Here with us right now is Washington Post Opinion Columnist Max Boot, he has a new op-ed this morning entitled, \"Putin Finally Learned His Lesson\". Max, so much -- thanks so much for joining us. In your column, a very important, significant column, indeed, you write this, \"Putin is learning what so many tyrants have learned before him.

The man that nobody can challenge, and anybody who does winds up dead or in jail.But you just saw in the last few days that Prigozhin did in fact challenge Putin, and we had this amazing spectacle of these mutinous mercenary troops marching on Moscow, and eventually they turned back, but they didn't turn back because they were smashed by the Russian military. In fact, there was very little indication of the Russian military even being willing to fight the Wagner troops. They were ultimately turned back because of a deal brokered by Putin's sidekick, Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus. And, you know, by all accounts, Prigozhin, gets out of this. He's not going to a prison cell. He's not going 6-feet under. He's going to Belarus. And, you know, the fighters that he led will get an amnesty. So, I think this was clearly a sign of the weakness of the Putin regime. It's not quite as solid as it seems from the outside.",

I mean, you know, Prigozhin is still going to be around. He's only in Belarus. That's not that far away. He can easily run the Wagner group from Belarus.There was, you know, there was talk about having the Wagner fighters who are loyal to the Russian Defense Ministry, but what that means in practice in terms of operational control, those fighters, it's very unclear. I will say this, Wolf, that if the Wagner group is no longer on the front lines on zero line in Ukraine. I think that'll be a significant blow to the Russian war effort because the Wagner troops have been some of the most determined, and the ones who are willing to suffer horrifying casualties in Putin's brutal cause much more so than the regular troops or, you know, conscripts and have low morale. So, you know, whatever happens, I think this is going to lead to less effective Russian military. And the Russian military already wasn't that effective. So I think, you know, we --it's very hard to judge full-scale ramifications because we don't know, you know, exactly what's going to happen with the Wagner group.

And in fact, I think that aura has already been in decline over the past 16 months because, you know, everybody had more respect and fear for Putin before the Ukrainian evasion than after the Ukrainian invasion because it's revealed the massive deficiencies in his military forces that they have been ground to a halt and in fact have been pushed back in many areas by the Ragtag Ukrainian military.So, you know, I don't think that Putin is going to inspire quite as much fear in the future as he has in the past. And I think what this also indicates is that, you know, it's very possible that time is actually on the side of the Ukrainians because, you know, the conventional wisdom has been that time is on Russia's side because it's a larger country. Ukraine is dependent on outside help, and the other countries may lose interest in supporting Ukraine. But, in fact, I think what this is revealing, Wolf, is something incredibly important, which is the strength of democracy at war, and that's Ukraine. They have a democratically elected leader who has near unanimous support. The Ukrainian people are united behind the war effort, whereas in Russia, you know, there's surface support for the war, but very little enthusiasm and certainly no enthusiasm for the Putin regime. Putin engenders fear, but he doesn't engender love or loyalty. And you saw that as soon as the Wagner troops challenged him, most of the population and the Russian Armed Forces kind of stood on the sidelines. They weren't mobilizing to say Putin. So I think, you know, I think this shows you something very important about the hidden fragility of a dictatorship and the hidden strength of a democracy like Ukraine.",

So, it was clear that this power struggle could have ramifications on the war in Ukraine. And the White House and administration officials were making calls to their allies and partners as this was all unfolding. Now, President Biden is at Camp David with his national security team, including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who canceled an international trip to travel to Camp David with President Biden and brief him on this fast-developing situation. So, while the White House has stayed mum because of concerns that anything they do say could be weaponized by Putin, they have been talking behind closed doors to leaders across the world as they all monitor what is happening on the ground. And we should note that U.S. officials were watching as early as January that there was an internal power struggle that was bubbling and officials believe that the tensions would mount.

Not clear. And it was also unclear when this would actually take place, and that's why we saw U.S. officials kind of scrambling on Friday night and into Saturday to figure out what exactly was happening with emergency meetings being convened across the government and, of course, senior U.S. officials canceling international travel to stay in D.C. and monitor the events. But U.S. officials are now looking at how this is actually is going to, of course, affect Putin and how he oversees the country. Is he going to try to consolidate power? Is he going to try to escalate things in Ukraine to make an example out of what happened with Wagner and try to show the world that he actually still is in control? U.S. officials don't know at this point whether Prigozhin is actually going to remain in exile in Belarus. Is he -- where is he at this point? They simply don't know right now. And so, these are all things that they are going to be looking at moving forward because the challenge that Prigozhin posed to Putin is perhaps the most significant -- he faced over the last two decades.

The most serious challenge to Vladimir Putin's reign in his more than two decades in power.To discuss all of this and more, let's bring in Nathan Hodge, he's a CNN editor here in London right now, but was also a former bureau chief for CNN in Moscow. He knows a lot about what's going on. Nathan, Thanks so much for joining us. Prigozhin claimed he was targeting the Russian military leadership not necessarily Putin himself, but help us better understand just how unprecedented this moment is for the Russian president.",

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, Wolf, first of all, I think the thing that jumps out to me is, you know, how the Kremlin's formidable spin machine will be handling all of this, because the Kremlin has, over the course of more than two decades, been building up the image of Putin as almost this sort of infallible strong man. So, the man on horseback, the man of action, the decider, the person who has the reins of state and is a steady hand. And here, Prigozhin's confrontation with Putin and this march by Wagner forces on Moscow just flies, you know, completely in the face of this carefully constructed edifice.You know, it was over two decades ago during the Second Chechen War Putin raised his public profile by showing that he was going to be a tough guy, that he was going to waste them in the outhouse, the term -- the tough guy talk that he used for taking on Chechen separatists at the time. But now, the person who has sort of displaced him on Russia's stage as the tough talker, as the straight shooter, as the uber nationalist has been Yevgeny Prigozhin. Somebody who sort of speaks in this kind of criminal argot, who really has commanded in a lot of ways where he previously, before the full scale-scale invasion of Ukraine, had almost no public profile. The Kremlin didn't acknowledge his activities and basically kept him at arm's length. So, you know, this has been an extraordinary -- you know, it's not even a dent, it's massive damage to Putin's stature and his public image as the person who can't be challenged, Wolf.",

It's more or less impossible to publicly criticize the Russian military. So, I think if you get a phone call from a pollster saying, we'd like to know if you approve or disapprove of the president's actions or the war in Ukraine, you're going to think twice about it.You know, so I think that, generally speaking, Prigozhin hasn't been that -- he hasn't figured that large. But state media over the course of, you know, the past many months have been pumping up Wagner, both on, you know, these Telegram channels by Russian war correspondents as well as state TV basically making him into, you know, this, again, ruthless tough guy hero whose kind of looks like sort of almost like the villain from Central Casting who is taking the fight to Ukraine. For instance, the battle for Bakhmut got a lot of air time and it did significantly raise his profile and it's hard to say how large those crowds really are in Rostov. You know, but clearly, he has raised, you know, his public profile in Russia, Wolf.",
