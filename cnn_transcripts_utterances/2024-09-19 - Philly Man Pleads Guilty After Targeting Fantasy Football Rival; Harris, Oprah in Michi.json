      "sentences": "Yes, and that's because they say that he called in these fake tips not once, but twice internationally. Once in Norway, once here in the U.S., and it was all because of this beef he had with a fellow player in his fantasy football league. So apparently, they had some sort of disagreement.And then this 25-year-old Pennsylvania man, Matthew Gabriel, he thought it would be a good idea in August 2023 to send out an alert in Norway to the Norway Norwegian police security service, claiming that this man he had a feud with online was going to conduct a mass shooting. And this is how he put it in the alert to the Norwegian authorities. He said, On August 15th, a man named (blank redacted) is headed around Oslo and has a shooting plan with multiple people on his side involved. They plan to take as many as they can at a concert and then head to a department store. I don't know any more people than that. I just can't have random people dying on my conscience. Now, as you can imagine, once Norwegian police got that tip, they worked with U.S. authorities, conducted, you know, hundreds of hours worth of investigation over five days. The FBI actually then interviewed Matthew Gabriel, later charging him. And then it was months later where he apparently, according to authorities, did it yet again, this time in the U.S., sending an alert to the University of Iowa. And he said that there was going to be some sort of incident at the university, knowing that that's where his rival went to school. So now this man, 25 years old, he has pleaded guilty to these two charges. And, you know, the U.S. attorney in Pennsylvania, who her office brought this case, issued what's a pretty poignant statement here. This is from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Jacqueline Romero. Writing this: While already being prosecuted for one hoax threat spurred by, of all things, his fantasy football league, Matthew Gabriel inexplicably decided to send another. His actions were extremely disruptive and consumed significant law enforcement resources on two continents, diverting them from actual incidents and investigations. And then she warns, you know: Hoax threats aren't a joke or protected speech. They are a crime. My advice to keyboard warriors who'd like to avoid federal charges, always think of the potential consequences before you hit post or sent. A big lesson for this one man in particular.",

He faces those two counts.He was released on $25,000 bond and he will be sentenced this coming January. And he does face up to five years in prison. So, you know, like the U.S. attorney said, this is no joke. And his hoax went way too far.",

Political organizers, political activists, leaders of Black-centered female organizations. But there is a level of excitement that is up here.To quote one, we're going to work our asses off. To quote another, if Kamala Harris does not win, it won't be because Black women did not do their job. So that's where the energy is, and that's where the mindset is. But when we talk about tangibles of what's different here with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, we've seen a couple of things, like Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, historically Black sorority. Vice President Harris is a member. They, for the very first time, recently launched their own political pack, allowing them to inject themselves in politics, endorse and fundraise for candidates. Delta Sigma Theta, another Black female-centered organization, Black sorority, they are running TV ads in battleground states for the very first time. So we're seeing that sort of thing. And then tonight's event that we've been talking about with Oprah Winfrey, that was organized by the Win with Black Women organization. You remember them, they did that Zoom call. They say some 90,000 Black women tuned in. This was just hours after President Joe Biden said he was dropping out of the race. So this event tonight is an offshoot of that Zoom call. But that is what we're talking about here as far as how these Black women are organizing. But what they all tell me is we've been doing this for decades. This is not new to us. But what they are saying is new is that the nation is paying attention to what preparation, meeting this very specific historic moment, what it looks like. And this is what it looks like.",

She says, Black women have been carrying the Democratic Party over the finish line decade after decade. But what's good here and what's sweet this time around is we get the best of both worlds with a woman who deeply understands our struggles. So there's this sense that within the issues that they care about, they trust how a Black woman will handle and address those issues.",

They're just very fragile in what the temperature can be and we have to be extremely careful when we take care of them because they have these very narrow thermal temperatures.So when we have them in the aquariums and why we're partnering with the Texas State Aquarium is we need to make sure that the conditions that we have the aquaria at are maintained in these very narrow windows that are optimal for corals to grow at. So we're able to work with the aquarium here and be able to maintain those temperatures for the corals and have certain levels of the temperature, the pH of the water and of course the nutrients of the water to be able to grow the corals here. And make sure that they're thriving in the waters that we have here and it's not getting too hot so we can continue to grow them and make sure that they're healthy in the environment here in Texas.",

      "sentences": "Yes of course, and I think one of the challenging things it might sound like well we're removing these organisms from this environment why exactly are we doing that? Well the primary reason behind doing this work is we were collecting some of these coral to do some experiments to understand if we were to do some dredging activities to have more ports or any kind of coastal development we want to know what kind of impacts that's going to have on corals. And that's what the research that we do here in my lab we want to have better informed decisions of how what we do here on land impacts our corals. So that we can make informed decisions about how to be more responsible here on land.So this is part of the reason why we need to get corals from this area so that we can make sure that the work that we are doing is actually relatable to the area where this work is intended to happen. The second reason why we wanted to remove these corals from some of the nurseries that are in Florida is these nurseries that are housed by Nova Southeastern University is out planted to be able to have this critically endangered species of coral known as the staghorn coral. They're trying to grow them out and have more of this coral because it is depleting and it's unfortunately dying because the waters are getting so warm. So we're trying to grow them so that there's more of them available when the water gets cooler. Unfortunately as you just mentioned the water is getting really, really warm right now. So this is a really great opportunity for us to take some of that coral remove it from the environment and move it somewhere where the water wasn't warm so we could save those corals from potentially bleaching and dying at the same time. And the last thing that we did was when we think about our waters there is some debris that's in the water whether it's tires or old piers or other structures some of that needs to be removed and sometimes coral settle and grow on that. If we want to remove that structures from the water the coral also needs to be removed and that coral needs to have a home and we would like to have that coral to have a home. And when the folks at Nova Southeastern said well we need to find homes for this coral I said can we please take those corals and provide a home for that because we wanted to be able to make sure that those corals had somewhere to go.",
