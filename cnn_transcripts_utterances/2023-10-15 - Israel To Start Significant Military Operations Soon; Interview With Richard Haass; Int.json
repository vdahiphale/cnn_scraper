Let's get the latest live from Israel and then we will talk to Richard Haass about the global politics at play, the influence of America, Saudi Arabia, Iran and others in this conflict. Then, historian Rasheed Khalidi will join me to talk about Palestinian politics and the reaction of the rest of the Arab world. Also, just how did Israel's much lauded intelligence apparatus miss the signs of an imminent enormous Hamas attack? I will talk to the Israel investigative reporter Ronen Bergman. Finally, the history of Hamas. How the Islamist group came to control Gaza and why it was able to pull off last week's terror attacks. We'll explore with an expert. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

If anything, the Israeli reaction is even stronger than the American reaction in part because of images of the Holocaust and what Jews have experienced throughout their history. But your point, I think, is spot on. Ultimately you've got to be smart. You've got to make foreign policy with your head as much as with your heart. So I would say, yes, the Israelis must respond. They must show thatterrorism cannot stand, it cannot go unanswered. But I would say go in targeted. Go in discrete. Go after Hamas, not the people of Gaza. Also the Israelis need to focus on rebuilding their defenses outside of Gaza, in western Israel. The fact that this could have succeeded says that they were focusing on the wrong areas. But your larger point is right. They should not get too ambitious. They should not try to remake Gaza. They've got to think this through, that even if they were to succeed militarily, and I don't think they can if the definition of success is to root out Hamas, then they would have to think what is the political authority that would fill the vacuum? There isn't one. That's why this entire approach is understandable but I fear it will be regrettable.",

He said the crucial question we have to ask ourselves is, are we producing more terrorists that we are killing with our actions, and I have to say you look at some of those images in Gaza and again totally justifiably, you know, understandable how outrage the Israelis are, but the question is, what is the effect on the ground in Gaza among Palestinians? You've got 2.2 million in Gaza.",

We know and I know that won't last. Calls for a cease-fire will grow louder by the day. I also think that if Israel does a large operation in Gaza, it increases the odds of war widening. I fear it will be difficult for groups like Hezbollah to sit still.They'll feel the need to somehow get into the act lest they look weak while Hamas does everything. And it's not in the American interest, it's not in the Israeli interest for this war to widen. So another awkward thing here, Fareed, is I actually think the Biden administration, which has been so supportive of Israel in public. The president's speech I thought was his best speech. I think in private they have got to speak as only friends can speak to one another and be extraordinarily direct about what in our view is wise but also not wise for Israel to do.",

This is their DNA, and my view is in some ways even if in the short run, they're degraded, which they ought to be, I fear that in the long run it reinforces their argument that they're the only game in town when it comes to promoting Palestinian interest, however misguided it might be.If Israel, though, I'd say this, Fareed. If Israel is going to do something very hard and large against Hamas, then it needs a political track. It needs a complementary policy. It's not enough just to defeat the terrorists, there's also got to be something that's been obviously missing from Israeli policy for more than a decade now which is a serious political effort to deal with the larger Palestinian issue. You just can't beat back terrorism. You have to show there's an alternative path that actually has a chance of succeeding.",

Maybe I'm wrong. But it was striking to me. He had a phone call with the Iranian president. If you are trying to get those two countries together, you know, Richard, seemed impossible, is normalization completely off the table?I also want you to expand that to -- I was struck by fact that nobody has talked about any of the countries that did recognize Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, withdrawing that.

The Palestinians still hold considerable influence over Arab populations, and you raised a larger question. Could there be some stalling or reversing of those countries that have entered into relations with Israel? But we've already seen pauses in normalization. But if there was something that's spread to Islamic holy places, I don't think that what's been accomplished so far is irreversible.",

If this is horrific and terrorist, that is horrific and terrorist.I hate -- I abhor the idea of killing of civilians but civilians are civilians, children are children.

And in both cases the Palestinians essentially walked away.Abbas, from what we can tell, never responded to Olmert and Arafat essentially launched an intifada.

None of them involved an end to settlements.You can't have a Palestinian state with hundreds of thousands of Israelis settled there. You cannot have a Palestinian state if you don't control your borders. In other words, what was on offer was never anywhere near the minimum of what is required for a just, equitable two state solution. That was never on offer in any of these Israeli offers. However far they went. I could go into detail if you want. But I think that is the problem. And the last thing I'll say is these things were quite a while ago.

The result is amazingly frighteningly the same, a surprise strategic attack that Israel knew nothing about and caused Israel unbelievable damage.But it is different. 1973, there was a lot of information, much intelligence from all kinds of intelligence. They saw the Egyptian army. They saw the Egyptian -- the Syrian army, but they interpreted the intelligence differently. This case, there was nothing. Until the last night where there some kind of a scarce alert, Israel was either not monitoring the right channels, not recruiting the right agents, or maybe it was Hamas who learned from previous experience, who learned from masters in Tehran, the force of the revolutionary guard, and was able either to create the parallel channel, or maybe even understanding which channel under the surveillance of Israeli intelligence and feed those with false information, with information that made Israel believe that Hamas relatively, to Hamas, is under one of those moderate -- relatively moderate, if Hamas doesn't, they said is deterred. Just five days before the attack, the national security adviser of the country said in an interview Hamas is deterred. He knows what would happen to it, in another case of defiance. Well, he didn't know -- the national security didn't know anything. And so, no intelligence. No ability to understand that we are talking about massive operation, 2,000 perpetrators crossed the fence that day. So, there are 3,000, at least, people involved.
