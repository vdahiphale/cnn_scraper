Let me see if I can do this, I haven't a chance to do this trick yet.All right. This is the blackboard here. In - this is percentage - I'm not going to do percentage, I'm going to do raw votes. There were 1,195 new votes reported for Kelly, 1,743 reported for Blake Masters there. So you can see closing that margin about a 5,000 - 5,650-vote difference there. So Blake Masters closing the gap ever so slightly, guys. So you can see this is how it's going to go in these states for some time, back and forth one way or the other. We're going to get these new batches of votes reporting and it's going to change this margin one direction or the next year. This was Yavapai County, which is a county actually that leans for the Republicans by about 30 percent. So the margin there for Blake Masters you might expect. So that's the thing that we're watching in Arizona, as you can see now, Mark Kelly still with the lead, the Democratic incumbent still with a lead of nearly 95,000 but a little bit less than it was about 10 minutes ago, guys.",

But even as the President is taking this so called - this victory laps of sort, he is also staring down the possibility of having to work with a divided government. Yesterday, President Biden said that he is prepared to work with Republicans and that he expects Republicans to do the same with him and that is why he held that call yesterday with GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy who very well could be House Speaker if Republicans take control of the House in the coming weeks as those races are coming in. But the President also drew some very clear lines of some non- negotiables for him and that includes GOP proposals that would cut Social Security and Medicare or implement a nationwide ban on abortion. The President is saying that those are the types of items that he would veto. So there certainly is a lot of challenging work ahead for the president. His team is closely watching how each of these races is going to play out and this event could also be a sort of rallying of the troops as they are still facing that Senate runoff down in the state of Georgia, depending on how the Senate races in Nevada and Arizona turnout, that race could very well determined control of the Senate. Now, the White House has said that the President is willing to help in any way that he can down there, whether it's through appearances or through fundraising, but it remains unclear if the President actually would be going down to Georgia as that is the state he did not visit in the lead up to these midterms. But we already heard from the DNC Chair, Jaime Harrison, today telling these people behind me to be ready to work in that Georgia Senator runoff.",

They can be - they're not - I don't think they're very strategic in many cases. So I think this is a real threat. He should get the number, but some of those demands are making about vacating the chair to remove the speaker, he could never agree to that, or an impeachment probe without evidence, I mean, it would be terrible. So - but he's going to have to deal with this, should he become speaker, he's going to face these kinds of bare knuckle threats and demands almost every day. We watched this - I lived this.

We have a very vocal and active progressive wing of the party. And although this president has moved on things like marijuana has moved on things like student debt relief. I think that we would be remissed if we weren't talking about what this presidential cycle would look like and I would not be surprised at all if he got a challenge from the left. Do I want that? No. Is it an indictment on his success and how good of a president he is? No. But that's just a realization of where we are as a party.

And here's the reason why probably Oz lost because Mastriano was just so weak that he dragged Fetterman across the finish line, who is also a flawed candidate.So I'm just stunned that the state House may be gone. They didn't pick up anything, but this happens all over the country. What part of losing are people comfortable with here. You can't nominate candidates. These ultra MAGA folks did very poorly in the election. Many of them lost or they're struggling. More normal mainstream candidates like Tom Kean Jr. in New Jersey, they did just fine. They won. Those are the ones who won. But if you nominate candidates who offend the sensibilities of a lot of voters, you can't expect them to win.
