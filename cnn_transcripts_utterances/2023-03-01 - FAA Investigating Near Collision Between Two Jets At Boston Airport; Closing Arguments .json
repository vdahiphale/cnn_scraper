Think back to earlier this year when the NOTAM system failed, causing a day wide ground stop at America's airports. Then there were the issues at Southwest Airlines that caused cancellations and delays in the thousands and now these issues on America's runways. Five of them so far this year.They're known as a runway incursion, and this latest one happened on Monday night in Boston, where the FAA says this JetBlue flight 206 was coming in to land on Boston Logan International Airport's runway four right, when on that crisscrossing runway, runway nine, a private Learjet took off in front of it. Now that's a problem because that Learjet was told to line up and wait on the runway for that landing JetBlue flight but instead took off, the FAA says, without having a clearance. Really shows the work that is cut out for the nominee to lead the FAA, Phil Washington. The issue here, according to senators who grilled him during his confirmation hearing today is that he just doesn't have much in the way of direct aviation safety experience. He has led the Denver Airport. He has also led public transit agencies. I want you to you to listen to him now as to how he classifies his experience. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Boston, has a hotspot alert for several of its runways because you have intersecting runways and taxiways.It's curious that the fellow there considering for the FAA is coming from Denver - from Denver International Airport, because Denver was built specifically back when I was Inspector General with long, long parallel runways and high speed exits off the runways that don't cross other runways. And so the whole idea was to make these runway incursions and obviously, when they happen, when you have a collision, I like to say Category As are collisions without calamities without deaths. But when you have a real collision, they're very fatal. So new airports are built where it is virtually impossible, but because of all the various - there's equipment that helps alert the air traffic controllers, there's alarm systems, when an air - at some airports not all - when an airplane is crossing a taxiway and lining up instead of on a runway. So there's lots of equipment, but it doesn't seem to be working at some of these hotspots or airports where the taxiways cross the runways and literally there's a disaster waiting to happen.",

Now, I was really lucky being IG because I was a pilot, and a lawyer and a prosecutor. But he doesn't have to be, there's no requirement that he is and there have been successful ones in the past that have not been pilots. But I think he needs a real intensive immersive program really to really studies up because some of these systems like the systems we were just talking about, it really does help to be a pilot and have actually experienced them.

There was no media allowed when they were there, although both defense attorneys and prosecutors were there as well as Judge Newman. The jurors were not allowed to speak to anybody. But according to the media pool that got to tour the facility afterward, they said they did see jurors sort of standing around the dog kennels where the murders happen. Standing in the feed room door, one juror looking up at the door frame, that is where Paul Murdaugh was murdered. And so we're watching these doors, according to the pool sort of go around this property. The media pool described it as feeling almost haunted, but noted that there was no staining, no bloods still there on the property. The grass had kind of grown up and there was still signs of a family that used to once live there, instead of it now being a murder scene that many of the people who come out to this trial to watch and try to get inside every day who were these true crime fans have actually tried to go out there and see themselves. Now, Victor, Bianna, we talked about the fact that defense could be doing its closing arguments. That's all going to depend on the prosecution and how long he takes today.

So one thing that stood out to me from what we heard from prosecutor Creighton Waters today in his closing comments here and its arguments was he said about - this about Murdaugh. He said, \"After an exhaustive investigation, there's only one person who had the motive, who had the means, who had the opportunity to commit these crimes and who also whose guilt conduct after these crimes betrays him.

So the prosecution has already emphasized to the jury that the only person that could have done this is Alex Murdaugh, because he had the motive, the means and the opportunity.Now in terms of have they proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt, yes, they put forward credible evidence. However, the defense has also been able to poke holes into the prosecution's case. I think it's going to come down to these closing arguments. And just remember this, closing arguments are not evidence, the purpose of closing arguments is for the prosecution to point out to the jury how they proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt, as opposed to the defense pointing out to the jury how the prosecution has not proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt and that they are multiple reasonable doubts in this case.
