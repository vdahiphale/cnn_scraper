Well, it's important to note, Poppy and Erica, that nothing has happened yet, that this fighting is still going on and this deal has not actually gone through yet after we heard from the Israeli cabinet that they had approved this following the late night announcements last night.But what I was just told by an Israeli official is that the first releases of this, and pause of the fighting is expected to begin around 10:00 A.M. local tomorrow morning. That would be around 3:00 A.M. on the East Coast. And whether or not that is a hard and fast time, it still remains to be seen because there are a lot of outstanding questions here about what this will look like. But what we do know is that they have agreed to this deal, the two sides here, Israel and Hamas, to this deal that would allow 50 Israeli women and children to be released in exchange if 150 Palestinian prisoners who are being held in Israel. That's expected to happen kind of in a succession with a few being released each day in exchange for a pause in this fighting. But it's expected to last at least four days. But a key thing we heard from the Israeli prime minister is that for every additional ten hostages that are released by Hamas, there will be another pause, another day of a pause in the fighting. So, the question of how long this goes on, whether or not this deal sticks together still remains to be seen. But once this does happen, once this does begin, which we are expected again around 10:00 A.M. local Israeli time tomorrow morning, it is going to be the biggest and most significant pause that we have seen since October 7th, since the fighting began. And there has been a lot behind the scenes as how this came together. There is a lot of skepticism from officials here in Israel and inside the U.S. over whether or not this was actually going to happen. But right now, what we are hearing from officials, they don't expect any objections from the Israeli Supreme Court, that 24-hour waiting period, and that is what is supposed to happen before tomorrow when this is slated to begin.",

And what I keep thinking about is not just nine-year-old Emily Hand, but also three-year-old Abigail Edan, whose aunt, Liz Naftali Hirsh, she's been on CNN multiple times, she was saying that all she wanted was for her to be able to come home, to be released by Friday, because that is when she turns four years old. She has two siblings who are still alive. Both of their parents were killed in the October 7th attacks. And so you can just see, you know, as we talk about the logistics of what this looks like, what it means for these sides to come together, it is absolutely agonizing for these families who still don't know if it's going to be their loved ones released.",
