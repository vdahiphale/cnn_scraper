I speak to former climate adviser Gina McCarthy on this year's summit. And Israel resumes military bombardment of Gaza as a seven-day truce with Hamas ends. We bring you the latest from the region. Then, a mother takes on a Mexican cartel. \"New York Times\" reporter Azam Ahmed tells an astonishing tale of revenge in his book, \"Fear is Just a Word.\" Plus, the staggering cost of caring for the dying. Two U.S. reporters speak to Hari Sreenivasan about their series, \"Dying Broke.\" And finally, a banjo prodigy from Brooklyn, Nora Brown, joins me to discuss her musical inspiration. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Britain's King Charles took to the stage at the U.N. Climate Summit in Dubai, saying that the world is approaching \"dangerous, uncharted territory\" as the climate crisis deepens, with 2023 set to be the warmest year yet. Take a listen.

That is the only way that we're going to be legitimately addressing the real challenge of climate change where it's most extreme. We have to also look at how we, again, address a phase down, at least if not a phase out, of fossil fuels and begin to address that in a more specific way. I am really hoping that tripling renewables by 2030 is something that we can actually move forward and embrace as a goal. I think in the U.S., we can clearly see a doubling. And now, with the Inflation Reduction Act, which has been so successful, we have the opportunity to achieve a tripling in renewable energy capacity by 2030. We're going to push for that. But the other thing we're trying to make sure we do, frankly, and work that I'm doing with Mike Bloomberg is to make sure that sub-nationals get a place at the table. Look, he is actually working with Al Jaber to actually make sure that there is a sort of groundbreaking local climate action summit the first couple of days at the COP. Because frankly, we know that the federal governments are great, these national ideas are wonderful, the international discussions need to move, but it's only going to happen if communities start to get engaged, if sub- nationals can get together. We know the challenges of burning fossil fuels and what it's done to actually impact health across the world, how many people and kids have been lost. Fundamentally, this is about the health and well-being of every individual in this world and fossil fuels are taking away their ability to lead healthy lives. We have to go after this every step of the way. And I think sub-nationals can help.",

So, I agree that we have to look at all of these challenges with open our eyes and make sure that we're not giving up the opportunity to really have much longer-term transition to clean energy, which, frankly, in the end is what we have to look at, not reducing -- just reducing emissions or burying them in the ground, but doing the hard work that it's going to take to make sure that we have the right balance of technologies so that we have these longer-term solutions.",

But I have to say that the agreement between the U.S. and China, to me, set the stage for action. Now, I know a lot of folks may not think that this was as detailed as it needed to be, and certainly it wasn't, but think about the relationship between China and the U.S. before the announcement of the agreement that was reached to really focus on methane and forest protection and plastics and other key issues, this was a signal sender.

And so, I'm hoping. That we can both rub our stomachs and tap our head at the same time. Clearly, we have to address climate change. I think, frankly, part of the challenge is to make sure that we recognize that there are challenges internationally, that politics can be put aside, but need to be managed internally in the climate process, because after all, I think the developing world is seeing that the developed world has prospered from fossil fuels for far too long and damaged our ability across the world to actually live healthy lives. And we now have to recognize that we need to develop investments that are appropriate to actually advance the developing world and provide us an opportunity for much more stability. I think a clean energy future is the goal to provide stability across the world and a more secure future. Look, we are seeing terrible challenges across the globe that are impacting communities everywhere, in the Middle East and well beyond. We have to face the fact that these challenges in countries, many of them are exacerbated by the poverty, by the challenges of energy not being available, by high energy prices. These are challenges, food scarcities, many of these challenges are exacerbated directly by climate change and are causing some of the instability that we're seeing in the world today.

So, it at least is theoretically possible to get back to a point of truce. And a senior State Department official expressed some level of optimism that they could get there, perhaps even in the next day or two. But challenges, of course, remain. Qatari officials said the resumption of hostilities has made that even harder. And then, of course, there's the conditions and the requirements for a truce to be carried out. Israel's requirement is still per the original agreement, which is Hamas must release 10 women and children for a 24-hour pause in the fighting. Israel believes there are at least enough women and children for one truce or two more days of a pause. Hamas says there aren't, in fact, enough women and children to release for a pause. Instead, they wish to focus on expanding the truce agreement and lengthening the pause in the fighting itself to elderly men being released and then men and women of fighting and reservist age in Israel. They say Israel rejected any attempt to have those conversations. So, you can see how difficult the negotiations are.

And all we see now is the results of heavy Israelibombardment in Khan Younis in Southern Gaza and Rafah, which is near the main border crossing between Israel -- I'm sorry, between Gaza and Egypt. Worth noting, there are trucks lined up outside of that border crossing that have not gone through, according to an eyewitness that we have spoken to who is at that crossing. And that's another critical problem for Gaza. But in terms of those Israeli strikes, they occur in Southern Gaza, which is where Israel told Palestinians in the north to evacuate to. They have tried to drop leaflets saying to evacuate certain areas that are war zones and even tried to drop a QR code that leads you to a map of Gaza with certain parcels that they may then be able to use to see where operations will be and where to move from. The challenge, of course, is you need internet connectivity for that, and that is not something that's been guaranteed over the course of this war. So, challenges remain, you're absolutely right. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was here basically demanding that Israel have concrete plans in place to protect civilians as we move into the next phase of this war. Health authorities in Hamas controlled Gaza say that more than 100 Palestinians have already been killed in the resumption of fighting.

For many of the loved ones and their families, they were missing or considered kidnapped without any definitive information.

Well, we turn now to Mexico, where this week saw the worst day of violence against journalists in a decade. Five were shot and wounded, four of them in the Guerrero State, the scene of many deadly turf battles. Former New York Times Bureau Chief for Mexico, Azam Ahmed, has seen violence like this up close, as well as a desperate fight against it. His new book, \"Fear is Just a Word,\" tells the story of a mother seeking revenge for the death of her daughter murdered by one of the most violent cartels in the world. And Azam Ahmed joins me now from Mexico City. Azam, congratulations on both a beautiful and heartbreaking story, a mother in search of her daughter and ultimately once she finds out that her daughter has been killed in search for those killers and bringing justice to her daughter. Tell us about Miriam and her daughter, Karen. AZAM AHMED, AUTHOR, \"FEAR IS JUST A WORD\" AND NEW YORK TIMES INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Thank you for having me. Miriam Rodriguez was a merchant in the local market in the town of San Fernando, which is about 70 miles from the Texas border. She sold cowboy boots, mother of three children, and then her town became an inferno when two warring cartels made it sort of the center of their fight. And her daughter was kidnapped. And like any parent, she did whatever she could to try and rescue her. She paid ransoms, multiple. She went to the police. She went to prosecutors, asked anyone to help her -- anyone for help. And no one really came to her aid. And so, she sort of almost broke with love and just started to go after the individuals responsible herself. She sort of became a one woman \"Law and Order:\" episode almost. She began to figure out who these people were, track them down, and eventually, get them -- get many of them arrested with an extraordinary amount of sort of resilience and perseverance.",

If you disappear someone, there's no crime, there's no body. And so, it became a prominent feature of the war on drugs here in Mexico. And, essentially, Miriam's case was a -- for me, an iconic case. There are so many others like her. In fact, she began to represent other people who had children who had been disappeared.

Over time, that cartel switched from smuggling contraband across the U.S. border to smuggling cocaine, and it became a hugely profitable business. As that cartel evolved and as the war on drugs started to begin, the leader of the cartel, who, sometime in the late '90s, decided he needed an armed wing. Essentially, as politics and power were changing in Mexico, he kind of had this epiphany that violence was going to be the new currency of power, this sort of dark pioneering vision for the future. So, he hired a bunch of former -- actually active Mexican special forces soldiers. And those -- that group became the Zetas. And they were sort of his armed wing. They battled other cartels. And eventually, they came to take a very prominent role in this cartel. And where the book sort of -- I think, what the book is trying to do is essentially explain how this cartel and the genesis of this cartel explains in some ways the genesis of, you know, the failure of the state in Mexico. So, the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel, who are partners, eventually break. And that war is what Miriam Rodriguez and her family are trapped in the middle of. Because it takes place in this state right on the border with the United States, Tamaulipas. And basically, engulfs the entire state. And then later, much of the nation in violence, as these two, these two cartels fight it out, and the Mexican government responds to their violence by militarizing their strategy.

But, again, one of the things that I was struck in the reporting was how many problems there are in the foreign countries, too. They're grappling with this as well.
