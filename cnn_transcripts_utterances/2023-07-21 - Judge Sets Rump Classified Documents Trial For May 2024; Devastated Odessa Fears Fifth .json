The judge setting a May start time and denying Trump the post-election delay he wanted. But will the timetable hold?Also tonight, the devastated Ukrainian city of Odessa on alert for a potential fifth straight night of Russian missile strikes, this as the CIA director is issuing ominous new warnings about where and who Vladimir Putin might attack next. And tributes are pouring in for the legendary singer Tony Bennett after his death at the age of 96. We'll talk to two iconic crooners who are carrying on Bennett's legacy, Michael Buble and Harry Connick Jr. are joining us live. That's right. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Jim Acosta, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Our top story this hour, the new trial date on the calendar for Donald Trump, the former president turned criminal defendant heading into an election year packed with legal proceedings as a third indictment may be around the corner. CNN's Senior Legal Analyst Paula Reid is joining us now with all these developments. Paula, now that the judge in the classified documents case has this trial date set for next May, how do we expect things to unfold? PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  So, as part of this order, the judge included a list of 30 deadlines and dates, all the things that have to happen between now and a potential trial. Now, today the Trump Team said they are confident that they are going to be able to push this trial until after the election. And, Jim, if you take a look at this list, this schedule laid out by the judge, it's easy to see how they could do that. You have one or two deadlines slide, a hearing get delayed, and the closer they get to the election, the less likely it is that this trial is going to occur before America votes for the next president.",

And as we all know Prigozhin, who led that rebellion, was really valuable because he had man, armed men and he also have this enormous series of companies that helped out the Russian government on various levels. But then you have to figure out what do you do with these guys who are saying the conventional military in Russia is not cruel enough, is not harsh enough, and that we really have to take it to Ukraine and do even more.

Thanks for joining us, Michael, great to see you. And you had the honor of collaborating with Tony Bennett on several duets. I have to ask you about that. What was it like to sing with such a giant in the industry? It is tough to share a stage with him, I have to imagine. MICHAEL BUBLE, GRAMMY AWARD-WINNING SINGER:  Yes Well, I mean, he's incredibly talented but he was always warm and gracious. And, you know, as a kid who had so much reverence for him and the heroes that come before me and the Great American Songbook, you can imagine how much it meant to have him take a kid like me under his wing. And I loved just every time I got a chance to be with him, to talk with him, to ask him questions. And I remember the first time I was with him. I was very nervous. I told the story too many times but it bears repeating. I said, Mr. Bennett, I have stolen everything from you and Frank and Dean and Bobby and Al. And he said to me, kid, he said, if you steal from one person you're a thief, he said. But if you steal from everybody, it's research. And I've told that story so many times. And I continue to steal from those greats and from him. What a class act.",

So, a source that's part of the ongoing investigation regarding the Gilgo Beach murders saying that there are at least two reasons why they believe that there were some or all of the suspected killer's victims may have been killed at his home on Long Island. That is, for instance, because at the time of the commission of the murders, some sources say or at least what we've heard from investigators that Rex Heuermann's wife was not in New York state at the time.So, authorities seem to believe that is certainly might be more than a coincidence and may have provided those ideal conditions or at least that setting for him to allegedly commit those murders. But there's also this cell phone triangulation data that investigators have pored over, specifically that of the victims here that seems to show that they were being lured towards the suspect's home, basically being lured towards their murder here. And there's also this investigation that seems to be now expanding to involve at least four states. We understand that authorities in Nevada and in South Carolina are now revisiting old missing persons cases. Why Nevada? Well, he seemed to have owned a time share in Las Vegas. But then this tie in terms of South Carolina, where colleagues at the Chester News and reporter tonight actually obtained a search warrant as they continue to pore over property owned by the suspect in this case. And when you look at the list of items that investigators here are trying to track down, including personal effects of the victims, possible photos or recordings depicting these victim and these firearms possibly as well, it give you an idea what's going on, and just the wide scope of this investigation as it continues to proceed and to move forward. As for Heuermann, we understand that he has pleaded not guilty and continues to maintain his innocence as this investigation continues. Meanwhile, here in Long Island, investigation now leading into eight days of searching the suspect's home now.",
