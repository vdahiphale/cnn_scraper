They're saying that the fact that he was tried, that he was impeached in the House and acquitted in the Senate would expose him to double jeopardy.I'll read you on another part of this filing, again, which follows along a lot of what you've heard in the federal case. They say, our country has a longstanding tradition of forceful political advocacy regarding widespread allegations of fraud. President Trump lacked fair notice that his advocacy in the instance of the 2020 presidential election could be criminalized. Important arguments, these are arguments that we're going to hear a lot of tomorrow here in Washington, the federal appeals court taking up this big question of immunity. We're expecting that to take about an hour or so tomorrow, Wolf. We know, of course, that this is something that Judge Tanya Chutkan has already reviewed. She said that the former president does not enjoy this privilege of immunity from any criminal prosecution because of what he was doing in his capacity as president. But, obviously, tomorrow is going to be a very, very important day, constitutionally a very important moment for the former president, especially as he tries to push this potential trial beyond the election season, Wolf.

He is not arguing that he is immune from prosecution for everything he did during every minute of his four-year presidency. What his team is arguing is that he's immune from prosecution for anything he did during that time within the outer scope of his job as president. The problem for Donald Trump, though, is the facts. Donald Trump's team claims well He was just making calls from the White House to legislative leaders, to cabinet members, to members of Congress and sort of leaves it at that. But that's a myopic view of the facts. The reality, I think, is quite clear in Jack Smith's indictment is Donald Trump was not trying to just neutrally administer the election. He was trying to steal it. He was trying to make sure it tipped his way and I think the weight of the evidence here is overwhelming it and is going to ultimately doom Trump's argument.",

Now, every court who has weighed these questions, starting with the federal trial court and now the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, have moved with an exceptional amount of haste in getting these cases to argument and briefed and so on. And I would anticipate that if this does go to the Supreme Court, and, spoiler alert, we're pretty confident that it will, they will move quickly, too.

In fact, it's quite unusual to have the actual criminal defendant appear at that argument. He has every right to do so. But in my experience, arguing cases in front of other federal courts of appeals, you almost never see the actual defendant there. It is his right to be there. His lawyers may point out his presence to the judges to make the point that he cares, he's taking the time to show up.

At worst, it can potentially create a really dangerous situation.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It has been a week since the country's most senior defense official has been in the hospital, and for much of that time, very few people, even his boss, the president, were aware. The Pentagon now says that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was rushed to Walter Reed Hospital last Monday on New Year's Day due to severe pain after elective surgery right before Christmas. Today, the Pentagon revealed that even for the initial procedure in December, Austin and his team didn't tell the White House or Austin's deputy. Now, shock and anger from both parties are now spreading across Washington for Austin's failure to reveal for days to people who should have been told that he was still in the hospital. REP. ABIGAIL SPANBERGER (D-VA): I do hope that every person in the cabinet recognizes that this was not an appropriate step, not an appropriate way to handle what was his hospitalization.",

It wasn't until Thursday, January 4th, that Hicks, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, and, ultimately, Biden were told where Austin actually was. The next day, on the fifth, the Pentagon told congressional leaders and put out a public statement. Then finally, on Saturday, five days after being admitted, Secretary Austin said in a statement, quote, I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better.While Austin was in the hospital, Hicks was on vacation in Puerto Rico, where she periodically assumed Austin's duties, this during a very busy week that saw Israel carry out a strike against a Hamas leader in Beirut, the U.S. bomb a militia commander in Baghdad, and U.S. Forces continue to actively face attacks by Iranian-backed groups, including the Houthis in Yemen.",
