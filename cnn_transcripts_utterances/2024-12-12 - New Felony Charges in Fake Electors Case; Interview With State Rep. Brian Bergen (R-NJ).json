Police in New York now say the 3-D-printed gun that Luigi Mangione was carrying when he was arrested matches three shell casings found at the murder scene. And this comes just hours after police announced that his fingerprints were also found nearby. Joining us now is NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner. Thank you so much for joining us. So you have fingerprints, you have ballistic evidence. Do you have any DNA matches?",

One law enforcement source tells CNN that Mangione's mother reported him missing last month and had not spoken to him since July. And he seems to have withdrawn even from social media.

It's lived experience. You had mentioned that you're trying to piece all this together,what was going on with him, his mind-set from his own statements. Is he talking to investigators? Is he telling them about the manifesto that was found on him when he was arrested?",

And I think everybody is looking at this individual, who seemed to have so much potential, promise in his life and wondering what could have changed to lead to where we get to now.And that is, again, all part of our investigative process, which is under way. Our detectives have done just a tremendous job putting this together as quickly as they have and will continue to do a tremendous job filling those gaps with the help of a lot of different entities as well, our intelligence analysts, forensics, cameras, all of that work.

By now, it's been all over the news. So you would think if it was Amazon or FedEx or UPS testing something or an insurance company checking out roofs for assessments, somebody would say something by now, but nobody. So law enforcement in my opinion, and the whole government, State Police, Department of Homeland Security, the governor, they need to take this way more seriously and find out what's going on. In that briefing you mentioned, the State Police colonel said that he had one of his helicopters hovering over a six-foot drone and that he decided to tell the helicopter to land because he felt it was unsafe for his pilots. What I think he should have done -- and I'm a former attack helicopter pilot myself -- is just follow the frigging thing. Find out where it's going. Do some real investigation, and let's put an end to all of the uncertainty.",

      "sentences": "And do you know what the scope of this problem is? Because my understanding is, and from talking to law enforcement officials, there are also several cases where people see an airplane or something and call it in as it's one of these mysterious drones, when, in fact, it's not.And so there's a fine line between, like, the hysteria and the reality of the situation, right? So can you help us understand the scope?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Yes, I sure can.So I'm not -- I'm a practical guy. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I don't jump on these things and run with them in a crazy way. I saw these drones with my own eyes above my town of Denville. And this was a couple days ago, and I didn't think much of it because, like I said, I thought there's a logical explanation, some commercial application. Maybe FedEx is testing a delivery system and wants to do it at night. So I didn't really raise a stink about it. But then the Department of Homeland Security in this briefing were at, they said the same thing that you just mentioned. And this is law enforcement's kind of go-to, is, oh, well, we're doing some analysis. We're overlaying flight paths to see if this stuff is true. Look, we had a colonel of the State Police tell us he had one of his helicopters hovering above a six-foot drone. You got a state assembly member in New Jersey who was a former attack helicopter pilot for the Army. And I helped stand up the initial aviation Army unmanned aircraft training battalion in Fort Huachuca, Arizona, telling you that there are drones. So the question of whether or not there are or are not should be put to bed. They should figure out what the hell they are and where they're coming from and who's responsible. Now, are there 30,000 drones at night in the sky? I would say probably not. A lot of those could be misidentified as planes. But I have seen them. The State Police has seen them. Six-foot drones, I mean, that's not somebody who went to Best Buy and picked up a toy. That's a legitimate aircraft.",

If this is legitimately not a viable threat, it has to be identified that it's not, because right now the answer of it's not a threat and we just don't know anything about it really isn't good for anybody. And the public is getting very concerned, and rightfully so. But I got to tell you, before I went to this briefing the other day, this useless briefing, where we got no information, I was really trying to figure out, how do I communicate effectively to my constituents to ease their concerns? After I left there and saw the incompetence of the actions being taken and the lack of information they have, I legitimately am concerned for the safety of my constituency.",
