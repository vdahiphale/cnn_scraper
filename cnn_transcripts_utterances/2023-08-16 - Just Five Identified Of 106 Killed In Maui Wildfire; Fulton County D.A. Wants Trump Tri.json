It was shot at a bird sanctuary and after a few seconds you see this bright flash of white light. The video is actually paused. The camera then starts panning around and a few minutes later, you can see flames spotted in the distance and are highlighted here.At the same time, sensors and a network that monitors the power grid went off. An official who watches the network says that indicates what's known as an arc flash which can spark a fire. Hawaiian Electric released a statement to \"The Washington Post\" saying, quote: We know there is speculation about what started the fires, and we, along with others, are working hard to figure out what happened. Let's take you there now with CNN's Bill Weir who's live for us on Maui. Bill, fires are still burning on the island.",

We actually met some volunteers putting out hotspots with bottled water in these hyped hard-to-reach gullies and canyons of there.They tell us now it's about 75 percent contained and it's going to get gusty today, maybe 10-20 mile an hour winds. So there's just one of many things for all of these folks here to worry about. They're going through so much just trying to identify who's truly gone. And the search and recovery teams have gotten some help. There's some -- a mobile morgue has been brought in. Some forensic experts to help them sort through all that ash. But is just heartbreaking and it affects so many people around the island in so many ways. A lot of people saying tourists should stay away out of respect. But your hearing a lot of other people perspective say, that would mean an economic catastrophe on top of all of this emotional pain right now. So these are complicated times for people of Hawaii.",

That is smack in the middle of the Republican primary calendar. So far, former President Donald Trump mounting legal troubles have not been weighed him down politically. Polling has consistently shown him with a wide lead among Republicans. But could Georgia change that?Let's bring CNN's senior data reporter, Harry Enten into the conversation. Harry, obviously this latest indictment is in Georgia and the political landscape given everything that happened after the 2020 election for Donald Trump is different there.",

Look, this is swing of the Democrats in presidential elections from 2004 to 2020. Look in Georgia, look at that swing towards the Democrats -- a 17 point swing. Compare that what we see nationwide, just a 7 point swing. So Georgia is becoming far more Democratic.Now look at the 2022 midterm elections. Look, these are the Trump endorsed candidates won this often in 2022 GOP primaries. In Georgia, it was 67 percent. Compare that to nationwide where it was 95 percent. So not only is Georgia moving to the left, it's also far more Trump skeptical through 2022 then the rest of the GOP electorate -- Boris.",

Because I want you to get an understanding that the Trump voters with the college degree in 2020 closest Biden won states. Look at this, 35 percent of the Trump voters in Georgia had a college degree. That is a significant higher than a lot of other states.

But it's still well into the political calendar for Republicans, when the lead candidate might very well have come close to locking up the nomination by then.

That's just going to, you know, put gasoline on the flames of the drama of Donald Trump. It's going to build sympathy and it's just going to prevent us from doing what we need to be doing as Republicans. Which is, we talk about the future of the party. How to secure the border. How to be physically discipline. Every conversation we have is going to about that guy and that makes it very, very difficult for any of these other candidates to get some oxygen, to get some news. even now, right? We're sitting here only talking about Trump. Any time these other candidates go on TV they're really only even asked about Trump. It's got to be incredibly frustrating. And for a Republican who just wants to win, I just want to win a 24 man. It's really, really hard to see the path there, when all the media, all the attention, all the drama is revolving around that.

It'll be 100 Republican voices across the country saying, we have to narrow this down to maybe five or six candidates by Iowa. Maybe three -- even three or four by New Hampshire. Because in a one-on-one race that's where Trump loses.And they'll be a lot of pressure -- not the powers that be but maybe some of the voices, the donor base, some of the more influential folks out there that say, hey, we have to narrow this thing down. Because Republicans want to move America forward. Republicans want to provide solutions for America. Donald Trump wants to just protect Donald Trump. And that's not a Republic value. And I think most of the candidates get that, but they've give it their best shot for the next six months.

We have to find a better candidate. We have to find a winning candidate. We have to find a candidate who is not facing four separate criminal trials, and yet he remains the frontrunner.

And the latest time they said he asked to be paid $15 million or he would go public with a story about them. Now again, a lengthy statement, I want to read part of it to you fromtheir attorney. It says: Anyone with a modicum of common sense can see that the outlandish claims made by Michael Oher about the Touhy family are hurtful and absurd. The idea that the Tuohys have sought to profit off Mr. Oher is not only offensive, it is transparently ridiculous. They go in to this saying, that basically he's just trying to drum up attention if his book that was just released this week. No comments yet from Michael about these claims, about being shaken down or about the book tour, publication and publicity. But certainly it's turning ugly, Boris. And I want to also mention it's turning ugly for the actors who played the parts like Sandra Bullock. There's online hate that she's been receiving just in regards to what is happening with this family. So much so that her co-star Quinton Aaron, who played Michael Oher, had to come to her defense. So again, we're going to have to see how this one plays out in court, but it's not looking good so far as this sort of drama plays out in real life.",

That charge was dismissed.I was told by a law enforcement source that's because the gun that was used in that shooting was discovered to have been modified. I'll read you what prosecutors told the court earlier in dismissing those charges. They wrote that: The charges against Alec Baldwin were dismissed without prejudice because of possible malfunction of the gun. If it is determined that the gun did not malfunction, charges against Mr. Baldwin will proceed. Now this is important, because that report that you reference, that was commissioned by prosecutors. This group of forensic examiners looked at that gun, which was previously examined by the FBI. They found that it could not have gone off without Alec Baldwin pulling that trigger. So we're waiting to see whether prosecutors will actually indeed move forward and recharging Alec Baldwin. We know course, for his part, he has claimed his innocence. He has said that he never pulled that trigger. We are waiting for a statement from his team regarding this latest report that's out now. It's something that we will certainly be watching to see if prosecutors make good on what they said in June. That they will bring charges if it turns out that gone did not function -- Jim.",
