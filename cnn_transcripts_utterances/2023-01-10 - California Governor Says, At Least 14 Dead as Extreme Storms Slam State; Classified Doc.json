It is also making it tough for people who are actually trying to get to safety, as you can see in some of this video here.CNN's Kyung Lah and Camila Bernal are covering for this for both us. So, Kyung, first to you in the southern part of the state, you're there on the 101 Freeway. Clearly, no one commuting there this morning. What are those conditions like? KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  You know, it is really our first good look at what we are standing on because the sun is just starting to peek out from behind the clouds. And this is the 101 Freeway. You can see it is completely caked over in mud, there is water that is completely washed over this freeway. And the reason why this is completely shut down and why this standing water is still there is because below the freeway is the Ventura River. In just 12 hours yesterday, that river rose 17 feet. So, that is -- just gives you a snapshot of what we're seeing here in Southern California. In Santa Barbara, the airport there reports one day of rain that is higher than the average month of January. So, just an incredible amount of water. And it is impacting tens of millions of people. I'm going to take a look behind and make sure no one is coming. We're seeing emergency crews beginning to move and down the 101 but they haven't been able to clear this yet because there are still so many emergencies happening. There is rain. Rain is expected throughout the morning here in Southern California. So, Jim and Erica, it is not over. The morning commute is still going to be happening. And there is a lot of concern about what is going to happen as people start to head to work.",

He's an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania and he has an office here in D.C.Now, just a few weeks ago, November 2nd, his lawyers were cleaning out this office and they uncovered what they say are fewer than a dozen classified documents. They say they immediately did what they were supposed to do, which is notify the National Archives, which we're told took possession of the documents the next day. The Justice Department has appointed the U.S. attorney in Chicago to review this and to do a damage assessment. And, Erica, what is notable about that is the U.S. attorney in Chicago is one of only two Trump-appointed U.S. attorneys still serving in government. The other one is a U.S. attorney in Delaware who is overseeing the investigation into the president's son. Now, the Biden team, they say they are fully cooperating with the Justice Department, fully cooperating with the Archives. And while that lays out what with we know, the facts that we have from our reporting, we still have a lot of questions. Among them, why did they go to this specific office on this specific date, just a few days before a critical midterm? Why did they send lawyers and also why did they let this get out to the press and not get out ahead of it?",

They're doing a damage assessment, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, but when it comes to the former president and Mar-a-Lago, it is a special counsel investigating not only the possible mishandling of classified information but also possible obstruction of justice and other crimes.",

You are already hearing them equate it to what happened with former President Trump and even though it is very an apples to oranges situation, even at a casual glance at this point.However, when you're talking about a House majority that is launching all sorts of investigations into the Biden administration, you have to imagine this is going to be very much top of mind.",

We're talking about a potential House Ethics Committee investigations.So, there are a lot of inquiries that George Santos is likely going to face in his first months of Congress, however long his service -- his tenure in Congress goes. But I think what those investigations do is actually give a little bit of leeway for now speaker Kevin McCarthy to defer to those investigations. Certainly, when he faces reporters later this week, he is going to be asked questions about Congressman Santos, whether he should leave Congress, whether he should get committee assignments. What should happen to those investigations? And I think what leadership will do here is kind of let those probes play out in whichever forum they go. The problem with a lot of these investigations, certainly with the House Ethics Committee, that they can go on for a very long time and never really reach a consensus. And in that house rules package, remember, House Republicans weakened the ethics apparatus of the House. So, we'll have to see the impact when it comes to investigating one of their own.",

They're going to try to use it to have spending cuts. And I think that is a great concern to the White House, and to the Fed and to lots of parts of this government and outside of government, how that debate will be handled. But they've been very bullish about that since taking the majority.And but they're also -- even if they can't do anything about it, I think particularly as you see certain members of Jason Smith, for example, taking the helm of a ways and means, he's more populous than you've seen as the chairman and ways and means, and he's promised a lot of oversight over the IRS and to ask a lot of tough questions to IRS officials.

You, of course, can you can pursue a murder case in the absence of a body but they want to, authorities do, exercise all due diligence, leave no stone unturned so -- to the extent that it becomes that, if it becomes that, they're ready, willing and able to move forward with a vigorous prosecution.",
