The visit has already drawn warnings and condemnation from China. President Tsai Ing-wen arrived in Los Angeles earlier. Selina Wang joins us now from Beijing. Selina, let's talk about President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron he's traveling with a delegation of about 50 business leaders. And the backdrop here is that all EU leaders are trying to figure out how to navigate this relationship with China. They're worried about China's increasingly aggressive foreign policy about Beijing's close ties to Moscow. But China is also a key trading partner as those number points too. Now for Beijing, this meeting is a chance to also boost Xi Jinping's image as this global statesman and it is also helping China to reconnect with the world and revive its economy after three years of damaging COVID restrictions. They need positive relations with these major trading partners. Now Macron is in Beijing, along with European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen. Both of them have recently spoken to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Von der Leyen has also pledged that Ukraine would be an important topic of meetings, but this visit is also drawing a lot of skepticism. Lithuania's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged caution in a series of tweets, writing \"We should remember that attempts to contain Russia by offering economic partnership failed. Putin was in fact, emboldened by our flexibility, not persuaded. Similar tactics would also embolden China. Let's not make the same mistake twice.\" Now remember, throughout all of this, Beijing has claimed neutrality when it comes to Ukraine, but China has still refused to condemn the invasion or even to call it an invasion. Instead, China has been bolstering ties with Russia. We're not too far off from when Xi Jinping made that trip to Russia to meet with Putin, where they reaffirmed their partnership on a whole host of issues, Julia?",

The meeting today, of course, coming with not just Kevin McCarthy going out on a limb and being a Republican meeting with the Taiwan President, but instead that this is a bipartisan meeting.

The discussion though did of course turn to the war and the state of the war. Interestingly, President Zelenskyy did say that they would potentially consider withdrawing troops from the highly contested City of Bakhmut in the east. Should those troops be encircled fully by Russian and private military contracting forces? You said it depends, of course on the amount of ammunition and support they are getting.

But there is a line that gets crossed, where the rhetoric is dangerous, where it's likely to incite people to commit acts of violence. And this is not merely hypothetical in Donald Trump's case; his rhetoric was certainly a contributing factor, at least to January 6. And if you remember when Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago was searched by the FBI lawfully back in August, his rhetoric inspired somebody to try to storm an FBI office in Ohio, and that person was shot and killed. So there is real concern here, as you say, I am friendly with and Former colleagues with Alvin Bragg.

And the theory here is they mischaracterize these payments as legal fees within the Trump Organization. But that's just a misdemeanor, Julia; nobody goes to prison that's the less serious type of crime. The only way to make it a felony is if you can tie the falsification of records to some other crime. And one of my big criticisms of this indictment is it doesn't specify what that other crime might be. Now, the DA sort of mentioned a few potential crimes in his remarks but that's not sufficient. The purpose of an indictment is to give notice to the defendant, here's what you're charged with. Here's what you're defending yourself against.

Of course, this data was collected during the banking sector instability so that might have played into some of the cautiousness that we saw in that data. It's a case of waiting for the next one.

And then as you said, we have three electric motors, two in the front and one in the back. So also, to assure that we can always drive in a permanent four-wheel drive system.

And also, in terms of our strategy as I said before, we will hybridize all of our line-up by the end of 2024. We will have our first full electric Lamborghini starting from 2028. It has to be a car which is more daily driver for the Super Sports guys like the Revuelto and Huracan. We are thinking that maybe also after 2030 there's still an opportunity for hybrid cars. It depends a bit on the rules which are coming up in terms of - but also in terms of sustainability. What we need is a worldwide, let's say equal system which is enabling us to have the same price reducer all over the globe.

And I think there was an element of sadness and resignation in there as well. This is his 25th Masters. He's won it five times. His first in 97 was extraordinary his last in 2019 coming so long after his previous major win was just remarkable. And of course, his fans think he can keep going and doing it again and again and again. But we all know what he's been up against most notably that dreadful car accident two years ago where he could have lost his leg. So, he says that success now to him isn't contending and winning. It's just being able to play that game like that's a win for him. But how many more times is he going to be able to come back? We don't know. He did talk about the fact that his game is better than it was this time last year. He says his endurance is better. He's aching more though. The people that have been around him and playing in the practice rounds with him say that he is looking great. The question remains, can he hack it over four rounds here? It's a very, very hilly course, he's got a walk at all. Can his body you know, do that? We will see but you know, there remains a great deal of excitement around Tiger Woods every time.

And since Liv began, some pretty unpleasant things have been said, exchanges on social media lawsuits have been flying around between the tours.

The players from both sides have been speaking to the media. And they all say look, you know, most of them are just our mates. So, we're kind of happy to see them again. Not all of them are our mates like that point has been made clear. But a lot of them just seem to be happy to be back together again.
