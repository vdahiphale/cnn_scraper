The Russians did not, and it caused serious frustration inside the White House that bled out publicly. They made that very clear that they were frustrated with the fact the Russians had not taken them up on that offer.The question around this, we do have big questions about Paul Whelan, and his family will as well, but what changed in this?

Viktor Bout's name come up repeatedly when you have talked about potential prisoner swaps between the U.S. and Russia. But clearly the Russians realized there was an incredibly high price on Brittney Griner. We should note that she is a famous basketball player, an American star. She really galvanized the LGBTQ community, the African American community to pressure the Biden administration to get her out. And rest assured that Russia was watching as that happened.Of course, Paul Whelan was part of those conversations, but she galvanized the public in a different way than we have seen before when it comes to Americans who are detained abroad.",

So Putin didn't end up showing up at the G-20, which was the place where we thought potentially Biden would see him if there was something to discuss on a prisoner swap. So that was sort of off the table. But when it comes to President Biden's role in all of this, when we talk to U.S. officials and track this back and forth, what they have repeatedly said is that they weren't telling the Russians anything was on the table without approval of the highest levels.And so what that means, of course, is that President Biden knew everything in terms of what U.S. officials were offering to the Russians privately. The Russians over the course of the last few months have been incredibly hard interlocuters because they have been coming back to the U.S. with proposals that U.S. officials said they simply couldn't deliver on.

And there is of course suspicion that she was grabbed at the airport, obviously it was a week in advance of the invasion, exactly in part, Don, because the Russians wanted to grab a hostage and have sort of one more bargaining chip as the war went on. They've also wanted to get Viktor Bout out of prison. He's been there for more than a decade, for a long time.And one of the questions that has been sort of circulating through this whole thing is whether this long-time arms dealer who is considered one of the most dangerous people on earth was worth more -- the United States should insist that they get more than just a single person back in return, particularly somebody who is held wrongfully. So the fact that they didn't get Paul Whelan as part of this is I think going to be politically a bit difficult for the president. He got bigger name, but he didn't get both of them.",

And what I've been hearing from over there is that they've been waiting for the phone call, and that phone call clearly came this morning. And the very brief interactions that I had with Cherelle over the last few hours, her spirits were high this morning. And I think you can see why. This has been a long-awaited moment.And just to kind of recap a little bit, in the last few months, President Biden hosted Cherelle Griner at the White House along with the family of Paul Whelan. And one of the main messages that President Biden wanted to convey in that moment was that he was doing everything that possibly he could, but that they did not feel like Russia was seriously coming to the table. Russia was asking for more than the White House believed that they could give them in that moment. And so, as we look at what has happened here where we have Viktor Bout in exchange for just one of the two Americans who are in the most kind of high profile detention situations in Russia, it seems that something significant must have changed where Russia was willing to come to the table again in a serious way and at least do something. That was not the case a few months ago, at least not according to what the families have been told by President Biden and by the White House. But they came out of those meetings feeling like the administration was really putting everything that they could into it, and based on the president's public statement saying he only wants to talk to Putin about this issue, that was as strong a signal as you can get that this was at the top of the agenda.",

And now, it appears that it has come through fruition.So, let's get now to CNN's Frederik Pleitgen. It is his duty and responsibilities to cover these stories. This is breaking news. I expected that it might happen, but now it appears that it has happened, Frederik. What are you hearing from the region? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, first of all, we're trying to get in touch with Brittney Griner's legal team in Russia. I followed the trial on the ground outside of Moscow for basically the entire time that it was going on. And I can tell you that, Don, the legal team really did pick a big -- put a big fight for Brittney Griner. They said that she was in good spirits. And I was in touch with them last week, and they said that they had managed to visit her and that she was still in good spirits to fight despite the fact that she was now in this penal colony. But you know, the way that the Russian legal system works, the way that the odds were stacked against her in that court, even the lawyers that were representing her said, the only thing that they could really hope for was for a prisoner swap like this to happen. They knew that it was going to be something that was going to be very complicated. They definitely knew that the Russians were playing hardball, that they wanted a high-profile person like Viktor Bout in return. But they also said that, you know, they basically exhausted all the means that they had within the Russian legal process, which is a difficult one anyway. And Brittney Griner had already been transferred to that penal colony in the place called Mordovia, which is an extremely tough place -- which is, by the way, also the same region that Paul Whelan is in as well. And so, they were saying right now, they weren't getting any information from the Russian side or from the U.S. side, but they were really hoping that the prisoner swap would happen. And we are in touch with them right now. We're going to see if we can get word from them how they feel about all this. But certainly, you know, one of the things that you guys were talking about, we were seeing as well was the Russian seemingly becoming more and more open to the swap happening. They were extremely angry at the beginning when the U.S. made public that it had put forward a substantial offer and when things came out that Viktor Bout was part of that offer and Brittney Griner was part of that offer as well, the Russians the entire time were saying it's counterproductive. They want everything to happen behind closed doors. But what we saw in the past couple of weeks was top-level Russian politicians then coming out and saying that, yes, they were open to such a swap. They still think that negotiations needed to happen behind closed doors. But they also put that name Viktor Bout out there as well. And you could see that they were setting the stage in the Russian public -- in the Russian public sphere also for something like this to happen. So, I think you're absolutely right to say that, you know, many people were expecting the swap would happen, not clear when it was going to happen. But of course, with these things, it's all so delicate, and so up in the air until the very last moment that it was impossible to tell whether this would actually be successful. And certainly, I can tell you from the early reactions that I'm getting that Brittney Griner's legal team is definitely extremely happy that she's finally able to get out. They were with her the entire time. They put up a big legal defense for her. They knew, you know, the psychological trauma that Brittney Griner was also going through being in that jail. So, definitely, a good moment for them and definitely a great moment for Brittney Griner and her family as well, guys.",

She is on her way home. He's expected to speak shortly as Don noted. What else have you heard from the White House on this monumental moment?M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. If we could put up those photos. This is the photo that the President's Twitter account just sent out along with this message that says moments ago, I spoke to Brittney Griner. She is safe. She was on a plane. She is on her way home. I mean, you can see just the expressions of joy on Cherelle Griner's face here. She is clearly with the President. The Vice President is there. This is presumably the moment that he is talking about when he just spoke directly with Brittney Griner on the phone. [08:20:26] I mean, Kaitlan, it is just difficult to overstate what a big problem and a priority this whole issue had become for President Biden. How much pressure he had come under in recent months, whether it is questions from the media, whether it was from celebrities, including folks in the sports world, family members to get her out of Russia. And this is why we eventually saw the President meeting in person with Griner's wife at the White House earlier this summer. There were obviously lots of conversations. And you know, these conversations and the outreach and the efforts really took place at the highest levels of the Biden administration. And I have to tell you, you know, obviously the issue of an American being wrongly detained in a foreign country, this is how the U.S. has always described grinder's detention in Russia, that is always going to be incredibly diplomatically complicated. But for this President, and in this situation, just take a step back and think about the fact that all of this was happening in Russia, in the middle of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And this ended up raising so many questions for President Biden on how and whether to engage Vladimir Putin. You know, in general, when he has been asked this question about are you going to talk to him, are you willing to talk to him? He has mostly recently said, look, I don't want to have a conversation with him unless he is serious in giving signs about wanting to end the war. But I thought a really telling moment from earlier this year was in his interview with Jake Tapper when he was asked, look, Mr. President, would you be willing to have a conversation with Putin on the sidelines of the G20? And he initially said no. And then he amended his answer to say, I would be willing to do this if he showed signs of being willing to discuss Griner. So, I think that exchange really captured how much the Griner issue was top of mind and has been top of mind for this President as he has been dealing with this ongoing war in Ukraine. And again, just the question of how do you deal with someone like Vladimir Putin?",

What can you tell us about, you know, your take on the fact that Brittney Griner is now coming home, something that is major news for her family and for the United States, but also just the fact that Paul Whelan is not from our understanding?",

I think I made a place where I am overjoyed for Cherelle Griner, who I think is an incredibly impressive person, whom I would never want to go up against in a courtroom. But at the same time, I'm sick to my stomach that the Whelan's had been left behind.Again, this is at least a third time in two presidencies. And I guess I wonder about the wisdom of putting a bunch of celebratory photos on Twitter when we just left, you know, a Marine behind for the second time.",

And they said that what they were trying to do was give the green light to personally execute this trade. He said that this was the right deal to make at this time.
