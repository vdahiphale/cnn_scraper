Billionaire tycoon Elon Musk, meantime, also hitting the trail. He is set to join Donald Trump tomorrow when the former president returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site where he survived an assassination attempt. This afternoon, we are tracking both campaigns. In a couple of hours, Trump will stand side by side with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp as that state reels from the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, these two apparently letting bygones be bygones after Trump's repeated attacks and his backing of a Republican rival in a primary after Kemp refused to lie about the results of the 2020 election. As for Vice President Harris, she is set to speak this hour in Detroit. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is covering her campaign for us. Priscilla, obviously, this news about Obama now hitting the trail as well is a big deal. What should we expect from this event tonight and what's coming up with the former president?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I don't think there's any love lost between them, Boris.I mean, this is pretty remarkable. As someone who has covered Donald Trump for several years as well, as was on the Hill during the House January 6 Committee hearings, this is pretty remarkable to see the two of them coming back together, particularly after all of the demeaning comments that Donald Trump has had for Brian Kemp over the last four years. And, remember, not even just that. He also had recruited someone else, another Republican, former Senator David Perdue, to run against Brian Kemp after the 2020 election because Brian Kemp refused to overturn the election results in Georgia. And so there's a lot of history there, a very fraught history, I should say. But, look, this is politics. And what we have seen is Donald Trump and his campaign recognize that not only, of course, is Georgia such a crucial state as we look ahead to November and they're looking at all the pathways to get to 270 electoral votes. But also, Brian Kemp is a very popular Republican governor and they need his help in that state. So that's part of this. And, also, just to go back to some of the criticism, I will note how unusual this is, is that, as recently as August, Donald Trump was criticizing Brian Kemp, saying that he wasn't a great governor, attacking his wife, saying he wasn't a true Republican. So, I mean, some of this fraught history goes back to as recent as August. But, as of now, it looks like unlikely allies that will be there on the ground today. Now, Boris, one thing that I am watching for is how the two really respond to what they will be talking to how the Biden administration is handling the recovery efforts after Hurricane Helene. Remember, earlier this week, Donald Trump was on the ground in Georgia. He actually had said that Brian Kemp was saying that Biden had never called him, although we heard from Kemp himself, who said he did talk to Biden. He appreciated his efforts. He kind of praised what he has done for the state of Georgia following the hurricane, as well as the efforts of FEMA. So, some differing opinions there. I'm really interested to see how this ends up looking in just a couple hours, when they both appear in Georgia -- Boris.",

Unemployment ticked down and all of this sparked a stock market rally. It's also one of the last major snapshots of the economy we will get before Election Day.

It is just one data point, Alisyn, but I think it argues for what's known as a soft landing, which is lower inflation and without causing a recession.Quite frankly, this data point is as good as it gets for the White House and the Harris campaign one month out from a presidential election, whether or not they get the credit for it. As you said, it was a whopping 254,000 jobs added net in September. That was way beyond expectations. I immediately got all sorts of skeptical texts from people, saying, hang on a second, is this going to be revised lower next month? And I think that's a fair question, but we did get revisions to both July and August too, and they added a further 72,000 jobs overall. So, if you add all of this together, it looks like a mini- acceleration, and you can see that in the bar chart there. This is not what we were expecting, let's be clear, and it's really good news. And, of course, this comes actually before the real impact of that half-a-percentage point rate cut from the Fed that we just got. It argues for a quarter-of-a-percentage point rate cut in November, but that's still to kick in. It's good news.",

It was better than expected by 100,000 jobs. So does that weaken former President Trump's message that the economy is in a shambles? FMR. REP. SCOTT TAYLOR (R-VA):  Look, let me first say that I'm rooting for America, right? I hope that it's correct, and I hope that we continue to have that trajectory. But I think, as your last guest said, it's rightful to be skeptical because it's just a data point. There was a data point before in the Biden and Harris administration that got revised down 800-and-some- thousand jobs. So I think -- I hope so. I hope it's correct. I hope America is on that path, for sure. But I'm certainly skeptical, because it's coming out right before the election. It's their data point. And I think it's important to understand that information leads to reason, emotion leads to action. And the reality is, a lot of Americans are hurting out there. And they don't care about a data point that comes out, when they can't -- when they're struggling to pay for grocery bills and gas and stuff like that. So I hope so. I mean, I'm team America.

I do know that Brian Kemp, he did say he communicated with him, but he also said -- he also criticized the slowness of the response. He criticized the fact that they only designated 11 counties initially. And I think probably the most egregious thing out of this -- and I know people who are on the ground helping folks right now. And what I'm hearing from them is that the Biden administration is not allowing them to fly drones to help with people. They just came -- they went to put people in a hotel and there were federal employees there and security kicking them out. These are people who just came from the disaster area. I think the federal employees could probably be in a tent and get those people to help out. But I think the biggest point here, and, in my opinion, the worst point and the worst data point for the Biden administration and Harris administration is the fact that they spent over a billion dollars out of FEMA's budget for natural disaster, when, three months ago, Secretary Mayorkas said that they're absolutely prepared for hurricane season. And now they're saying that they're broke. I don't think he should have a job, quite frankly, because, when Americans, everyday Americans are out there -- and I'm from Virginia, obviously, and, in Virginia, in Tennessee, in North Carolina and Georgia, they're watching billions of dollars go overseas. They're hearing FEMA's broke. And there are still bodies being found and people still getting rescue -- in search-and-rescue operations that are out there. Rebuilding hasn't even come close to being started yet. So I think this is a big problem for the Harris and Biden administration because everyday people, they're seeing that.",

And in this case, it tests whether Mexico can sue American gun manufacturers for aiding and abetting unlawful firearms sales to Mexican drug cartels. Federal law generally prohibits these kinds of lawsuits, protects the gun manufacturers, but Mexico is saying there's an exemption in the law when a manufacturer might be aiding and abetting the criminal activity. So that's number one. Another one, Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services has kind of counterfactual situation here, where the case was brought by a straight woman who's claiming she was denied a promotion by her gay boss in favor of another gay employee, and whether, as a member of a majority group, the plaintiff in a majority group here, not a minority group, actually has to prove a bit more under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits sex discrimination, whether she has to show some additional pattern of bias or other background circumstances. And, finally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. Texas. And this tests the NRC's plan to actually take spent nuclear fuel and allow it to be stored in Texas' Permian Basin.
