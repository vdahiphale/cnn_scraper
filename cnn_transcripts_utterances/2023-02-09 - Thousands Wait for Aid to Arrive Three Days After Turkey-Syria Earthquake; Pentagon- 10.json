The new discovery has drawn ire from Republican lawmakers already unhappy with how long it took for the U.S. president's order to shoot it down. Here is what the Pentagon had to say about the incident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIG. GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: I can assure you this was not for civilian purposes. That is -- we are 100 percent clear about that. Based on what we know and have serve observed about this balloon, it is a surveillance balloon, it was an intelligent collection capability. You know, a question I would ask myself is if in fact it was a civilian balloon, a weather balloon and it was approaching a sovereign nation about to enter their air space, a responsible nation would have put out some kind of public statement saying hey, head's up, this is heading your way, just want to let you know.

They say that U.S./China relations under strain right now. And they really don't see a window of opportunity opening up near term for a reset. Earlier today at the ministry of foreign affairs briefing, we heard the spokeswoman again insist that this Chinese balloon was a civilian aircraft that blew off course. The United States of course disputes that saying that this is spy crafts and not only that, part of a wider Chinese military surveillance operation that spans multiple continents. With the Pentagon saying that they have 100 percent certainty this was not just a weather balloon. I want to show you this statement we received from the ministry of foreign affairs just a couple hours ago in response to what we've been hearing from the U.S. overnight. According to the spokeswoman, Mao Ning, she said: The U.S. side claims that this balloon is part of a fleet of aircraft, -- I do not know that. I think that this may be part of the U.S. side of the information and public opinion warfare against China.
