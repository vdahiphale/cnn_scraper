Well over 3,000 have been killed, more than 13,000 injured, and parts of Southern Lebanon, some villages appear to have been flattened, the same in Eastern Lebanon.So I think what we're seeing here, when you see the sheer number of people on the streets that are trying to drive back to where they've come from is a feeling of wanting to see what is left, of wanting to try and get home and get back to some kind of normality. And yes, there have been warnings from the IDF saying, it is not time for you to come back to Southern Lebanon in particular. Do not come back until we tell you it is safe to do so. And we've heard from a senior Biden Administration official that the Israeli military is not necessarily expected to withdraw immediately. They want to make sure that there's no vacuum. They want to make sure that there is sufficient Lebanese military there who will be patrolling this area, so that, that vacuum cannot be taken up by anyone else. Now, we've heard Lebanese officials saying that there will be sufficient military power in that area. The Lebanese army, they say, that they will be doubling to 10,000 soldiers in the southern part. And we've heard from politicians as well, being quite triumphant as well as positive about this ceasefire that the Parliament Speaker, Nabih Berri, for example. He was key in this whole process. He's the key interlocutor with Hezbollah, and he had said people should go home. They should start to celebrate, but also pointed out that this was, as he saw, a victory against Israeli aggression and also a key test for Lebanon and all the different sects to unite, and try and rebuild the country.

And that's something we heard from President Biden when he addressed reporters in the Rose Garden yesterday, really reinvigorating and doubling down on his push to get a deal for Gaza.

Many of these people that Donald Trump has put in key positions are incredibly wealthy business people. There are hedge fund managers and Wall Street executives who -- some of which are billionaires and we will get our first glimpse into how the Trump transition team has been ensuring that the interest of the American people will take priority over the business holdings of these individuals. So those are two key areas that ensure a sort of seamless transition. It also allows for individuals who will be serving in national security capacity roles to begin getting briefings day to day on the national security issues around the world. And of course, that is incredibly important given that what these appointees will be walking into with, everything occurring in the Middle East and with Russia and Ukraine at the moment, all the unrest that is facing and uncertainty around the world. Without those briefings, these individuals would be walking in someone blind on day one.

When you think about the fact that there are going to be a-million-and-a-half people at least coming through Chicago area airports over this weekend, those numbers look absolutely perfect.And when you look across the country at the FlightAware MiseryMap, there's only 19 cancellations across the country. So when you look at the busiest holiday season ever and you see that there's only 19 cancellations, I mean, that is like the holy grail of holiday travel. When the rush actually really hits, they are thinking it is going to be actually Sunday. So here at O'Hare, the airport authority here in Chicago thinks there's going to be about 254,000 people pouring through O'Hare on Sunday alone. So, hopefully the weather holds, hopefully there are no ripple travel effects, because we've seen in years past where there's that weather system in one spot across the country and that can have a ripple effect all over.

Three central things -- protesters, supporters of Imran Khan, the former prime minister of Pakistan, wanted him out of jail. He's facing more than 150 criminal cases. They also wanted a constitutional amendment for Pakistan's Constitution repealed. And they finally wanted seats that they believe they won fair and square in parliament, in elections in February, to be given to them. And from their point of view, those seats have been denied to their political party. So one of the main questions going forward is, what will both of these sides do? The side of Imran Khan, his wife, Bushra Bibi, certainly a galvanizing force in Imran Khan's absence, of leading protestors to go on these convoys from the outskirts of town into the center of Islamabad. And conversely, we will be acutely watching what will the government led by Prime Minister Sharif be doing as well. At the end of Tuesday, we were able to report no substantial measures of progress between Prime Minister Sharif's government and Imran Khan's political party and the protesters. Will there be talks that will be held in the next few days to avoid this situation from playing out?

So this is an important achievement and one that the Biden Administration has been working on.The fact that it's being delivered now, I think, is attributed to a few reasons. Perhaps Prime Minister Netanyahu is in (ph) speaking to the fact that, of course, over 14 months of war has been exhausting for Israeli society, let alone the military, and a pause in the northern border allows for Israel itself to think strategically about what comes next. The Israeli leadership and Netanyahu has been constantly suggesting that Israel is on a seven-front war. And so closing down one of those fronts could mean that Israel turns its attention hopefully to Gaza and thinks about a ceasefire in that context that is urgently needed. But it is also likely that Israel will try to degrade Iran-backed groups more broadly across the region, perhaps in Syria.

Especially as you said, we know just how influential influencers were ahead of this U.S. presidential election. We know that around half of Americans, at least some of the time, get their news from social media and this of course happens around the world.And it's a good reminder that even though influencers often form what feel like personal relationships with their followers, they build brands around their perceived trustworthiness, you really can't always trust what you see on social media. And according to this report, here's how influencers determine what they feel like is the credibility of information before they share it. It said 40 percent of influencers relied on measures of popularity, so how many likes or follows a person or a piece of information had before they shared it. 20 percent said they trusted friends and experts, so maybe slightly better. But just 17 percent said they actually looked at documentation and evidence before sharing information to their followers. And something that really stuck out to me, there was one person who said that they decided what was reliable just based on their own life experience. So whereas you may think that you're getting trustworthy information from these widely followed influencers, it could really be biased or just plainly untrue. And of course, we've seen that before. Perhaps the most prominent recent example is this viral false claim that there were immigrants in Ohio who were stealing and eating people's pets. That, of course, was amplified by President-elect Donald Trump and ended up being really harmful to the people there.

And we've seen in the last few years, sort of a pullback for many of the major social media platforms in terms of their efforts to invest in trust and safety and content moderation. Most of the big platforms do say that they label misinformation. On X, they allow users to add what are called community notes to try to add context to information. Other major platforms work with professional fact-checkers and in some cases, they demote content. They don't promote it or they make it impossible to make money from that content.But still, that content is out there and available for people to see. And I think that's the real issue, is that once something's out there, it's really hard to sort of walk it back and undo.",

Clare Duffy, appreciate your reporting. Thank you. Now, for the first time in more than 50 years, a painting by British artist George Stubbs is up for auction. It's expected to sell for up to $2.5 million. The \"Spanish pointer\" is considered one of the most famous artworks and the artist's most famous works, and has been in a private collection. The painting is now on display to the public at Sotheby's in London until early December.British Airways has unveiled a new first class seat design set to debut in 2026 on its Airbus A380s, the world's largest passenger plane. A sliding door makes each space feel like a suite, with extra wide seats that can fold out into a bed. There's also a closet, mini bar, mood lighting, and a 32-inch 4K entertainment screen. While other airlines are cutting back on first class options, British Airways says there's still demand in the luxury travel market, if you can afford it. (LAUGH)",
