We're looking at live pictures from out of Beirut, black plumes of smoke still rising from the densely populated southern suburbs where the Israeli military went after Hezbollah targets overnight.Israel is vowing to carry out -- carry out more strikes in the region after Iran's largest ever attack on the country. The commander in chief of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps says 200 missiles were fired at Israel, and that 90 percent of them hit their targets, which appears to have been the Mossad Intelligence Service headquarters and two Israeli air bases. The IRGC claims Israel and the U.S. are deliberately downplaying the effectiveness of the assault. However, it is very unclear at this point whether the barrage caused any serious damage. The IDF has reported one death so far. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to hit back, fueling fears that this conflict will spread even further. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Iran made a big mistake tonight, and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and our determination to retaliate against our enemies. We will stand by the rule we establish. Whoever attacks us, we will attack him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Thank you.Israel has woken up to a country that certainly seems largely intact. Iran suggesting that the ballistic missiles that it used to attack the country last night hit 90 percent of its targets. But the assessment at this stage, though it continues, doesn't suggest as such. These were military and security facilities that were targeted. What's your assessment of what happened between what 7:30 and 8:15 or so last evening? COL. MIRI EISIN, SENIOR FELLOW, INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR COUNTERTERRORISM AT REICHMAN UNIVERSITY: Becky, I love the way that we quote what the Iranians are saying, that they fired these against these different military installations, and yet it hit near a school inside a schoolyard in the town of Gerar (ph) that most people in the world have never heard of, not a big city inside Israel hid inside the town that I live into right next to Tel Aviv and all around Israel. So, I want to separate between the statements that they make, the statements that Hezbollah make. They can say that they're firing at military installations. They fire at the civilian communities, and wherever it hits, it hits. And in that sense, I think that, as an Israeli right now, you cannot hide in Israel if there are casualties and the idea that Israel is hiding what happened yesterday, Becky, you were here. We were all here. It was scary, it was hard, but that's what air defense does. That's why Israel, together with the United States, by the way, invested heavily in the term air defense. I don't think people understand what that means. It's not just the active defense of having the interceptors intercept these missiles in the atmosphere above the ground and the booms that we heard. It's also about the passive defense, what you and I did when those sirens were going on and on and on yesterday, for you know, within that hour. But we protect ourselves. We go to places. We know how to act. So, I don't believe the Iranians. I don't believe Hezbollah, and I do think that this kind of unprecedented attack is not the same as April. This is bigger and harsher.",

He said, and I quote, \"Earlier this evening, we exercised self-defense under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, targeting solely military and security sites in charge of genocide in #Gaza, #Lebanon.\" This is the Iranian foreign minister.And he went on to say, we did so after exercising tremendous restraint for almost two months to give space for a ceasefire in Gaza. And speaking to sources around this region, there was certainly an enormous effort made on the part of regional actors to try and rein in Iran's response to the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas in Tehran, and latterly, to the assassination of the Hezbollah chief, backed by Iran, of course, and his -- many of his commanders and now, of course, the limited and targeted incursion, as it is described, into Lebanon. The foreign minister very quick to point out that this has been a policy of exercising restraint for almost two months, to give space for a ceasefire in Gaza. That seems as far away as it ever has at this point. The concern is clearly now about a wider regional war. Do you share that concern? And you front opening up with Iran itself, rather than just, for example, its proxies in Hezbollah and its, you know, ally, as it were in Hamas in Gaza. What are your concerns at this point about where this goes next?",

The question is, what you do with the proxies, with Iran and Hezbollah has both a proxy and a Lebanese player.And when you talk about diplomacy, I want to be clear, diplomacy is not about a peace treaty. You don't do a peace treaty with somebody who's calling for your annihilation. The peace treaty there would be that I don't exist, and then everything's great. And I say that because right now, if you look at that foreign minister's tweet, I was reading it right before the program on night of April 13th, 14th, the former foreign minister, he was killed in that air crash that happened when the president was killed, put out a similar tweet from the United Nations from the Iranian where they show that what they're doing is legal, and what they're trying to do is not just the physical attack against Israel, it's the information warfare. Look at what you're just telling me, that what Iran is doing is legit and that what they're doing is just self-defense. I don't think that's what you were saying, but that's what they're saying. What the Islamic regime of Iran is doing is a overt attack against a sovereign state. They can say whatever they want. This is beyond illegitimate. It's been called out as such by the president of the United States, by the prime minister of the U.K., by all of the world leaders. This isn't something that should be put in the Iranian information war context. We shouldn't allow them to be able to be legitimized in such a way. What do I want? I want an end to the war. I want the hostages back. I want Hamas to stop attacking me. I want Hezbollah to stop calling for my annihilation. In the meantime, I need to talk, at least in a certain degree, in Middle Eastern terms with his proxies and the voices that they hear, and that's my targeting them in a very specific way.",

He joins me now from Tehran. The U.S. describes the unprecedented attack by Iran on Israel yesterday evening as defeated. The missiles mostly intercepted, they say, and those that landed don't seem to have caused significant damage, although that assessment continues. The IAF, Israel's Air Force, still has its full operational abilities according to the IDF. So, will this be seen as a success or a failure for regime supporters in Iran?

And you know, there have been, you know, different reactions, but there have been calls from political factions and officials calling for unity against this.

Otherwise, we'd be talking about President Dukakis after Lloyd Bentsen demolished Dan Quayle in 1988.

He really did save the best for last, talking about democracy, not only looking back at January 6th and Trump's actions, but looking forward to what a Vance would do if presented with the same circumstances in which Mike Pence stood up for the constitution.

If he wants, if he would like to stop this war, you first of all don't supply Israel with unlimited and unconditional weapons and ammunition. What is Israel supposed to do with all those weapons if not to use it?So, I think Biden maybe with very good intentions, lost his way because he said one thing and he acted in the exact opposite way.

But according to the mindset of Israel, there must be retaliation for last night, last night was horrible.Not that I underestimate what happened last night, but the question is, OK, so we will beat them back now and then what? And then they will beat us back, and then what? I mean, this lack of horizon or any kind of horizon, political horizons, strategic horizons, nothing of this. Netanyahu never believed in any kind of political settlement with the Palestinians, with the Arabs. He never believed in negotiations, and he is now implementing his policy mainly to live only on our soil (ph), on our military force and nothing but this. This is a very depressing vision.",

And therefore, they will do anything possible in most massive forces, in unlimited way to try to implement this strategy.The only problem with this strategy is that it cannot succeed. It must fail because you cannot base your policy only on military force. You cannot go on from war to war, from retaliation to retaliation forever. You must talk for another horizon.

Vance was likely to be more prepared, perhaps smoother on the debate stage, saying that he has had more practice than the governor in terms of doing interviews as a senator, and being more combative in media appearances. After the debate, Walz aides that we spoke with wouldn't deny that Vance did appear practiced and polished. Anyone could also see that Governor Walz did appear for nervous, particularly at the beginning of the debate.But the Walz aides that we have been speaking to, they do insist that when it comes to substance, put aside the style, that he did come out on top on a number of issues. As one Harris aide put it to me, they were particularly pleased with how much the debate ultimately ended up focusing on former President Donald Trump and his record, his statements, and his proposals, including on issues like immigration and reproductive rights. And as CNN had reported going into Tuesday evening, Walz's debate prep had included preparing for potentially false statements that are made by J.D. Vance. Now, an example of this is the following exchange where we saw the governor trying to balance both real-time fact-checking his opponent and also quickly turning to his own talking points on a specific issue. Take a listen.

But let's go back to this on immigration. Donald Trump had four years -- he had four years to do this and he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2 percent of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime.(END VIDEO CLIP)",
