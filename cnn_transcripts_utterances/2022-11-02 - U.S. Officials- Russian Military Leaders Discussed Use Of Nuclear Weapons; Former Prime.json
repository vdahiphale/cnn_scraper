That's according to a U.S. intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources.Some of those sources cautioned that the conversations may have taken out of the context, but others say they show intensifying frustration among Russian military leaders, frustration that they fear could become desperation. CNN's Natasha Bertrand joins us now. So, Natasha, it's important to point out that Putin himself was not involved in these conversations, nonetheless they are troublesome.",

      "sentences": "Exactly right, Bianna. So, what we're learning is that this intelligence assessment is essentially is a description of a conversation that Russian generals had amongst themselves, about the conditions under which they could potentially use a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Now this intelligence has the administration kind of divided. Because it is not a raw intelligence product. It's not, for example, a readout of the exact conversation that these generals had.Rather it is a description based on a source, and the intelligence community kind of putting some analysis over it as to what it could mean. And so, the rub here is really as to how to interpret what this intelligence actually means. Is it the general discussing concrete plans to want some kind of nuclear weapon. Is it more of an abstract discussion about, you know, what-if. That's something that administration officials the at manufactures officials are trying to figure out now. Some of them say that this intelligence really is not enough and that it could be taken out of context, it could be misinterpreted. But other officials are more concerned about it. They say that given all of the rhetoric that we have heard from Putin, from other top Kremlin officials about their desperation in terms of the battlefield losses in Ukraine, the evacuation from certain southern cities in Ukraine, that has raised some fears that perhaps something could be -- definitely could happen, right. And so, the administration is emphasizing that they have seen no plans -- that Putin has made to conduct this kind of attack. But still, they are watching this very closely because of course, no one is in Vladimir Putin's mind himself.",

The last election was Solomon aberration where the center and the center left and the center right together managed to cobble together an unwieldy coalition -- that didn't hold. And now the extreme right has made enormous gains.The context is very important. This is not a one-off. This is not a result of low turnout. In fact, this is the highest turnout in any Israeli election in more than a decade since 1999. And most of the turnout, the spike in the turnout comes from the extreme right. It shows that the extreme right after a period of uncertainty has consolidated. And Benjamin Netanyahu has aligned his Likud Party -- which is center right -- to the extreme right and has driven that combination back in the power. It means that the center right are now beholding to the extreme right. And the extreme right parties now basically are going to be kingmakers in Israel. In this next round of government formation and perhaps for some years to come.",

And Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro finally broke his silence days after losing his reelection bid. He spoke yesterday. He vowed to abide by the constitution. But notably, he did not explicitly concede the election. And this is important because since the election we've seen his supporters block highway traffic, hundreds of highways across the country, concerns about the effect that would have on the economy. Does his non-concession at least ease some of that tension?",

But as you point out, many of them are already in the street, and they are challenging the results. He hasn't said whether he will set up a formal challenge in the courts, but his sort of chief of staff immediately after Bolsonaro spoke, his chief of staff came out and said that they would begin the work to transition to the new government led by, although President Lula, which allows for a little bit of optimism.But the fact that Bolsonaro hasn't come out openly and said, look, I lost fair and square, the other side won, let's move on. That leaves open the possible that he might be simply taking the measure of the -- of his base, to understand where his base stands. Whether he can mount a challenge in the streets, having failed to win the election. And the crucial, the crucial, the billion dollar question now, Bianna, is what will the military say? If the military faces down the protesters in the street, forces those protesters to go back home, if the military throws its weight behind Lula, who won the election, then we can begin to exhale.

I don't think he's know I was. I don't think I be here today without Jerry Liebling.This is a photograph he took in 1949 in New York City of this just wonderful kid looking at the camera, with all his business, the hat, the coat, shoes flapping, an improbable shoot, the beauty of the curve of the car. You know, I had lots of choices for this. And I felt I could honors my mentor by putting his on the very front. And to say -- the word \"our\" has to be as inclusive as possible. It's everybody's stories. And what I've learned -- I've made films for 50 years of the U.S., but I really made films about us. And what I've learned in those 50 years is that there's no \"them.\" And today everybody is telling us there's a them that's responsible for their grievances. And I think what we have to get back to in our country is a sense that there's no them, that we're all in this together, and our problems are not the other person's fault. But we're all bound to each other. Lincoln understood this. All of our great leaders understood that. And this book is an attempt to sort of draw together all of that into one place and celebrate how incredibly beautiful our country is. How incredibly dark parts of our past is, but how people have joy and fun. It's all in the book.",

It's important to point out here, that the FCC does not regulate TikTok or other social media companies. So, in some respects, Commissioner Carr is, you know, speaking out of his lane a little bit. But you know, he's saying that his experience on the FCC, dealing with other Chinese businesses in the telecom space, and trying to block those companies from U.S. telecom networks has given him important context for his efforts in trying to prevent TikTok from being able to operating in the United States. Now what is TikTok staying about all this. In a statement here they gave me they said: Commissioner Carr has no role in or direct knowledge of the confidential discussions with the U.S. government related to tick-tock and is not in a position to discuss what those negotiations entail. He appears to be expressing his personal views, independent of his authority as an FCC commissioner. We are confident that we are on a path to reaching an agreement with the U.S. government that well satisfy all reasonable national security concerns -- Bianna.",
