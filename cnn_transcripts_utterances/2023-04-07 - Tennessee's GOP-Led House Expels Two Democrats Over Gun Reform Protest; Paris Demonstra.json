And so the protestors have said that they plan another protest next Thursday. That there will be another day of strikes. So we expect to see hospital workers, schoolteachers, downed tools. I also have some factories being blocked. And the objective is to try and get the government to listen to, of course, remove that reform. Now, next Thursday will be the day before the Constitutional Council looks at the reform and will either greenlight it or say that some parts of it are unconstitutional or, indeed, the whole thing. Now we expect this to be a formality so we expect it to be greenlit. But if it isn't this would be a dramatic development, especially for Macron. You know, Macron has been severely weakened by this pension reform. You will remember that most French people are against it. So his popularity ratings are very low. The last time they were this low was during the yellow vest protest. So Macron has a lot to do. He's in -- he's in China right now but this really is the biggest crisis facing his presidency and he has a lot to do to try and make the French feel listened to and to find some way to appease the masses -- Omar.",
