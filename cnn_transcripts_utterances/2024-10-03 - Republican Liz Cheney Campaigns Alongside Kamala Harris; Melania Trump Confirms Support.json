That is the message from Liz Cheney, in a passionate plea to Americans, while standing with the Democratic nominee, in the birthplace of the Republican Party. Also tonight, an old photo has surfaced, of a Republican member of Congress, in blackface, while dressed up as Michael Jackson. Tonight, Congressman Mike Lawler will join me, live, to respond. Entrapped in the flooding, two people are dead. Four more are still missing tonight. And a Tennessee factory is under investigation after workers say they weren't allowed to leave, to escape Hurricane Helene until it was too late. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the last presidential election are front and center with only weeks to go before the next one. The fallout from the culmination of those efforts by Donald Trump, January 6th, is what pushed Liz Cheney to do something that would have been unthinkable, for anyone in her family just four years ago.

Tonight, Trump's lawyers are trying again to get that case thrown out entirely, and they're attempting to lean on an assist from the Supreme Court. My legal sources areFormer Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and CNN Senior Legal Analyst, Elie Honig. Also here, former Senior Investigative Counsel for the January 6 Committee, Temidayo Aganga-Williams. Great to have you both here. Elie, can we just start with what they are arguing, what Trump's team is arguing here? Obviously, we know what the goal is. But what's the process that they're hoping to get there by? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASST. U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: So, this is the other issue. We've been very focused for the last several days, and weeks, on the immunity question, which is playing out, and I know we'll talk about in a minute. But what Trump's arguing today is there was another Supreme Court decision, a few days before the immunity decision, that said the obstruction law that was charged, to get hundreds of January 6 rioters, does not apply to the physical attempt to block Congress on January 6th. The court, as a result, threw out 300-plus convictions for that. And by the way, I should say, Justice Jackson, Ketanji Brown Jackson joined with five conservatives in that ruling. So, Trump's team is saying, Aha, two of the four charges against me are the same obstruction statute, therefore it has to get thrown out. Jack Smith's going to say, Well, your case involved fake documents. Which the Supreme Court said is really the distinction. It has to involve fake documents. So, Jack Smith is going to say, The fake elector certificates, that keeps these charges on the books against you.",

The distinction there is going to be about whether these -- this law that was made after the Enron scandal, focused on documents, is applicable to the former President. I think it's going to be a failure when he moves forward here. I think the judge is going to be pretty easily dismissed that -- that argument. COLLINS: Can I ask you about the other thing the judge did today, which was move the deadline for when Trump's team has to respond to, to what we went through, last night? All this evidence that we had never seen before, some of it, in the election interference case against Trump, saying, This can still go to trial, despite what the Supreme Court argued.

Then the defense says, Here's the motions I'm going to make to try to dismiss. Jack Smith here said, I want to go first, and I want to speed it up. And Judge Chutkan agreed with him.

The Supreme Court told Jack Smith to go forward and do exactly what he's doing. Jack Smith filed that brief under seal. Judge Chutkan chose to unseal this, not Jack Smith. And I do take issue with the framing that this case has been delayed or is going forward at this time because of Jack Smith. It was delayed because the Supreme Court took so long, took this action. It was delayed because the former President has sorted every angle to stop this from going forward. So I do think that, personally, for me, I think what Jack Smith has done so far is prosecute this case, honorably, quickly and appropriately. And the public has a right. There is a public interest in an open process, which means seeing this evidence, which means moving quickly, and yes, moving quickly before an election. That's what should happen. The people should know what happened and get the evidence that a grand jury, as beyond probable cause, said that the former President likely committed this crime. So, the people should get to trial as quickly as possible and should not be stopped because an election happens to be happening. He's a defendant, first, candidate, second.",

I'm not -- I'm not saying, they don't -- they don't communicate, they don't spend time together. The work that Melania Trump does is often siloed, and it's something she does on her own.And I think it's interesting too. Listen, if Donald Trump could say anything to Melania Trump, about these recent weeks or months, wouldn't it be, Hey, can you get out on the campaign trail for me? Can you help me get undecided women voters? Or recent immigrants, or people who would relate to your story? It's a typical thing that first ladies do for their husbands who are campaigning, or their spouses who are campaigning. And I mean, Doug Emhoff is doing it for Vice President Harris. So, I think that if there was something he could ask her to do, it would be campaign, not necessarily hawk the book. But she's chosen otherwise.",
