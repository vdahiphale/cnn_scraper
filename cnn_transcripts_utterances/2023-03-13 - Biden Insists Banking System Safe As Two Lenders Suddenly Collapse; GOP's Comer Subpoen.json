But again, depending on which side of the aisle you're talking to, members from which side of the aisle, it depends on what kind of answer you're getting and how they think they should move forward and what if anything they should be doing.What we do know is the - is that Democrats and Republican leadership, both briefed by the Treasury Department over the weekend they were in the loop about this. We know that House Speaker - Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, both expressed some concerns about any sort of systemic failures within the economy. If you talk to liberals, people like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who had an op-ed today in The New York Times, they really point back to a 2018 vote in which a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted to overturn some federal banking regulations that had been put into place after 2008. So let me read to you what - part of what she wrote. She said, \"Had Congress and the Federal Reserve not rolled back the stricter oversight SVB and Signature would have been required to conduct regular stress tests to expose their vulnerabilities and shore up their businesses. These bank failures were entirely avoidable.\" On the other hand, you have Republicans who are blaming what they call woke policies by the banks that got them into this position to begin with. They say that there are these liberal policies that put them in these vulnerable positions. And we also heard from the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, South Carolina senator, Tim Scott, who really urged against any sort of culture of government intervention. What is clear from everyone Bianna and John, one thing they do seem to agree on is there is no appetite for a major government bailout and again, as Priscilla was alluding to just a moment ago, the President very clear that the taxpayers will not be bearing the burden of this, that this is not a bailout that is like 2008, John and Bianna?",

But for the most part, it's the really big financial institutions that were that have been subject to much stricter regulatory requirements and regular stress testing.And more recently, some of these smaller to medium-sized institutions have had some of the regulations relaxed, they're not stressed tested to use the term of art as frequently. Would the vulnerabilities at Silicon Valley Bank have been caught, had they been stress tested more frequently, had regulators been more proactive, I think probably based on the bank experts and economic experts that I've spoken with, it seems like Silicon Valley Bank in particular made a pretty basic no, no, which was essentially not hedging against interest rate risk and when everybody kind of knew interest rates are going to go up. So that's something that seems like it should have been caught, whether you can directly draw a linkage between that deregulatory action, rolling back part of Dodd-Frank and this collapse, I don't know yet, but it seems quite plausible.",

So the first thing has changed is two plus years have passed between now and then. The other big difference is we're really talking about different sets of laws here.
