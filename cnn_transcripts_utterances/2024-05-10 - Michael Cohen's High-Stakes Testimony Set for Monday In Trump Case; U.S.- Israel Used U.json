Cohen's former lawyer is OUTFRONT. Plus, from Stormy Daniels to the judge, the alarming and growing threats targeting key players in Trump's trial. And the breaking news, a new Biden administration report says it is reasonable to assess that Israel's use of U.S. weapons in Gaza could violate international law. At least one Democrat though says that report ducks the hard questions. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erica Hill, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the final major witness in the Trump criminal trial now confirmed. Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney and fixer, set to take the stand when the trial resumes on Monday. And, of course, much of this case really hangs on Michael Cohen someone who the defense will say has deep credibility issues. Cohen though, is seen as the one potential witness who can help prosecutors proved the crux of their case that the hush money payment was made to influence the 2016 election. Cohen says Trump repaid him for that $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, money that Trump again claimed today was simply for Cohen's illegal fees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What they've done is they've used witnesses essentially to tell the story that Michael Cohen would tell. So you don't have to what they'll say in closing argument believed Michael Cohen at all. We have reasonable inferences that can be drawn from all the other witnesses, which would suggest that exactly what he's telling you is true.

But this is nonetheless the most detailed and the most damning public accounting of Israel's conduct in the war in Gaza by the Biden administration. And it certainly adds yet another layer to the ongoing Israel-U.S. tensions that we have watched really escalate. In particular, this week following that interview that President Biden did with Erin Burnett, in which the president made clear that a main each are ground offensive in Rafah would be a red line would result in withholding additional U.S. munitions to Israel. The Israeli prime minister in responding to that, he has been defiant. He has made clear that Israel will do what it feels is necessary for its security, including going into Rafah, something that the Israeli security pretty cabinet late last night made clear will continue to expand in terms of that military operation. I'm told by an Israeli official that the Israeli security cabinet last night approved a, quote, expansion of the area of operation in Rafah, indicating that the Israeli military will continue to expand its operations there. This basically gives the war cabinet, which is the key decision-making body, the authority to continue to expand that military campaign, to make decisions about the timing of that. It's not an indication that this offensive in Rafah, the expansion of it is imminent but it does give that additional authority and ultimately, it seems right now that it is more a question of when the Israeli military will expand its ground operation in Rafah, rather than if it will do so.
