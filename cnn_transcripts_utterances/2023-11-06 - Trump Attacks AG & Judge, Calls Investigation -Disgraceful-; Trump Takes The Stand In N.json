And I guess that's what you're getting at there.But when it comes to the perspective of voters, we saw a poll out yesterday from the New York Times, not a national poll, a poll in the determinative swing states, Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, all of which show Donald Trump beating Joe Biden, and then in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, too close to call. If that is the case -- and I'm an undecided Republican voter, why would I vote for anybody other than him if my goal is to beat Joe Biden?",

We know how that went. There's a ways to go here.But getting back to the point of TV, Dana, I mean, look, he absolutely believes that that's where he's most effective. And, by the way, on the polls that you saw yesterday, if he can't beat Joe Biden right now, when inflation is where it is, when there are two wars going on at the same time and Joe Biden is in the midst of this storm, if he can't be ahead of him now, when would he ever be ahead of him? So, you know, I don't -- I think he should take, you know, comfort from those polls, but very, very temporary comfort, because the same way the world was much different on October 6th than it was on October 7th, given the Hamas attack on Israel, who knows what is going to happen next that might help Donald Trump or hurt him. But I suspect that the biggest thing that's going to hurt him is he's going to wind up paying a big number in this case, and we'll see if he even has the money to be able to do that, the cash to be able to do it. And secondly, he is getting ready to go to trial on March 4th in Washington, D.C. on a criminal trial where he won't be able to come in and out of the courtroom like he's doing now, Dana. He has to be there every minute of every day that the court --",

      "sentences": "Yes, Dana. It's quite tense inside that courtroom right now. What is going on is they're talking about something that is kind of at the heart of this, which is Trump exaggerating and not only his net worth, but also the size of his properties. And what has really been at the center of this is his apartment inside Trump Tower. That is something where publicly Trump bragged even beyond what his financial statements said was the size of that apartment. I believe the financial statement said it was about 30,000 square feet. Trump brags in an interview with Forbes when they were talking about his net worth that it was actually 30,000 -- 33,000 square feet. But in reality, we have since learned that it is much closer to 11,000 square feet, and that is just an example of why Donald Trump is testifying in this courtroom behind me.He, obviously, stands accused by the Attorney General of inflating his net worth, inflating the size and value of his assets in order to get more favorable terms for his loans that he secured. He's arguing that there was no real victim in that. But what he was just asked by the AG's office while he is on the witness stand is who in the Trump organization was responsible for identifying something like this, where a number was significantly off. Because Trump in his own words was telling Forbes that it was even higher than what his financial statement said. He just told the attorney general office, the lawyer for the attorney general's office that everybody at the Trump organization he claimed was responsible for that. He also flagged the outside accounting firm that they had hired, saying that they are someone that he believed would have flagged that. The question, though, is whether or not that is a defense that goes over well with the judge. Trump has not really been answering these questions and yes or no -- in a yes or no fashion. That has been very frustrating to the judge here, and so that has been a big part of this. CNN's Kristen Holmes is over at Trump Tower, where, of course, is the source of part of all of this dispute over how big exactly this apartment was. Kristen, obviously, I mean, the question over the size of these apartments is something that is playing into just what is at the heart of this, which is Trump exaggerating the size of these properties, the value of these properties, and now trying to kind of say, well, everyone was responsible for this. Not saying he himself was responsible for those numbers that they were giving to these financial institutions.",

They're just taking a lunch break right now. Trump was expected to say something, but he just walked, continued walking. ELLIOT WILLIAMS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, you know, it is his right to not say anything. He's not obligated to. Something we were talking about through the program, Wolf, is the idea that the president is sort of, or the former president, is using this opportunity as a bit of a political show.

That's what it was appraised at.But, you know, the Trump team said it was 30,000 square feet, where there's no error that anyone could make. It would be a reasonable error that would make something close to three times its size. Looking also at 40 Wall Street, it was appraised at between $200 million and $220 million. The Trump team reported that it was worth $527 million, almost two and a half times as much. These aren't just, at least as the allegations are coming from the state attorney general, these aren't just errors in mathematics, they're evidence of fraud, and that's what the judge is weighing here.",
