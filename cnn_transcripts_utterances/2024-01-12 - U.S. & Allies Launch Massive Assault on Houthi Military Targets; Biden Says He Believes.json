The action following weeks of hostility by those well-armed militants in the Red Sea, targeting commercial ships and endangering U.S. troops and freedom of navigation, according to the White House. The Houthis are Shia militants. They're considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department until President Biden took them off the terrorist list in 2021. But moments ago, he said this.

Ships that have linked to Israel. The Red Sea's waterway absolutely vital to the global economy. Of course, it seats between 10.15 percent of all global trade and about 30 percent of global container shipping. Since the Houthis began their attacks, most commercial shipping companies have opted to instead reroute around Africa. The Houthi attacks are part of a pressure campaign against Israel, orchestrated by Iran through its many proxies. And while President Biden insists last night's strikes will act as a warning to Iran and its proxies. There's really no way of predicting exactly how and when Houthis or Iran will respond as the Houthis warn American and British interests are, quote, legitimate targets. Many Republicans on Capitol Hill last night and this morning applauded President Biden for the strike. Some Democrats, however, are upset since the president did not first ask Congress for authorization for the use of force. We're going to talk to one of those Democrats in the next hour. But let's start right now with CNN's Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv, Israel.

The Houthis run a ceasefire with -- in the internal civil war in -- inside of Yemen, but also they've been firing recently, as recently as a couple of years, cruise missiles, Iranian-made cruise missiles at Saudi Arabia.

Lieutenant Alkonis, as you might remember, he was stationed abroad in Japan. He was sentenced to three years in a Japanese prison back in October 2021 for a car accident. He says he suffered acute mountain sickness while driving with his family down from Mount Fuji and that caused him to lose consciously -- consciousness and tragically to cause a deadly car accident.
