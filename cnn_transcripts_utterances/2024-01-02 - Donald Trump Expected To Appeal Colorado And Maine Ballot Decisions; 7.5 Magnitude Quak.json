Anti-Trump challenges succeeded at using the 14th Amendment's insurrectionist ban to remove Trump from ballots, though those decisions have been paused pending potential appeals.But challenges in several other states were rejected. And now Oregon's Supreme Court will decide whether to ban the former U.S. president from the ballot there over his alleged role in the January 6th insurrection.

Trump has maintained a consistent lead in the polls there despite his legal troubles, but rivals Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are hoping for a strong showing. CNN's Kristen Holmes reports from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is officially that final sprint to Iowa, we're looking at two weeks and the candidates are going to all be on the ground, or at least most of them trying to scoop up every last minute voter that they can, talk to any kind of Iowan who might be on the fence. And really going into it. When you look at the poll numbers, you still see that Donald Trump according to these polls, has a very substantial lead. He is the front runner and their goal is to keep that margin really high between him and whoever the second place person is. Now, the polls show that that would be Ron DeSantis right now. And after that Nikki Haley. Now, think about Ron DeSantis is that Iowa is critical to the Florida governor. He has made this essentially his make or break moment, put all of his cards or all of his eggs in the Iowa basket and he's really focused on that. However, we have seen some substantial rise in the polls from Nikki Haley, but still looks as though that would be the order. Now, whatever happens in Iowa is really going to set the tone for the rest of the primary and caucus season. Right now, Donald Trump is leading in most states, but there is a part where there are several Republican operatives who believe that if Donald Trump is slowdown in Iowa, if that margin is not as big as those polls show, it's possible that someone else could take the lead. We could see someone else surge. But right now, it's just still very early, and the big focus still remains on Iowa on the Hawkeye State. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The real question for me, I think, is whether you know, John Roberts, the chief justice in the U.S. has had a concern over the years about this court being seen as overtly partisan, as a player in the increasingly polarized struggle between the parties. And to me, the question is if in fact they decide to put Trump on the ballot, overturn the state decisions, does that make them more likely at the same time to also deny his claim of absolute immunity and say that voters if he is going to be on the ballot deserve to know whether a jury of his peers have found him guilty of the serious crimes of which he has been accused.",

And I think that also, as I said, I mean, the question will be, does this influence the Supreme Court's decision making? I mean, John Roberts and his concerns about way -- the way the court is seen, it is certainly ruled on big questions like Shelby County in 2013. And the decisions on redistricting is ruled in ways that benefit the Republican Party. But nonetheless, he has been reluctant to be seen as totally kind of in that camp and has often tried to balance the books and their decisions. And if all of -- if the outcome of all of these state actions is to create more space for the Supreme Court, what I think most legal scholars would say, reached the correct and more important decision that a president is not uniformly immune from prosecution, they will certainly have an impact in that regard as well.",

As you know, as analysts have pointed out, no one has ever had the kind of lead that Trump now has in national polling, and then gone on to lose the primary.You know, Ron DeSantis is probably in the strongest position to come in second in Iowa, as Kristen noted. I mean, he has put all his chips on Iowa. He's visited all counties, he's focused on according evangelicals and mobilizing support in that community, which is very powerful in Iowa. But he, like many other social conservative candidates who did well in Iowa is polling poorly in New Hampshire. And I think it is likely that Nikki Haley is going to do better in New Hampshire than DeSantis thus in Iowa, even if Trump is still likely to win both. And I think the most probable outcome is that after Iowa and New Hampshire on January, the night of January 23rd, Hayley will have eclipsed DeSantis as the most like -- as most plausible alternative to Trump and then she will have a month to make her case in her home state of South Carolina, which historically has been the pivotal contest in a Republican primary. Trump remains a heavy favorite there and if he wins there, he will probably effectively end the race at that point. [02:10:03] But if she does well enough in New Hampshire, she will at least have a chance to go into South Carolina and see if she can slow down Donald Trump over those next four weeks.",

The Supreme Court has never previously struck down a basic law or an amendment to a basic law. These are the closest things that Israel has to a constitution. So that was unprecedented. It's also a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who made this judicial overhaul almost like a flagship policy of his, withstanding months and months of protests, sometimes tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets, protesting against his judicial overhaul plans, because they said it would do irreparable damage to Israel's democratic character. Indeed, in justifying its ruling, the Supreme Court said that it did say because of the severe and unprecedented blow to the core characteristic of Israel as a democratic state. And of course, the other major implication is that this ruling threatens to reopen these very deep and severe divisions that the government's judicial overhaul plans sowed throughout Israeli society. Now, those divisions seem like a lifetime away now that Israel is fighting this war with Hamas after the militant groups terrorist attacks of October the seventh, but there are concerns that it could reopen these divisions, and that it may be even has the potential to split the government of national unity that was formed as a result of this war. We have heard from the Justice Minister Yariv Levin assailing the court for the timing of its ruling, even though it wasn't in the courts gift to decide on when it had to make this ruling. We've heard from National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, one of the most right wing members of the governing coalition saying that this decision by the Supreme Court was illegal. But we've got Benny Gantz, who's now a member of the war cabinet, saying that this verdict must be respected. And Israel must remember, internalize the kind of divisions that it saw in the run up to October the seventh and remember that Israelis are brothers, and that they have a shared destiny.

And right now, it's coming about. So, Russia is watching and waiting. And meanwhile, Ukraine's frustration is growing. President Zelenskyy gave an interview to The Economist which was published on Monday where he said that he sees absolutely no sign that Russia is looking to move towards any kind of peace. I want to read you a quote from that interview. He said, Putin feels weakness, like an animal. Because he is an animal. He said, he senses blood, he senses his strength and he will eat you for dinner with all your E.U., NATO, freedom and democracy. A warning from President Zelenskyy as he has warned many times before that President Putin and Russia will not stop at Ukraine unless Ukraine gets more help from the west. And President Putin meanwhile, also not in the mood for backing down, made it very clear in his New Year's address, he said, we will never back down. So, this is the stage we are at the moment, Ukraine laser focus now on two things. One, defending their cities and two, trying to hit the threat before it hits them. Essentially focusing on hitting weapons supplies, things like warships in the Black Sea and Crimea President Zelenskyy said in that interview would be a key focus going forward.",

Now, the Israel- Hamas conflict dominated so much of the president's attention in the closing months of 2023, and 2024 will be no different.White House officials are closely watching the coming weeks to see whether Israel actually transitions to a lower intensity phase of fighting. That is something that the U.S. has encouraged Israel to do in recent weeks. And a senior U.S. official said that they believe that they were starting to see the beginning of that strategy, that tactic, when Israel on Monday, announced that they would be withdrawing some of their troops from Gaza as Israel is preparing for a prolonged fight, heading into 2024. Now, Secretary of state Antony Blinken will be traveling to Israel later in the week as he is expected to start talking about that next phase in fighting with officials on the ground there. But there's also a host of domestic issues that Biden needs to tackle once he is back in Washington. That includes the border crisis as there has been a recent surge in migrants on the southern border, really adding additional stresses to an already strained system. Congressional negotiators have yet to settle on a deal regarding border policy changes, even as President Biden has said that he is willing to make some concessions. There is also big questions about whether the White House will be able to push through additional aid for Ukraine, as that debate is currently locked in the fight over those potential border policy changes. The White House, of course, has warned of what inaction could mean for Ukraine on the battlefield. And then, there is two major government funding fights looming. In just the next five weeks, there are two deadlines that Congress will need to reach to try to pass additional funding to prevent a government shutdown. Of course, all of this is playing out against the backdrop of the 2024 election. President Biden really has not been doing his day-to-day campaigning, but that is expected to change in the early months of 2024. He is also expected to ramp up his attacks on Former President Donald Trump, as his campaign believes that he will eventually become the Republican nominee. Of course, President Biden has been trailing Trump in some recent polling, and the president has much more work to do in trying to keep his coalition together, even as there have been some strains among some groups that have supported him. So, the president coming back to Washington, tackling a huge plate of issues, as he is heading closer to that 2024 election in November. Arlette Saenz, CNN, Washington.",

      "sentences": "Another thing going into effect starting January 1st is decreases in the list prices of insulin of more than 70 percent. Now, the list price is the actual price of medicine before insurance kicks in, or any rebates or discounts are paid back into the system. Now, the reason that is actually happening is because of a Biden Administration 2021 law, the American Rescue Plan Act. Essentially, that changed the way drug makers have to pay rebates back to Medicaid for drugs on which they have raised the price a lot over the years.Insulin's have been going up for decades. If you look at this graph we have here, this one actually comes from a congressional investigation into drug prices and you can see how much those list prices have increased. Now because of this change which goes into effect January 1st, companies that have raised the price of medicines a lot overtime could actually end up paying Medicaid for drugs. So, losing money on those medicines. So by reducing the list prices by 70 percent or more, these companies are actually avoiding having to pay these rebates back to Medicaid. Some analysts put this at hundreds of millions of dollars a year in savings these companies will have because they are reducing the list prices of their drugs. And so, while across the board, it is hoped that insulin prices are coming down for everyone, there is a lot going on beyond the surface here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
