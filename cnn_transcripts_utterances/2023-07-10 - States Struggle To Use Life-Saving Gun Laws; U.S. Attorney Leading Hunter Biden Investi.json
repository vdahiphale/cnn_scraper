Was denied that. In this letter to Capitol Hill, Weiss says he never asked to be made special counsel. There are also concerns the whistleblowers raised that had Weiss may not have been able to bring charges against Hunter Biden in the jurisdictions he wanted to. He again says in this letter, \"I was never denied the authority to bring charges in any jurisdiction.\" So in this very succinct letter, frankly, Weiss is refuting two of the main complaints we heard from these whistleblowers. One of the whistleblower's attorneys says, look, it doesn't matter if Weiss wanted to be special counsel or not. What matters is there were Biden political appointees involved in this process who shouldn't have been. David Weiss was a Trump appointee and, ultimately, it was his decision.
