It's the fastest, most tactically sound way to bring medical resources into those victims right away. So what you have here is about as highly evolved, well trained responses you're going to get, you know, anyplace in the country. And still we have seven victims. We have a shooter, two rifles and a handgun that is very heavily armed with lots of rounds of ammunition, undoubtedly. There is just - you know, hard to imagine (INAUDIBLE) what few facts. We have to be a better response. And yet it's still an absolute tragedy for this community.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's six victims, three adults, three children.And I think Andrew's speaking to the speed of that response of - according to metropolitan police and the fire department, just there in that press conference there were no other wounded. There was an officer who hurt their hands on some glass. But other than that, there were no wounded that we know of. Five people were transported to the hospital. We were told they were all deceased. But as you just touched on, Andrew, not only is it exceedingly rare that a young woman carries out a mass shooting - more than 90 percent of the shootings are carried out by men. But this young woman also had access to these extraordinarily strong firearms, assault type rifles and a handgun. So I imagine law enforcement will be looking into not only who she is - they don't have her identification yet - but certainly how she got ahold, if she is, indeed, a minor, of these of these guns. MCCABE: That's absolutely right. And you know the gun restrictions are different state by state, as we all know now. And whether or not she was able to legally possess those weapons, that's something for the investigators, and particularly the ATF to figure out. But they're also going to be looking at, like, where did - if she wasn't able to purchase these things, or have them lawfully? How did she get them? Did she get them from her parents or family members or friends? And are those, any of those folks in a position to be held responsible criminally responsible for what happened here today? I thought it was also, excuse me, really notable, Alex, that she was interdicted on the second floor of the school and in what was described as a lobby area. So they got there fast enough to stop her before she got into a classroom. She was still in kind of an open space on the second floor, not actually in a classroom, which probably also saved many lives. As we think back to the horrible tragedy at Uvalde in the situation where a shooter actually was able to kind of hide in a classroom with those victims.",

But, Andrew, when we see that there were no wounded, that all of the victims are now dead, does that speak to the power of these weapons? That this - that this young woman is this girl, if she's in her teens, was able to get there were no wounded. Which is just incredible in a shooting like this.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ASHBY BEASLEY (ph), MASS SHOOTING SURVIVOR: My name is Ashby Beasley (ph) from Highland Park, Illinois. I was actually in town just on vacation. But I'm a mass shooting survivor. My son and I survived a mass shooting in Highland Park where there was a shooting at a parade that we were at. We ran for our lives. And this is just unacceptable. It's only in America can somebody survive a mass shooting and then go on vacation, to visit another person that they have met through, you know, fighting for gun safety and find themselves in another involved like near another mass shooting. (CROSSTALK) BEASLEY (ph): Like only, you know what I mean, like, only in America does this happen where we keep seeing this again and again and again? Only in America does her son survived a mass shooting and then you know, end up in a lockdown school because there is another mass shooting. This is an epidemic. Gun violence is an epidemic and it needs it needs to be resolved. (CROSSTALK) BEASLEY (ph): It needs to be addressed.",

And I mean just how preventable this is how preventable these incidences are, how we should pass gun safety legislation and lock up weapons. And, you know, put background checks, require background checks on every single gun purchase, ban assault weapons. And until we do those things, this is going to continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That woman was at Highland Park. She's now she's now a witness to the shooting in Nashville.

And that woman was absolutely right when she repeatedly said \"only in America only in America,\" this does not happen anyplace else on earth with the frequency and lethality that it happens here in America.And the driving reason behind that, Alex, is because we have twice as many guns, twice as many guns in the hands of civilians as the second- highest gun, you know, possessing country on earth. We have 120 guns for every 100 people in this country. It is the easy and largely poorly regulated access to firearms that provides the opportunity for people with grievances, with complaints, with mental health challenges, what have you, to lash out in a way that wrecks this kind of violence on society. And it happens at schools. It happens at places of worship. It happens in hospitals, places of medical care. No place is immune from this sort of violence in America. It happens all over the place. We're not instinctively more violent than other countries. We just have many, many, many more guns.",

Andrew, you were just laying out what the FBI would be doing right now in great detail. They obviously have a lot on their plate.

You know, you can take one of the ways you understand who the shooter is, or identify a shooter by taking their fingerprints. If you're a teenager, it's less likely, not possible, but less likely that you would have been fingerprinted in the past. So those records might not be there to identify you. But I expect, certainly, by the end of the day today they'll have an understanding of who this person is. And that will lead directly to the execution of search warrants at her at her residence and any other location they can associate with her to look for that sort of evidence that we discussed a few minutes ago that might shed some light on her motivation and why she did this.",

But they're always going to be behind the attacker. So we have to - that's - this is a problem that law enforcement alone cannot solve for this country.

So, yes, when I hear about these things, I instinctively wonder if there could be another act of violence that's coordinated in. It's almost never happens in the run-of-the-mill, day to day mass shootings that we experience in this country. But it is why a tactical team, after eliminating the threat in the way they did in this school, they can't just dropped their guard and immediately start, you know, thinking about tending to the victims.

Now that ben was not perfect. I know from personal experience, working as a street FBI agent in New York City and trying to prosecute people for gun crimes, it was not the easiest statute to work with. But when you look across the country in general, during that period, you had a decline of mass shootings. And so I think, putting the prospect of an assault weapons ban back on the table, you know, it's is something logical and sound, aspirational likely for the administration to do.
