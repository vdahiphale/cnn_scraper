Thursday, December the 19th, beginning in Avignon, France, where Dominique Pelicot has just been found guilty on all charges in the mass rape of his wife, Gisele, and organizing that.We're awaiting verdicts now for dozens of other defendants whom Pelicot had recruited to sexually abuse his wife for nearly a decade. This has been one of the darkest criminal cases in France's modern history, one in which Gisele Pelicot was determined to make public, hoping to help other sexual abuse victims. She's become an icon. Prosecutors are seeking the maximum 20-year prison sentence for Dominique Pelicot and lower sentences for the other defendants. Melissa Bell standing by for us at the courthouse in Avignon. When do we get the actual sentence then, Melissa?",

      "sentences": "Well, for the time being, Max, what's happening inside that courthouse behind me is they're going through the verdicts of each of the men. More than a dozen of them now found guilty. The sentences we understand, will be announced afterwards.Essentially, they face sentences from between four to 20 years in the case of Dominique Pelicot and a few others. And, of course, as you can see by the amounts of people outside this courtroom today, Max, this is a trial that has been so extensively followed. It isn't simply the gravity of what these men are accused of having done. It isn't the scale of this trial, France's largest mass rape trial in modern history. It is, of course, also at the very heart of this trial the courage of Gisele Pelicot. We watched her arrive a short while ago to the cheers of the crowd shouting merci, madame, merci, Gisele, for her courage. Essentially, by waiving her anonymity, what she did is not simply waive that of the men accused of her rapes, but also placed at the heart of the trial and for the trials to see and the journalists to follow and then transcribe the details of the acts that were captured on camera by Dominique Pelicot, their violence against his own wife captured over a decade. What we're talking about, investigators say, is 200 rapes captured on those appalling videos that were recorded by Dominique Pelicot. Remember also, simply found, because he was caught one day in a supermarket trying to film up women's skirts, a particularly vigilant guard at that supermarket insisted the woman take it on to police. It was only then that police, looking through his phone and computers, found the horrors of what had been captured by Dominique Pelicot over that time. Gisele Pelicot then discovering it for herself. And again, through her courage, the courageous decision to waive her anonymity, the wider world hearing the very sordid details of what went on and what these men are now accused of, 50 of them in court here today, one of them still on the run. And I think chillingly, investigators saying that there are many other men also captured on those videos that they were simply unable to identify. So, the scale of what Gisele Pelicot has been through matched only by her extraordinary courage in being willing to speak about it. And she's been very clear about why. This is for other women to understand that, in her words, if Madame Pelicot could speak out, so then can other victims of sexual abuse -- Max.",

But he's already having a major influence on business in Washington, this time effectively tanking a bipartisan bill that would have funded the government through to mid-March, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board. In a social media post on Wednesday, Trump complained about what he called Democrat bells and whistles in the stopgap measure. And he even threatened any Republicans who backed the plan. Coincidentally or not, Elon Musk posted a similar message just hours before calling for harsh action against dissenting Republicans. But no one is drawing as much ire as House Speaker Mike Johnson, the man who helped negotiate the bipartisan bill. Republicans say he allowed too many add-ons to the deal and a warning his time as speaker may be in jeopardy. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This negotiation had happened behind closed doors for several weeks, and ultimately a deal was reached. It came out just last night.That deal, about 1,500 pages in length. It had a whole wide range of provisions, but the most significant part, it would extend government funding until mid-March to avoid a shutdown. Now, throughout the course of the day, anger began to build on the right. Republicans, particularly conservative members, said that it was a bad deal that Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, cut with Democratic leaders and cut with the White House. They pointed a number of provisions that they did not like in there. There were some politically toxic measures as well, such as raising the salary, giving a salary increase to members of Congress. But perhaps most significantly, it was Elon Musk who came out to oppose the bill very loudly, calling on members who vote for the bill to essentially lose their elections. And it wasn't just Musk. After Musk came out in his opposition, then Donald Trump himself came out opposed to the measure. He and J.D. Vance issued a scathing statement over this bill. He attacked the bill, and he also added a highly complex issue on top of it. He is now demanding that Congress raise the national debt limit, avoid the first ever debt default. That could have happened next year. He wants that done now because he doesn't want to deal with it when he's president, even though doing so is a highly complicated issue that will be very difficult to resolve in just two days.

According to court documents obtained by CNN, her parents married and divorced twice within the span of about 10 years. The documents show a complicated arrangement with Natalie moving between homes every two to three days. Ultimately, her father, Jeff, had primary custody with regular visits from her mother and they lived roughly 40 minutes apart. The documents also show that Natalie attended therapy and her parents were encouraged to join her. Neither Jeff nor Melissa Rupnow have responded to CNN's multiple requests for comment. But court family documents say at one point reported a generally positive co-parenting relationship. Police say Rupnow's parents, Jeff and Melissa, are cooperating with the investigation. According to police, Rupnow used a handgun in the attack, but it's unclear how she obtained the weapon. A Facebook photo posted by Rupnow's father in August shows her at a shooting range. A comment from her dad on the photo says they joined the range in the spring and, quote: We have been loving every second of it. She's also seen wearing a KMFDM shirt, a German industrial rock band, whose lyrics were cited by the shooters at the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 in Colorado. The band at the time condemned that horrific attack. The band's music also accompanied a TikTok post from Dylan Butler shortly before he opened fire at a school in Iowa in January, killing a sixth grader and wounding seven. Police say they're looking into Rupnow's activity online. Experts say any social media footprint left behind by Rupnow is crucial to the investigation.",

She chose that very bravely, but I think she's also touched a nerve because of the dignity with which she's done it.A great deal of humility as well. She's said over and over again, I am just a normal person. And in many ways, although she's at the center of this trial and the heart of it and the focus of so much attention, she's really insisted day after day that this isn't just about her. It's about the victims of all sexual abuse, and she's explained that that was why she'd chosen to make the trial public. In her words, she wants other victims of sexual abuse to say, if Madame Pelico could do it, could speak out, could ensure that shame was in the other camp, then I can too. So I think it is that bravery, it is the sense of what she's doing for others that has touched a nerve, and also I think the fact that this case doesn't just shine a very harsh light on these particular men and their particular acts and guilt. It also shines a light, perhaps more importantly, on societal questions. The question of how so many men could have thought it was OK to turn up at a house, find a clearly unconscious woman, do what they did, and none of them ever take that further or report it or raise alarms about what might be happening to these women. Again, these are acts that took place over nearly a decade, and the only reason the world found out was that one day Dominique Pelico was found in a supermarket trying to film up women's skirts. The contents of his phone then discovered otherwise. Gisele Pelico might not have learned of it, the world might not have learned of what was done to her, and therefore these questions might not have ever been brought to light -- Max.",
