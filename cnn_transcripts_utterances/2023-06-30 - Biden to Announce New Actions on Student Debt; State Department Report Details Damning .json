This case opens the door to more -- reigning in of that so-called administrative state as it was put in the majority opinion here. What other programs do you see as the precedent here, right, the standard set in this ruling to effect? Are we talking about potentially Medicare, Social Security? What do you think? TIM GRIFFIN, (R) ARKANSAW AG, OPPOSES BIDEN STUDENT LOAN PLAN: Well, look, we have a number of lawsuits against the administration that relate to executive orders, that relate to regulations coming out of the different agencies. And I'm not going to comment specifically on them, but you make a good point. This does continue to draw a clear line reining in the administrative state -- which I will say. As someone who was a member of Congress, who worked in the executive branch in Washington, who's held these different roles, the administrative state has been way out of control for a long time. And they've been acting in an extra constitutional way. And look, the stuff they do can be done. But it must be done by the elected officials in the United States Congress. The fact they won't do it is not a good legal reason to do it on your own. We saw this when I was a member of Congress with President Obama. There were a number of instances where his lawyers had said in the past, we can't do this legally. But when they were thwarted in the Congress they said, well, let's try it anyway. That is corrosive to the rule of law. And if people want to apply pressure to their elected representatives to get \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C\" or \"D\" passed, go do it. There's a proper process. Process matters. We saw this with some of the mask rules. We've seen it with OSHA, so I'm all for that discussion, but we're doing a disservice --",

Anything that this department could have done to prevent that from occurring.I think you'll hear folks in this building probably point the finger at the intelligence community or at the Department of Defense regarding decision making surrounding that.

That this report not only is rolled out on a Friday before a holiday weekend, but it's also being rolled out more than a year after the report itself was concluded.So they've, you know, waited more than a year to roll out these findings. They're waiting until the Friday before Fourth of July. What the senior State Department official said on that call is that they weren't going to get into process-related questions. But clearly folks in this building see that timing and they're concerned about them trying to, you know, really hide the fact that the department doesn't want all of its failures with this withdrawal really dragged through Washington and setup at a moment when Congress is in session, they might face more criticism.",

In one of those rulings the court sided with a Colorado website designer who is a Christian, who didn't want to work with same-sex couples. This is a decision that effectively limits LBGTQ rights. And Democratic Governor Jared Polis -- who himself is gay -- called it misguided.He went onto say in a statement, quote, these rulings run counter to Colorado values and we'll continue to fight against bigotry and discrimination in all their ugly forms. Joining us now CNN senior political correspondent Abby Phillip.

I think that that is really kind of splitting hairs, one would argue.And there are all kinds of things that same-sex couples -- or let's say call it interracial couples. I mean, if you're an interracial couple and someone's religious beliefs don't align with interracial marriage, could that person discriminate against an interracial couple? I think it raises -- those are questions that do not close the door to more litigation. In fact, I think this opens the door to the flood gates here. And the groups that bring these cases in some ways that's what they're going for.

All large-scale events have been banned today in response to three nights of growing unrest over the shooting death of a 17-year-old boy by police on Tuesday. Nearly 900 people were arrested during the protest last night alone. Vehicles were set on fire. Some businesses were looted as well. Public transportation right now, including buses and tramways, have been shutdown. Let's take you to the streets of Paris now with CNN's Melissa Bell. Melissa, what are you seeing there?",

We've seen really on the periphery of France's big cities in the suburbs move to the centers. This is because left-wing called these police and the justice for some protesters who'd come here to make their anger known.And this large police presence is what you're going to see all over the streets of France tonight. It is 45,000 police men and women that have been deployed, 5,000 more than last night. And what the interior minister has announced is that they're deploying armored vehicles, helicopters, mobile units to try to get to the end of this violence. From the point of view of the protesters, there is no sign of that happening anytime soon. In fact, Boris, tomorrow will be held this funeral for the young 17-year-old who was killed by a policeman Tuesday morning. That is expected to attract large crowds and there will be protests tomorrow in the very heart of Paris on the Champs- Elysees. Again, to show that people are angry. First of all that the events of Tuesday morning the police brutality that they believe has been a long-standing issue and not sufficiently addressed. But also the questions of the systemic racism that many in this country believe have underpinned those kinds of incidents over the last few years. So from the point of view of the government very heavy-handed tactics determined to get to the bottom of this. Even though the Elysees says there is no need for a state of emergency yet. They're really pulling out everything they can to try and restore order. For the time being though, Boris, there is no sense of the anger letting up at all.",

But I will stop at nothing to find other ways to deliver relief to hardworking middle-class families. My administration will continue to work to bring the promise of higher education to every American.
