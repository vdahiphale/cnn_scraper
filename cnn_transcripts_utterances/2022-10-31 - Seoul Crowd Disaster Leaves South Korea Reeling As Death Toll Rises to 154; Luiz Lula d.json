Victims from more than a dozen countries, two Americans among them. A far right rebuke in the world's fourth biggest democracy, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro beaten in his re-election runoff.And what could be a big blow to diversity at colleges. Today, the U.S. Supreme Court considers ending affirmative action. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Christine Romans. All right, the death toll is now at least 154 in South Korea's crowd surge, making it one of the country's worst ever disasters. This morning, South Korea's president and first lady laying flowers at a memorial alter in front of Seoul City Hall as the nation begins a week-long period of mourning. Senior international correspondent Ivan Watson is live for us in Seoul this morning. Ivan, are investigators making progress on finding out what sparked this crowd surge?",

I'm here just basically a few steps away from the crowded alley way, the narrow alley way where so many young victims died on Saturday night, and you can see the makeshift memorial here.There are plenty of journalists and plenty of just ordinary people who are coming to lay flowers and pause for a moment to remember young lives cut short. The Korean Ministry of Education says of the 154 victims, five were high school students, one was a middle school student. And I've spoken with some of the survivors. These are people 20 years old, 22 years old, 18 years old, who were here Saturday night for a night of partying. Joking initially at the huge crowds that were packed into the narrow alley ways around the block, around the corner from where I'm standing. And then getting increasingly panicked as they were just packed more and more in like sardines until people started falling, and then we've seen images of rescue workers trying to pull people out from underneath the weight of the crowd and struggling and failing. And that's where affixation happened en masse. Again, at least 154 people killed, the vast majority, Koreans of course, and then dozens of international foreign visitors here, many of them students. There are some photos here of two Americans, exchange students over here for semester abroad who were among the many victims of this terrible tragedy. Many people saying that there were no police or very few police present to control the thousands and thousands of partiers who were gathered. And that's all the more striking when, Christine, there's a police station barely a stone's throw away from where I'm standing right now. Christine?",

We also know from the mayor of Kyiv that 350,000 homes here in the city will be without electricity and water.Kharkiv, critical infrastructure, Zaporizhzhia region in the east center of the country there, a big hydro-electric power plant, the biggest one actually in the whole of Ukraine, has been targeted there. In the west of the country, there's been more critical infrastructure targeted. Other locations, critical infrastructure as we have seen Russia targeting. Now, Ukrainian officials say that 50 cruise missiles were fired into Ukraine. That they took down 44 of those. This has become typical of Russia recently to launch barrages of missiles and hope that some of them get through. These are the first missiles to have actually impacted the capital here in a couple of weeks. Yet to find out precisely what's been targeted. But the fact that electricity is off to some parts of the city gives a clear indication, again, critical infrastructure. And as for that grain deal, the U.N. says that despite the fact that Russia has suspended its cooperation in that deal, they plan today to allow a number of ships, about a dozen ships in and out of Ukraine, to ship that much-needed grain out. Criticism coming from the United States, from Secretary Blinken, coming from the European Unions. Foreign policy chief accusing Russia of essentially holding the world hostage over food by shutting down its cooperation. It's not clear yet what Russia is going to do with the fact that the U.N. says it's going to go -- that it's going to go ahead with the grain shipments. That's an open question. Russians so far say they're engaging with the U.N., but we don't really know what that means going forward.",
