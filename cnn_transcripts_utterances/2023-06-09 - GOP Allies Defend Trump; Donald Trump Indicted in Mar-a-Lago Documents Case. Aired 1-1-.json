She is a Trump appointee, and a higher court rebuked her for giving the former president unusually beneficial rulings in the past.And this:  CNN exclusively has obtained a transcript of a taped conversation where the former president admits he kept a classified Pentagon document about attacking Iran, and that he did not declassify that information while he was president.

Now, we still have not seen this indictment. It has not been unsealed. And Donald Trump's team still has not seen this indictment. But they did get a summary that sort of lays out what we can expect to see from the charges, laying out seven criminal charges. This is from Trump's former -- now former attorney. There's a charge under the Espionage Act. There's obstruction of justice. There's destruction or falsification of records, various conspiracies, and there is false statements. So, again, this is a broad outline of what we are expecting to see in this indictment. But we still have not heard anything from the Department of Justice. We still have not heard anything from the special counsel. And we still have not seen the indictment, which is going to put more meat on the bones of what we're seeing here from these charges. Again, this is going to be the first step in this process, getting this indictment unsealed. Trump himself said on social media, though, that he is expected to appear at a federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon.

      "sentences": "That's right. Let's set the scene here.This is this summer of 2021, several months after he left the White House. He is at his golf club in Bedminster. And he's in a meeting, several people, including a few of his aides, and two people working on an autobiography for his former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. And, at this time, he was in the habit of having his aides record conversations with journalists. So it's key. He knew he was being recorded when he said the following. Now, I also want to note, contextually, at this moment, he was very upset about a magazine article that features some quotes from General Mark Milley that suggested that Trump had wanted to attack Iran. And he says: \"Well, with Milley -- let me see. I will show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack Iran. Isn't that amazing? I have a big pile of papers.\" And our sources tell us you can hear him shuffling through papers. \"This thing just came up. Look, this was him. They presented me this. This was off the record. But they presented me this. This was him. This was the Department of Defense and him. \"We looked at some -- well, this was him. This wasn't done by me. This was done by him. So, clearly, he wants the people in the room to know this was done by him.\" But then he goes on to say all sorts of stuff, pages long: \"Look, wait a minute. Let's see here. I just found -- isn't that amazing? This totally wins my case, you know, except it is, like, highly confidential, secret. This is secret information. Look. Look at this.\" I will stop there for a second. Secret and confidential, obviously, two different levels of classification. And he's also buttressing that by saying, \"Look, look.\" It appears, based on this recording, that the former president was trying to share sensitive information with people who did not have a security clearance. But the most damning quote of all is, at the end of the tape, he asks: \"Can we declassify?\" and then sort of answers his own question, saying: \"As president, I could have declassified. But now I can't,\" an incredibly important piece of evidence for prosecutors, because it's so rare that we ever have the former president -- again, in his own words, he doesn't e-mail, he doesn't text. And, here, you have him describing what he clearly understands to be the continued possession of sensitive information, appearing to try to share it with people. Why? Because he's trying to settle some score with General Mark Milley. Now, at the end of the tape, I will note, he also just calls sort of off screen for someone to bring them some Cokes. So, incredibly, he knows he's being recorded. And he doesn't seem to really in any way grasp the gravity of this moment, or how it could potentially come back now two years later to haunt him legally.",

You have on the one hand the retention of classified documents or some form of document that is prurient and prescient -- excuse me -- that's pertinent -- excuse me -- to national security or defense-related documents. You got the idea of obstruction that is likely there, meaning you refuse to hand them over, even though you know you're not the lawful custodian. You have got the idea of possibly inducing someone to make false statements to law enforcement about the subject matter of their investigation, and, of course, conspiracy, the meeting of the minds and some overt action to try to create or harm someone or to break a law. The key witness to me in all this will also be Evan Corcoran, who, of course, was the attorney for Donald Trump, who had his attorney-client privilege pierced. That was highly unprecedented. We want our clients and our attorneys to have candid conversations, because we want them to be able to have a defense. We want them to have a fair trial, where you have a fair opportunity to get legal counsel. And so the second that was pierced, and we knew there was copious notes, apparently, taken by Evan Corcoran about whatever direction may have been given and allowed to be before a grand jury, this was really perhaps a foregone conclusion that this might happen.",

Instead, what we have here -- and you would have to prove that the person was knowing, that they were willful, and they doubled down so many times, as in to buck any notion that they did not know it was actually happening. Why that's so important, of course, is because, normally, it's so hard to find the intent of a witness, let alone a defendant or a target, because you have to go into their minds, and they're not going to be very forthcoming with you about what they want, because they know they have got this sword of Damocles.

Kristen, first to the latest development, the indictment of the Trump aide Walt Nauta. He was in Bedminster as this came out. Any word of a response from him or his own legal team to this? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Not from Walt or his legal team. But we have heard from the former president, who put out on TRUTH Social -- he praised Nauta. He said that the DOJ was trying to ruin his life, like they're trying to ruin the lives of others. But I do want to note that I have talked to several members of Trump's inner circle who are very shaken by this news. Nauta is a military man. He was -- worked with him in the White House. He was a valet. And he's been with him ever since he left office. And he is very beloved among Trump's inner circle. And so this has shaken some of them. Now, I want to talk to you about that quote that \"jacked up\" quote, because what I think is so interesting about that is that two things can be true at once. They can say that they are energized, that they think this is going to bring in money, and also be deeply concerned that this is going to impact his 2024 candidacy. And that is exactly what I am hearing from Trump's top advisers. They do believe that this is going to help with fund-raising. They do believe that this is going to help with polling, just like we saw after that Manhattan indictment. However, there is a sect of Trump advisers who are deeply concerned about this. They do not think that this is going to help long term. Maybe it will help him win the GOP nomination, rev up the base. But how does this play in a general election? We are in unprecedented times. And one thing that we have reported on is that Trump's team has really tried to broaden his base. That is one of the reasons he's been doing so much, actually, traditional campaigning. Again, he is not traditional, but they have been trying to run a traditional campaign because they want to reach other voters. Getting indicted in a federal investigation is not something that they believe is going to appeal to suburban women, something that they think that Trump will need to win, a group that he will need to win if he is going to win the 2024 election.",

They re-upped a request for information about that search on Mar-a- Lago, although they did put a little bit more meat on the bones in terms of what they were requesting in this letter. And they also revealed that Chairman Jim Jordan had a transcribed interview with a former FBI official which Jordan says raises new questions about that search on Mar-a-Lago. I want to read you part of that letter. They wrote: \"Additional information recently obtained by the committee about the department's execution of a search warrant on President Trump's residence only reinforces our grave concerns that your reported actions are nothing more than a politically motivated prosecution.\" But, Jim, it is worth pointing out here the split screen between House Republican leaders and Senate Republican leaders in terms of how they're responding. Speaker Kevin McCarthy yesterday was very quick to put out a statement calling these charges unconscionable, saying it is a sad day for America, and also vowing accountability for the DOJ, whether that's in the form of potentially investigating the investigators or even targeting the DOJ in the upcoming spending season. But over on the Senate side, Mitch McConnell and John Thune, the number one and number two Senate Republicans, have been silent. And we are actually not expecting to hear from them, at least until we see the indictment next week. But there have been two notable GOP Senate voices we have heard from supporting former President Donald Trump. That includes John Barrasso, a member of the leadership team, as well as Steve Daines. He's the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm. Of course, he wants Trump on his side, not working against him, when he tries to take back the Senate next year. So that's, I'm sure, part of the motivation there as well. But this divide between the House and Senate GOP in terms of reacting to this news really speaks to the broader divide in the GOP over the former president and whether he should be their nominee, which is likely only going to go deeper in the weeks and months ahead, Jim.",
