Former President Donald Trump is meeting with congressional Republicans up on Capitol Hill, marking a truly stunning comeback in American politics. Moments ago, the former president arrived at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, right by the Capitol. Today, he will be trailed by a mobile billboard from the DNC playing this 11-minute video on loop of the January 6th attack. Today's visit is apparently the first time Trump has stepped foot on the Hill since sending a mob of his supporters to fight like hell, as he said it, on January 6th. Here's how Republican lawmakers reacted in the immediate aftermath of that assault on democracy. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA):  The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  All I can say, count me out. Enough is enough. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Today, they're welcoming back to Washington with open arms, despite the fact that he put their lives in jeopardy when he refused to call off the mob as his supporters stormed the Capitol, hunted for lawmakers and erected gallows. If you think that political violence is all in the past record, recall just yesterday, as we reported on this program, his campaign called to, quote, haul out the guillotine, in a fundraising email.CNN's Kristen Holmes and Lauren Fox are standing by up on Capitol Hill.

I mean, it's significant for the number of reasons that you laid out, but I will remind you that despite the fact that these lawmakers said that after January 6th, they have long come around to Donald Trump, or at least most of them, the Republican Party really rallying around their nominee, despite what happened on January 6th.And this is significant for a number of reasons, because this is really the first time he has met with a group, a big group of lawmakers like this since he became the presumptive nominee and also since he became a convicted felon. And when talking to Trump's team, they really want this to be about, quote/unquote, unity, getting the party in line behind Donald Trump and really getting the messaging in sync before what is expected to be several very contentious months ahead of November. Now, the way that Donald Trump's team laid it out to us was that he was going to present his plan to beat Joe Biden in November, as well as talk about a potential 2025 agenda, give lawmakers an idea of how they could help him really lay the table ahead of the November election if Donald Trump is in case to win. But I know Lareun will talk about this more. Instead, at least the first meeting, which is just with House Republicans, seems to have devolved somewhat into a chaotic pep rally. Our Hill reporters kind of really giving us a line by line of what's coming out of there. Not so much agenda, but a lot of back and forth from Donald Trump.",

He's kind of all over the map. He brought up the fact that he really wants to pass a no tax on tips bill. That is something that he's been touting on the campaign trail, something that he brought up inside the room just a few minutes ago. He's also, you know, really laying out some of his frustration with his enemies, including the Justice Department, including Republican strategists he doesn't like.

It has to do with Mifepristone, one of two drugs used in chemical abortion. And here, the Supreme Court has decided to just toss the case entirely, arguing that the group that brought this case that was challenging broader access to Mifepristone did not have what is called standing, which is the right to bring this lawsuit.So, this was considered one of the biggest cases that the justices were reviewing this term, potentially for the impact that any decision that would have restricted access to this drug could have had obviously on people across the country, but also potentially on the election. But here, the justices, they have decided that the group that brought it, they do not have the right to do so, so they have tossed it entirely. The question they were looking at here is whether the FDA overstepped its authority in approving broader access to Mifepristone. As I said, Mifepristone is one of two drugs used in chemical abortion, which is the most widely used form of abortion in the United States. There are two drugs, Mifepristone and the Misoprostol. They are prescribed often to implement a chemical abortion. So, this was obviously a hot button issue, something that could have enormous consequences. But here the Supreme Court has decided to toss the case entirely, saying that the group that brought it just didn't have standing. So we're waiting. There are other opinions this morning. We're watching and waiting to see what those are. Jim?",

The Supreme Court has not really ruled one way or another on Mifepristone, but on this particular challenge, they have said that they're just tossing the case. They are not going to rule one way or another on the FDA's authority generally or on this drug. But they're saying, look, the group that brought this case, they don't have standing. So, they are tossing this case, arguably sidestepping the issue for now, but I would fully expect that a similar challenge could come back to the court in a different form, potentially with someone who does have standing, and then they may or may not opt to weigh in on the bigger question of broader, more easy access to Mifepristone. ACOSTAAnd I want to go to Meg Tirrell. She's also with me now. Meg put this in perspective for us.

It accounted for 63 percent of abortions in the most recent year's worth of data from the Guttmacher Institute. There were more than a million abortions in 2023, so that's more than 600,000 people who accessed abortion using these medications.As Paula said, though, you know, we've heard from a lot of folks in this space who are watching this case very closely that it's not the end of this question. We are expecting potentially to see these questions come back. The fact that this is tossed out on standing, this is not going to be the end of the road for the questions around access to Mifepristone. But certainly there were concerns that a ruling against the FDA in this case would roll back access to Mifepristone, to make it more difficult to get, especially through telemedicine, which has become an increasingly common way that people access medication abortion in the United States as more and more restrictions are put into place in different states. There were also threats to the pharmaceutical industry and to the FDA's purview. Those aren't necessarily going away this case does come back and then is heard differently on the merits, but there were major concerns that overturning an FDA judgment through the courts would threaten the way FDA regulates medicines, would threaten the pharmaceutical industry's ability to depend on the FDA as the key regulator of medicines, Jim.",

There are really two drugs that are used in combination for a medical abortion. Mifepristone and Misoprostol, when used together, are very effective and very safe for the termination of a pregnancy, and the FDA has approved the use of, of this combination of drugs for patients with -- people with pregnancies, less than less than ten weeks of gestation. As Meg has said, it's really become the predominant means of terminating a pregnancy in the United States.

What the plaintiffs were trying to do here was roll back a series of expansions in access to Mifepristone that were passed in 2016 and then 2021. And the Supreme Court has left the status quo in place.The basis for their ruling, and I should note, Jim, this is actually a unanimous ruling. It was written by Justice Kavanaugh. There's one concurring opinion, but all nine justices agreed that the plaintiffs, the people who were suing here to try to roll back access to Mifepristone did not have what we call standing. And the basic way to explain standing is, do you have a dog in this fight? What's it to you, the plaintiff? Do you have some actual injury? The group that brought this lawsuit was a group of doctors, medical practitioners, who objected to Mifepristone. However, they have the right under law, various law, to declined to prescribe Mifepristone. So, they tried to argue, well, but we might have to treat women who use Mifepristone and then have secondary complications. And the Supreme Court said that's not enough. That's not a direct enough injury. Therefore, you don't have standing. Therefore, you lose, 9-0.",

We recognize that many citizens, including the plaintiff doctors here, have sincere concerns about and objections to others using Mifepristone and obtaining abortions, but citizens and doctors do not have standing to sue simply because others are allowed to engage in certain activities. I mean, I think, Elie, that's what your point was.And Dr. Pernell, you're with us as well. Your reaction to the practical impact of all this. DR. CHRIS T. PERNELL, REGENT-AT-LARGE, AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE:  It means that reproductive justice has prevailed, health equity has prevailed, access to care has prevailed. And what do I mean by that? What we know is that the majority of patients who need abortion care are receiving care via this prescription pill. But what's more important, it's saying that you don't need to be in person. You can get this prescription via telehealth or telemedicine. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants and even midwives can prescribe the position to those who are in need of the care. And that's fundamentally important because we know and believe that health and health care is a human and civil right.

This, which is used, as we were talking about, by more than half the women who want to terminate pregnancies in this country, if this were thrown out, I mean, the Democrats would obviously use it. But what would women across the country do? Would they be forced to flee the country? What would, what would the ramifications of this be? I think that's something the Supreme Court was obviously considering.But it seems to me that this may not be the end of it, because the court -- according to what you just got here from Kavanaugh, the court said it is not clear that no one else would have the standing to challenge the FDA's relaxed regulation of Mifepristone. So, what they're saying is, okay, you folks didn't have the standing because you can't prove that you personally were damaged by the use of Mifepristone. But in the future, I think the door was left open a little bit. Now, I'm not a legal expert here So you got to ask your legal experts? But that didn't seem slammed shut to me.",

But, yes, very important aspect of this opinion. The Supreme Court does not actually reach or address the underlying question, which is, did the FDA properly approve and then expand access to Mifepristone? They don't even get there. They just say the people who brought this are the wrong people to bring this. You're the wrong plaintiffs. Case dismissed, 9-0. So, it could come back, but that will take a long time.

I was looking at -- there's a New York Times animation this morning showing how much more women are traveling out of their states to other states in order to have this procedure performed.And so, obviously, this is going to provide a tremendous sigh of relief to a lot of women across this country that they can at least still rely on Mifepristone on abortion medication.

So, this type of ruling could disproportionately impact the African-American and black community. We know that within that 56 percent, three states are where most of the black women live, Florida, Georgia and Texas. So, any opportunity to continue to assert reproductive freedom, reproductive justice is not only in the best interest of black and African-American women, but in the best interest of all those identifying as women and birthing people.

Now, we still have several dozen outstanding opinions as of this morning, so it's significant that this Mifepristone case came now, because, of course, they didn't really do anything. They didn't make any new law. They didn't really issue a decision. They just decided to toss it out because the group that brought this case didn't have standing.So, this is relatively early when it comes to when the Supreme Court releases their most significant and impactful decisions. We still have several weeks and there is another case. It is a case based in Idaho. And it has to deal with when you have state restrictions on abortion, how those can bump up against federal law. Specifically in that case, the Justice Department argued that federal law should trump state law, especially when state laws restrict a doctor's abilities to conduct abortions. In that case, specifically, it's dealing with emergency room care, and whether you can perform an abortion to stabilize a patient or whether you have to wait until a life is clearly in danger. That is another case that hasn't been decided yet. And even though we are, of course, watching for the major cases related to former President Trump, his possible immunity, January 6th prosecutions, I would say that what they decide in that next case, if instead of tossing it like they did there, if they actually issue a decision, whatever happens there, Jim, it could actually have potentially a bigger impact on the November election than any of the Trump related cases. So, even though this is one big abortion question before the justices, they have sort of sidestepped it, saying the people didn't have standing. We still have another abortion case outstanding.

So, this was really not a case brought with concerns about the safety of the drug or whether the FDA correctly approved the drug or appropriately changed how the drug could be prescribed.

And these are very sad, upsetting situations, often with wanted pregnancies. But if there is not that care delivered in that emergency setting, that could threaten organs, the future health of the pregnant person.So, that is what that case concerns. And a lot of people are really looking forward to hearing what the outcome is. We have already seen an impact in Idaho on the medical care system from its abortion ban. We've seen doctors leaving that state. We've seen patients who are pregnant. The doctors advising them on their first prenatal visit to buy life flight insurance so that they can be helicoptered or flown out of state if they have an emergency that requires abortion care, because things have gotten so confusing for doctors are so scary for doctors in that state, not knowing exactly what kind of care they can provide.
