Joining us now is the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, who's in Michigan campaigning for the Republican ticket on his American Revival tour. Speaker Johnson, thanks for joining us. Let's start with Israel. You spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday. The U.S. is right now investigating a leak of highly classified intelligence documents posted online that appear to show Israeli plans for a retaliatory strike against Iran. What's the latest on the investigation into this leak, and what did your conversation with Netanyahu go like? How did that go? REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  Yes, the leak is very concerning. There's some serious allegations being made there, investigation under way, and I will get a briefing on that in a couple of hours. There's a classified-level briefing and then other, but we're following it closely. Look, I talked to my friend Bibi, Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, to encourage him. I mean, he's done an extraordinary job, I think, prosecuting that war, and if he had taken Joe Biden's advice, they'd be in a much weaker position right now. I think that the United States needs to stand unequivocally by our ally there right now. There is -- really, we're on a precipice, I think, Jake, of a new era of security and freedom for Israel. And I think we're very close, I hope, I pray, to ending that conflict there. But we cannot equivocate. We can't appease Iran. Now is the time for a maximum pressure campaign against the head of the snake. It's not Hezbollah and Hamas and the proxies that are ultimately the threat. It is Iran itself, and I think we need to recognize that right -- reality right now.",

And I think that's what the Biden/Harris administration has tried to do at too many points along the way. They have withheld weapons systems, when Congress in a bipartisan manner duly enacted that these things would be supplied. And I have had many very serious, deep conversations with administration officials over the previous months, urging them to do what Congress has voted to do. And I think, in many ways, they have kind of empowered Iran. I mean, look, President Trump is right when he says on the campaign trail that none of this happened under his watch. It didn't because we did not empower it. The Biden/Harris policies did. They relaxed sanctions on Iran, which allowed them to have the resources and the time and the opportunity to do what happened on October 7, more than a year ago, that great atrocity, and to continue all of this. So, look, we need to stand by Israel. This is a good-versus-evil conflict. It's not even close. Israel is a state. It is the most stable democracy in the Middle East. And Iran is a terrorist regime. And it works through terrorist organizations to do great harm to our allies and, ultimately, what they hope to do is to us. And that's a real threat to us right now as well.",

I mean no one. And that's why Kamala Harris herself avoids the question. Look, I have been traveling the country nonstop, Jake. I have been in over 230 cities and 40 states right now. And I'm spending this -- these final closing weeks in the swing states, in blue states, in toss-up districts for the House. I'm absolutely convinced -- there's an energy out there right now. I'm convinced that we are going to win the White House, the Senate, and the House. And we're going to have a very aggressive agenda to get the economy going again, to help everyone. Look, everywhere I go, Jake, everybody has the same concerns. They're fed up and they're fired up about the cost of living that's unaffordable now and the rising crime rates everywhere and the weakness on the world stage and the wide-open border. And they know that Kamala Harris is responsible for those things. And they know that President Trump is offering alternatives. So, put the rhetoric aside. Look at the record of these two candidates.

I wonder how Trump's remarks, not just the one about Arnold Palmer on his -- quote -- \"manhood,\" but everything we have heard from Trump this week, how it fits in with the analysis that \"The New York Times\" offered a few days ago. They looked at his speeches from 2015 and 2016 and looked at his speeches today and said -- quote -- \"With the passage of time, the 78- year-old former president's speeches have grown darker, harsher, longer, angrier, less focused, more profane, and increasingly fixated on the past.\" I know you want to talk about policy, and I respect that. But the reason that Donald Trump is not up 10 points is because of comments like that one, where people do have concerns about his fitness, his acuity, and his stability.

The only person that they fear less, our enemies abroad, the only person they fear less than Joe Biden is Kamala Harris. At the end of the day, when you go into the ballot box, I would just encourage everybody, ask yourself quietly, are you comfortable with Kamala Harris being the commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces at the most dangerous moment since World War II? She could not handle that. Our enemies would have an opportunity there. And people think about those things. And that's why they're going to vote for Donald Trump.",

I remain Jake Tapper.Tomorrow, Kamala Harris will make her case to a key group of voters, Republicans who are reluctant to vote for Trump, when she campaigns alongside former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the blue wall states of Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Joining us now is a senator on the other side of the aisle from Cheney who has been campaigning for Harris, independent Senator Bernie Sanders from the great state of Vermont. Senator, thanks so much for joining us. What does it say that Kamala Harris is starting this week, with only 16 days left, campaigning with Liz Cheney, a very conservative former congresswoman, daughter of Dick Cheney, obviously, but she has not yet held a public campaign event with you, arguably the leader of the progressive movement in the United States? SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT):  Well, first thought, what I think it says is that what the vice president understands is that there are millions of people really disgusted with Trump's constant lying, with his attempt to prevent the first peaceful transition of power, his undermining of American democracy. And that's what she's talking about. Also, last night, Jake, you may have noticed Trump held a rally, and the big issue that he talked about -- and please forgive me if I mention this on television -- was apparently the size of Arnold Palmer's penis. That was the major issue that he discussed, and also referred to the vice president of the United States as an S-H-I-T. So I think you have got a lot of Americans, whether you are conservative, whether you're progressive or moderate, who say, really? We have major issues facing this country. Is this the kind of human being that we want as president of the United States? And there is a reason why Trump's own vice president, Mike Pence, terribly conservative, says he's not voting for Donald Trump. There is a reason why Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate, not voting for Donald Trump. So I think what Kamala is trying to do now is make it clear that, above and beyond issues -- and, obviously, Liz Cheney and I disagree on everything on the issues -- there are reasons to vote against Trump.",

Its major goal is to make billions in profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies, and we end up spending twice as much per capita on health care of the people of any other country, while 87 million are uninsured or underinsured. I think it's a broken system. I think we have to expand Medicare to cover every man woman and child. I happen to believe that -- unlike Donald Trump, who thinks that climate change is a hoax, I happen to believe that it is very, very real. And unless we lead the world away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy, I worry very, very much about the kind of planet that our kids and grandchildren will inherit. Those are my views. That's what I campaign on in Vermont and what I have campaigned on nationally. Bottom line is, we need to move toward a government and an economy which works for all people, not tax breaks to billionaires and not being influenced by the big money that politicians -- that the billionaires are now putting into the political process. One of the things, Jake, that we are not talking about, which I know, whether you're a Republican, Democrat, independent, people are really worried that you're seeing a handful of billionaires put huge amounts of money into the political process.

Crazy. Despite the total lack of any verifiable evidence from this random anonymous Twitter account making this claim, the post racked up millions of views on X. And then it got even worse.
