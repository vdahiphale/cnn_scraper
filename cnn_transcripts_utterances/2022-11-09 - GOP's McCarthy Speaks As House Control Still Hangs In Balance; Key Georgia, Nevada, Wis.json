Thought that they'd have many more gains than they did. But he's touting gains. He says in New York, the DCC chair Sean Patrick Maloney said that they have historic wins in New York, Florida and in Iowa, as well as saying that they're going to take back the House and that by tomorrow are coming soon, that Nancy Pelosi, the current speaker of the House, he believes will be in the minority.But clearly, as I turned to John Berman here who is at the magic wall, he is like a coach trying to put a good face on basically what they thought would be a good way and getting ahead of it. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: So two important things. Number one, he's ahead of himself, we have not projected yet that republicans will take control. Number two, if they do, and they might.",

      "sentences": "It is by much smaller of a margin than Kevin McCarthy hope. Let me just show you. This is what you're seeing right here is where republicans are currently ahead. You can see, yes, this would give them control of the U.S. House of Representatives but barely done just by a few seats. This is where the races that we've called. Among the races that we call, they hold a bigger lead. But again, there are still a lot of races out there.And if you look at the competitive seats, these are the seats that CNN with inside elections considers to be either toss ups or tilting one way. Republicans need to win 30 of these to take control. Right now they're ahead or called and only 33. So again, 30 is their magic number. They're at 33. So barely, barely where they need to be. And I want to also just point out a few other things he said worries ahead of himself. Let's go to New York. He said for instance. Well, first of all, in New York, there are 10 competitive seats, right? You can see republicans do lead in eight of the seats, democrats and two. This would be a very disappointing night for democrats in the state of New York. Two years ago within these boundaries, democrats would have held eight of these seats, republicans just two. So you can see why republicans feel good about New York. He particularly pointed out the district held by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Sean Patrick Maloney. He is trailing in his race right now. We have not called this race. There is still a fair amount of vote left to be counted there, including in the most democratic county in this district, Westchester County, still more than 25 percent of the vote. He's got a smaller lead there than he should. This is a democrat plus 27th district right now, he's only leading by a little but it's possible that he does pick up some votes there. A couple other states I want to point out to you here, again, why democrats might feel better about certain things. Let's look at Michigan right now. Again there are four competitive seats here. Democrats lead in two. Republicans lead in two. Two years ago this would have been three to one. So let's actually focus in on one of these races that we have been watching. This is Elissa Slotkin's district. Actually, this is a disappointment for Democrats if this holds. This is a district the democrats fought very hard for. Liz Cheney actually went out to Michigan and campaign for Elissa Slotkin. You can see that she's trailing right now. Let's see where the remaining vote might be. Lansing, which is a highly democratic area, only 68 percent. This is a -- this is a county where democrats hold a wide margin. So there is vote to be made up by Elissa Slotkin there, but right now she is trailing. We can look at some other states on the map here. Pennsylvania. What's interesting about Pennsylvania is that we've called the senate race there for John Fetterman already. In the house, you can see four competitive districts, democrats leading in all four. Two years ago, they only would have led in three. One of these districts right here. We'll look up here is a district held by an incumbent Matt Cartwright. This is a -- actually a republican plus three district right now. And Mark -- Matt Cartwright is holding a lead. So democrats outperforming in some places that Republicans had hoped to make gains, Don.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, going into the night McCarthy's people, his team set a bar. That bar was a 20-seat gain because they believe that if they were to clear picking up 20 seats that would give them a comfortable governing majority. And the lesson that would be problematic, potentially for Speaker McCarthy because that would empower the right flank of the conference, often folks who do not listen to leadership and often folks who have their own ideas about exactly what to do.It would empower that element of the Republican conference. What we are seeing here tonight is a very likelihood that the republicans will not meet that goal of achieving a 20-seat gain. Never mind what McCarthy had hoped for last year which was a 60-seat gain. Things had changed post Dobbs, but even so, even though the post the decision over abortion, republicans were still optimistic that coming into today, they could get that a majority of more than 20 seats. Right now, as John pointed out to you, Don, that path seems uncertain. If the republicans do take back the House and they are still likely to do so given the amount of territory that are playing in, it could very well be a very narrow majority. So, not only could that give problems for McCarthy in trying to pass an agenda, but also trying to just lock down this votes to become speaker. And that's one of the things he's going to beginning -- begin tomorrow, Don, is to actually call members, ask for their votes. Ensure he has the votes, become speaker, he almost certainly does have that. But republicans, even though they may not have the bigger majority, as they may ultimately have, they will still have subpoena power and the ability to set the agenda.",

Let me just quickly take you through all these states to see where we are right now.In Nevada, we only have 62 percent in. Catherine Cortez Masto. The incumbent democrat there is holding on to a small lead but we need to wait for more vote to come in. In Arizona the incumbent Mark Kelly is holding a lead there, it looks big.

Now let's look at what's still out there. 154 of the 159 counties there in Georgia have completed their counts. If we're looking at a precinct, that number of the total 207 -- 2723 precincts. We've got 2711 that are complete. So we've got the numbers there. As we look at turnout overall for this. We've got nearly four million, exactly, I'm updating the website from the secretary of state's office while we're talking here. 3,922,847 ballots cast. Turnout but 56.4 percent. If we look at the pre-election number of how many votes were cast before Election Day, that 2.5 million, that means that almost 65 percent of the votes overall were cast before Election Day as it relates to any questions of voter integrity questions or issues with the count. Things are moving very smoothly there.

That Georgia will not be decided. The four races you see on yellow on the map right now are the races that we have not called in the U.S. senate.Remember, democrats need to get to 50 to maintain control because Kamala Harris, the vice president would break a tie. Republicans need to get to 51 if they want to control. So let's see what happens if things go a certain way here. All right? We can play a little game. In Wisconsin, you just showed Ron Johnson leading there, that gets republicans to 49. You have three races left here. In Nevada, you just had the democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto ahead. But let's say that the republicans are able to win this. OK? That gets them to 50. Right? Arizona then becomes crucial. If it goes democratic, then this runoff right here determines whether or not democrats maintain control. If republicans were to win this, that would mean the runoff would matter. If democrats were to control or win both in Arizona and Nevada, it means the runoff would not matter in terms of control.

Now look, this is not a big county. I can show you two years ago in the presidential race. You're dealing with, you know, 25,000 votes, but those votes add up.

More than 70 percent of Nevadans live in this county.Washoe which John was just mentioning has about 20 percent. So between those two counties 90 percent of Nevadans live. So these votes are critically important. So, right.  There's a lot of counties haven't reported yet. But all together, those 15 counties comprise less than 10 percent of the vote. So these are the two key counties. So we are at the election center in Clark County. A short time ago, there were dozens of workers out here processing the votes. They have gone home for the night. They come back early in the morning, but back in the corner there, that secret corner. It's not really a secret but we have to stay far away from it. That's the tabulation center. And right now workers are there tabulating the votes that came in today. Now you may think it sounds like things have been kind of slow here because the polls have been closed for 4-1/2 hours. [02:30:03] These workers are working very well. It's not slow. There's a tradition here in Nevada, in this relatively small state -- I mean, it's not small anymore, it's 3.1 million people. Just to give you an idea, which is pretty amazing, after World War II, there are 150,000 people lived in the state. This state has increase by 20 times since World War II. It's increased -- it's doubled in the last 25 years. So, the population keeps growing. But anyway, it still has a small state mentality. And they have a tradition here, they wait for all 17 counties to process their votes before they put it on the state list. So, that slows it down a little bit. Also, what slowed it down today, is when you come to Vegas, you're expecting great weather, sun and maybe a little chilly, it may be very hot in the summer but it's usually sunnier in the desert. Torrential rain today and winds, tropical storm force winds. And then in Reno, Washoe county in the north, it was snowing today. So, the weather was very bad. Nevertheless, we are being told by officials here in Nevada that people really turn out big numbers. The key though is the mail-in balloting. That will be the number one way to get votes here.

But what it is isn't keeping with what we have seen over recent weeks and months from North Korea. Certainly, last week was a particular -- particularly busy week towards the end of the week. We saw a flurry of launches from North Korea.Now, we have been hearing from Pyongyang that the reason it's carrying such a great amount of these launches out because of what it calls the open provocation of the U.S. and South Korean military drills. The U.S. and South Korea were carrying out military drills last week. We know that this week, South Korea is carrying out unilateral military drills. And this is really the reasoning that Pyongyang has been giving for carrying out quite so many launches. Now, there was also a significant launch, we understand from the South Korean military at least, last Thursday. It was a presumed failed launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Now, this is the kind of missile that North Korea claims can reach mainland United States. But we understand it only had a maximum altitude of less than 2,000 kilometers according to the assessment. So, that particularly one was deemed to be a failure. Something which North Korea has not publicly acknowledged to its people that very rarely does. Now, we have not heard about today's launch from North Korea. At this point, we expect that probably within the coming hours if it does in fact admit to this launch. It hasn't been admitting to them all this year. But this year has been a record when it comes to the sheer number of missile launches that North Korea has carried out. Never in its history has it carried out quite so many. This is the 32nd day of this year that it's carried out a missile launch. Rosemary.",
