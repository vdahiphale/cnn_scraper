I'm Kasie Hunt.President Joe Biden is expected to vent his \"frustrations\" in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. It's going to be the first conversation between the two leaders since seven aid workers from chef Jose Andres' World Central Kitchen were killed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. The president condemned the attack earlier this week. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterating his message in the briefing room yesterday. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  He's outraged. He's heartbroken. And we also laid out what we want to see and the conversations that we have been having. But it also lifts up the importance of having that hostage deal -- getting that done. Getting to a ceasefire. Getting that humanitarian aid. Making sure that those hostages come home to their loved ones. So there's a lot of work to be done. We're going to continue to do that work. But I think that statement made it loud and clear -- made it loud and clear where the president stands. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Akayla, let me start with you and I want to kind of dig into the way that Chef Jose Andres has been speaking about what happened to his people in public and how this really has driven a new level of outrage here among, particularly, the president's base -- progressive voters, young people -- about what happened.

He's called them a direct attack on aid workers. And I think Biden, particularly, has been more critical and more outspoken, saying this is one of the worst conflicts in recent history for aid workers. So I certainly expect him to drive home that point, and also some of the things he talked about with Jose Andres in that call with Netanyahu.But I think the thing that's still looming behind the scenes is the U.S. is still facilitating conversations --backdoor conversations about the hostage deal, really trying to get that done and working with Qatar to do that as well. So there's obviously a very complicated relationship here and I think we're seeing them more publicly being critical. But for so many young voters, for Arab-Americans, for Muslim-Americans it feels a little bit too late for people who are still frustrated as we saw with that meeting earlier this week with that group.",

The Foreign Assistance Act, right, says that if humanitarian aid from the U.S. is being imperiled that aid then has to be revoked or conditioned. And so, he's saying he's also interested in Congress potentially blocking future arms transfers and weapons transfers. But he's saying the Biden administration already has the authority to sort of reevaluate that relationship with Israel.

The motion was a final Hail Mary by the presumptive Republican nominee to try to further delay his trials until after the election. Trump tried to argue the delay was justified as the Supreme Court has yet to hear Trump's lawyers' arguments for presidential immunity. That hearing is set to take place later this month.The judge, Juan Merchan, who just last week expanded the gag order against Trump, argued he'd had ample time to bring this issue up earlier and that \"The circumstances, viewed as a whole, test this Court's credulity.\" Now, while the trial in New York is full steam ahead, the Florida classified documents case is less so. In a filing late Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith blasted Judge Aileen Cannon for her handling of the case. He says the judge's decision and tactics are ultimately stalling. Here's the former White House lawyer -- the Trump White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "All right, joining us now, CNN legal analyst and criminal defense attorney Joey Jackson. Joey, good morning. Wonderful to see you.Let's start there with what Ty Cobb had to say about Aileen Cannon because this is increasingly becoming part of the conversation in terms of how she is handling this. This filing from Jack Smith was really a remarkable one. We don't hear a lot from him and this really -- it took me by surprise. Can you -- can you help us understand -- I mean, what stood out to you in the filing, and what do you think happens next with Judge Cannon? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, Kasie. Good morning to you. I think what stood out most was really a sense of frustration and a sense of impatience. You know, judges have a myriad of decisions to make but when those decisions are questionable and when, in the past, she certainly, as it relates to Mr. Trump, shown a willingness to really intervene on his behalf and to make decisions dating back to 2022 in terms of whether the Mar-a-Lago search was appropriate. Certainly, the appellate division thought so and overturned her. In terms of 2023 and whether the appointment of a special master to delay the FBI's reviewing of special documents should happen and the 11th Circuit overturning her again. I think what happens is the special counsel is saying enough. And certainly, as a lawyer, that has to be done in a certain way -- a professional way. In a way that makes your point without yelling and screaming about it, which the special counsel essentially did. So here you have, Kasie, briefly, a situation where the judge is saying listen, I want two sets of jury instructions. Both those jury instructions really relating to irrelevant issues. The issue in this case is not about the Presidential Records Act, right -- which really, essentially, presidential records are public. They're not personal. So when you have a decision where the judge is saying submit jury instructions that would demonstrate or at least suggest that these were the personal property -- 32 classified documents of the president -- it's frustrating, especially since it's not a case about that. The Presidential Records Act referring to when you're president. This is two years later. This is about the Espionage Act. And so, I think the special counsel said enough. In terms of what could happen in the future, I think as Ty Cobb noted, you could see a recusal motion being submitted to have her off the case. But even that, Kasie, is problematic because guess what? It leads to delay, and that's exactly what the Trump team wants, needs, and may very well get -- and is getting, in fact.",

What are those? Those are motions that are previous to trial that really you alert the court that you're making certain -- you want the court to make certain motions predicated -- decisions, excuse me, predicated upon arguments you're making. That motion schedule was set last year. The motion submitted several months ago. The motion heard, right, a couple of months ago. And so, the fact is that if you were serious about filing a motion about immunity you would have made it or could have suggested it earlier. So it seems obvious to the court that this is another delay tactic. And so, I think the court is not entertaining it. And I think the judge has delayed the trial already giving three weeks from the earlier March 25 date in which the case was going to go forward, to say that's it. And so, I think what we'll see when the case comes forward on April 15 is the selection of the jury, the moving to trial, and the adjudication, in this case, of guilt or innocence of the former President of the United States. So my view is anything could happen but it certainly looks likely that this case is getting tried before a jury, and that trial is going to happen at some point very soon -- a couple of weeks.",
