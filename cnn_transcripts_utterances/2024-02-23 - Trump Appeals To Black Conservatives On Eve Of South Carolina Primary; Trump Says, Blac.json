There's a New York Times article not too long ago, poll, that showed that Donald Trump's polling at 22 percent with black male voters, well, black voters. And that set off alarms, obviously, within the party.But here is what I am seeing. I've met with the party. We sort of had a debrief about what lessons learned from 2020. I was in the war room and we were bleeding black male voters 30 days out from the election. Part of what we saw then I don't think the party is quite yet ready to confront in any sort of robust way. I mean, the strategy is quite antiquated. They're putting $25 million on television in these ads with the president sitting down having dinner. That's an antiquated strategy. The issue really is that disinformation is disproportionately targeted to black voters as well as youth voters. And that's what we saw dating all the way back to the 2016 election. U.S. intelligence agencies are saying it's going to only get worse this cycle. A.I. is only going to compound the situation with these deep fakes. So, the concern is that the party -- for me, is that the party's not really ready to deal with this issue. You can try to address it on the margins with these types of these dinners and ads and $25 million on television. But the reality is the problem is in our feeds.

And to offend and upset group that supported you back in 2020, especially young people, I mean, you know, I've been saying this month that he's going to cost himself the election. He's going to -- you know, if Trump has any chance, it's the decision that he's made to embrace slaughter, carpet bombing, babies in incubators dead because they cut off the electricity, on and on and on. And this is -- and I think Joe Biden somewhere confused the fact that, of course, the majority of Americans will do anything to protect our Jewish brothers and sisters, no matter where they're at. And I would say a majority of Americans support Israel. And I would say practically all of us want those hostages released right now. So, he somehow conflated that with Bibi Netanyahu is some friend of mine, I'm here for you, I'm going to fly on the plane right away, come over there, give you a big hug, give you the thumbs up, do what you got to do, and it has caused a slaughter like nothing that we have seen, and its --",

You know, people in other countries, I think they know they think we're a nation of gun nuts, but the truth is we are not. It's just a few, and it's a real small percentage that own majority of those guns. So, what Wayne and his people did for so many years was to make sure every time there was a school shooting, a Sandy Hook, Parkland, whatever, that they came right out and doubled and tripled down in their support of you being able to carry any weapon you want anywhere. And I'm telling you, those days are over. It's only a matter of time. And I think myself and others who are continuing to work on this issue are going to see good results in the years ahead. There's -- let me add something to it. The way you began the show tonight with Trump's comments tonight, about Biden being a racist, I just want to point out, especially to younger people who might be listening to this, in 1973, the Justice Department brought charges against Fred Trump, Trump's father, and Trump himself, who was 26, 27 years old at the time, working for his dad. His Dad was getting ready to turn the business over. The Trump family owned thousands of apartments in New York City. The Justice Department focused on 3,700 apartments, they took one swath of Brooklyn or Queens or wherever it was, and they discovered that of the 3,700 apartment in Brooklyn and Queens, only seven black families did they rent an apartment to, 7 out of 3,700. Now, how did they figure out, how to do that? Because the people in their office, when you went there to rent an apartment in New York City, if you were black, they'd let you fill out the form and when they left, the person in the office put a big C on top standing for a term that they used to use for black Americans. And that's how they were able to know, don't rent to this family. How the seven got through, the seven families that did get an apartment, you know, my feeling has always been their name must have been, you, know Pitney Van Buren (ph) or something where the Trump family just said, oh, no, they're not, they are not a solid name like that, a good German name, a good British name. Now, they got away with this. And they had been this way the entire time. They are the O.G.s of a modern New York City style of racism that you can go all the way back into Trump's years. I'm so glad that you brought part of your show of this.",

Just as a data point, President Biden has done fewer news conferences than his predecessors at this point in his presidency. Should that change? Should he be doing more?",
