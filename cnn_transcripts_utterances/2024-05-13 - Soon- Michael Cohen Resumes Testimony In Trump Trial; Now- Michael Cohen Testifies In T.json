The jury just exited the courtroom without looking at Trump. They were just listening to Michael Cohen's testify -- Michael Cohen testified under penalty of perjury about that recorded phone call between the former Trump fixer and his former boss Donald Trump. Cohen explaining why he advised the former president against using cash to buy the silence of women peddling stories about sexual encounters with Trump.I want to bring in Anthony Scaramucci. He briefly served as White House Communications Director in the Trump administration. Anthony, good to see you. So, Cohen has long said that Trump didn't direct people to do anything. He spoke in code. Examples, like handle it or make sure it doesn't get released. Is that what you experienced working for Trump?",

And I think he and the prosecutors built a good foundation of that today before the jury. And so, I think the facts that Michael are laying out are irrefutable. And, you know, listen, it's -- again, Mr. Trump is entitled to innocence until that jury says he's guilty. But the facts are there, Anderson. It'll be I think, very easy to conclude what happened. And so -- you know, and Michael told a very good story today.And I think, Michael's a compelling guy. And you and I both know people that have been caught in lies in the past that have reformed themselves and are speaking very directly and very factually. And I think he did that today.

But there's a big lesson there for viewers listening at home and kids. Don't be anybody's groupie. And there's a symmetrical nature to loyalty. Loyalty is a two-way street. When someone's disavowing you, and let's face it -- Mr. Trump's only out for himself. He's running for president for retribution and vengeance. He's been very open about that. He's not there to serve the American people. He hurts people. And he's asymmetric in his nature. And it's not just Michael Cohen. There's a legion of people that he's done this to.

Circling back to the recording -- recorded conversation, Cohen says he didn't think cash was a good idea to repay the tabloid empire AMI for the McDougal transaction, so he suggested by check to make it appear to be a proper transaction. I didn't want to record more, Cohen says. Cohen says I had already had enough that I would be able to show David Packer so as to convince him that he was going to receive the $150,000 back. So, Cohen in this telling he was recording Donald Trump saying that he'll -- suggesting that he'll pay David Pecker back the $150,000 that the tabloid enterprise pays Karen McDougal for her story so as to kill it -- catch and kill. He was trying to convince David Pecker to do it, and by playing this recording of Donald Trump I'm saying yes, I'll pay him back.Trump shakes his head at Cohen's testimony while continuing to read the papers in his hand. I'm told we have some of the first courtroom sketches from inside the room. Again, if I had my druthers, we would be airing this entire thing for you live. But we're -- I -- we do not have my druthers. So, there are -- here's a Jane Rosenberg special with Attorney Susan Hoffinger standing at the -- at the little podium.

[11:50:15] And -- but I want to bring something to your attention though. The Jane Rosenberg's art is magisterial as it may be. Donald Trump, we have been told, has not looked in the direction he is depicted in this art looking. He has -- generally he's been facing forward toward the judge. That is obviously very recognizably Donald Trump, though. So, that's Jane Rosenberg. I'm not sure if we have Christine Cornell available. If we do, I'd love to see that. No Cornell, yes. But that's the art from inside the room. Cohen says, by the way, that the call that interrupted the recording came from a bank branch manager at Capital One Bank. Kasie Hunt, so, here we are.

There was a lot of information that the tabloid had on Trump in a secure drawer. Cohen didn't know what was in it, but he wanted to make sure Pecker remained loyal to Trump. So, that's the significance of that. And then inside the courtroom after being asked if he ever altered the recording, Michael Cohen says, no.

What you said is correct.
