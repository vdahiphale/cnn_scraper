New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and his wife have been indicted on corruption-related charges.Menendez is the powerful chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He and his wife were accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for the Democratic senator's influence. What's more, this is the second time in the past ten years that Menendez has faced charges like this. We are getting new details and new pictures from this indictment, including gold bars.

We will be following that news conference, to be sure, to learn much more about the scope of this indictment.Kara, as you have pointed out, what makes part of this so interesting is the Supreme Court has actually made it harder to convict public officials on corruption charges. You have to prove -- really, it's hard to prove an official action was taken. And part of the reason we know this is because Senator Bob Menendez himself had charges brought against him. There was a trial, a mistrial, and, ultimately, those charges were thrown out. But talk to us more about all that. SCANNELL:  Right. So, Menendez was charged initially back in 2015 in a scheme involving a friend of his that was a doctor. He was charged with bribery, honest services fraud, a lot of these corruption-related charges. He'd gone to trial on that. The jury was hung. They couldn't come together with a verdict, so the judge declared a mistrial. And then the Supreme Court had ruled in this case involving, again, bribery involving the governor of Virginia, Bob McDonnell. And in that case, the Supreme Court really focused on what is an official act, so the quid pro quo of a bribery. And they had said that just setting up meetings for a friend is not enough to say that it's corrupt and in criminal. So, they raised the bar on what prosecutors would have to establish as an official act. And that opinion was written by Chief Justice John Roberts. And now so what we're seeing here, you know, I've been still going through this indictment, it's 39 pages, but they do seem to have some specific examples that go beyond setting up a meeting, and that is what this new hurdle is. Although, of course, this will be exactly what Menendez's lawyers challenge when they are in court facing these charges, John.",

Ukrainian officials are warning the Russian Black Sea fleet could be, quote/unquote, sliced up like a salami, is how they're saying it, if they don't surrender the Navy headquarters.

This was a city of poor founded by Catherine the Great. This was the location of the Crimean War in the 1850s. It held out against the Nazis as long as it could in World War II. And then the Russians actually leased it back from Ukraine after the Cold War in 1991. This place, again, huge symbolic value to Russia.With us now is Ben Hodges, retired Lieutenant General and former Commander of U.S. Army Forces in Europe. General, thank you so much for being with us. I mentioned the symbolic value. Talk to me about the strategic value for Ukraine to continue to strike this port hard. LT. GEN. BEN HODGES (RET.), FORMER COMMANDER OF U.S. ARMY FORCES IN EUROPE:  John, Crimea is the most important terrain for this entire war. It's what we would call the decisive terrain. Ukraine knows they'll never be safe or secure as long as Russia is able to operate from there. Russia does not care about Donbas except that that's where the land bridge is to Crimea. So, if the Ukrainians are able to liberate Crimea, then this war actually I think will be over. So, what's happening, what your team has been describing very well, this is part of the counteroffensive. The counteroffensive is much more than the land operation. It's also the air and sea and Special Forces. All these things that are happening, this is the plan that is designed by the Ukrainian general of staff that is putting enormous pressure on the Russian general of staff. And so as the commander of the Black Sea fleet, how the counteroffensive is going, he would tell you it's going terrible from a Russian perspective.",

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the Ukrainians were able to get armor through right here in this region, to break through some of the Russian lines. And the map I'm showing the audience from the Institute of the Study of War shows just how deep these Russian lines are.

So, the ground part of the counteroffensive is aimed at just that, to isolate it by cutting the land bridge. That means either by physically sitting on top of it, which is going to be much more difficult, or with the penetrations that you're talking about, they will soon be able to bring up longer range rocket launchers and artillery that could disrupt any traffic moving down the land bridge. So, the land part of this is a critical part of isolating Crimea.Meanwhile, all of these strikes against Sevastopol and Saky and Dzhankoi, this is all part of making it untenable so that the Russians can no longer operate from there.",

Hard right Republicans delivered House Speaker Kevin McCarthy another blow, blocking forward motion again on a related bill. So, McCarthy burned again, sent members home for the weekend.

The House Rules Committee is going to gather to try and move a couple of these bills forward. But once they come to the floor, it's another question entirely if the votes will be there. And lawmakers are now gone for the weekend. Meetings will continue. They're going to still try to get some work done. But actual votes on these bills, they're not going to start to happen until next week when they are just five days away from government shutdown. So, at this point, the question is what is the Senate going to do and is the Senate going to send something over to the House of Representatives. And if so, would House Speaker Kevin McCarthy put it on the floor knowing that he is imperiled if he does anything to work with Democrats from his right flank. It's really a question right now. Do you want to keep your job if you're Kevin McCarthy or do you want to avoid a government shutdown? And that is a tough calculation to make if you're the speaker of the House, Kate.",

BERMANThe New York Times had a remarkable tidbit of reporting today saying that, you know, several months ago, the DNC, on behalf of Joe Biden, had been doing polls of head to head matchups of Biden versus President Biden versus prospective Republican candidates. Well, now, apparently they've stopped asking questions about Ron DeSantis, the implication being they just don't think he's a threat anymore. They don't think he's going to win the nomination. It's just Donald Trump. The direct quote is, now as Mr. Trump's leading the primary has grown in heart, the party has dropped Mr. DeSantis from such hypothetical matchups in the Biden campaign's polling on Republican candidates is now directed squarely to Mr. Trump. What does that tell you? S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  That tells you a lot. Look, Ron DeSantis was really hyped. He was hyped as being Trump but smarter. And I've said this before, it's almost like he's Trump but dumber, at least when it comes to running a political campaign. I mean, he's lost donors, he's had to fire staff, he has not found his lane. And, you know, despite throwing out a bunch of stuff, you know, spaghetti on the wall to see if it would stick, you know, picking on Disney and picking all those culture wars, nothing has really boosted him. He's only gone in the opposite direction. And I think he was always sort of a donor invention, almost a Manchurian candidate, with not a lot of there there. I don't know who Ron DeSantis is outside of like the culture wars.
