It`s created with encrypted computer algorithms. Many experts are quick to point out the issues with crypto, though, including market instability bankruptcies lawsuits and how it can actually harm the environment because the computers give off massive amounts of heat. That`s why they`re stored in crypto mines. We`ll go now to northern Sweden with CNN reporter Anna Stewart who`s found a mind that may be more sustainable for the environment if their plans to use the heat to grow things we can eat come to fruition.

There`s about a 30 degrees centigrade difference though between here and here under one of the big bends where you`re getting the cold air from outside. So, you can feel the energy that is coming out of these lots of power a small city, one of the reasons crypto mining can be just so controversial. But that is why Hive Blockchain Technologies have set up shops here in the north of Sweden. Come take a look why. Outside, some 500 meters along the River Lulea is a hydrogen power plant, a source of abundant cheap and renewable energy.",

Full of green forest, temperate rainforest, has lots of glaciers, rivers, lakes and the coast is very steep. The marine life came from deep waters but also from adjacent areas and so the diversity we find in fjords is elevated compared to other coastlines. My name is Vreni Haussermann. I`m a scientist working at the University of San Sebastian and I`m studying the marine biodiversity of Chilean Patagonia. Diving in Patagonia, we found many species that haven`t been described before. The coastline is more than 100,000 kilometers, which is twice around the world. Only a handful of scientists working there. So even if we studied all the main areas, there are still most parts that we don`t know yet. Chilean Patagonia was free of human impact for a long time, but in the `80s when aquaculture moved in, it started to be impacted. Life in the fjords has been reduced in abundance. There are species we hardly don`t find anymore. By impacting an area where we know very little about, we always have the risk that we are damaging ecosystems and the equilibrium of the ecosystems is lost. I hope that humanity understands the need of protect our planet. I hope humanity understands the need of protecting the oceans and our lives and the lives of all future generations depend on a healthy ocean and a healthy planet. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
