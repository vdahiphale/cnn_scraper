But it's not the only threat to democracy now.With election deniers dominating U.S. midterms and far-right parties joining governments in Europe and Israel, the risk of rising authoritarianism comes even closer to home. Anne Applebaum writes extensively about these autocratic threats in her book, in The Atlantic and elsewhere. And he's -- she's joining me now from neighboring Warsaw. Welcome back to the program, Anne. As you watched, as we've just been describing, not just the humanitarian crisis unfolding here now, but in general, as we've laid out the threat to democracy itself. How do you assess the current situation here in Ukraine, in terms of on the battlefield and elsewhere? ANNE APPLEBAUM, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC AND PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING HISTORIAN: So, I think it is significant what you quoted Putin saying a few minutes ago. Namely, that he sees Ukraine as some kind of existential threat to him because Ukraine wants to join the west. Because it wants to be integrated into Europe. He's made a very clear that he sees this war as a war against democracy. The democracy is a threat to his particular kind of autocratic, kleptocratic regime, and that he needs to see it crushed for that reason. That's been the main reason why he invaded Ukraine. That's why he's been fighting since February, is to protect his idea of autocracy. And of course, others have that same idea. I mean, the idea that -- of a one-party state, of one-man rule. It's popular in other countries. We've seen just in the last few weeks China is strengthening its one-party rule - - one-man rule, I should say, excuse me. So, you know, when he is fighting democracy, he's doing it on behalf of a lot of other people and a lot of people are watching him to see what the result will be. And that's why it's so important that the democracies continue to fight back.",

And for them to make this shift and even verbally, as they have done, and to begin to send weapons to Ukraine, as they have done, is really an enormous change. And I think, you know, it's very important to acknowledge that has happened. And that so far, it's popular. It's got support inside Germany, and again, across a pretty broad political spectrum. Including the central-right, including the green party, including the central-left which is the party of Olaf Scholz, the chancellor. That doesn't mean that the argument doesn't continue. You know, the nature of German support, you know, should they send tanks? What kind of weapons should go to Ukraine? how much military support should there be we? It goes on. I think it's -- what we're watching, really, is Germans adjust themselves to a new world. To begin to think differently about what their role is also in a way to begin to reinterpret their own rules since the second world war. So, maybe the lesson of the second world war is that Germany needs to help stand up to, you know, totalitarian autocracy as, you know, to countries that are seeking to, you know, to create genocide in Europe once again. And getting all Germans on board and getting them to rethink their energy policy, their trade policy is a big struggle.

So, the problem is not the lack of diplomatic negotiations, those can happen at any time. And I find the call for negotiations a little bit strange because they're happening and they could happen. The problem isn't the negotiations or the lack of willingness, the problem is that right now the Russians are not interested in negotiations. The Russians have not yet dropped their main goal in this war. And the main goal was to conquer Ukraine. To conquer all of Ukraine, to destroy Kyiv, to make Ukraine part of Russia, to destroy the Ukrainians as a nation. That remains, in essence, their goal. That's still what you can hear on Russian television. That's what you can hear from, you know, from Russians at all levels. When the Russians drop to that goal, and when they realize that this war was a mistake, and it was not just a moral mistake, and it was not just a military mistake, but it was also a catastrophe for them and for their idea themselves. When they understand that it was, you know, a disaster for this regime and for their future, then we might be able to talk about having negotiations. And that moment will come when they perceive that the Ukrainians are winning, that they won't lose, that the west will not stop backing them, and that the war will destroy Russia and will undermine the Russian economy and Russian society. And it might mean that moment might happen when their political changes inside Russia. We might be getting closer to that time. The fact is that the Russians have withdrawn troops from Kherson. We don't know if they've withdrawn all of them. We know there are certainly not taking territory anymore. But they need to feel that they're losing, that they can't win, and then we might be able to start talking. And then we can talk about how the war could eventually end.

By 1971, institutions like universities had realized that we were not making progress in overcoming racial injustice. Every top university, selective university, decided to consider race and ethnicity in order to have integrated student bodies. In 1978, the Supreme Court had a case challenging that. And in an opinion that made up a majority written by Justice Powell, he said, you could consider race and ethnicity if you did it for educational purposes, for the benefits of educational diversity. But you could not take it into an account to rectify past the present injustices. My case that I was involved with, really against the University of Michigan and the law school which had a policy that basically every other law school had, of trying to have a diverse student body was again challenged. And a majority of the court, five justices upheld that practice. So, it was a landmark decision because it -- we had not had a majority of reaching that conclusion before. So, in 2003, this became settled constitutional law. That was followed by a subsequent decision called Fisher, which reaffirmed Grutter, and now we are with these two cases before the new court.",

But I was, by virtue of being president of the University of Michigan andthe lawsuits that were brought, it became central to my life. I've always believed in. But this became a much more of a mission. Jeff and I are from a generation that were formed and shaped in the era of the civil rights movement. We became law professors in the context of Brown versus the Board of Education and the profound effects on law. From our point of view -- from my point of view, it would be a tragedy if a majority of the Supreme Court, as appears very likely, were to overturn a half century of efforts by higher education to try to help overcome the racial injustices that we have lived with. This is not a small matter. As we see in other universities that have been affected by bans on affirmative action. University of California Berkeley, University of Michigan have seen African American students plummet. But it's not only higher education. I mean, this is an unraveling of the efforts of institutions all across the United States to try and deal with racial injustices that we have inherited. And they continue to affect American society adversely. So, to me, it would be a tragedy. We would be entering a new era in which we would be ebbing on our efforts to try to live up to the ideals of Brown versus Board of Education.",
