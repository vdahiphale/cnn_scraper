The polls could be wrong. And they've been wrong before. But in the polls, at least he is losing, and was losing before, and is losing more now. What does this say about his read on the election, and what his own people are telling him about the state of the election? SARA FISCHER, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Yes.

But then there are some people, there is some worries within Biden- world, that the people the closest to the President, the closest political advisers are too often telling the President, what he wants to hear, which is why he is going out and saying, oh, the race is a toss-up.
