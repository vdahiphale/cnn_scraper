Kramatorsk isn't far away and that's where a Pizzeria was hit by, again, a sophisticated cruise missile able to target it. And again, the timing at suppertime, just after 07But you look at those first images of the first strike in daylight and then the second images after the second strike. More than half of those injured were rescue workers. There were 81 people injured, two of them were children, 31 civilians, 42 were rescue workers, either police, rescue workers or military. And one of the leading emergency recovery services figures in the area, the deputy head of recovery in the Donetsk region, was killed as well. So this is quite typically in the Russian playbook to draw in the emergency services and then fire another missile and they know exactly who they're going to hit.",

If you listen to the words of the Deputy Defense Minister speaking just yesterday about what the situation around Bakhmut, for example, saying that we were able to defend our positions and put casualties onto the enemy, essentially, that's hardly the language of taking territory.And in other areas, she was saying along the southern front, we're finding that the Russians are actually putting concrete fortifications on the high ground, you know, having got through the minefields. That's what they're discovering. So the reality is the Ukrainians haven't been able to punch through, but this was always going to be an asymmetric war. This was always going to be a war where the Ukrainians were going to struggle against the might of the Russians, their numbers and their ability to keep losing troops. Ukrainians don't want to lose troops. And they've said they've spoken a lot about that and about the slowness of NATO allies to supply weapons. But I say asymmetric because they've been able to hit Moscow with drones. There's been a mutiny, a military mutiny in Russia. They've been able to perpetrate attacks across the border inside Russia. So they have had an effect on the Russian establishment. But that key thing, the frontline that they need, they haven't got yet.",

This is why, when they sent the delegation to Niamey last week, they didn't even meet with General Abdul Rahman Tiani. This is the man who's declared himself the new leader of Niger.They didn't meet with him. They met with other juniors. Victoria Nuland, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the U.S., who went to Niamey yesterday, also did not meet with General Tiani. She met with the self-declared chief of defense. And she says they had very frank, sometimes difficult conversations about the situation. And she said that she didn't get a lot of traction around a negotiated settlement because these men who've taken over the country are very firm in how they want to proceed, which violates the constitution of Niger. Now, here's the interesting bit. Burkina Faso and Mali also sent a delegation to Niamey. They actually met with General Abdul Rahman Tiani. He had time for them. They met for some time, and the government spokesperson from Mali spoke to the press afterwards with these words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ABDOULAYE MAIGA, MALI GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN (through translation): I would like to remind you that Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger have been dealing for over 10 years with the negative socioeconomic, security, political and humanitarian consequences of NATO's hazardous adventure in Libya. Of course, we ask ourselves, if it took us 10 years, how many years would it take us to get another adventure of the same nature in Niger? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

July's temperatures on average were 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than in preindustrial times, according to the E.U.'s Copernicus Climate Change Service. It's a significant milestone since scientists consider that threshold a key tipping point for the planet if it succeeded in the long term. This chart shows changes in sea surface temperature going back to the 1970s. And the top red line that you can see represents 2023, with July clearly far and away the highest temperature. If rising temperatures continue, scientists say extreme weather will become more common. And joining me now to discuss this report is CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Derek, it's so great to see you. We often hear from meteorologist experts like yourself that extreme weather engenders more extreme weather because of these cycles. Can you explain what's going on there? And also if reaching this threshold now is going to make even more extreme weather more likely?",

Efforts to save the Amazon are nothing new. The Brazilian government has rated illegal mining and logging operations over the decades, but the results have been disappointing. A study by Purdue University showed that deforestation drove the massive Amazon rainforest fires of 2019, which destroyed thousands of square miles of Amazon rainforest, roughly the size of New Jersey. And according to an analysis by the Council on Foreign Relations published last year, it's estimated that between 17 and 20 percent of the Amazon has been destroyed over the past 50 years. And some scientists believe that the tipping point for dieback is between 20 and 25 percent deforestation. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
