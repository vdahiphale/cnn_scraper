      "sentences": "Israel announced in the early hours of Saturday morning that their military operationagainst Iran was over after striking military targets in different parts of the country. The targets, according to Israel`s military, included missile manufacturing facilities as well as surface to air missile systems. Sources told CNN that there were three waves of Israeli airstrikes. And Iranian media said that military sites in three different provinces were hit but they claimed limited damage. The United States had pressured Israel to not strike Iran`s nuclear or oil facilities, fearing greater escalation in the region and an impact on the global economy. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to have complied. Following Israel`s operation, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters that, quote, \"This should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran.\" The official also said that the strikes were carefully prepared as well as being extensive, targeted and precise. Israel`s strikes were in response to the October 1 Iranian barrage of some 180 ballistic missiles, directly fired at Israel. For the past three weeks, Israel has been preparing its response in coordination with the United States though Washington made clear it did not participate in Israel`s operation. What comes next remains very much to be seen, what the damage in Iran looks like, whether the Iranian regime retaliates in some way and what impact this may have on the other fronts in the region, in Lebanon and in Gaza.
