So, the question will be, is that going to be something that the judge actually addresses at the start of the proceedings today? This has been a long, steady stream of these kinds of attacks on the judge personally, as well as on the attorney general. And I will be interested to see whether the attorney general's office raises this with the judge at the beginning of the proceedings, especially if Mr. Trump is in the room, and whether the judge decides to raise it on his own.",

Donald Trump arriving here for opening statements in this civil case.We just heard from the attorney general moments ago. We'll see if he takes the chance to speak before going in. I don't think we necessarily anticipate that, but you never know. In the meantime, I want to bring Dana Bash into this conversation. Dana, we've been noting all morning long, yes, this is a legal proceeding, but in many respects this is a campaign event because Donald Trump is choosing to be there. He's coming from Iowa. He was in Iowa yesterday. He spent last night in New York. Going to this campaign event today. In a way it proves the point he's been trying to make, is there's no daylight. You know, the sun can't shine through almost on any of the other candidates, Republican candidates, no matter how hard they try.",

      "sentences": "And there is no opportunity for a spectacle that he will give up. It's -- in general, but particularly at this case, when this kind of moment is a central part of his campaign for re-election, for election again, I should say, and a central part of his campaign to galvanize Republican voters, which according to every poll, national, and more importantly, state poll, is working. His numbers have continued to go up with every indictment that he has faced. That's on the criminal charges. This, as you've been noting all morning, is a civil trial.But I want to go back to what Kate was talking about with this Trump campaign statement. A very lengthy statement attacking Letitia James, because it plays into the notion of him as a martyr and him going after what he perceives as his political enemies. And Jessica was right, of course, that this is going to be a question legally in the courtroom about his -- his behavior, both against Letitia James and against the judge. But if you just look at it from the point of view of his political campaign, he makes point after point using quote after quote of Letitia James as a candidate for office herself. Remember, she was elected as attorney general. She is a proud Democrat. And so he is trying to turn that very much into the notion of witch hunt. It is different from, let's say, a Jack Smith on the federal level, who is apolitical and, you know, nominated because of that or appointed because of that. This is a very different kind of thing. And he clearly feels that it is much easier to make the political argument that this is just Democrats coming after him in a way because -- because they can.",

Highly unusual. Hasn't happened yet. But the judge has been asked and there is a question as to whether or not he would allow cameras just for the opening statements. If that happens, of course, we will bring those to you as soon as they happen and we'll give you the decision as soon as that decision becomes clear. But there is a big case that still has to go forward here. And, Dana, you know, the argument that Donald Trump has been making is it's political for the simple fact that he has been touting his business acumen for decades. And these business records have been around for a very long time, as well as questions around his wealth. Is this an argument that is working with those who are looking at potentially putting Trump back in office?",

It was essentially an objective assessment of the fraudulent nature of the documents.But for the other causes of action, she does have to show individual intent to defraud. And so there could be a differentiation among the individual defendants depending on the evidence of their intent to defraud. And so depending on how the evidence comes in from the various witnesses, it could be that the judge finds Donald Trump Sr. did intend to defraud but Jr. didn't, or something like that, and that could affect not only his verdict on those individual causes of action, but also the remedy that he imposes as to each of them in terms of whether they're individually barred from holding a corporate office or position.",

We don't need to proceed on the other six. We don't think it adds anything. Clearly the attorney general is not going to make that decision. I think she just sort of amplified that just now.

[09If there's a judgment for hundreds of millions of dollars that Trump can't pay, then that may have to be seized in order to pay that judgment off. One other thing that's important to notice on damages. And this is why I think this is different from the other civil cases. This is going to be more than just cutting a check. When Donald Trump lost his judgment to E. Jean Carroll, $5 million, ultimately he can cut a check.

It is an icon as courthouses go.But as we've been watching the hallway, we've seen the Secret Service agent at the barrier here. We've seen some of the 4,000 New York state court officers that are the security for these buildings across the state. We see Mike Magliano (ph), the chief of the court officers, walk by a few moments ago. He was the individual with the four stars on his court officer uniform. And we've been seeing Lushan Chalfin (ph), who is the -- basically the press officer for the office of court administration pacing back and forth on his cell phone, probably waiting for word as to whether or not cameras will be allowed in the courtroom to take pictures or to record the opening statements as that goes. So, it's a lot of activity in a building that's recognized by a lot of people in a civil case. Interestingly, it is a block away from the other courthouse at 100 Center Street, where Donald Trump was brought in for the criminal case, which also included the charge of falsifying business records.

That's why we saw those photos of Donald Trump sitting at his lawyers table. He set aside some time in the beginning. He said people can take still photographs. But he did not allow any sort of live video or audio feed. And I should say, the concerns about letting cameras in the courtroom are lessoned a bit because there's not a civilian jury here, because the worry is, you don't want the jurors sort of being influenced by outside coverage.

I still think it's quite unlikely that this judge allows a televised - but maybe - and if he is going to try to thread the needle, maybe he allows it just for opening because then you're not showing witness.",

They are very aware and following very closely every twist and turn around this camera. They know how many seats are there. They know where the press cameras are. They know about this ruling and are waiting to see what's going to happen. They want press coverage. And I actually just got off the phone with a Trump adviser who essentially conceded that this was, in fact, similar to a campaign event. And it's not just what Dana said about that blast out, raising money off of the mug shot. It's also the fact that essentially right as he was leaving Trump Tower, they put out a blast attacking Letitia James the same way that you would a campaign rival. He is absolutely capitalizing on this and does want the media attention. Now, as we have said, this is not something that he wants in general. It is damaging to his brand. The politician in himself, the fact that he has sold himself as a rich businessman and this undermines that, this trial. However, they do know that the cameras are on him when it comes to these legal issues. They want that traction. And they do believe that it helps them at least with primary voter. Now, of course, when we look ahead to 2024 and the general election, there is some concern even among his top advisers that there will be Trump fatigue. However, Trump himself believes that if he can face these charges, if he can paint himself as a victim of election interference, of - be -- Democrats' political insertion into the court system, that that is something that will help him in the election, actually potentially could help him with some voters that are down the middle. Now, that remains to be seen. There is no indication that that is true. But these are at - these are the beliefs that they hold as he is going down to courthouse, as  he is in front of those cameras, as he is really taking this opportunity, as Dana said, milking this to get the most eyes on him at this time, partly because it is a campaign event. There is no line between his legal issues and his campaign. He is continuing to campaign off of the legal issues, to fund raise off of the legal issues. And that's not going to stop any time soon. And, of course, we've seen a rise in the polls as he has done so.",
