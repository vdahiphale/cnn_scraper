That is the latest that this 25-year-old active duty member of the U.S. Air Force, Aaron Bushnell from San Antonio, has died from his injuries in the hospital and we have a pretty clear picture of what happened in this incident in broad daylight in Washington, D.C. around 1Now, we are not showing that video is graphic and disturbing, but I can walk you through what we see in it. You can see Bushnell in his military uniform, walking down the street in dc, really speaking calmly to the camera as he records himself before arriving at the Israeli embassy. He says: I will no longer be complicit in genocide. I'm about to engage in an extreme act of protest. But compared to what people have been experiencing in Palestine at the hands of their colonizers, it is not extreme at all. This is what our ruling class has decided will be normal. Then he appears to pour some sort of accelerant on his head, John, and then he sparks a lighter and sets himself on fire, yelling again and again, free Palestine, free Palestine, before eventually the flames overtake him and he collapses to the ground and police officers then rushed in to put out the fire with an extinguisher. But again, we now know that he has died from those injuries. And look, John, this just again speaks to the rising tensions were continuing to see, not just across the world, but right here in the United States over this escalating war in Gaza, now, more than four months into the conflict the death toll nearing 30,000 people. And we saw similar incident back in December, a person set themselves on fire outside of the Israeli consulate in Atlanta. But this takes it to another level when an active duty member of the U.S. military has burned himself to death in the nation's capital but as the political stakes again continue to rise for the Biden administration.",

In early January and Secretary Blinken was here, he said that it was needed for the Palestinian Authority to reform and deep when he left, he said he had a commitment from them to reform. He made a visit back in February. There have been no change.So this does seem to be a step in the direction of potential Palestinian Authority reform. The prime minister has talked about the need to form a unity government. Now, that reaches across the U.S. aspiration of finding a path to a Palestinian state out of the war in Gaza, something where there's a Palestinian body that can administer both the West Bank and Gaza as well. It speaks to that. The Prime Ministers Shtayyeh, the Palestinian Authority prime minister, saying that it would be something a new unity government that would draw on, not parties, but on competencies. So is this movement in that direction? Its certainly pressure the United States has been putting on the Palestinian Authority to make movements like this. Worth noting that in the West Bank and I was talking to a respected Palestinian pollster in the West Bank just a couple of weeks ago. And he said right now the Palestinian Authority presidents ratings 92 percent in the negative, the Palestinian Authority, there its not particularly popular in the West Bank. Is there a need for change there? Absolutely.",

Harvard business professor Raffaella Sadun is resigning as the co-chair of this antisemitism task force that had just been put together. This news was sort of buried in the middle of a longer announcement from Harvard laying out the full list of members of this task force, and another one on Islamophobia.Now the question is, why, of course? And the stated reason is that she wants to double down on academics. Harvard's interim president, Alan Garber, he put out a statement saying that Sadun has, quote, decided to refocus her efforts on her research, teaching, and administrative responsibilities at Harvard Business School. But the fact that this came out on a Sunday night and that it is so abrupt suggests that there could be some more afoot here. Now, publicly, for now, both sides are playing nice. Garber praised Sadun for her work on this task force and she said the Garber has put together a, quote, excellent task force. But we do know there's a lot of pressure on Harvard right now, especially on the antisemitism task force, and this antisemitism issue. And a job like this. I mean, this requires building consensus, which, of course, is no easy task given the spotlight on the university right now. And we've also learned that some Jewish alumni at Harvard, they are still upset with the antisemitism controversy there that they are even taking the extraordinary step of auditing the university's courses to try to root out what they see is pervasive antisemitism.

But we do know from CDC guidance, the CDC recommends when there is a measles outbreak children who are not vaccinated if they're exposed to the virus, should stay home for 21 days because that's the incubation period for the virus.Whereas just last week, the states surgeon general in Florida sent a letter to parents and guardians saying what you just mentioned, Kate, that the department of health is quote, deferring to parents or guardians to make decisions about school attendance so there is this disconnect between what the CDC guidance says and what Florida is actually doing. Now, the reason why this is controversial if the child is not vaccinated and there are exposed to the measles virus and they're still sent to school. Of course, they have their own risk of getting seriously ill or sadly, even possibly dying from the illness. But also if they're sent to school, that raises the risk of the virus spreading and the outbreak getting worse. So there is a lot of concern around this if you're unvaccinated, 90 percent of the time, you will get the virus if you're exposed and measles is so contagious if someone's infected and they cough or sneeze, it can linger in the air for up to two hours.
