One official I was speaking to did say that the U.S. public warnings do seem to have had an effect on Iran's calculations, but it is clearly a waiting game right now for both the U.S. and Israel as they are waiting for and bracing for whatever actions Iran or Iran related groups might take against Israel. And it is very much worth noting that nobody here at the White House would deny that for President Biden, one of the biggest pieces of his lasting sort of foreign policy legacy that is really top of mind for him right now is getting the ceasefire deal.

What's been interesting about all of the different exchanges we've seen the Iranian support to its proxies, from Hezbollah and Lebanon to the militias in Iraq and Syria to the Houthis in Yemen, is that all of this escalation since Hamas's October 7 attack has been designed to maintain pressure on Israel, maintain pressure on the United States, but not escalate to the full scale war. We also saw Iran launch that a direct attack in April, but it was actually quite easily defeated by Israel, the United States and a constellation of Arab and European allies. And so the question now, is there a sweet spot for Iran that's more than what we saw on April 13, but less than that big war. And the United States has put a lot of resources behind making it clear that it wants Iran to stand down.Another aircraft carrier, more fighter jets, now, a guided missile submarine, all deployed to the region in less than a week to send really strong signals to Iran, and clearly they're reconsidering whether now is the moment for escalation.",

The trajectory of this crisis and future of this region now rests in hands of Iran, Hezbollah, Sinwar and Benjamin Netanyahu. Break that down for us. AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EASTNEGOTIATOR: Look, Wolf, you know, under normal circumstances, in a normal environment, Middle East negotiations have two speeds. We've talked about this slow and slower. You now have a situation where you have at least three clocks that are ticking at different speeds. You have the administration clock understandably, they see a hostage deal, frankly, as a key to deescalating on the northern border, freeing hostages maybe get a six week cease fire in which they can build. The other two clocks are running slower. Yahya Sinwar, the principal Palestinian decision maker ensconced in a tunnel somewhere meters below ground, probably surrounded by hostages, really is in no hurry. He may be under pressure, but he needs stuff that the second master of the clock, Netanyahu, right now, is not prepared to give them. So you -- give him. So you've got no synchronization. [17:10:24] And against the backdrop of all of it, if this wasn't bad enough, you've got the Iranians, as Dana had just suggested, still undecided, presumably, about how to inflict significant damage beyond what they did in April 13 on Israel without triggering a massive escalation, which he could easily given the amount of hardware in the region and the unpredictability of some of these strikes draw the U.S. in. So, I think right now, you know, you'd have to have access to the intelligence, and you'd have to somehow get in into the minds of the four principal decision makers that are now responsible for the lives of the hostages, the future the Palestinian people, stability and maybe at some point, Wolf, a better pathway for Israelis and Palestinians.

It involves direct messaging, telling Iran the famous Biden contraction, don't. Don't escalate, and don't have your adversaries escalate at this moment in time. It's involved sending massive military force to the region. Public messaging, private messaging, some exceptionally coordinated diplomacy.We've seen Secretary of State Blinken in the region multiple times, and now we actually have Brett McGurk from the National Security Council, Amos Hochstein, a presidential envoy, all parking themselves in the region working to deescalate at this moment. I would say President Biden's clock is pretty accelerated. He wants to get the hostages out of Gaza, out of -- out from under Hamas, and he wants to cease fire, as he believes that's the path, as Aaron said, to opening multiple opportunities for deescalation, searching humanitarian assistance into Gaza, getting Israel's northern border with Hezbollah to calm down, getting normalization, perhaps with Saudi Arabia back on the table, and even a political horizon for a future Palestinian state. Those are all key priorities of this administration. And their theory of the case is that they cannot move forward on any of those priorities until there's a cease fire in Gaza.",

They don't necessarily watch the news, but they might watch an interview with Elon Musk, and as you saw Elon Musk saying that the conversation itself got more than a billion engagements, and Donald Trump himself, privately was thrilled about all of the viewers that were there. He was actually complimenting, or not complimenting, but saying behind closed doors, before it started that he was flattered that the internet had essentially shut down because so many people were interested in hearing him speak.But that is the campaign, and they are trying to reach out to these voters, these non-traditional voters. On the other side, you have these allies who are concerned that something like this takes him off the campaign trail and also takes him off message. As you said, they want him to be focusing on things like immigration, like crime, like the economy, things that he pulled ahead of President Joe Biden on, things that they believe that he could pull ahead of Kamala Harris on, but we really have not seen him stick to that messaging, and that has become complicated for some of these allies who really want to see him in the White House in November, but don't believe these kind of off script conversations, particularly for two hours that dive into issues that could get Donald Trump in trouble, that's not what they want to see him doing.",

So far, it's been one event this week. Last week, the only event we saw him at was in Montana, and then he gave a press conference from his estate. Now, part of the narrative that we are hearing from Donald Trump's team is actually around Kamala Harris not taking questions from the press.One of the statements they put out, they doing this daily, says day 23 and still no press conference or media interview for Kamala Harris, it's almost like she can't step out in public unless she is pre- programmed like a robot or has a teleprompter with her. Now that's part of the reason, again, why they are advocating for these interviews with Elon Musk or these press conferences like we saw last week, to kind of try and offset what they're saying about Kamala Harris.

NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY EDITORThis is a stark moment for Russian security, period. But I think the question is, Wolf, as you pointed out there, exactly whether Ukraine is digging in. Now, we heard from the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine the suggestion they have no intention of occupying this area, so it seems like we're seeing more of a hit and run here, potentially. Ukrainian forces moving around fast, according to Zelenskyy, taking quite a lot of prisoners as they move, we've seen images of that, significant numbers of prisoners, some of them marched basically back across the border to be used in exchanges, one of the points made by Ukraine's president today, but also slight hints of what may be the larger Ukrainian game plan here. Russia has lacked the firepower, the manpower to put a stop to this advance. And so we're seeing hints, potentially, from Ukrainian officials there might be some relocation of Russian forces from hotspots around the front line inside occupied Ukraine. Maybe that's what Kyiv wants, to see Russia transfer troops, weaken up somewhere and then push somewhere else too, but ultimately, Wolf, we're a week in now, over a week in, and Ukraine's advance into areas of Russia which haven't seen an invasion since the Nazis is unimpeded. They're really not being stopped. They continue to move onwards. Yes, they're losing troops, we've certainly seen some graphic video indeed of Ukrainian casualties, but it's quite extraordinary how this is continuing, and despite what the Kremlin say, they've been unable to stop it.",

Even if they get repelled back, they have demonstrated that they can take the initiative, and they've taken those prisoners. Today's media, print media, was writing a lot about the Ukrainian statement saying, we now have prisoners that we can swap with the prisoners the Russians are holding, so that's already a win for them. So I think it's risky, but so far, it looks like the risk has paid off.",

And if you think back, Wolf, to yourself, you know standing in front of the camera about a year ago when Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was at one point very loyal to Putin, but basically marched up from Ukrainian territory, crossed the Russian border with armed forces, and marched very, you know, got almost into Moscow unimpeded.And what he was doing was he was trying to, you know, he's challenging Putin's military command. Once he got up there and he realized he didn't have the full support, plus, he really probably didn't intend to launch a coup. He backed down, and we know Putin later took revenge and killed him. But that was -- that was a year ago. Putin is very weak internally. So I think we -- it tells you that there's a lot we don't see. And there have been also reports coming out, of course, you know, over the last several months about changes in the Russian defense establishment, you know, he basically did a switcheroo and moved a lot of his people around. He said it was to clamp down in corruption. The economy is not doing terribly well. So there are a lot of weaknesses in the Russian system that we don't often see. The fact that average Russians can tell their neighbors and can tell other Russians that I had to flee my town is pretty -- is a pretty dramatic development for Vladimir Putin.",

One of the reasons for that, Wolf, is because of just how expensive coffee and iced coffee have gotten. I mean, here in New York, it's $5, $6 for an iced coffee, and that's really having an impact on sales. You look at Starbucks sales last quarter down 3 percent from a year ago.And it's not just the higher prices, Wolf, that are turning away customers. You think, you know, 10, 15 years ago, everybody used to go to Starbucks and they would sit down and order. Now they're all ordering on their phones, and that's creating long lines, kind of a frustrating customer experience in stores right now for Starbucks.",
