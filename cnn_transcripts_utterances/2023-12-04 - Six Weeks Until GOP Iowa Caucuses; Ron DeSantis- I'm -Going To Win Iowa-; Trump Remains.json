      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, countdown to Iowa. The first test of the 2024 presidential election is just six weeks away. Will the crucial caucuses propel a Trump challenger towards the nomination or push the former president closer to a second term?Plus, a wider war. Israeli forces are expanding their fight against Hamas across all of Gaza. As we are learning even more of the gruesome terrifying details of the way Hamas terrorists savagely raped women on October 7, before killing them. And destroyer of American democracy. That's what Donald Trump is calling Joe Biden. The president's campaign calls the attack a distraction when the American people will see right through. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. I want to start in Iowa where just a month and a half from now Republicans will be gathering across the Hawkeye State to select the first winner in the Republican contest. Let's go first to Jeff Zeleny who is in Iowa in Cedar Rapids. How's it feeling there? Besides I'm guessing pretty cold.",

      "sentences": "Well Dana, there's a bit of snow on the ground and it's Christmas shopping season. So, it's also time for the Iowa caucuses to enter a new phase and talking to voters here throughout the weekend. It's clear that the ones who at least are inclined to participate in the Iowa Republican caucuses are paying a new level of attention. It's hard not to.There are so many television ads from all of the candidates about Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis were in Iowa over the weekend making their individual pitches. There's no question that the former president still looms large in this race in every way. He still holds a commanding lead in all of the polls, although there haven't been many recent polls. So, one strategist I talked to this morning said, it feels like we're \"flying blind.\" They're not sure if opinions are changing. But when you talk to voters, the set of Republicans who are interested in moving on from the former president about half the party or so, they are beginning to focus more intently. We talked to a Nikki Haley voter this morning. He has made up his mind, Ron DeSantis supporter yesterday, others are still considering a Vivek Ramaswamy. We did get news this morning that North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum is suspending his campaign. Of course, not a big factor in the race. But what it shows is the race is consolidating. The race is definitely getting smaller before the voting begins and that could have an impact. But Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, of course, is putting all of his eggs into the Iowa basket. He needs to win here. He knows that. He made this point yesterday while campaigning in Eastern Iowa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): So, I'll be able to lead because it's not going to be about my issues. It's going to be about your issues. I think that's very clear. That's clear with the media. They're agitating for it because -- and they're not doing anything right now. They're waiting and they want to get through the primary and appease that you're going to see them open this up. And it is going to be blistering and unfortunately it will work. So why would we want to nominate who the Democrats want us to nominate? Why would we want us to nominate who the media wants us to nominate? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, the Florida governor there is trying to make his pitch to Iowa voters to think independently and not necessarily follow the polls that show that the former president is in the lead, but he has had his own drama here, Dana. There is no doubt. He's outsourced much of his campaign to a Super PAC called never back down. It's gone through a massive leadership, a turmoil, a couple different leaders in a couple different weeks resignations, firings.The question is, is that organization going to be enough to help pull him over the finish line? Or is a for rising support from Nikki Haley going to really make a difference here? So as there is one more debate this week in Iowa -- or in Alabama on Wednesday, the fourth Republican debate. Most Iowans are watching that to see how their decisions go. But Dana, I can say six weeks before the Iowa caucuses. Yes, Donald Trump is still his race to lose. A bigger question is who is in second place? And that race still is a very tight one.",

      "sentences": "Well, a couple of things. So one, when I talk to Republicans, they actually don't believe that argument as much as they used to. I mean, if it was back in 2022, that was definitely the argument that DeSantis was leaning on as well as many other Republicans saying, that Trump cannot win a general election.When you talk to Republicans now out in the field in these early voting states, many of them are so dissatisfied with Joe Biden, and they also consume so much conservative media that is reiterating that idea that they think that there is no possible way that Joe Biden could win another election. So, this electability argument isn't really there anymore. But one thing I do want to point out, you know, I was there with him in Cedar Rapids this weekend. And one thing I found to be the most striking talk about where the voters stand is before he even took the stage, somebody asked how many people here is there going to be their first time caucusing this year or in January, and half the room raise their hand. And I just think that's a really important note because we talk about how Donald Trump has this sticky bass. These are not people who have been in his base. These are new voters that he's getting.",

I don't think that there's any future for the campaign. He alluded to the fact that several people have won the Iowa caucuses and then lost the nomination.What I think differentiates him from some of those previous losers is that he's got a stronger campaign. He's got more of a campaign organization. He's got more campaign money, more supporters who are high profile in the various states but none of that's going to matter at all if he doesn't win Iowa.",

And if he doesn't, it won't matter what he said. You know, the Iowa voters are pretty notoriously independent in their own ways, and they make some decisions that we don't expect.It's interesting. Jeff said, there's no new polling out there. So, it's hard to tell what's going on. The thing that caught me about DeSantis and I think you caught -- you too, was him saying the media wants Trump and there's no reporting on Trump. And like, well, he's not reading a lot of the stuff we're reading. There's a lot of reporting on Trump in his second term. I guess he just sees that as a good argument. But, you know, this is it for DeSantis. And he started out in this position, and he was the guy, right. Obviously, I think we all sat around to go. Well, he's the logical alternative to Trump. And it's just not playing out that way. And turmoil at the top in a campaign is never a good indicator of things going.",

I mean, when you look at where the poll numbers have gone, it seems actually strange that Donald Trump would still be focused on Ron DeSantis, especially given Nikki Haley's surge and she seems to be climbing in multiple states.But yet, he has remained fixated on Ron DeSantis part of that likely because of the disloyalty factor that he feels that he thought that he should have never run and if he did run, you should have called him first to talk to him.

Teens have rock stars that they follow like Taylor Swift. Grown-ups have Trump, said Melton, whose red hoodie carried a portrait of the former president, the word legend stamped underneath. It really is such a snapshot. And I didn't mean to suggest that you were anything other than a Swifty by the way. It really is a snapshot of the cult like figure that Donald Trump continues to be across the -- well it's not across the political spectrum, but sort of in the political world.

I think is not the way -- it is not a helpful attitude for citizens in a democracy to have things. The thing is, though, with Trump, it's not just that he's got that hardcore base of support that will be with him, regardless of what he does.It's the other Republicans who think he was a successful president who think favorably of him, who have not been necessarily totally sold on him.

As you said, the Israelis now have armor on the Salahuddin Street, which is the main north south highway linking the north with the south. That was the route through which people had been advised to move from the north to the south. But now of course, the problem is that there are hundreds of thousands of people crammed into the south the area where they had been advised to go to be in a safer area. And what we have now is a mounting humanitarian crisis. In much of southern Gaza, where the schools that have been turned into shelters are full of people. We're hearing from the U.N. that in some instances, there are as many as 400 people to a single toilet and that's if a toilet is actually functioning as well in the town of Deir al-Balah, which is to the southern part of the Gaza Strip. The only functioning bakery was hit overnight. As a result there was looting there. What we heard from people there is that the situation is desperate, and it is increasingly chaotic. Dana?",
