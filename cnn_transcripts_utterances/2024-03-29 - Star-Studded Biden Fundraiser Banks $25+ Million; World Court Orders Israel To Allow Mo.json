I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. We begin with the fundraising battle in the race for the White House. The Biden campaign holding a star studded gala at New York's Radio City Music Hall last night. It featured a panel discussion with former Presidents Obama and Clinton. It was moderated by \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert. Some of the biggest stars and entertainment like Lizzo, you see her there, came to perform for that packed house. But this large crowds showed up outside Radio City to protest Biden's support for Israel during its war in Gaza. President interrupted repeatedly inside the hall as well. The event boosted Biden's war chest by at least $25 million and added to his growing fundraising advantage over former President Donald Trump. The former president's campaign hopes to top Biden's haul when it holds an April 6th fundraiser in Florida? Their goal for that Mar-a- Lago event, $33 million. Joining me now to discuss is national political reporter for \"The Hill\", Julia Manchester. Julia, good morning to you.",

He's really flipped the script for Republicans on that, talking about America first. And I think those issues, the way he speaks out them really resonate with them, as voters.

You can see the wins that will pick up through the course of the day today, gusty and over 30 miles per hour at times. The other big story that you teed up just a moment ago is still just off the West Coast. There it is that kind of a comma shape in the cloud cover? That is a low pressure system that's drawing in Pacific moisture. And we call this an atmospheric river event because it has that tap of moisture feed from the ocean and it will produce significant rainfall for southern California. So we do have flash flood watches in and around Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, into Ventura counties. Look how it just kind of meanders along the central and southern coastline through the course of the weekend. Another piece of the energy splits off and moves across the Intermountain West. But the big story here will be the rain. You can see the rainfall totals anywhere south of the Bay Area into Los Angeles, particularly across the mountain ranges near the southern coastline, just north and west Los Angeles, they could pick up locally three to six inches, but were talking about downtown Los Angeles one to three. There's also a lot of wind associated with the system. So wind advisories and wind warnings in place across the central coast. And that extends into the San Francisco Bay Area. By the way, Kasie, we are adding to the snowpack across the Sierra Nevada mountain range. We call it the snow water equivalent, and we have had a great year for that region and that is such good news to pilot the snow this time of year because we require an actually look forward to that snow melt.
