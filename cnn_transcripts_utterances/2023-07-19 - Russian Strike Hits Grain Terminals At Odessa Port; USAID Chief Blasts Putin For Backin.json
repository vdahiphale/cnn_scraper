You know, look, we know this is something that has been the focus of not just fans and the family but of the authorities over the past 26 years, since he was gunned down in 1996. And remember, he was leaving a boxing match in Vegas at the MGM Hotel when he was in the car with Suge Knight, a very famous record executive, and as they were stopped at a light, a car, a Cadillac pulled up in front of them and that's when 12 shots were fired. And remember, Tupac was raced to the hospital with serious injuries. He was alive for a few days before he succumbed to the injuries. And obviously, there have been so many questions as to what happened that night, and who knows what, and who might be hiding something.

Aldean's people have said privately that they didn't know about the lynching when they shot the video at that site and that a lot of videos and films shoot there and have that location, unfortunately. You know, it's hard to know whether to ascribe racism exactly to what's going on here. I see it more as kind of a general xenophobia that you see in the song and the video about small towns, big towns. We don't want any city slickers coming in here with their demonstrations and their Molotov cocktails and their city ways in general. But when you hear lines in the song like, \"See how far you get leaving town,\" I think that is the kind of language that historically people have heard from the south and associate with people being unfriendly to either certain races or demonstrators who had very high-minded causes. So I don't blame people for taking that leap, I guess, is what I would say.",

And, you know, I think that sounds kind of vaguely threatening and paranoid.But then, you know, when the video came out, it really seemed to be about we hate protesters, we hate these demonstrators. I don't doubt that Jason Aldean hates white demonstrators such as he hates black demonstrators. So, you know, however much we want to read into that. I think still, you know, what climate this comes out of is back during the pandemic when the Black Lives Matter demonstrations were happening and there were a number of country stars on the very conservative side who made it known how they felt about the demonstrations. Now, you know, it's a couple years later, three years later, and Jason Aldean has the song where the video has all this footage of demonstrations that makes it very clear that's what he was thinking about. And the general tone of it is that demonstrators deserve maybe a beating if they try to come in and do that in their part of the woods.",

I certainly see from the reaction that I've gotten initially to what I wrote, it was, you know, positive from people in media circles followed by a lot of backlash from Trump supporters once Candace Owens Tweeted out something I had tweeted. I immediately started hearing a lot from, you know, them.I understand that there's room for a plethora of opinions in country music. Certainly, it's not a surprise that people hold some of these views. But I think country music has striven to become a welcoming place, a big umbrella, but not that they're going to change all of their values. But this really talks about the superiority of small towns, even though Jason Aldean has never lived in a small town. He grew up in Macon. But he kind of presents as if he did sometimes. So it's not a radical shift maybe from what certain portions of country music has represented in the past. They've flited around the area of being pro-Trump. And now Jason Aldean is finally coming out and saying, I don't care if I'm divisive, I want to rile people up. That's a difference from what we've seen in the past where it was more subtle or people kept it out of the songs.",
