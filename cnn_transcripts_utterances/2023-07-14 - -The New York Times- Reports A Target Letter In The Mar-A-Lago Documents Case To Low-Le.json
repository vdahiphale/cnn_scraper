I'm John Berman and this is CNN TONIGHT or CNN Very Nearly Tomorrow, or since it's Friday, CNN Very Nearly Next Week. And next week really could be a big one in the various investigations into Donald Trump. This week alone has seen a litany of activity.On Monday, Trump lawyers filed a motion to delay any criminal trial, the classified documents case until the 12th of basically never. On Tuesday, a grand jury was selected in Georgia that could indict Trump for election interference there. On Thursday, special counsel Jack Smith urged Judge Aileen Cannon to reject Trump's delay, delay strategy. And we found out Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner testified before the grand jury in the DOJ investigation into Trump's role in January 6th. New today, Trump's team filed a petition in Georgia to throw out evidence and disqualify Fulton County DA Fani Willis. Also today, a CNN exclusive, sources say the Secretaries of State for both Pennsylvania and New Mexico have been interviewed by federal prosecutors in the election probe. And \"The New York Times\" reporting that a low-level employee at the Trump Organization has received a letter from the special counsel in the documents case warning of a possible indictment. This is a target letter. The employee testified before the grand jury, possibly about security camera footage at Mar-a-Lago, and prosecutors are trying to determine if the testimony was truthful. So, if that all seems like a lot, it's because it is a lot. Next week, too, on Tuesday, Judge Aileen Cannon will hold her first hearing in the classified documents case. The hearing will be about how to handle classified information involved in the case. So, with all of this, I have to catch my breath. How will Trump's team handle, in the words of Bananarama, this cruel, cruel summer? I want to start with CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. Counselor, great to see you tonight. Actually, I want to start with the news that came most recently, which is this \"New York Times\" report of a target letter in the Mar-a-Lago documents case to this low-level Trump Organization employee. The bigger picture, what does that tell you what's going on here?",

They pressured state and local officials asking them to find votes, trying to get them to throw the electoral votes. They pressured Mike Pence when all else failed, trying to pressure him to violate his oath and the Constitution to throw away electoral votes.

He was appointed to do a thorough investigation, analyze the facts and the law, and if it turns out that people are responsible for this attack upon democracy, for this threat to the peaceful transition of power, but the evidence doesn't go as high as Donald Trump, the special counsel has not failed in his obligation. He's going to just call it the way he sees it. So -- but I think the whole case is about intent. There's not any question what happened. We all watched it. I mean, the American people are witnesses. If there was a witness list, there would be two or three hundred million people who would be put on this witness list. It's a matter of whether or not Donald Trump had the requisite criminal intent.

That's the best kind of evidence.Then I would look to evidence that he was told by credible sources, he had lost. That's not as good because there's other people who told him he had won.

It has been all day long. Just a huge number of investigators who have been in that home, pulling out evidence throughout the day. Several different jurisdictions represented here today. Investigators also say that Mr. Heuermann became increasingly brazen during all of this, using burner phones to search, for instance, about the investigation itself. That was concerning to them. They also say in taunting one of the victims -- they say that he used a burner phone to call a relative of Melissa Barthelemy, one of one of his victims, telling that person that he had sexually assaulted and killed their relative. The next court hearing for Mr. Heuermann is set for August 1st. John.",

The fact that he lived in Massapequa, which is where the calls were coming from, the taunting calls that we knew about, and he also, he worked in Midtown Manhattan, which is also where some of the taunting calls had come from. He had been called potentially a contractor, possibly. It all kind of lines up. There's nothing really surprising. What's surprising is why it took so long.",

She was a sex worker, she'd invite a client over and then a guy would jump in one of her friends and say this is my girlfriend and then they would empty the pockets of the John. The John just would give the money and then go away.They had done this to a man a couple days apparently before she had gone missing and they had described the man as being 6'4 to 6'6. He drove a Chevy Avalanche, which is not a typical car, and it was a dark color, not a typical car on Long Island. And he was, you know, just a very big guy. The fact that they had that information and also knew that this killer was probably from the Massapequa area, it seems like they could have narrowed him down, but we know that the Suffolk County Police Department had so much corruption. And we know that they had kicked out the FBI a year into it, that that's one of the reasons why they weren't able to get it. But he should have been caught way, way earlier.",

They did, you know, this was an interesting way to go about capturing this guy, because they were able to go through a grand jury, able to get apparently 300 subpoenas, and they were subpoenaing everything from his burner phones to his Google searches, and that's where we saw all of these searches. And there's still a lot of questions, you know? There are 10 canonical, you know, sort of Long Island serial killer, victims that were found on Ocean Parkway.

We have the two victims, Valerie Mack and Jessica Taylor, whose bodies were found in Gilgo Beach as well as in Manorville, which is a few miles east of Gilgo Beach.

We have Fire Island Jane Doe and we have the biological Asian male.There is so much difference between these victims as opposed to the four victims of the Gilgo Four who were all petite, who were all using Craigslist and the internet in order to find their clients, and were all found in a similar fashion, wrapped in the burlap and that sort of thing. {23:35:00] So, I think it's very possible that there is not only another killer out there, but multiple killers.",

SAG-AFTRA has joined the Writers' Guild on strike after failing to reach a deal with studios this week. This is the first time since 1960 that both actors and writers have been on strike together.The union's demands include better pay, benefits, streaming residuals and protections on artificial intelligence use. As part of the strike, that means SAG members won't do on-camera work, such as acting and singing. Off-camera work, including voice acting and narration, means no auditions, no rehearsals, and really no promotional activities, including premieres, festivals, and press junkets. Hollywood basically shut down. With me now, actress and SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, along with SAG-AFTRA's National Executive Director and Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland. Thank you both so much for being with us. Fran, Madam President, if I might say. The demands include, as I said, better paying benefits, streaming residuals, protections on AI use.

They constantly canceled our negotiating appointments.I thought maybe they were really duking it out to try and come up with some deep inroads for the negotiations. And it didn't work out that way. I think they duped us to have more time to promote their summer movies, but nothing significant came out of it. It was a gross disappointment.

The union spent that time trying to make sure that our members' minimum salaries even keep up with inflation, and that our members working in 2023 don't make less than they made in 2020, or even under the proposals from the companies in 2026 working for less than they made in 2020. That, you know, these are all proposals that we came forward with in good faith, and to have these corporate, you know, mega corporations tell us that these proposals run realistic, like Bob Iger did in an interview just the other day. You know, while they are paying corporate salaries -- executive salaries that are far more than many of these proposals would ever cost, it's really out of step with where the American public is. It's certainly out of step with where our membership is. And I have every belief, as Fran just said, that our members are ready, willing, and able to do what it takes to make sure that we win this strike.

And I mean, literally, injury. Blistered feet, heat stroke, hose burns. More on that in just a moment.In Phoenix, they have had 15 straight days above 110 degrees. And Harriet was telling you they've hit record temperatures not dropping below the 90s at night. The lows haven't dropped below the 90s, which is really dangerous. \"The Washington Post\" has an amazing story chronicling some of the dangers when the pavement temperatures can reach 160 degrees and anything metal or shiny is just treacherous. People are burned by their seat belts or mailboxes, swimmers attempting to walk across not so cool decks. The hospital has seen truckers who drive barefoot step onto parking lot surface and end up badly blistered. And on the hottest days, patients have been scalded by the water coming out of their garden hoses. Be safe there because there's not a lot of relief in sight.
