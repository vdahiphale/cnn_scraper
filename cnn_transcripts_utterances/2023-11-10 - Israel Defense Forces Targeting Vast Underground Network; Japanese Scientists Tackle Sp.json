Israel is going after Hamas`s underground infrastructure. This soldier shows an electrical system he says is used to circulate air underground. The IDF says it has destroyed 130 tunnel shafts since the start of the war. That`s just a small fraction of what`s known as Gaza`s Metro. Israel says there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels below Gaza. In 2018, CNN was given an exclusive look at a Palestinian Islamic Jihad tunnel inside Gaza. Its concrete walls creating a durable underground maze that favors the defender. Tunnels can pose problems for even advanced militaries. But Israel faces an even greater challenge. Hamas is believed to be holding many of the approximately 240 hostages underground, possibly in different groups. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

As they walk, they wave white flags, a symbolthat for centuries signals that the flag bearer is not fighting. The Hamas controlled Health Ministry said this week that more than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza, with that number largely made up of vulnerable populations, including more than 4000 children, 2600 women and 600 elderly. These numbers cannot be independently verified, though, by CNN. With more on the residents of Gaza, we turn now to our Salma Abdelaziz. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocents. The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the strip to southwards. Most recently opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time. Pushing thousands here to Salah al-Din Street, where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. The only way to reach the route is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there`s no fuel, he says. They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. The U.N. calls this exodus forcible displacement and accuses Israel of the collective punishment of some 2 million people. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Let`s turn now to space, where Japanese scientists are thinking about our rising space waste problem. Researchers at Kyoto University inJapan are building wooden satellites, hoping to soon send them into space. Why wood, not the usual metal? Well, when satellites are no longer in use, they come back into Earth`s atmosphere, where they break up into metallic particles, that litters the layer of the Earth we call the stratosphere. That`s the second atmospheric layer of Earth that rises anywhere from 6 to 12 miles above the Earth`s surface, depending on where you are on the equator. And we`re getting a lot of space debris. In 2021, we sent up nearly 1400 satellites into space, with scientists worried that this future satellite trash, if you will, could damage the ozone. The Kyoto University researchers say wooden satellites can hold up to metal ones because there`s no oxygen in space that can break down the wood. But when the satellite has run its course and it starts rapidly descending back towards Earth, poof, they just turn into gas. They`ve tested three types of wood so far, with the Japanese bigleaf magnolia coming up as the winner so far, if all goes well, we might just see a prototype in space next year. Ten second trivia. Which basketball star holds the all-time 3-point contest record for points scored in a single round? Steph Curry, Sabrina Ionescu, Diana Taurasi, or Larry Bird, cuckoo. In July lie of this year, WNBA Star Sabrina Ionescu broke Steph Curry`s record by hitting 25 of 27 three pointers. For today`s story, getting a 10 out of 10. We`re getting secrets of success from one of the hardest working, most focused people you could ever meet. WNBA superstar Sabrina Ionescu plays for the New York Liberty, and she`s set to represent Team USA at the Olympics in 259 days. I caught up with her at practice this week to ask some questions just for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
