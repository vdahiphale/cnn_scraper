Including support activities for those who have been in isolation experiences like the ones she has been in.But there's a lot of controversy as well around this prisoner swap because of who Griner was exchanged for. On paper Viktor Bout has a very different track record. He is accused of being an arms dealer. Whereas Griner was accused of having about a gram of cannabis oil. Bout accused of being an arms dealer. Nicknamed the \"Merchant of Death\" for supplying weapons and fueling conflicts across Africa and other conflict ridden areas. So very serious concern about this exchange. And Bout already in Russia and giving an interview, celebrating his release. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN was able to get exclusive access and exclusive interview with Whelan after Griner's release. Where he expressed his concern about President Biden's ability to get them out. He also expressed that Russia sees them as a more important, more valuable prisoner than Griner was perhaps. The Biden administration says for its part that there's no option toget Whelan out in this specific exchange. But that they continue to do everything they can to secure his release. But just another reminder of how complicated these negotiations are. And yet again, it is a diplomatic victory for President Biden. But he's still vowing to try to get Whelan out as well -- Kim.",

And provided some of those critical text messages to the committee before he stopped cooperating. Second, conservative lawyer John Eastman, who was advising Trump and was part of those meetings we've heard about to pressure then Vice President Mike Pence to try to be a part of a plan to overturn the election results. Third, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who advised Trump and who the committee believes played a critical role in trying to weaponize the Justice Department to go along with Trump's attempt to stay in power. And finally, a familiar face, former Trump lawyer and ally Rudy Giuliani, who we saw played a key role in promoting claims of election fraud and trying to convince state legislatures to take steps to overturn the election results.

This piece of legislation will protect the marriages of millions of Americans all across the country. It will protect the marriages for same-sex couples and interracial couples. This is something that really started to bubble up after Roe v. Wade was overturned over the summer. There became concern here on The Hill that interracial marriages and same-sex marriages could be threatened if the Supreme Court turned its attention to that.So, lawmakers here began conversations in the fall about this. They had hoped to get a vote before the midterms, just couldn't quite get there and now that everyone is back, they did. So, it passed the Senate earlier with 12 Republican Senators joining all of the Democrats and then it went through the House today. Again, with 39 House Republicans supporting Democrats to get this legislation through. And what it does, is it requires every state to recognize the laws of other states. Which simply means if your marriage is recognized in one state, if you travel to another one, no matter what their laws are, your marriage will be recognized. And for so many here on Capitol Hill, this was really important to do. They wanted to get it done in this lame-duck session. And again, now another piece of bipartisan legislation heads to President Biden for his signature. Jessica Dean, CNN, Capitol Hill. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Pele has been sending messages of support to this young Brazilian team here at the World Cup. Although, we haven't heard anything from him ahead of this match as yet -- ahead of Croatia.But it was Neymar who became just the third Brazilian player to score in three World Cups when he found the back of the net against South Korea. That was a goal that took him within one of Pele's record, 77 goals for Brazil. And it's difficult, really, to look past him, potentially equaling that record against Croatia, even though they don't concede many. They've only conceded two in their four games so far in this tournament. Terrifying is the word that Zlatko Dalic used and that is because it's not just Neymar. This is a Brazilian side scoring from all over the pitch. And they, very much are confident that they are going to be able to lift that record extending sixth world titles next Sunday.",
