And as early voting in Georgia sets of records right now, the high stakes midterm election is now only three weeks away. We're following new flashpoints in the battle for control of Congress, including a new promise by President Biden on abortion rights for women. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer, you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Our top story this hour, widespread blackouts across Ukraine as Russia strikes major power and water facilities. Ukrainian officials warning that Moscow's attacks have already destroyed nearly a third of their energy infrastructure. CNN Senior International Correspondent Fred Pleitgen has our report. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Russia hitting Ukraine's infrastructure with massive strikes across the country. Power plants in several regions targeted by both kamikaze drones and cruise missiles. This video purports to show Ukraine taking down one of them, but some hitting civilian areas like this residential building in the southern town Mykolaiv. KSENIA HORPYNYCH, MYKOLAIV RESIDENT (through translator): We woke up at 1:45 a.m. because of a very loud explosion. It's impossible to describe it. There was so much dust. PLEITGEN (voice-over): The Ukrainian say 30 percent of their energy infrastructure has already been destroyed by Moscow's bullets. Key installations like this power plant in the city Dnipro hit by multiple missiles. Ukraine's air defense is sometimes also overwhelmed by swarms of cheap kamikaze drones. PRES. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINE (through translator): The world can and must stop this terrors. When we talk about Ukraine's need for air and missile defense systems, we talk about real lives taken by terrorists. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Kyiv believes Moscow is resorting to drone strikes because its forces are running out of precision cruise missiles, stocks of sub weapons already critically low Ukraine's military intelligence player. But Russia's army is showing no signs of letting up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): During the last 24 hours, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continued to deploy long range high precision weapons both air and sea based on Ukraine's military command sites and energy infrastructure. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Ukrainian officials believe despite Russia strikes, its forces will prevail on the battlefield. The senior intelligence leader saying Russia's defeat is inevitable.

This kind -- there's a certain kind of Republican figure, Liz Cheney's another example of it, that is going away.
