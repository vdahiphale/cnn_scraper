Secretary Raffensperger, good to see you. So, Georgia has broken some records for single-day early voting, but overall, in aggregate, the number of early votes cast is far less than in the 2021 runoff, because this runoff has had fewer days of early voting. Doesn't that suggest that this new law is hurting the cause of enfranchisement in encouraging as many Georgians as possible to vote? BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATEfour years ago I was in a runoff and we had 1.5 million total votes show up. Already we're at nearly 1.9 million, over a million probably tomorrow, so we'll be at 3 million so I think we're still going to have strong turnout. And historically, not the same number of people show up for runoffs as show up for the general races, but we've had strong one-day totals. Tomorrow we'll have strong turnout. The counties will have all of their precincts open and we've really worked hard to keep those lines short and we're expecting strong turnout tomorrow and we think that we'll keep the lines short. I think we have movement through there and people to exercise their votes. We've actually already had over 80,000 people that voted in this runoff that didn't vote in the fall at all. So, that's what's you're really seeing. Those people that were kind of sitting back and watching things are getting engaged in this race. So, we think both sides are energized.",

Those men, you know, were people of strong character and they didn't have to worry about having runoff races because they had broad-based appeal.

It's a relief from scenes like this, Bakhmut's Ukrainian field hospital. He's been defending this Ukrainian town from Russia's most intense assault along an 800-mile front. Artillery duels and trench warfare have almost destroyed Bakhmut as Russia throws its army at a bid for victory after months of defeats to the north and south. Defending against his Russian motherland is a religious imperative for Caesar. CAESAR (through translation):   The fighting is very brutal now, he says. There are very few prisoners. KILEY (on camera):  When you see those Russians in your gun sights, what do you think and what do you feel? CAESAR (through translation):   I believe that these people who have broken the law of man and the law of God, I have no pity for them.

Trump has yet to hold a public rally in an early voting state or even leave his home state of Florida, baffling many who experienced the frenetic phase of his previous campaigns. CNN's Kristen Holmes is following this for us. Kristen, what are you hearing from these Trump allies about why they're worried? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENTadvisers say that while they do believe that Trump is the undisputable frontrunner in 2024. This isn't really a time he can squander particularly given that there are so many Republican heavyweights who seem more than interested in knocking Trump off of his throne. And this inactivity in the campaign has many of these allies wondering is Trump's heart really in it. Are we going to see some kind of surge, new energy in 2023, or is Trump not going to be able to meet this new political environment. And Jake, when you look at the campaign and what's happened since, there really only been three notable events. The first one was one that was unintended and actually dreaded by Trump's team and that was Attorney General Merrick Garland announcing a special counsel to oversee those investigations into Trump. And Trump's announcement actually seemed to be the catalyst for that. The other was a dinner with a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi. And the other one after that was Trump calling for the termination of the Constitution. I want to read to you what one former Trump adviser told Gabby Orr, our colleague, who worked on the story with me. They said, \"So far, he's gone down from his bedroom, made an announcement, gone back up to his bedroom and hasn't been seen since except to have dinner with a white supremacist.\" And again, this was a former Trump adviser. And when you talk about those GOP heavy-hitters who are looking to knock Trump off of his throne, part of the reason we were told by so many sources that he announced so early was in order to freeze the field and that has really had seemingly a lack of impact in that effect. Just days after his announcement at the Republican Jewish Coalition, a number of Republicans came out, several of them just lashing out at Trump, others, former allies, indicating that they were willing to take him on in 2024. And Jake, I will note that according to the campaign, this is all intentional. They are taking a breather and planning for the next two years. And that of course, is a plan that these allies are looking forward to seeing.",

And that is part of what's going on here. It's just it's a lot of sick people wanting these medications. Also, unfortunately, COVID numbers have been spiking back up. Still relatively low the week of November 26, there were 33,000 people admitted to the hospital with COVID, 33,000, and that's up 27 percent from the previous week.

Jake, I think that sometimes people forget that children get the flu.Let's take a look at this graph and you'll understand what I mean. That top line, that red line, that's flu hospitalization rates for the elderly, for people over 65. But right next to it, right the next line under is the yellow line, which is children, hospitalization rates for children ages zero to four, the littlest children for the flu. So, unfortunately this virus hits the very old and the very young. And when you see this you it makes sense that in some places, you might be seeing these shortages. We're also having these supply chain issues still lingering after COVID.",

And that is an accusation, but it's also feels like a mission to them. I mean, you're hearing there how Prince Harry talks about the pain and the suffering of women who marry into the royal family and the royal family has a duty to protect those women and they failed in that duty. And in fact, were planting stories to undermine the Duchess of Sussex.All of these things, of course, the palace, the wider family absolutely deny. They say they did protect and welcome Meghan into the royal family. But we'll have to see what's in this documentary to back up these claims. And no one's seen the full documentary here in London as far as I know. So we don't know what's in it. So it's very difficult for the family to respond at this point.

The traditional way of dealing with all of these issues is not to respond to them by the Royal Family. But we'll have to see what happens this time, Jake, because the late Queen has now passed, the king is now in control. Charles will now decide how to respond to this. Prince William has also been elevated to the Prince of Wales. I get the feeling that they're pretty fed up with all of these accusations sitting unanswered particularly from the Oprah Winfrey interview, for example. And I think they may respond this time, but they want to see what's in it of course first. We get to see that for the first time on Thursday.",
