Upping the ante just hours ahead of a meeting between the Russian president and his security council. The commander says Russia wants a friendly Ukraine while acknowledging a tense situation on the ground and a very difficult situation in the southern Kherson region.That's where Ukrainian forces have made significant advances in recent weeks. The head of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency says he hopes to recapture the occupied city of Kherson by year's end. One of the significant victories he's predicting. And by next summer the Intel chief expects a Ukrainian victory saying \"Russia's loss is inevitable.\" Still, Russian forces continue to launch drone and missile attacks across Ukraine striking critical infrastructure. Ukraine's president says 30 percent of his country's power stations have been destroyed since October 10th. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAN RICE, SPECIAL ADVISER TO UKRAINIAN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: The Russian attack under this new general is ruthlessly attacking the civilian population which is a war crime, but they've never been charged with any of the other wars. But they're attacking the cities trying to attack the grid, making it a very difficult winner. They are trying to -- in my opinion, trying to get to the negotiating table to try to go back to the 2014 lines. Ukraine won't have it. Ukraine wants all of their land back back to the '91 lines. They really need air defense systems they need aircraft. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That drone specifically has about a 250 or 130-mile range. Has a max speed of 200 kilometers per hour. It has forced lodged per missiles. But that particular drone has the ability to see the battlefield. And it can shape the targeting of the Shahed 136 drone which we have seen the last couple of days going in in swarms which don't have a camera on board. So, these two drones work in tandem. They are very different. One is an unmanned combat aerial vehicle. The other one, the Shahed, is a loitering munitions drone. I don't mean to get too technical but they have to work together in order to attack the targets. And it is very difficult because these drones work below the normal level. They have a very low radio -- radar signature. So, it's hard to knock them down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But if you look at the sheer numbers, one thing you need when you're invading an island like Taiwan is a large and powerful navy.
