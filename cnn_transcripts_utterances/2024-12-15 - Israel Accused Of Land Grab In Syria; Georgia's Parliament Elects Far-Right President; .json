      "sentences": "Well, welcome to all you watching us around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. This is CNN Newsroom.Western and regional leaders meet to discuss the future of Syria as Israel is accused of an attempted land grab in the midst of the chaos. More unrest in Georgia as the parliament elects a far right former football star as the country's next president. And U.S. federal agencies face pressure to give the public more information following weeks of mysterious drone sightings on the East Coast. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. has been in direct contact with the lead group of Syrian rebels, a group Washington still considers a terrorist organization. The news comes after Saturday's diplomats meet in Jordan to discuss Syria's future, attended by representatives from the U.S., Europe, and the region. Blinken said the contact with HTS was an effort to locate missing journalist Austin Tice. He also explained what's expected of a new Syrian government, including respecting the rights of all Syrians. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes, we've been in contact with HTS and with other parties. We have impressed upon everyone we've been in contact with the importance of helping find Austin Tice and bringing him home. And we've also shared the principles that I just laid out for our ongoing support, principles, again, that have now been adopted by countries throughout the region and well beyond. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Hezbollah's leader says he's hoping the rebels will consider Israel an enemy. Israel has continued to carry out airstrikes on Syria since the rebels took power, and Israeli troops have moved into the buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli occupied Golan Heights. Israel says the move is temporary, but Arab countries are calling it an attempted land grab.Last hour, I spoke with Louis Fishman, an associate professor at City University of New York's Brooklyn College, and I asked him about tensions between Syrian rebels and Israel. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "A week ago, Assad was just escaping the country. So, we need to give it time.And I think with Israel, you're going to see that eventually it will pull back. They've hit numerous military targets throughout the week, basically destroying most of the military power in Syria. So, we're going to have to see what happens with that. But at the same time, we're going to have to look at, you know, what's going to happen in the country. And I think, first and foremost, is that we have to remember that this is about the Syrian people. And this is about the resilience of the Syrian people. And they're going to decide their future and how they move forward. So, we're going to-- in the next few months, there's going to be lots of ups and downs, on one side with Israel, but on the other side with Turkey, with other powers, trying to make a power grab, basically, in a country that is on a new path.",

      "sentences": "Yes. The Syrian people obviously will have a strong say, but as you say, so many other countries involved. So, let's look at that bigger picture. Right now, the U.S. is taking this central role in the Syria summit that was taking place this weekend in Jordan. You've suggested that with Iran marginalized, the U.S. has come out of this as the sole international power in the region.So, I'm wondering about the U.S. role in, in rebuilding a new Syrian government. I mean, the let's face it, the American track record for rebuilding in the Middle East is questionable, to say the least. So, what challenges might the U.S. face in promoting stability and preventing further conflict?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that's the million dollar question here. As we know, Trump is somewhat of a wild card. And at first he said, you know, well, we're not going to get involved in Syria, but that's not going to happen. We know that Russia has pulled out their forces, and as you said, that Iran is completely marginalized.So, today, the only power in the Middle East is the United States. And it's a bit ironic that if it is the only power, why are there so many conflicts in the region. So, I think the Trump administration is going to have to make some very bold decisions about how to limit Israel's power and to also introduce some plan for the Palestinians, although, unfortunately, I don't see it coming with the Trump administration. [03:05:12] Now, in the greater picture with Syria, I think what we're going to see is there's going to be tensions, of course, between Turkey and the United States. The U.S., you know, has about 900 military personnel in Northern Syria. And that is the area that's under Kurdish control that is going to go head on with the Turkish-backed militias, which already started. So, in some sense, I think what this conflict has showed us, or this new beginning in Syria is that everything really is connected. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A video from the Russian naval base in Tartus shows camouflaged Russian equipment and troop activity. Earlier this week, satellite images showed what appear to be Russians packing up military equipment at one of its bases.Now, you can see the location of the two Russian bases on this map. Russia operates an air base at Crimea Khmeimim and a naval base in the port city of Tartus. Meanwhile, social video from Homs shows a Syrian waving a shoe as Russian troops pass, a gesture that's considered an insult in Middle Eastern culture. Hospital officials in Gaza say a strike on a municipal building has killed the mayor of Deir al Balah and at least 11 other people. Gaza Civil Defense says the building was targeted while employees were inside. Two children are among the victims. The Israeli military says it intended to kill the mayor, accusing him of providing Hamas with combat assistance. The IDF also says it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians. Gaza's government media office calls it a heinous assassination. The sitting president of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, who's been vowing to stay in office, says lawmakers have made a mockery of democracy by installing a new president. On Saturday, Georgian lawmakers elected Mikheil Kavelashvili, a far right ex-soccer player. Reuters reports he'll be inaugurated on December 29th. Opposition parties weren't at the vote, they've been boycotting parliament. Now, this is the latest escalation between the pro-Russian government and the opposition, which is fighting to join the European Union. Kavelashvili was elected by an electoral college of lawmakers, not the usual national election. Hundreds have been arrested as pro-Europe demonstrators have been protesting for weeks against Georgia's pro-Russian political tilt. And joining me now live is Tina Dolbaia, associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and she's in Washington, D.C. Thank you so much for being here with us. So, things were already at a boiling point before the installation of this new president. Now, there's this, the current president vowing to stay. So, we're heading towards a showdown, I presume, on that inauguration day two weeks from now. How do you think this will all play out?",

Yes, as you have correctly mentioned, the inauguration is happening in two weeks on December 29th. The acting president, President Salome Zourabichvili, has said that she's not stepping down. She remains the legitimate president of Georgia because the current government is illegitimate and unconstitutional. Therefore, the current presidential elections that took place today were also illegitimate and unconstitutional.And there are, as you have mentioned, hundreds of thousands of protesters who are in the streets for more than two weeks already also agree with President Zourabichvili. The opposition, progressive opposition, also agrees with President Zourabichvili. As for the international community, so far, Kavelashvili was congratulated on his election by several presidents and leaders around the world. This was president of Azerbaijan. We also had Khachaturyan, the leader of Armenia, congratulate him, some leaders from Serbia and Belarus.",

Now, the crisis was I guess sparked by the government's decision to suspend pursuing membership in the E.U., and that's what sparked these massive protests. We were showing pictures of that just moments ago. I think the polling suggests some 80 percent of Georgians want closer ties with the E.U. So, that's why there's been so much anger. There's been, you know, some violence in the streets.How far do you think the protesters will go and how far could the government go to suppress them?",

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, at the local level, the state level, and here in Washington, are pushing for more answers and saying that they need more transparency from the administration. This after some of those reported drone sightings happen near residential areas as well as critical infrastructure and restricted sites.Now, U.S. officials from the federal agencies leading the response those reported drone sightings in the tri-state area are acknowledging the unusual nature of what is being observed, but at the same time attempting to downplay the reported drone sightings. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that his agency knows of no threat or nefarious activity. He said that the government has state of the art technology as well as experts to New Jersey following those first reported sightings and that technology has not confirmed any of the drone sightings. Instead, it's confirmed that at least some of the reports were actually small aircraft. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: We believe that there are cases of mistaken identity where drones are actually small aircraft and people are misidentifying them. There very well may be drones in the sky, of course, but those are commercially available. One can go into a convenience store and buy a small drone. There are also commercial drones as well, (END VIDEO CLIP)",
