Subsequent to that there have been these gigantic studies -- hundreds of thousands of kids around the world who are vaccinated and then followed for a decade and a half compared to kids to were not vaccinated over that time. So these are these huge medi-analyses. They did not find an association. They studied this several times. There was 10 -- at least 10 different studies that did this over the last 25 years. So this is a question that has been asked, and maybe appropriately asked, and it's been answered. And there's not a connection between vaccines and autism. There was one study that came out five years ago showing that, in fact, unvaccinated kids had a higher likelihood of developing autism. A small association there.

This morning we're learning new details on how the incoming Trump administration is preparing to crack down on the border and start mass deportations and detentions of migrants. Sources are telling CNN people close to President-elect Trump and his aides are already laying the groundwork for expanding detention facilities and preparing executive action.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez has details for us now on this. And I guess the question is if they're already doing this preparation, how soon they might try to launch it when he walks into the White House. PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, they want to launch this as soon as he gets into the White House -- so on Inauguration Day. Now, of course, there are multiple pieces at play here. For example, there are executive actions that are being worked on that could be rolled out on the first day. Operations, though, are trickier. Now, of course, taken together, Sara, this is a return to the hardline immigration policies that we saw in Trump's first term and will mark a dramatic change for migrants and immigrants in the United States. Now, you see them there on your screen. Some of these may sound familiar, and that is the point. This is about bringing back policies they had before and building them at scale. So, for example, you see \"Remain in Mexico.\" That required migrants to stay in Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings in the U.S. It was controversial at the time. It didn't -- it was pulled back during the Biden administration. And you also see reviewing regional capability for housing migrants. This is part of the mass detention-mass deportation plans. Where could they put those migrants that they arrest in the interior of the United States before they get repatriated? Bringing back family detention. That was discontinued by President Biden in 2021. What that means is essentially detention for families. It's something that administrations have done. The Obama administration did it. The Trump administration did it. It's been a practice though that has been widely criticized by immigrant advocates. And making detention mandatory and ending the release of migrants, something that has happened, again, across administrations because there haven't been enough federal resources, and they are trying to shore that up. And one of the ways that they want to do that, Sara, is through a national emergency declaration. Remember, the Trump administration tried to do that with the border wall the last time around. This was a way that they wanted to unlock those Pentagon funds. Well, they are looking at that again and trying to craft it so that they can use a declaration like that for their plans of mass detention and mass deportation. Now, the team that's going to be charged with all of this is coming together. We saw that this week. Tom Homan as the border czar, Stephen Miller at the White House, and Kristi Noem as Homeland Security secretary. Homan talked about how the three of them will work together last night. Take a listen.

I mean, I think you look at the numbers in Arizona where RFK was very popular. I think RFK -- I mean, there, of course, is controversy but he has changed the conversation when it comes to public health. People haven't really been talking about the fact that 75 percent of Americans are either obese or overweight. One in four Americans suffers a significant mental health disorder. We should be having these conversations. I know there's a lot of controversy and skepticism about what he says about fluoride in the water.

By most indications in the exit polling and by some new indications for us in our Axios that engages monthly swing voter focus groups, what we're hearing from key blocs of voters is really that it was inflation and how the economy has impacted them. That is overwhelmingly the reason why so many of those voters who were sort of persuadable switched back to now President-elect Trump. And in this panel that we just conducted this week we had voters telling us overwhelmingly they don't want him to use his power to go on a retribution tour against enemies. They're not looking to sort of blow up all of the boxes. They want to focus on the economy. And we've heard from other voters they want to focus on unity and unifying people. So there is a risk. But unlike many other politicians, I think President-elect Trump is not looking at his -- at the next 30 years of running for office. He's looking at what constitutionally is -- would be his final four years in office. And he promised that he was going to hold -- change institutions in his mold. He has foreshadowed this. And I think he's less concerned than a conventional politician would be with am I allowed to do that, or what if my party gets mad at me, or what if the Senate pushes back.
