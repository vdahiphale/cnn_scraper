I saw that happen by Jack Ruby. And it just was bizarre. The whole thing was bizarre.And then the Warren Commission comes out a year later, and I didn't think very much about it because I was, you know, 17, 18 years old. I mean I -- but then books started coming out, \"Rush to Judgment.\" I started listening to other people. I read everything I could. And over the 60 years, we have had revelations after revelation. And -- but people don't really understand how it works in the aggregate. And so I decided, because I've been studying this for forever. I've been to Daley Plaza many times. I've talked to everybody who was alive at the time. I've talked to forensic experts. I've talked to everybody. I decided to see if we could put together, in a comprehensive, deep dive as to what actually happened that day with the best information that we have at this point and put it all together. And we do eventually tell you what we think happened. We name names of actual shooters and we talk about the positions those shooters were in. And this is based on talking to hundreds and hundreds of people and reading many, many books and looking at all -- recently there was a documentary about the Parkland doctors. Every single one of them said, all the - all the shots on Kennedy were entrance wounds. Well, if that's the case, then the shots didn't come -- there were shots from the sixth floor, but those shots are not the ones that killed Kennedy.",

In total, 15 people were injured in those shootings, five were killed, including four women in Tennessee who were all related. The suspect in that shooting has been found dead. And the U.S. is on pace to reach a record, 700 mass shootings this year. That is according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. And that would make it the most in a single year. It would be more than double the number of mass shootings in just 2018, the year when 17 people were murdered, 17 more injured at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, that remains the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history.And, today, six Democratic lawmakers will tour the scene for the final time because that building has remained largely untouched since the shooting. The wall still riddled with bullets. Blood still on the ground. And now that the criminal trials have concluded, the building will be demolished next year. Joining us now, Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. He is a graduate of Marjory Stoneman Douglas. He currently represents Parkland in Congress. Thank you very much for being with us. Tell me about your goal. I mean just to -- it's going to be incredibly difficult, I'm sure, for those who have not walked through the hallways to do so. What do you hope they take away from it? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, thanks. Thanks for having me this morning. So, I've done this before. I took a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress through the building before. And I'm taking -- this is the second group of bipartisan lawmakers that I'm taking through the building. The building is literally a time capsule. It's exactly as it was the day of the shooting minus the victims. Every backpack that was there, every shoe that fell off, the homework that was on the desk, what was on the dry erase board that day, it's exactly as it was. And it's unique because they wanted to keep it that way for the trials. And so what I'm hoping that it accomplishes is that, to make this real, when we see these mass shootings, we see camera angles from far away, we see a picture of the building, but never see inside. And here in Florida, when I brought lawmakers to the building when I was in the state legislature, I brought Republicans and Democrats to the building, it led to the largest bipartisan gun violence prevention and mental health school safety bill in Florida history. And so, for me, this is about seeing what failed that day, not just from gun safety regulations, but also from school safety rules as well.",

You're talking about a-plus rated members of the NRA came to the building, folks that have, you know, every child in their house has an AR-15 and had never voted for gun regulations, gun violence prevention rules in their entire political career. And when they saw what it looked like, when they saw the devastation, they realized, well, look, we have a Second Amendment that we can protect, but we also have to keep guns out of the hand of people who shouldn't have them. And that's what led to the bipartisan deal.And so, look, look what's going on in, you know, in wars in Ukraine, wars in the Middle East. We get those images beamed onto the TV and into our social media every single day. But when there is a mass shooting in people's neighborhood, they don't get to see it. No, no, if they saw it, it would have a dramatic impact on recognizing that there is a balance that has to happen in this country between protecting the Second Amendment and people's rights to defend themselves and also keeping kids safe in schools and movie theaters and grocery stores.",

They're very quiet. But, by the way, the same thing happens to my left, which is, when there is a protest that's on a foreign policy issue, like a ceasefire protest, right, but there's people in the crowd holding signs that say gas the Jews, kill the Jews, I don't see my colleagues on the left calling that out. And so anti-Semitism is easy to call out when it's across the aisle, right? Democrats have no problem calling out Marjorie Taylor Greene or Paul Gosar, right, across the aisle, and Republicans have no problem calling out the squad. But when they want to do it from within the party, they're super quiet.
