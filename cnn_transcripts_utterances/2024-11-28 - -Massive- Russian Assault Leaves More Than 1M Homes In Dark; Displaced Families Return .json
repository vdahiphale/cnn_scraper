We will discuss more with a Ukrainian parliament member. Plus, major concerns over President-elect Trump's pick to lead the National Institutes of Health. What this will mean for the U.S. health care system. And just because the balloons are down does not mean Thanksgiving celebrations are over. As Americans prepare for dinner, we will speak to an expert on how to have that best holiday. Like New York (ph), I'm Paula Newton. Zain and Bianna are off today, and this is \"One World.\" Ukraine's winter has set in, and Russia wants to leave its neighbors in the cold. Dozens of Russian drones and missiles were launched in attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight. It's left more than a million homes without power. In Kyiv, people took shelter in metro stations. Five people were reported to have been injured. Ukraine's energy ministry says this year alone, Russia has hit energy facilities 11 times, leaving millions in the dark. Now, earlier at a summit in Kazakhstan, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his military hit 17 targets in response to Ukraine using U.S.-made longer-range missiles. Nick Paton Walsh has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And regions across the country reporting temporarily or for a longer stint of time being without power. Kh-101 missiles fired by Russia past moving, able to get through a lot of Ukrainian air defenses. And clearly, Russia pushing hard to do as much damage as it can as we get into the darker, colder, freezing months of winter. A bid to cripple Ukrainian morale, already I think it's fair to say damaged by the relentless nature of drone strikes we've been seeing city after city hit by waves of these Iranian-made Shahid drones. A hundred eighty-eight drones in total fired by Russia, a record, say Ukrainian officials in the previous night. And that is, I think, just adding to a sense of how much. The Kremlin is throwing at this conflict in these months ahead. We've been seeing on the front lines deep concern from troops. They simply don't have the infantry, the manpower to slow Russian advances in the east, particularly around the town of Pokrovsk. Indeed, that's been reflected by Biden officials in the White House hinting that Ukraine really needs to drop its recruitment age down from 25 to 18 to simply get more buddies on the front line. And indications as well too of the likelihood of some sort of peace deal being requested for Ukraine to sign up to by the incoming Trump administration. His possible choice for a envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, hinting in previous writings that he'd like to see a freeze imposed upon the conflict in the front lines. Many we spoke to though on the front lines concerned about what damage Russia could indeed do in simply the months until January when Trump takes office. So fast is their progress on the front lines. We were shown maps by some Ukrainian commanders that they said were already out of date because Russia had pushed through what was indicated as the front lines in that particular area. So deeply concerning time here, but very powerful missile strikes impacting the lives of ordinary Ukrainians as we begin to head into the freezing months of winter.

So, it's good from all points of view to give us much more air defense and to do it right now. Secondly, with the permission to attack military targets inside Russia, we need to have with what to attack them, because it's not about dozens of missiles. We need hundreds of them. And the third thing, as I told you, we need finally to have a tough sanction, first of all, on Russian oil and gas industry, and especially when President-elect Trump said that he will drill, drill, drill. We need - - that is a good thing, because it will drop the oil price, and we need to put more sanctions, including secondary sanctions, on Russian oil and gas industry.

And I dare say we've kind of seen these patterns before from an incoming Trump administration, right? They really do break from precedent. STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER (on-camera): It certainly has been the case, at least the first go-around as well. And here's what it means. It means that the president-elect, at least as of now and at least not in writing, is not making a pledge to consider the interests of the American people above his personal and business interests. The rest of his cabinet will be signing a pledge that says that they will quote avoid both actual and apparent conflicts of interest and will quote hold only non-conflicting assets, such as assets exempt from conflict by regulation. Trump, remember, has a massive portfolio of businesses that he oversees. He now -- most of his wealth is now tied up in a social media company that owns True Social. What happens if businesses that are trying to curry favor with the U.S. government decide to massively advertise on Trump's social media website? He also has been selling trinkets and watches. What if foreign companies or foreign nationals try to buy one of his $100,000 watches to curry favor with him? He also has in recent months started a cryptocurrency venture with his families, and he is promising at the same time to push pro-crypto policies if he is president. What is the guarantee that he will make those decisions on really some massive financial implications that will benefit the American people at large and not just this company that he and his sons have started? So those are the sort of questions that the Trump administration and Trump himself could potentially put to bed by signing an ethics pledge and agreeing to potentially put his assets in some sort of blind trust like his predecessors have done.
