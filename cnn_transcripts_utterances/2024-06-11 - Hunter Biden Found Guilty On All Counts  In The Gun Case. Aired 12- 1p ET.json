Biden could face as much as 25 years in prison,but legal experts are saying that he will likely get a much lighter sentence than that. Now, the key question for the jury was whether Biden was knowingly addicted to drugs when he filled out a federal form to purchase a handgun in 2018. Once the jury agreed that he was, the verdicts then appear to have come fairly quickly.",

Jessica, can I just ask you, legally, the timing of the sentence, it seems to be rather arbitrary in that in the Trump case, it's coming just a matter of a few weeks following the jury reaching their verdict of guilty.

It's also possible that Trump's team could ask to push that sentencing date off, given the political calendar with the Republican convention just days after, the -- now on the books July 11th sentencing. So, we could see about that. But in this case, I mean, this has been a federal trial overseen by a federal judge. And I will say this judge, Maryellen Noreika, she has actually been quite prompt and pushing forward with this case. She moved this case along very quickly. There were a lot of requests for delays in the case itself that she refused to entertain. So, I think that that 120 days is probably pretty standard for a federal court and a federal judge, because this is definitely a judge in the Hunter Biden case who will not stand for any delays. So, I think this is just par for the course in the federal courtroom as opposed to the state courtroom where Donald Trump was found guilty on his charges.",

The prosecutors said that there was overwhelming evidence of Hunter Biden's guilt. And it seems like they were right, because it only took the jury three hours to reach this verdict. Now, to prove that he was guilty of these crimes, they needed to prove in the crimes of all 12 jurors unanimously that Hunter Biden was a drug user or a drug addict while he bought and possessed a gun in October 2018. It's against federal law, it's against U.S. law for drug users or drug addicts to buy guns or to own guns. And to convey that message to the jury, the prosecutors brought in devastating details of his drug use, his addiction, the relationships that he destroyed, his inability to get clean, how he was using crack cocaine almost every 20 minutes, meeting up with dealers at homeless encampments in L.A., trolling around the streets of Washington, D.C. to find crack cocaine. This is personal. It is devastating. And it hit -- it hit with the jury. And they agreed unanimously that the prosecution had proved this case that, yes, they -- that Hunter was a drug user around the time that he bought that gun. You mentioned the defense. They noted over and over and over that there was no eyewitness testimony presented during the case. No one said I saw him smoking crack on the day he bought the gun, the day after he bought the gun, the day before he bought the gun. But the prosecution very smartly in their closing arguments told the jury directly, we don't need to prove that. We just need to prove that he was using drugs around this same time.

Of course, only oneof those two men is a candidate for office, Donald Trump, of course. But this has been a massive weight on the entire Biden family. You know, experts and historians and people who know intimately the Bidens, they know that this must be weighing on the President's mind just as much as the other major issues that he's grappling with -- the war in Israel and Gaza, the situation in Ukraine, the immigration crisis at the border. This hits close to home. Just imagine it's hard enough doing a normal job, let alone running the free world. And then if your own son, now, is facing potential prison time, it has been devastating for them. It has been amazing for the Republicans, though, to flip this to the other side. And you asked about the politics. They loved it. They had put front and center in their impeachment case -- Hunter Biden front and center. The House Republicans spent a lot of last year investigating Hunter, investigating his laptop, looking into his financial dealings overseas and the money that he made in Ukraine and China. This is surely helpful to their efforts to dirty up the Biden family. And also, Bianna, it's just part one. There is another trial scheduled for September that gets to many of those financial dealings that have been so important to the Republican political attacks against Hunter and his father. There is a tax trial scheduled for September in L.A. for tax evasion and alleged false statements on his tax returns relating to the millions of dollars that he earned overseas. So this, frankly, is a very bad day for the President and his son. But it could get worse as we get deeper into the campaign season.",

We added a charge similar to this only because we wanted to get in certain evidence. But as a standalone charge to charge an addict, and they proved beyond a reasonable doubt, he's an addict. Congratulations. But to charge this type of case where he's lying on a form and he's being charged with possessing a gun as an addict, I have never, ever seen this case brought in my almost 30 years with the Justice Department.

He said -- Abbe Lowell now issuing the statement saying, \"We respect the jury process. And as we have done throughout the case, we will continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available to Hunter. \" So, obviously, Hunter Biden's legal team will immediately start working on an appeal. I will note that sentencing has been scheduled for about 120 days, maybe three to four months from now. If Hunter Biden is sentenced to any prison time, that will likely be paused as these appeals are ongoing, which we definitely expect because, you know, there have been a lot of rulings and cases in the past several years regarding gun laws. The Supreme Court a few years ago, they issued a ruling, Bruin, where they said that all laws regarding guns need to comport with the historical traditions that were in place at the time that the Second Amendment was put into place. And that has really opened up this door for a lot of litigation and quite frankly, a lot of confusion in the courts. And the idea is, well, if a certain restriction on guns didn't exist at the time of the nation's founding, then those laws shouldn't be in effect now. That any laws that aren't in effect should be the type that would have conformed with the way the founder s had believed things should be when they drafted the Constitution and the Second Amendment. And, you know, to that end, guys, you know, I'm getting a little complicated here, perhaps, but the Fifth Amendment Court of Appeals, granted it's a conservative court based in New Orleans, Louisiana, they actually, last year, ruled that gun laws, you know, saying that there's a prohibition on drug users from owning guns, they actually declared that all of those types of laws unconstitutional. So, it's quite possible that as Hunter Biden's legal team moves forward with their appeals. That case will move forward, as well, potentially at some point be heard by the Supreme Court. And, you know, what Hunter Biden's team is saying in their belief is that this conviction rests on very faulty legal grounds, that they will definitely be challenging here. But nonetheless, guys, I mean, this is a conviction, the first ever conviction of a President's child, as we are at the height of this 2024 campaign. Both presidential campaigns, Trump's and Biden's, now really embroiled in this legal drama as we wait for Donald Trump's sentencing in that state case on July 11th, if that date holds, and as Hunter Biden continues to go through the legal system with his sentencing, and then another case in federal court in California on tax fraud charges. So, just a lot going on in the legal arena at the same time as this campaign and upcoming election is happening.",

So many families who have had loved ones battle addiction understand the feeling of pride, seeing someone you love come out the other side and be so strong and resilient in recovery.\" He added, \"As I also said last week, I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I think the fundamental part of President Biden's statement is that he's trying toapproach this not from a legal perspective, but from the perspective of a father. So, you heard the President in that statement really reiterate his support and his love for Hunter Biden, while also acknowledging that addiction is something that impacts not just his family, but also many families around the country. You have often seen the Bidens turn to that point as they've talked about their son, Hunter Biden. That's one way that they framed a lot of this back in the 2020 campaign when Biden had faced off against former President Donald Trump and had expected that he would try to raise issues about his son, Hunter Biden, in the midst of that campaign. Secondly, you have President Biden trying to make this very clear distinction with Trump in saying that he will accept the verdicts, the outcome of this trial. Biden first said that last week in an interview with ABC News, where he also ruled out the possibility of pardoning his son, Hunter. Now, one question going forward, while the President has ruled out a pardon of his son, could he potentially consider a commutation of his son's sentence? That's likely a question that the White House will receive a bit later today when Karine Jean-Pierre briefs the press around 2:30. But really, this conclusion of this trial that has ended with three -- with Hunter Biden being found guilty on all three felony gun charges really caps off a very difficult and troublesome period for the Biden family. They have long grappled with the issues of Hunter's addiction. They were well aware that much of this would wind its way through the court. First Lady Jill Biden had been on hand for much of the trial. She walked out hand-in-hand with Hunter after the verdict today. But it's clear that the Biden campaign -- or the Biden family continues to stand by Hunter amid this conviction as they continue to try to show their love and support for their son.",

Quickly, let me ask you, just on the President's schedule today, perhaps a bit awkward given the subject and the context behind his son's guilty verdict today, he'll be speaking about gun safety in Washington.",

But it does potentially come at a politically awkward time just hours after his own son, Hunter Biden, is found guilty on three felony gun charges.

The specialcounsel in the case is expected to hold a news conference in just about 15 times, and we will bring that to you live when it happens. For now, we want to bring in Jeff Schwartz. He is a former judge in the state of Florida and a professor at the Thomas Cooley Law School. Jeff, thanks so much for joining us. It's interesting detail that we're just now getting in from one of the jurors in this case that said that jurors were split as recently as last night when they took an initial vote on whether to convict Hunter on the three criminal charges. When they returned Tuesday morning, there was only one woman who was not ready to convict. And over the next few hours, the jury discussed the elements of each crime, and the last holdout finally agreed to a guilty verdict. I guess for someone who is an expert in courts and obviously how juries process a case, it's no surprise that even if there's one holdout, usually, perhaps after more deliberation, they tend to side with the majority. JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE:  They do, and that's the essence of what has been referred to as an Allen charge. Even if a jury comes back and says that they are hopelessly deadlocked, the instruction basically says, if you're in the minority, go back in there and work some more. Listen to the people who are the majority and try to figure out why you disagree with them or whether why you disagree with them is not really a reasonable doubt. It's just some doubt that you've created for yourself. And eventually, the jury comes back with a verdict. I'm not surprised that last night, it was maybe six to six. Some people, because of things that happened in closing argument and otherwise, just felt sorry for Hunter and felt sorry for the Biden family. I think that we can pretty much point to who the one was that was left this morning. There was one particular juror who cried through most of Abbe Lowell's opening statement, was still crying when she came back from the break. And so,, I think that that person really identified with the family and with addiction more than maybe the others did. But I'm not surprised that they sat down and said, look, let's go through this a little bit. Maybe we can bring you along. And I think that's exactly what happened. It's not a question of feeling bad for them. It's a question of whether he violated the statutes. And I think that's what occurred.",
