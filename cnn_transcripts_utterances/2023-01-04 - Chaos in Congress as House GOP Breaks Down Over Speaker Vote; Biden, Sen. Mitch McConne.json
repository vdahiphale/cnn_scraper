One of his allies has told CNN he has about 24 hours to figure this out. We are now learning he has now asked five colleagues to lead negotiation efforts with those no votes.

      "sentences": "Yes, that is actually the big question of the hour, whether or not they'll actually come back at noon and have that fourth ballot vote. This is a very tricky proposition for Kevin McCarthy and his allies. The concern right now among McCarthy supporters is that the opposition could grow to McCarthy in that fourth ballot. If that were to happen, that can probably be very, very problematic for his efforts to ultimately get to the 218 votes.So, that is why behind the scenes over the last 24 hours, there have been serious negotiations between a handful of key emissaries to Kevin McCarthy, as well as some of those detractors. Of course, 20 Republicans voted against him in the last round of balloting. He can only afford to lose four Republican votes in order to become elected the next speaker of the House. So, right now, those emissaries of McCarthy are trying to get a sense of what those dissidents want, put together some sort of offer, present it to other Republicans within the conference, see if that passes muster, which is why it is very possible Republicans may try to adjourn as soon as they get in at noon, delay the proceedings maybe by a few hours, maybe by a day, we'll see what they decide to do. But that is the current discussion right now. Now, there's also a warning among some of the more moderate members, including Congressman Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who I just talked to about some of the concessions that Kevin McCarthy is talking about. The trick for the challenging, balancing act for McCarthy is that if he goes too far to the right, he may lose the middle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DUSTY JOHNSON (R-SD):  There are still a number of things that I think Kevin McCarthy could do to increase trust and I think to make it more likely that he would become speaker. Now, that being said, Kevin McCarthy can't go somewhere that the conference isn't willing to go. He, I think, is firmly aware of the fact you are not going to have 10 percent of the conference dictate all of the terms of engagement and the rules to the other 90 percent. That being said, there are reasonable people who I think are trying to find common ground. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's headed to McConnell's home state, the president, to promote the benefits of that bipartisan infrastructure deal.Let's bring in CNN's M.J. Lee. She is live at the White House. I mean, it's remarkable to see this, right? I mean, you have very public divisions inside the Republican Party in the House, and here you have the top Republican and the president standing out there and saying, hey, you know, we can actually work together. Tell us the importance of all of this. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Jim and Erica, I don't think they're going to quite hear White House officials say this out loud, but I do think the White House, in general, is pretty content to let all of this drama unfold among House Republicans. And imagine the split day screen that we're going to see today, right? On the one hand, on Capitol Hill, we have this drama and infighting that is unfolding among House Republicans, and President Biden is taking off now actually right behind me to head to Kentucky where he is going to be touting this bipartisan infrastructure bill that he signed into law back in 2021 and will be joined by Republican-elected officials, including, of course, Mitch McConnell. And, actually, a number of reporters just tried to ask him to weigh in on the House speaker's race. And he said, look, it is not my place to weigh in on the ins and outs of the race, but it's basically not a good look was the message that we got from the president. Now, I do want to just set the scene for you a little bit in terms of this bridge that he is visiting. This is the Brent Spence Bridge, which that connects Cincinnati, Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky, which is where the president is headed. And it has become this sort of politically famous bridge. Past presidents, congressional leaders have promised that they want to fix this bridge because officials say it carries basically double the traffic that it is meant to support. And now, what the president gets to do today when he goes to Kentucky is say, look, $2 billion from that infrastructure law is going to go towards upgrading that bridge and a number of other bridges as well. So, again, just keep an eye on that contrast here, what is going on in Washington, D.C. today, and then what the president is doing as he launches into basically the second half of his first term. He's making it very clear that even with the new Congress, and with Congress now being divided, yes, he wants to continue to try to work with Republicans.",

The only lever of government that they control completely twists in the wind and not get their acts together.So, I would say that is probably -- you're not going to have Democrats bailing out Kevin McCarthy, particularly at this juncture, when they don't know what his fate is going to be at this point.

And that does not speak well to their ability to get things done.And one thing to keep in mind, just like we saw with M.J. Lee, when federal projects come through, hundreds of billions of dollars, there has to be coordination at the local level, with state government, county government, local government, and it's the job of members of Congress to sort of see that through and make sure that it happens.
