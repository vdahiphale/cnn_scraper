Just a short time ago, President Biden said he believes a deal to free hostages in Gaza is going to happen. A senior U.S. official tells CNN that Israel and Hamas are inching closer to a deal, and Israel's Prime Minister just indicated that he thinks the ground offensive inside Gaza is increasing pressure on Hamas to negotiate.Also today, demonstrators have taken to the streets demanding the hostages be released. Tens of thousands of people are in Washington at the March for Israel. The rally follows a troubling increase in anti- Semitic incidents across the U.S., and that's why law enforcement is on high alert today. In Israel, a similar demonstration is underway. Family members of hostages began a days-long march from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Let's start here in Washington. CNN's Gabe Cohen is on the National Mall. Gabe, what are you seeing at this huge rally today?",

And medical officials there describe the situation as dire, minimal staff caring for about 500 patients, many of those in critical condition, only 2 operating rooms and 3 surgeons left inside of that hospital.And the Al-Shifa Hospital, which has been the focus of so much in the area around it, so much intense fighting over the last several days, that is a hospital that has collapsed. There were babies that were taken, premature babies that were taken to operating rooms where there were still some minimal oxygen supplies. Israeli defense forces have been offering to take incubators and other oxygen supplies to be able to care for those premature babies. But really, all of this just speaks to the catastrophic conditions that are unfolding inside the hospitals.

One Israeli official tells CNN that negotiations are ongoing and that the broad parameters of what is being discussed right now, and all of this is still very delicate, still not close to being nailed down, we understand, but it would involve an exchange of what would have to be a large number of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, as well as a days-long cease-fire.So exactly where the details of all of this ends up is not clear. These are very delicate negotiations that are taking place, being handled by government officials in Qatar, as well as the CIA and the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad.

Our colleague Melanie Zanona did catch up with McCarthy, who just said that this was a narrow hallway, that they were walking down in the hallway. He didn't do it intentionally. And that's what McCarthy allegedly told Burchett, too, as they got into a back-and-forth confrontation.One of the reporters who witnessed it said that Burchett said that McCarthy didn't have any guts and asked a question what he was doing. Burchett confirmed that he said that. So, as you can see, so much tension, Brianna, still exists in the aftermath of McCarthy's ouster. This is a house that's been in session for about 10 straight weeks. Typically, there are recesses in between, but they have scrapped those amid all this infighting and chaos on the GOP side.

Now, in this brief, they're summarizing their arguments for why they believe that this gag order is necessary.And they say that, look, there's never been a defendant who has been allowed to malign a prosecutor, his family, going on to threaten witnesses. And they say that these problems began at the beginning of the case. They say shortly after they filed their indictment against Trump, he threatened to, quote, if you go after me, I'm coming after you, and then used inflammatory language to target the district court, the special counsel, and trial witnesses who he knew were going to provide damaging evidence. And they also point out that this extends to as recently as this week. On Saturday, the former president, at a campaign official, at a campaign event, launched several attacks against Smith and his family. So, the prosecutors are arguing that, look, these kinds of attacks and the threats and harassment that come to those who are targeted, this is part of a years-long pattern.
