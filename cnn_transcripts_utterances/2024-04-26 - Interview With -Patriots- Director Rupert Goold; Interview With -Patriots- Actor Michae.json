Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, there were scenes of utter desperation and chaos. Thousands of Afghans crowded outside Kabul's airport as American troops withdrew and the Taliban swept the country. That was August 2021 when a congressional hearing last month, Former Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley blamed the U.S. State Department for not ordering what's known as a noncombatant evacuation operation sooner. Of course, it ended in tragedy for many at the airport when an ISIS-K suicide attack killed more than 180 people, including 13 U.S. servicemen. For two years, the U.S. military has maintained that these deaths were all from that single explosion. But new video evidence shows that there was far more gunfire than the Pentagon has ever admitted. As correspondent Nick Payton Walsh details in this special report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They said their review, released earlier this month, focused not on gunfire but the bomber and events leading up to the blast, but found no new evidence of a complex attack and uncovered no new assertions of outgoing fire, having no materialistic impact on the original investigation.

This is an area of immense interest to me, butI think what's so successful and wonderful about this production is that you don't have to be from the Soviet Union, you don't have to be a Russia watcher to really walk out with chills and get a sense of that time in history and the arc through present day Russia and obviously the tragedy of this war. So, congratulations. Why did you decide to build this show based around that era and this man. RUPERT GOOLD, DIRECTOR, \"PATRIOTS\":  I think in the West, certainly in my lifetime. I think about Russian, it was a huge focus through the '80s. Anyone living in the West, particularly in Great Britain or America, would have been super aware of the Cold War. And then, of course, in the last 10 years, particularly in the last few years, we've become also grimly fixated with what's going on in Russia and the former Soviet republics. But there was this period in the '90s where, to some extent, we in the West maybe slightly took our eye off the ball. I mean, we knew that the Cold War had fallen. I think I was leaving school around the time the Berlin Wall came down. And that period, which people talk about now, the '90s and the West, is this period of peace, you know, between the Berlin Wall and 9/11, when everything was great. But of course, in Russia, it wasn't, it was a time of huge chaos, this massive political and economic system had collapsed, and into this anarchy, and this sort of gangster like anarchy, arose these extraordinary, opportunistic, very brilliant, sometimes corrupt, sometimes principled, sometimes super ambitious, interestingly predominantly brilliant Jewish men, a lot of them were who became the central oligarchs who, to some extent, rebuilt the Russian state in the '90s. And Berezovsky, who Michael plays, was -- in Peter's play and probably in history, the sort of -- the ur oligarch, as it were, the person who was there at the coalface at the beginning.",

No. But who will get blamed for that if they're going to have trouble getting to the polls when they're already probably barely motivated? Was anything done about police reform? That was the largest protest in the history of the country. What did it yield? The George Floyd bill was not passed. It left and died. More black people are being shot and harassed.

You need actual policies that speak to working-class people who are drowning under this, and you need to be more frank and direct about when those needs aren't being met. A lot of people are apathetic and feel left out and are tuning out. Not everybody is wrong, and not everything can be blamed on the fault of the voter. There are so many people who don't participate in that process because they feel like it doesn't speak to them. At what point do you either change your tone to reach them, or do you just feel like wagging your finger is going to do something? You're going to wag your finger under a loft. And also, in terms of representation, the Republican Party has just as many, if not more, more variety. It's just they all stick to a very specific ideology. So, there's representation over there too. That's why a lot of people are finding themselves being, you know, to me, conned into right-wing ideology, but at least they directly target them online. It's -- I'm not the first to make these types of complaints, but I hope more people actually listen because we could find ourselves in a much different country in a year.

And sometimes I think, do I even want a house now, given if I buy in a black neighborhood, it'll be underwritten, or depending on what city I'm in, climate change might impact it. Is that really the investment I think it is? Like, I probably will change my mind. But, you know, just the way things are set up. I try to tell my friends, however, that -- not friends, but readers, friends, you know, some things in life we're not made with designed with you in mind. So, you are pressured to feel married by a certain age, but look at the dating pool, look what's happening, or you should have a house by a certain age. Well, interest rates. And I'm not the Fed chair. I don't control that. I'm trying not to be priced out of L.A. like a lot of people, even if I like my apartment. So, I just think, you know, a lot of these things are harder than they should be. So, why am I holding on to this arbitrary standard where I'm not even being given the tools properly to achieve that? And I don't necessarily -- I will -- I know for a fact now, there's no such thing as good that -- particularly not with student loans, because, ultimately, people are not being paid enough to keep up with the cost of living, tuition is rising, and social mobility is harder than ever. So, if you do go to school, I encourage more education, but if you do it out of disservice to yourself, we won't even be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor ever. You got to reevaluate however that works on your terms.

And in your book, you say, as he walked out of prison, he said, yes, I was angry and I was a little afraid. After all, I had not been free in so long. But when I felt that anger well up inside of me, I realized that if I hated them after I got outside that gate, then they would still have me. I wanted to be free, so I let it go. That's pretty remarkable. PETER HAIN, ANTI-APARTHEID CAMPAIGNER:  It's a very deep insight, isn't it, and a remarkable one that he came out determined not to show any vengeance, not to show any hatred because, as he says in that quote, that very revealing quote, that if he did, then he'd still be trapped. After all, the white minority is a very privileged minority. Perhaps the most privileged in the world in recent times.
