And so it is just tragic.Also, we're talking to the Department of Justice, the civil rights division, because there are other citizens of color who said that this officer engaged in excessive force against them. So, it begs the question, what Malachai's grandfather said, why was he even on the sheriff's department in the first place? Why was he hired with all the red flags?

Something of a honeymoon period right now for the vice president in her new presidential campaign. I guess my question to you is, what do you think needs to happen once the honeymoon is over? REP. KATHERINE CLARK (D-MA): Well, I'm not sure we're going to see an end to this honeymoon. What a week this has been in American politics. What a week for Kamala Harris. What a week for the Americans who have been looking for a candidate to embrace. And she is giving them what they want, someone with a vision for the country of how to build an inclusive economy, stick up for reproductive freedom, and speak to a wide swath of Americans, communities of colors, young voters. And it has been electric, the momentum that she has built. And she started with grassroots, talking to the primary voters who had her as part of the ticket, moving to the delegates who represent those voters, bringing in the organizations and grassroots groups and now this capstone with President and Michelle Obama. It has just been an incredible week. And I think the strength of her campaign, the strength of her vision is going to grow in the next hundred days till we get to the election.",
