      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with this breaking news. a major policy shift from the White House with potentially huge ramifications for the war in Ukraine. For the first time, President Biden is now authorizing Ukraine to use long range US weapons inside of Russian territory. The decision comes after North Korea deployed thousands of troops into Kursk as part of a new Russian offensive. CNN's Kevin Liptak is traveling with the president in Brazil and we are also joined by CNN chief international security correspondent, Nick Paton Walsh. Good evening to both of you. So, Kevin, you first. What more are you learning about this decision and why now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, this is a significant change in policy. It had been a long time under consideration inside the Biden administration. President Biden now determining that the time is right to allow Ukraine to fire these long range US provided ATACMS missiles inside of Russia and it comes at what American officials say is something of an inflection point in this conflict.Tens of thousands of Russian troops are massing near the northern region of Kursk as they prepare to try and claw back some territory from Ukraine, and they have been supplemented by thousands of troops from North Korea, that is causing a great deal of alarm in Washington, and that is part of what has led to this decision today. American officials say that they want to send a signal to the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un that he is sending his troops into Ukraine at their own peril. But I also don't think you can ignore the fact that this is coming two months before President Biden hands off power to Donald Trump. Of course, Donald Trump has voiced deep skepticism about American assistance, both military and financial, to Ukraine. He says he would be able to resolve this conflict in one day. He hasn't necessarily said how he would do that, but the implication, of course is that it would require some territorial concessions on the part of Ukraine and what American officials want to do now is put Kyiv in the best possible position to win this war, or at least to eventually regain some momentum on the battlefield before Trump comes into office. Now this had been the subject of an intense internal debate inside the administration. Of course, you did have the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, putting intense pressure on Washington to arrive at this decision, but you also heard leaders from other NATO countries who said that Ukraine needed this capability if it was able to regain some momentum, essentially saying that Ukraine's hands were tied, if it wasn't able to fire these missiles inside of Russia. But on the other hand you had officials who are deeply worried about the risk of escalation certainly, that is something that President Biden has been at the forefront of his mind every time one of these new capabilities comes on the table. You also heard officials on the military side of things in the United States worry about the stockpiles. At the end of the day, these are not weapons that are in limitless supply. Now, President Biden has come to this decision. It does follow something of a pattern of certain capabilities being off the table for a while, whether its F-16s, whether it is tanks, only for President Biden to come to the decision to allow Ukraine to use them. And, of course, the Ukraine war and Donald Trump's return to the presidency, all of that is a backdrop for the G-20 Summit that is getting underway here in Rio de Janeiro. President Biden will be arriving here later tonight.",

      "sentences": "Fred, in practical terms, as Kevin was saying, there aren't really enough of these ATACMS that the US has to spare to give to Ukraine that this is going to make an overnight massive change on the battlefield.I think what is most important here is the amount of time in which the Biden administration simply said they didn't want to do this because they feared the potential for escalation. Now, clearly, with North Korean troops potentially about to be involved in an offensive to retake Kursk, which Ukraine moved into in August, part of Russia, they are now saying, okay, we need to escalate back against Moscow. [15:05:07] And I think that makes the symbolistic nature of this so much more potent and perhaps, it may be in practical terms. I've got to remind you, Fred, you know, in the gap between Ukraine asking for these for many months, they've been developing their own longer range drones to hit deeper inside Russia. Sometimes it seems even deeper than these ATACMS would be able to hit themselves, wreaking havoc around Russia's energy infrastructure and its airports too, as well, so that's a capability in which Ukraine has been improving with. And indeed, the US has been saying they will help fund as well. So the ATACMS have become, I think  deeply symbolic thing in which you saw Kyiv, you saw president Volodymyr Zelenskyy loudly demanding it. Essentially, I think trying to get the United States deeper involved into Ukraine's war, to have precision missiles like this, supplied by the United States, fired deep into Russia, is a bit of a sea change, frankly, in Washington's involvement in this particular war. That may be one of the reasons why they were so keen to avoid this step. Potentially balancing up the risk versus the reward. You know, I really don't know at this point quite how many ATACMS Ukraine is going to get their hands on and how much damage they can cause. Remember, too, Fred, over the past months, we've seen increasingly particularly here in Europe, sabotaged by people who are linked towards Russia's intelligence services, of civilian targets and that may be weighing in the minds of western governments as they debate this particular choice. But you have to remember, here we are seeing a limited capability being introduced at a late stage from the Biden administration. They had in fact, themselves been hinting in various media reports that some of the attack aircraft, some of the key targets these missiles might be used against, had potentially been moved deeper inside Russia to be outside of the range of the ATACMS themselves. So, it is really not clear quite how this is going to change the battlefield, but it does change one important thing. It puts the United States deeper inside this war than it was simply 24 hours ago, when, 24 hours ago, the focus was really upon quite what kind of peace deal Donald Trump might try and propose. He said he can end this war in 24 hours. I've been talking to European allies over the past week, and they are really having to deeply reassess where this war may go, where the kind of red lines, where their final finishing points are. Now, the Biden administration essentially saying that one of the things they were most worried about being escalatory, they are quite happy to do, Trump could reverse that come January, the 20th. But it certainly I think changes the nature of this particular conflict in the months ahead, months that are going to be about both sides and Ukraine's allies doing everything they can to improve their battlefield positions, because everybody wants to go to the table if there are peace talks in the best possible position -- Fred.",

These probably single warhead versions, so it has got a one ton warhead on it, pretty powerful. It needs to go against hardened installations, factories and things like this.The dual purpose, improved conventional munitions, the older warheads that have the bomblets, that is better against troop concentrations, airfields, and anti-aircraft locations. So it is a mix of those. Now, the question is then how soon can the Ukrainians get these specific targeting coordinates and information they need to fire? And how many will they fire? What is their total allocation of missiles. We are not going to know those things. We will have to watch this on a day-to-day basis.",

The US military advice to the president has always been about winning militarily, but in a battle like this, you have to consider what the political and diplomatic impact is.And so this could have a very helpful impact on the negotiations if it helps the Ukrainians hang on for example, to that Kursk salient, if they can strike the North Korean forces as they are massing and getting ready to go in there, they'll hold on to Kursk. That's an important piece of bargaining leverage in the negotiations. If they punish the Russians by taking out the factory that is producing these guided bombs that are being used a hundred times a day, these two and three-ton bombs that come in on the Ukrainian troops, that's a military aspect. But the Russians typically have more than one factory. They stockpile these weapons. So the real impact, I think, is going to be diplomatic. If it says the United States is going to do what it needs to help Ukraine regain terrain on the battlefield, that would be a complete game changer, this is it.",

He is all in.And just to give an example of what that means, his former press secretary, Sean Spicer, telling CNN: \"Telling Donald Trump something isn't going to happen is a surefire way of him doubling down.\" And that is what we are seeing happening right now, even as Donald Trump hears from Republicans on Capitol Hill who tell him look, Matt Gaetz is someone who is not well-liked within the party. There are concerns about these sexual misconduct allegations in his past and this ethics report that could come out detailing some salacious accusations against Matt Gaetz, the now former congressman, and that there is a concern whether or not he could get the 51 votes that he needs.

For the first time, President Joe Biden is authorizing Ukraine to use long range US weapons inside Russian territory.The decision comes after North Korea deployed thousands of troops into Kursk, the Southern Russia region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive. This decision, made while -- and announced while President Biden is in Brazil. Joining me right now is Heather Nauert, a former spokesperson for the US State Department under President Trump's first term. Heather great to see you again. So what does Ukraine's use of US long range missiles into Russia mean for the war in Ukraine today? And possibly under the incoming Trump administration? HEATHER NAUERT, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE US STATE DEPARTMENT UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST TERM: Sure. Well, I think this is obviously a very important development. This is something that Ukraine has been asking for, for quite some time. I was in Ukraine just in February, meeting with frontline commanders and that is one of the things that they said to us, not only do they want more ATACMS, but they want to be able to use them in a long range capacity. So the Biden administration is providing an authorized use of this now, a major change in this. Will it make a big difference? I am not sure that it will. It might help Ukraine hold off Russia from further aggression. You know Russia right now is trying to retake Kursk, so it could be of help in that regard. I think it is a good morale booster for the government of Ukraine. You know, one of the troubles is the Biden administration wanted to prevent escalation at all costs. The problem is escalation came to the Biden administration, and as we look at what is happening right now, we have North Korean troops participating in Ukraine right now and that is a result -- a direct result of the Biden administration not taking decisive action early enough. The Biden administration has provided too little too late all along and this is yet another example of that.",
