She is undoubtedly an underdog going into the general election, given that former Governor Hogan ran statewide twice and she has never run statewide before in a general election. And yet, she was all also discounted in this primary race, but was able to overcome an excellent opponent in David Trone, who also spent more than $60 million.So, she has proven herself very adept at creating effective political coalitions that address the questions of the day. And that's really the critical thing here. Pro-choice is going to be a catalyzing issue in Maryland. It is going to be on the ballot in a referendum and of course, the whole country is thinking about what Donald Trump and his party have done, which is to steal away from tens of millions of American women, their right to choose in consultation with their families and their physicians instead putting the locus of choice in state legislatures and having been in this state legislature, I will tell you, I do trust the women of America more than the state legislators to be making these fundamental health decisions. So, Angela Alsobrooks has said she will vote for the Women's Health Protection Act to codify Roe v. Wade in America. The former Governor Hogan has not said what he will do about that. He has not said whether he will support making Roe v. Wade the law of the land.",

Now, does that actually help him is the big question. I mean, when I was in Arizona in 2020, I did hear some voters that say they were really interested in Kelly, who is now a Senator and that that may be made them a little bit more amenable to voting for Biden, that they started looking at him a little bit differently. Now, is that enough though in a state that is going to be one at the margins, especially if President Biden is suffering with other key blocks, whether it is Latinos, whether it is black voters in these states.
