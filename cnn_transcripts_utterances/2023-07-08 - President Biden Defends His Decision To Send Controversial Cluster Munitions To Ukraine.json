I'm Fredricka Whitfield.The Biden administration today defending its controversial decision to include cluster bombs in its latest military aid package to Ukraine. The president himself calling it a difficult but necessary decision as Ukraine's stockpiles of weapons runs low. Russia has already been using them in the war, and earlier today Ukraine's defense minister thanked the U.S. for supplying the munitions. The bombs are canisters that carry dozens of mini-bombs about the size of a grenade. and this is video of a cluster bomb dropped on Ukraine last year. Sometimes these bomblets don't explode on impact, like in this attack, and that can pose a threat to civilians. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where the president is spending the weekend. Priscilla, some Democrats aren't necessarily behind Biden's decision. And so what's the White House response to that?",

In a \"Washington Post\" op-ed, Senators Merkley and former Senator Leahy put it quite bluntly. They said that this is, quote, a serious mistake with, quote, devastating impact. And they went on to say the last thing we need is to risk a rupture with key allies over a weapon that the United States should be leading the global effort to prohibit.Now, this was a decision that evolved over time within the Biden administration. It's one that they did not take lightly. And the national security team eventually unanimously agreed to move forward. And it was President Biden who signed off on it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're in a situation where Ukraine continues to be brutally attacked across the board by munitions, by these cluster munitions that have dud rates that are very, very low -- I mean very high, that are a danger to civilians, number one. Number two, the Ukrainians are running out of ammunition. The ammunition, they call them 155-millimeter weapons, this is a war relating to munitions. And they're running out of that ammunition.

And it also comes ahead of President Biden's trip next week where he will be attending the NATO summit. And the war in Ukraine is going to be a key topic of discussion, Fred.",

Seven or more GOP contests are expected to take place over seven weeks before super Tuesday, which is March 5th.Twitter is threatening to sue Meta for trade secrets after Meta's rival to Twitter's Threads. Threads has experienced explosive growth since its official launch Thursday, reporting 30 million sign-ups on the platform's first day. And now it's hit over 70 million. Twitter accuses Meta of hiring its former employees, but Meta is pushing back on that, saying no one on the Threads engineering team worked at Twitter. CNN's Clare Duffy is joining us now.

And it's not clear that letter is going to amount to anything more than a threat. But I do think it shows that Twitter is rattled by this, as well they should be. And 70 million user sign-ups in just two days is really remarkable. It's about a third of the size of Twitter's total user base in just two days.And that's because it's so easy for people to get started on this new app. They can log in through Instagram. They can port over their whole following list, and so it's really easy for people to join. And look, people on Twitter have been looking for months for an alternative since Elon Musk took over this platform. He's made a lot of really controversial decisions. And so I think there's a threat not only of Twitter users leaving, but also people who have never been on Twitter but who are on Instagram, not they're not going to join Twitter.

And Mark Zuckerberg is engaging with people on Threads, he's responding to posts with suggestions for the platform, and they say they have plans to continue building out the platform.The other thing I think they're going to have to do in order to keep people on this platform is avoid some of the things that people don't like about Twitter, things like spam, harassment, misinformation.

Heat advisories and now excessive heat watches back into parts of southern California. Temperatures over the next three days well into the triple digits. Phoenix where we should be, around 107 degrees. Not the case. We're climbing up around 115 Wednesday and Thursday. Four days in a row this past week where we broke our global average temperature record, and the current is 63.01 degrees. Yesterday didn't quite make it there at 62.96, but still rather impressive. So what's going on? We've got a lot of land in the northern hemisphere so land heats up a lot faster than water does. Plus, we're dealing with what's called an El Nino where our sea surface temperatures are above normal. And it's a teleconnection pattern, so it's not just happening in one area. It's all across the globe. As our trade winds start to weaken, that warm weather pushes back up toward our western coasts of the Americas. And we're noticing that over the last few years our temperatures just continue to rise, and the last nine years, for that matter, we've hit our warmest on record, Fred. So rather impressive.

So there would be no rescue scenario in space. Your vehicle is coming down one way or the other.The other option is you're seeing that SpaceX has flown some purely private commercial space flights, and those are currently being flown into the same orbital plane as the International Space Station. Right now NASA and Russia and the other international partners that fly on these vehicles, the SpaceX vehicle and the Russian Soyuz, we depend on the space station as what's called a safe haven or kind of a lifeboat, a place we can go in an emergency, assuming we can dock to it. And so these purely private commercial flights are also launched into the same plane, and presumably if they can dock they can also use that as a safe haven.
