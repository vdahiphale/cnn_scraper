One, remember in 1965, that led to a police attacking voting rights activist that ultimately led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

And the federal rail administration says that 400 of those 1,084 derailments were actually caused by the track, track defects themselves, but the rest of them, the five to 600, or 700, are caused by for example, collisions with traffic or other factors or human errors, switching errors, et cetera. So we really have a lot of, you know, rail safety issues that often just go under the radar. People don't pay attention to rail. If we have these many accidents in airplanes with commercial aircraft, I think what people would be saying, so there's really a lot more than meets the eye until you have a spectacular disaster as in New Palestine, Ohio.",

This was after the derailment and caused the pressure relief valves not to function and those valves are supposed to prevent pressure inside the tank cars from the building up and causing an explosion.And there's this new federal push for those aluminum vents to be switched to steel, but it's kind of a recommendation.

Now, it hasn't been, you know, confirmed or proven yet, but they think that what happened is that aluminum melted and prevented those relief valves from working just as you said, and so they're going to look at into that and see whether those need to be changed, if there's needs to be additional regulation coming out.But that's a good clue. And, of course, the National Transportation Safety Board will be looking at that because they have to find the probable cause of this accident. And if those valves don't work, that's what led to the bleeding off and the burning and, you know, the manmade disaster on top of the rail disaster and all the problems.

For tax year 2022, the maximum child tax credit is $2,000 per kid if your income is below $200,000 or $400,000 if filing jointly. Above those levels the credit starts to phase out. That's at least $1,000 less than the COVID era enhanced child tax credit that expired at the end of 2021.And it's not the only pandemic provision to sunset. The child dependent care credit is also smaller for tax year 2022. That's the credit working parents can use to pay for childcare or the care of an adult dependent. The earned income tax credit for those without children has shrunk notably, too. Keep in mind the standard deduction is bigger this year, $1,2950 for single filers or $25,900 for those married filing jointly. Now, that's good news since most tax payers don't itemize. But if you do take the standard deduction, you can't subtract charitable contributions this tax season. That's a change from the last two years when even people who didn't itemize were allowed to deduct $300 in charitable donations or $600 if married filing jointly. You also have a few extra days to file this year. The deadline is April 18th for most taxpayers. That's also the cutoff to file for a six-month extension if you need a little bit more time.

Over 40 tons, it spews exhaust, its tracks struggling across the muddy ground. Following close behind, the mine clearance team called Sappers, they advance deliberately on the hunt for deadly explosives. This is delicate work. MARQUARDT (on camera): This was a Russian position, Russian trenches. And now, these guys are working through here carefully, methodically, looking for mines, for booby traps, and even Ukrainian ordnance, those fired at the Russians who were here. MARQUARDT (voiceover): Last September, a Ukrainian counters offensive pushed the Russians out of these trenches. Now, Colonel Maksim Melnyk's team has been charged with clearing any explosives. They have left many traps behind and many of our brothers are Sappers have died, Melnyk says. Russia doesn't obey international conventions. They put mines on top of mines, leave booby traps, and use banned mines. Russian and Ukrainian mines are scattered throughout the eastern front, making Ukraine one of the biggest mine fields in the world. Rockets and other explosives can often fail to detonate when they land, too. All of it posing immense danger to civilians. The Sappers of Ukraine's DSNS Emergency Service like Eduard Herasimenko, who is a father of a 10-year-old daughter, are keenly aware of the danger. It's dangerous for everybody, he says. I wouldn't say we take more risks than others, everybody is taking risks now. Herasimenko was de-mining before the war started. Seeing what Russia has done to his country infuriates him. They are just animals, he says. There is no other way to describe them. He finds and carries an unexploded rocket propelled grenade to the side. Working day after day all across this country, deminers know how much they still have left to do. MARQUARDT (on camera): After the war, the soldiers get to go home, but your work continues for years. MARQUARDT (voiceover): We will keep working for decades, Colonel Melnyk says, this will go on for decades. Alex Marquardt, CNN in eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
