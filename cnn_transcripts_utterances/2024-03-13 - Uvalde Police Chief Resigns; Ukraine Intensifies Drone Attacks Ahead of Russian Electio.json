Chief Daniel Rodriguez announced his sudden resignation just days after an investigative report exonerated local police and the 2022 Robb Elementary School massacre that killed 19 children and two teachers. That decision has infuriated the community.Rodriguez has been police chief since 2018. He was not in Uvalde at the time of the school shooting, he was on vacation, but he did appoint the acting chief that day and has stood by the officers who failed to take action in the moment. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, who has been following the story from the beginning, is with us now. How much of this resignation come out of nowhere, Shimon?",

So by far the largest strike the Ukrainians would have ever really conducted onto a Russian territory. The Russian saying they took most of those drones down. However, it does appear, though, that some of them have hit their target. There was a big oil refinery in the town of Rezan, which is really just south of Moscow. I've actually been there quite a number of times. And that apparently was hit. There was a large fire. There was video that came out from there afterwards. There was also one in the sort of St. Petersburg region. That's very far away from Ukrainian territory. So we can see more of those long-distance strikes conducted by the Ukrainians -- Kate.",

Designed to protect against the effects of climate change, defenseless against climate change, Bill. What happened? BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: This is a fascinating story in the new normal for coastal residents, really all over the country, but this is picturesque Salisbury Beach, Massachusetts. We're right near the New Hampshire border here. And for generations, the folks who've been coming here have watched high tide creep closer and closer to these homes year by year, foot by foot, because the state refuses to replenish dunes on private property. Over 100 homeowners kick together after a series of big storms, really took away their defense system and they pulled together their money, spent $600,000 on 15,000 tons of sand to try to fortify things. Some homeowners opted in. Like you can see here, this is what's left of the dune after the last storm, some did not. This home was exposed and as a result, that storm sent waves into living room of this house. A lot of the staircases and jetties and these sorts of things were destroyed in this last storm. But about over half of that $600,000 investment washed away in a single storm and now so these folks have no idea what to do next. They're hoping the state might kick in and start paying for this, but it really gets to the heart of who pays to defend these kinds of communities at a time when seas are just getting higher and higher officially. The state of Massachusetts is bracing for up to two-and-a- half feet of sea level rise by the middle of the century, by 2050. This is just the result of less than a foot of sea level rise over the last century -- Kate.",

But if you don't believe in climate change, and I've met some residents here who's just seen this as a string of bad luck and that they're in the clear now and they just need to get their dunes back. It's a very different conversation from who are coming to grips with the idea that we can't afford a half a million or a million dollars in truck and sand to protect a few hundred homes.But if you live in these homes, you say we provide a brunt of the tax base for the local community. The property taxes here help pay for the cops and the teachers. So if we condemn this and retreat from it, what happens next? This is the really tough conversation that's going to be happening more frequently at coastal towns everywhere. It's sort of the haves and the have-nots when it comes to sand. Who has the sand, who doesn't, who will pay the price of that as a result. Here they say a flood insurance is relatively expensive, about $2500 a year. In other places, it is prohibitively expensive. Massachusetts does not allow dredging sand from below the waves and pumping on shore for environmental concerns. They want to revisit that as a future conversation.
