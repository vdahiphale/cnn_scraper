The U.S. Geological Survey conducted the most comprehensive research to date to find out just how widespread these chemicals are and scientists now believe they may be even more hazardous to our health than previously thought.CNN's Jacqueline Howard joins us now. So Jacqueline, what exactly are these forever chemicals?",

Mark Zuckerberg says 30 million people signed up here in the first day. So let's talk about this. What this means? Is it going to live up to the hype with CNN Analyst and Senior Media Reporter at Axios, Sara Fischer. I think that's the question, is it going to live up to the hype?Which brings me to my first question, is it going to scratch that Twitter itch? How is this kind of the same as Twitter? How is it different, Sara?",

      "sentences": "Well, on the surface level, it looks and feels very similar, Brianna, to what Twitter is. You can post things, you can favorite things, you can like things. You have a follower list and a following list. So it's not that different. But I do think it poses a pretty serious threat to Twitter. And that's because the adoption, Brianna has just been absolutely explosive.As somebody who covers media and technology, I have signed up for every Twitter alternative, whether it's been Parlor, or Truth, or Post Dot news, or Spill or Mastodon, I have never had my phone blow up the way it has in the past 24 hours with new following requests, with people liking my posts. There is definitely momentum behind this app. And just to give you some context, that 30 million number that you referenced is extremely important. Yesterday, I posted a story in axios.com of all of the copycat features that Meta has introduced in the past few years. And all of those features that have been sunsetted, that have died, they were killed because they only had a few 100,000 followers. The fact that Threads has 30 million people signed up already, to me indicates that this is not an app that's going to get killed. It's not going to be short lived. This is going to be a product that Meta will likely invest in for the future for the long term.",

There's that question of how can you look chronologically, maybe you can't at the Threads. I almost said tweets. But it does seem that when you go on this and I'm on it, @Brianna Keilar now.People are just very happy to have somewhere else to be and people who have been having those Twitter conversations are now having those Thread conversations, how vulnerable is Twitter?",

      "sentences": "They're pretty vulnerable. And I think you hit on something very critical. Mark Zuckerberg said yesterday in a Thread, that he wants it to be a friendly place a place for kind of conversations. And you and I both know, anytime you get into a text based public square like app, it's going to be hard to retain that level of happiness, you're ultimately going to get into things like political speech, where it gets more antagonistic.But for now, I do think that users are looking for a place, a reprieve if you will, from some of the nastiness on Twitter that has come out since Elon Musk took over and pulled back some of those content rules. Now Brianna, you had mentioned a few features that don't exist yet on Threads. Things like direct messaging, or chronological feed. One of the other things to note though, is that there are things that come with Threads that don't happen on Twitter. For example, there's a ton of content moderation policies.",

And also, by the way, on the other end, it's a selling point for Twitter, if you're not somebody who wants to engage in sort of thoughtful, you know, moderated conversation. But you know, the big thing that I think that Threads has going for it, Brianna, is it's launching at a really important time. You know, Twitter's lost about 60 percent of its value. Advertising is down for the month of April 59 percent. The company is struggling to roll out new products in a way that is thoughtful and isn't disruptive to the user experience. Mark Zuckerberg is coming in when Twitter is down. And that's different.In the past when he is introduced new features like stories which he took from Snapchat, it was when those apps were on the rise. This is different because it's when the app is on the fall. And so I think that Twitter is going to have a real run for its money because of Threads.",

Payroll Processor, ADP says companies added nearly half a million jobs in June. That is double what economists had predicted, a big jump as well from May.Consumer facing service industries and leisure and hospitality drove those gains, annual pay increases however were slightly down. Tomorrow's June jobs report also expected to defy expectations, economy's still strong. Yesterday's average global temperature tied with Tuesday's as the planets hottest day ever, at nearly 63 degrees Fahrenheit. Keep in mind that's average across the globe, including at the poles. Experts believe these are the warmest temperatures in at least 100,000 years. You heard that right. And warn the record could be broken again and again. That's bad news for a warming planet. And if you're Honda driver, do listen up. The company just recalled 1000s of models because of a brake issue. Not what you want to hear The recall affects certain Civic, Ridgeline, Passport, Pilot and Acura MDX models made since 2020. Honda says a loose fastener could make the brakes malfunction. Drivers can have their cars inspected and repaired at Honda dealerships, of course free of charge for us. Boris?",
