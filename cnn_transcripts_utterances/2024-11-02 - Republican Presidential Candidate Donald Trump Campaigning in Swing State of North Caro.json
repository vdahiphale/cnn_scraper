And with just three days now until the election both candidates are barnstorming key southern states today, making their last minute pitches to voters. For the past hour, former President Donald Trump has been speaking at a rally in battleground North Carolina. It's the first of two rallies for him that he'll hold in that state today. Vice President Harris is holding a get-out-the-vote rally in the swing state of Georgia before heading to North Carolina for a rally there later on today. So today is the last day of voting, early voting, that is, in North Carolina, and so far more than 4 million people in that critical swing state have already cast their ballots. Nationwide, more than 70 million Americans have already voted. Let's start our coverage with CNN's Steve Contorno in Salem, Virginia, where Trump will hold a rally there in a few hours after he leaves North Carolina. So Steve, Virginia hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 2004, so what's the explanation behind this rally today?",

      "sentences": "Talking to Virginia Republicans, they are just as surprised as anyone that Donald Trump is spending one of these final campaigning days here in Georgia. It's certainly not an expected stop when the map has shown that so much of this race will be fought in those seven battleground states.But look, the campaign insists that Virginia is much closer than the narrative suggests. And look, both these campaigns are just trying to do what they can to get to 270. And the reality is that if Trump cannot flip one of those blue wall states, then he is going to have to look for support somewhere else. And if Virginia is as close as his campaign believes, and the see an opportunity to potentially gin up some enthusiasm here in the final days, then they don't want to leave any sort of opportunities or votes on the table. Now, I also will point out that Trump has been traveling these seven battleground states over and over and over again in recent months. He had an appearance yesterday in Warren in the exact same room that he appeared at in a month ago. And a month ago, he had sold out the room. Yesterday, it was only about half-full. So they might be reaching a saturation point in some of these markets, and it just might be helpful for the campaign to get outside of those seven states just to show that there is support for him and be able to fill up a room again.",

It has always been a very important electorate, but recent numbers, \"USA Today\" reporting that perhaps you're going to have the largest college youth voter turnout in this cycle than ever before. PRABHUfeels like young people are so much more engaged in the political process than in the past. Maybe they have always been engaged at these numbers and we're just seeing it because they're posting videos about it. But if it is that they are more engaged, this is definitely a huge change because younger voters are said to often be apathetic voters. So seeing how excited a lot of these younger voters are about voting in this election, I think they might break some records this time around.",

That group is also responsible to having ties to the notorious troll factory known for its efforts in undermining the 2016 election. CNN's Alex Marquardt explains.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) ALEX MARQUARDT, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  It's from this 23-story building in Russia's St. Petersburg that some of the most effective Russian disinformation of the 2024 U.S. election has been cooked up. One of its occupants in recent years is believed to be the so-called Russian Foundation to Battle Injustice, or RFBI. CNN teamed up with researchers at Clemson University to investigate RFBI's long tentacles and its impact. PATRICK WARREN, CO-DIRECTOR, CLEMSON MEDIA FORENSICS HUB:  The connection between Prigozhin and the RFBI is cut and dried. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  RFBI's origins can be traced back to Yevgeny Prigozhin, longtime ally of Vladimir Putin and the founder of the Wagner Mercenary Group, who after launching an audacious revolt on Moscow last year, was killed in a mysterious midair explosion. But Darren Linvill and Patrick Warren say that the story of RFBI makes it clear that Prigozhin's legacy persists beyond the grave. DARREN LINVILL, CO-DIRECTOR, CLEMSON MEDIA FORENSICS HUB:  They're pretending to be this really positive force of good in Russia. In reality, they're really an arm of the Russian state. MARQUARDT (voice-over):  One recent viral post baselessly accuses Governor Tim Walz of sexually assaulting a minor.",

But also when you actually have a terrible discussion with your best friend and things go wrong is to get back to them.
