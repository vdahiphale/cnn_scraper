And those concerns were raised in a phone call on Sunday between President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and his counterpart in Israel. The White House says that Sullivan raised those concerns, discussed alternatives to a ground invasion of Rafah. Israeli national security adviser said that those concerns were being taken into account. But at the end of the day, these concerns are nothing new. President Biden has been raising them with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in phone calls dating back to February. And there are no signs that Netanyahu is necessarily taking those views into account. He has said that a ground invasion of Rafah is necessary to completely eliminate Hamas. That view is completely at odds with what we heard from American officials on Sunday, including the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, who said that a ground invasion of Rafah could launch a Hamas insurgency. Listen to more of -- a little bit of what he said. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: They will be left holding the bag on an enduring insurgency, because a lot of armed Hamas will be left, no matter what they do in Rafah. Or if they -- if they leave and get out of Gaza as we believe they need to do, then you're going to have a vacuum and a vacuum that's likely to be filled by chaos, by anarchy, and ultimately by Hamas. Again, we have the same objective as Israel. We want to make sure that Hamas cannot govern Gaza again. We want to make sure it's demilitarized. We want to make sure that Israel gets its leaders. That's what were determined. We have a different way, and we think a more effective, durable way of getting that done. We'll remain in conversation with Israel about exactly that. LIPTAK (voice-over): Now Blinken also said that the U.S. believes Israel has killed more civilians than Hamas members over the course of this war. He also said that the U.S. hasn't seen a plan from Israel for security and governance in Gaza once this war ends.

But many conservationists are skeptical about orangutan diplomacy, as some call it. Others -- some are calling it obscene. Malaysia is looking to leverage the critically endangered apes by gifting them to countries that buy its palm oil. Clearing land for palm oil plantations has been a major driver of deforestation, which is the greatest threat to the survival of orangutans in the wild. Palm oil is the world's most widely consumed vegetable oil, used in a variety of products from shampoo to ice cream. And Malaysia is the world's second biggest exporter. Here to discuss further is Dr. Felicity Oram, a scientific advisor for the Malaysian Primatology Society and director at the Human Orangutan Coexistence Project called OranJUGA. She joins us via Skype from Seattle, Washington, and thanks for doing so. What is your reaction to this idea, what some have called orangutan diplomacy? DR. FELICITY ORAM, SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR, MALAYSIAN PRIMATOLOGY SOCIETY: Yes, indeed. I think it's very easy for people to become confused, especially with respect to orangutans, because on the one hand, they're an exceptionally lucky animal, because many people all around the world, including in their native countries of Indonesia and Malaysia, wish for Asia's only great ape species to continue to survive and share the planet with us. However, on the other hand, with lots of concern can come many misunderstandings. For myself and fellow conservation practitioners, including oil, palm sustainability teams working together on the ground where wild orangutans live, the fact that the minister of plantation -- plantations and commodities was the opening speaker at a conference to discuss coexistence with iconic native species such as orangutans, elephants and tigers, was already in and of itself, an important act of orangutan diplomacy.",

Well, I think that, to answer your question, as orangutans are a wholly native forest-dependent species so without diverse native forests, there can be no wild orangutans.And our research with colleagues has found that orangutans can withstand moderate degradation and quite remarkable levels of forest fragmentation, but they cannot survive where there is no forest. And also what we find is that male orangutans that usually migrate seasonally with routing cycles across very broad landscapes, now increasingly need to cross these areas where no forest exists.",

They're taking venom and turning it into antivenom by extracting deadly fluid from the fishes' venom glands. They then send off what's been captured to another lab where they inject the venom into an animal with a strong immune system such as a horse, which then produces antibodies, which are extracted, purified, and reduced for humans. Now, what was once deadly creates something lifesaving. Seymour says the need for antivenom may increase as ocean temperatures rise due to climate change. Warmer waters are pushing the marine life further South and can also change the toxicity of the venom. This could then make pre-existing antivenoms ineffective.",
