It will also make it harder for people claiming asylum legally, including those entering the United States via third country, or those in fact who don't give advanced notice to the authorities. Now, critics say, the law bears a striking resemblance, in fact, to a Trump-era law already struck down in court. And many lawmakers within Biden's own party are voicing their opposition. Now, it's a notable departure in policy for the administration. Here is candidate Joe Biden speaking back in March 2020 about his vision for the country.

Does not slam the door on those fleeing persecution, violence and oppression. Does not seek -- make people seeking an asylum, have to stay in another country to do it.

Dozens are still missing at this hour, and an urgent search and rescue is underway. Now, in a, moment we will have more, of course, about the U.S. migration issue.

Among the dead to wash up on this lonely Calabrian Beach, an eight-month-old infant. The 20-meter-long wooden boat reportedly took to see from Turkey, Thursday, with perhaps as many as 250 people on board, coming from, among other places, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, and Syria. Fishermen Luciano Vincenzo (ph) was one of the first on the scene before dawn. When we arrived, we found 10 dead, he said. And as dawn broke, we found more and more. Only around 80 people survived the ship wreck. The rest perhaps well over 100 by either dead or missing. This type of tragedy should have been avoided, said the governor of Calabria, Roberto Occhiuto. Sunday, Pope Francis told the faithful in St. Peters Square, I pray for each of them, for the missing and for the other migrants who survived. But thoughts and prayers won't save lives.",

Now, of course the problem here is that the Mexican asylum system, by the U.S. Department of State's own country conditions reports, is subpar. It is not adequate for people who are truly fleeing for their lives to feel safe and protected in a country that has rampant violence against migrants. Including just recently, migrants who were stoned in Mexico, Cartel violence. I call, it in my practice, the refugee hunger games. It is a survival strategy just to make it through Mexico. And that is what many of my clients telling me stories about the Mexico-Guatemala border.

And now, to a subject which is, again, often the source of an incredibly polarizing debate. And that, in truth, is deeply nuanced as well. Medical Assistance in Dying, it has been legal in Canada for six years now and increasingly used to render mercy in the final moments of life. Now, currently, only people with a serious, irreversible condition are eligible for the program there and it's known as MAID. But an expansion of the law would include those with mental illness. And that, as you can imagine, raising concerns and the government has now decided that it would be prudent to temporarily delay it. So, we're going to go through some of the issues involved here and what it could mean for end-of-life care right around the world. Dr. Madeline Li is a psychiatrist who has helped hundreds of patients through medically assisted death and led the university health network's MAID program. She joins us now live from Toronto. And I thank you for being with us on what is a very difficult subject for so many families, let alone governments trying to grapple with this. You know, I think it's important, and you've had the benefit of your experience, for you to explain to us, what is assisted dying? What does the law in Canada allow for now? How does it work? And why is it necessary in some cases? DR. MADELINE LI, PROVIDER, MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING AND PSYCHIATRIST:  OK. Thank you for the invitation to speak on this really challenging topic. The way Medical Assistance in Dying or MAID in Canada works right now is that you have to -- you have to have -- you have to be a competent adult who has something called a grievous and irredeemable medical condition. And there's four -- there are criteria for that. You have to have an incurable condition. You have to be in an advanced state of irreversible decline and capability or functioning. And you have to have physical or psychological suffering that is unrelievable by any means acceptable to you. You used to need a reasonably foreseeable natural death, which is a construct that wasn't well-defined. But because of court challenges, that was removed in 2021, and now, the government has to tracks for access to MAID, one where you do have a reasonably foreseeable natural death and one where you don't, which is more highly safeguarded. And then to clinicians. And in Canada it can be a medical doctor or a nurse practitioner assess you against those eligibility criteria. And if you have them, we can provide MAID to you either by giving you an intravenous injection of lethal medication or by prescribing an oral medication that you take yourself.",

The debate, though, for it going further has been, you know, visceral and for good reason, right?Then, we should point out, you know, that there's no right and wrong here. These decisions rest on a continuum and they're personal decisions. Now, you have been very frank that the expansion of the law to include mental illness worries you. Just explain some of your reasons why. DR. LI:  I'd qualify that a little, actually. It's not just the expansion to mental illness, actually. It was 2021 when it expanded to non-terminal illness. I think, when MAID was first introduced, the thought was that all the criteria I described. Described as somebody on a trajectory towards the end-of-life. And we thought it would be restricted to end-of-life conditions. In 2021, it clearly opened up to people with chronic illness, and that's where I started to become uncomfortable. Because it's a different circumstance, if you're going to apply MAID -- if you're going to give assisted dying to somebody who is already dying and would die whether you gave them MAID or not, that is one thing. It's quite something else to end the life of somebody who wouldn't, otherwise, die. And so, I struggled a little more with that in 2021. The expansion to mental illness is just a part of that. That if you are going to allow MAID for people with chronic disease, then you really can't stigmatize and exceptionalize (ph) mental illness. But there are extra considerations around mental illness, which is why the government put a two-year hold on expanding it to mental illness, which they've just extended for a further year.",

LI:  So, the opponents to expansion to mental illness talk about how hard it is to know when a mental disorder is actually incurable or irremediable, right. That we don't have good science to say when treatment is now futile. I'm not sure that that's the main issue, I mean, that is true. But actually, our law allows patients to refuse treatment. And to me, that's one of the problems with our law. But our law doesn't require a patient to accept treatment that is available. I think the bigger challenge is, how do you assess somebody for capacity to choose to die when suicidality is a common symptom? It's a common part of a mental disorder. And I think we don't have a really good frameworks for how to do this. And I also think the other reason the government delayed the expansion is the health system isn't prepared to do this in terms of balancing patients' rights to access MAID for mental disorders, but there is very limited access to mental health treatment. And so, it's not clear what we're supposed to do when a patient actually wants treatment but can't access it. And they're eligible for MAID but then, do we approve them for it because they can't access treatment. I think those are the struggles.",

I want to point, though, to the debate in Canada because it is one that will continue to resonate around the world. One group that's opposed to the expansion in Canada. Tim Seaton, quite a direct statement, he is with the Canadian Institute for Inclusion and Citizenship at the University of British Columbia. He described Canada's law as, probably the biggest existential threat to disabled people since the Nazis' program in Germany with the 1930s. You know, some people have said, look, of you -- from the outside looking into Canada here, that this almost seems dystopian in practice. Do you see any truth to that? DR. LI:  I've described MAID in Canada not quite as dramatic language as that, but as a bit of a brave new world myself, right. Whether it's inspired or dystopian, I think it can be a bit of both. I think, for sure, there are concerns from disabilities, groups about how we are applying the laws. I think those are valid concerns. I also think there's a valid reason why MAID should exist. And that there are ways, if we can more -- if we can provide the training and better safeguard the law itself, if we can think about this carefully, that hopefully we can decide what the society wants to prioritize, autonomy or protection.

No interest in integrating with folks in the inner city.

You know, of course that's not the only, you know, kind of history they should learn. So, you know, there's also a sort of citizenship component to it that really proponents of black studies were saying, look, you know, we want to be Americans. We want to stay here.
