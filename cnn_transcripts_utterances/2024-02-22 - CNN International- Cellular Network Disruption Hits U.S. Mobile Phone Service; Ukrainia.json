I'm Rahel Solomon in New York.A major disruption hits cellular networks across the U.S. Still, no explanation for the outage, but authorities say that there is no indication it's malicious. Plus, Joe Biden trading insults with the Kremlin, what the President called Vladimir Putin behind closed doors. And we're just hours away from a potentially historic moment. A private company's lander could become the first American spacecraft in more than 50 years to touch down on the moon. Coming up, I will speak with one of the NASA scientists involved. But, we want to begin this hour with that massive cellular network outage in the U.S. Tens of thousands of AT&amp;T customers are impacted, making it difficult to call, text, even just use the internet. AT&amp;T has encountered sporadic outages over the past few days, including in some areas a temporary 911 emergency call system failure. Now, a website that tracks self-reported customer outages show that more than 70,000 people were impacted at one time. Now, AT&amp;T, for its part, says that it is working on restoring service though there is still no official reason why it went down in the first place. And industry source told CNN that there is apparently no indication that the outage was the result of a cyberattack or other malicious activity. Joining us now is the U.S. Editor-in-Chief of the online publication TechRadar, Lance Ulanoff. Lance, good to have you. Can we just start with -- I know you've been following this all morning long. What's the latest from what you can tell me? What is the latest status on these outages? LANCE ULANOFF, U.S. EDITOR IN CHIEF, TECHRADAR: Well, the good news is it appears, while they're still ongoing, they're starting to trend downward. Now, that's based on customer reporting happening on DownDetector. But, I've spoken to AT&amp;T and Verizon. AT&amp;T is sort of the center of this whole thing, and they acknowledged that there are wireless service interruptions, no idea like what's going on. And what's interesting is when you look at DownDetector, all the other networks appear down, but again, self-reported. And one of the things that may be happening here is when people on those other networks are trying to contact, say Verizon trying to call AT&amp;T, it is failing. So, they assume it's their network. So, it's not clear that this is across all the networks or if it's really just A&amp;T, which is one of the biggest carriers in the U.S. And by the way, I've gotten reports from almost every state, like all over the place, Florida, Virgin, and lot of people in Texas, all having trouble with AT&amp;T.",

But, it -- the only other explanation that has been floated, again, not verified, is a solar flare, which can impact cellular service. There were -- NASA reported a couple of major solar flares over the last 24 hours. So, the timing would be right. But again, we really don't know.

Now, Russia has claimed to make advancements around Krynky, but Ukraine says that it is still holding on to its positions there.And as the war approaches its second anniversary, Ukrainian forces are stretched thin. They've been outmanned and outgunned from the beginning. But, the longer and longer the war goes on, replenishing the ranks, well, that gets harder as well. CNN's Christiane Amanpour reports now from the frontlines, (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (VOICE-OVER): Snow falls softly on new recruits for the Ukrainian Army's Third Assault Brigade. Drill sergeants push them through their paces with urgent basic training for the trenches, urban warfare and assault maneuvers.

Just watch this video call between a severely injured soldier Evan (ph) and his panic-stricken sister Katarina (ph). UNIDENTIFIED MALE (TRANSLATED): Everyone left, everyone retreated. They told us a car would pick us up. I have two broken legs, shrapnel in my back. I can't do anything. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (TRANSLATED): Are you there alone or what? AMANPOUR (voice-over): Evan and his comrades never made it. Ukraine says there was a deal Russia would evacuate them and exchange prisoners. Instead, Russia released video of them dead. The brigade says they were shot. These are desperate times in Ukraine's fight to survive. They need to replenish the ranks of the dead and injured. And even here at the Superhumans facility in the western city of Lviv, therapists and prosthetic specialists work around the clock giving these war amputees a second chance and even a return to the front lines. 25-year-old Anastasia Savka (ph) is an army sniper. She stepped on a landmine in November near this Zaporizhzhia front, and she tells me they are scattered there like snow drops in spring, like daisies in summary. We couldn't get out for a long time because we were under very heavy fire, she tells me. To be honest, we were ready to die there. The attacks was so close, and we were thinking this was the end. Olga Rudneva is CEO of this center, which is supported by Ukrainian businessman and the American philanthropist Howard Buffett. 80 percent of the patients are military, many of the multiple amputees, and that's because, Olga says, the wounded cannot get out of the battle zone during the so-called golden hour to save their limbs.",

Now, the show of force comes amid deepening tensions with Washington over the war in Ukraine and the death of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. President Biden slamming Mr. Putin last night at a fundraiser in San Francisco, saying \"We have a crazy S.O.B. that guy, Putin, others. And we always have to be worried about a nuclear conflict.\" And here is how the Kremlin responded to that.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN SPOKESPERSON (TRANSLATED): Such rude statements from the head of the U.S. state are unlikely to offend in any way the head of another country, especially President Putin.

We have been hearing about this with my sources, Democratic sources for several weeks now that if this bipartisan border security proposal falls apart, which it absolutely did, within minutes of it being released last month, that this is something that the President should do.

And I think that that resonates with people. I think they want to see that he is forceful, that he is strong.

It's a pretty big development in the sense that for some days now, since Friday, Lyudmila Navalnaya, Alexei Navalny's mother, has been trying to get access to her son's remains so she can give them a funeral. So far, she has been unable to do that. She has been refused entry to the morgue where it's believed in the far north of Russia the body has been held. She has now, within the past few minutes, announced that she has gained access to the body and has actually seen the corpse of her son Alexei Navalny. So, that's something. But, I mean, obviously, that has come with some strings attached aswell, because what Lyudmila Navalnaya is also saying is that she is being blackmailed by the Russian authorities to bury the body in a certain way. They're trying to set conditions, she is saying, on how and when and where the body should be laid to rest. What her claim is, and she has made this in a video message, is that she is being threatened that unless the burial is a secret burial, then the Russian authorities will take care of the arrangements themselves, and not allow her to have any part of it. That's the implication. And of course, you have to remember that not only is this a terrible time and a difficult time for the family of Navalny and for his supporters, of course, but it's also a very sensitive moment for the Kremlin, because it's an intensely political decision about what happens to the body of Alexei Navalny. This is a man who in life was able to rally tens of thousands of people onto the streets of Russia, posing a massive political challenge or at least a bigger challenge to the Kremlin than any other opposition leader has managed to pose in recent decades. And the concern in the Kremlin, I expect, is that a public funeral of Alexei Navalny could be a trigger for more kind of outpouring of protests and opposition to the government.

They say they need to keep the body for at least another couple of weeks, this is what they've told the Navalny family, to carry out chemical tests, autopsies and post mortems to try and establish what the cause is.But, this whole issue is fraught with suspicion, particularly on the Navalny support and Navalny team, Navalny family side. Alexei Navalny has been poisoned once before using a Russian nerve agent Novichok. He only barely survived that. And the Navalny team and others have accused the Russian authorities of being directly responsible for that, although the Kremlin has denied any culpability. The concern on the Navalny side now is that his body is being hid from view and not being released so that the real cause of death can also be hidden.

Joining us now from Houston, Texas, is Dr. Regina blue. She is a deputy with NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services. Doctor, good to have you today. It's so interesting just hearing some of the emotions around this event, as we just said, nervous, excited. I heard someone from Intuitive say it's really emotional.

And so, to have not only visualized or dreamed about and put in place this commercialization effort, to have it actually being executed is something that literally gives me chills.

It also sets the framework for us to not only have safe human presence on the lunar surface, it sets the framework for us to have sustainable human presence on the moon, which will allow our crew to indeed explore the lunar surface and give us back answers to many science questions that are still not answered today.",

Earnings released Wednesday showed the chipmaker's profits hitting nearly $12.3 billion in the last quarter, up from, get this, $1.4 billion in the same quarter a year ago. Now, the company is riding the wave of AI investments and also posted revenue gains of 265 percent year-over-year. And early on Wall Street, Nvidia, I'm going to guess, started today pretty strong, yeah, up 15 present. Shares are currently trading at about $779 a share.More broadly, let's take a look. It has been lifting the broader markets thus far. And green across the board. Dow, NASDAQ, especially the NASDAQ, look about, 2.5 percent. And the S&amp;P is up about 1.7 percent. And taking a look at the European and Asian markets, how they finished Thursday, green across the board. Look at the Nikkei, also having a historic day, lifted in part perhaps because of these Nvidia developments. So, let's being in Anna Stewart who joins us from London with more on the Nvidia surge. So Anna, walk us through -- I mean, it seems like it was nothing but highlights for the company. ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It felt like nothing but highlights, and this was certainly the expectation going into the earnings. They keep beating expectations. I am actually going into this. Goldman Sachs said this is the most important stock on planet Earth. And it certainly feels like that today looking at both the increase in the share price for Nvidia but also how it really has buoyed stock markets in different sectors, literally all over the world. Now, highlights from the earnings report, here we go. Profits up 580 percent compared to last year. Fourth quarter revenue comes in at $22.1 billion. And why? Well, that's because Nvidia accounts for 70 percent of AI chips around the world. It is the market leader, and by a country mile compared to competitors. Now, supplies simply cannot meet demand. So, they also have very much a price control here in the market. So, leading today, the only slight cloud on the sort of blue skies of the earnings report we saw is the fact that there are restrictions in terms of how much Nvidia, in terms of certain AI chips, how much they can export to China due to U.S. trade restrictions. But, apart from that, we're looking at an absolutely stellar report.",

Like, compared to all of its competitors, this is the leader for now. But, you're right. All of these big competitors in the chip market are trying to get the edge on AI. The reason Nvidia is ahead of the game really is the fact that it's been in this space in terms of gaming, cryptocurrency, data centers, for many, many years. So, it has led the way. It's almost part and parcel of the AI wave. It is the backbone, for instance, with some of the largest language models in the world, like ChatGPT.So, it's very much part of the AI story. Will it be forever? Well, that was a question that was actually put to the CEO of Nvidia at the World Government Summit last week. Here is what he had to say to Richard Quest.",
