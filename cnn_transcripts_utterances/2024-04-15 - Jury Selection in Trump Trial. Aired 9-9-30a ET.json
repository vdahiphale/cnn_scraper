Who ends up in the box will determine if Trump is convicted of any of those criminal counts connected to the alleged scheme. The jurors identities will remain hidden from the public out of concern for their safety, but their ultimate judgements will not be.Even before today, Trump has, on social media and in speeches, fired a barrage of lies and smears and threats describing the presiding judge and the district attorney as conspirators in an elaborate nonexistence scheme run by his opponent, Joe Biden, to persecute and punish him. Now, many of those accusations are completely false, of course. The trial will also likely feature well-known witnesses, Michael Cohen, the former president's fixer, and Stormy Daniels, whom Cohen and Trump allegedly tried to pay into staying quiet in the final stretch of the 2016 election. We're going to start off our coverage with CNN's Kara Scannell, who is just about to head inside the courthouse for jury selection.

I know it's probably hard for people to realize, this is actually the first day because Trump's team sought a lot of delays over the last several weeks and months. They were unsuccessful ultimately in getting it delayed any further past today.Though it is teeming with people outside the courthouse here. A lot of members of the media here to cover this trial given it is so historic. And I can tell you, for top of mind for Donald Trump right now as he is making quite clear on social media today is how his political fate is going to be shaped by what happens inside that courtroom behind me because, of course, they could ultimately determine what happens come November. They could have a role in looking at the election. And that is something that Donald Trump is thinking about as he is entering that courtroom. He has just arrived here at 100 Centre Street to begin this trial. Got CNN's Paula Reid and Kristen Holmes here with me as we are always outside the courthouse. And, Paula, you know, getting up to this day, Trump's team was trying delay, delay, delay. What is their actual strategy going to be now that this isn't getting delayed, they are going to be inside this courtroom and this is going to be starting?",

You know, they would argue that, look, we each have ten strikes, right, people that we can try to eliminate, but if it's just a minority of the potential jurors of that pool of 100 who are pro-Trump, it will be easy, right, for the prosecutors to wipe them out, but then you have all these other people who are against their client.So, what we're going to see is as they go forward they're going to try to preserve every possible issue for appeal. You just heard Kara talking about this issue of people who will be dismissed for cause. Now that could be, you don't speak or understanding English or you have a vacation or you have a bias, you can't be impartial. And the Trump team really wants the judge to separate out these folks who are being dismissed for cause because they want to, later on down the road, be able to show, look, this is how many people we lost because they couldn't possibly be impartial. And as we go through jury selection and the trial, you're going to see them - some folks say it's a delay strategy, in some cases it is, but he also has legitimate, constitutional rights that they are going to try to assert throughout this process.",

They have no idea how this plays out. We have not gotten to this stage before. Obviously, this is unprecedented. And we are now in a general election. What happened during a primary is not the same thing that's going to happen in a general election. But too, when it comes to Donald Trump himself, he does not want to be sitting through this trial. We have to remember that this is a deeply embarrassing case for Donald Trump. We are likely to hear salacious details. I mean at the heart of this is an alleged affair with a porn star and then hush money payments to cover up said affairs. That is not something Donald Trump wants on full display for everyone to see, particularly heading into this election. So, he is angry. He has been ranting. He has been talking to people about how he doesn't understand why they could not get more delays.

We don't have actual cameras in the courtroom. So, we're going to have to glean is through the presentation of evidence, what the jurors actually find.But the prosecution is going to be really key here. There are 34 counts of falsifying business records. They've got to meet the burden of proving this is an intentional act by Donald Trump. This is important because it says it actually has to have the intent to defraud, an intend to commit another crime and trying to cause a false entry of a record. What was that false entry, that Michael Cohen paid money to Stormy Daniels and said it was for one thing and then actually it was for quite a different matter, a falsification of a business record, trying to get reimbursement. But the idea of what was the other underlying crime is the sub - is the issue people have with Alvin Bragg's case here. What was the other crime he was intending of committing? How can you prove it? And, of course, this dates back to 2015 when the original (INAUDIBLE) had with David Pecker at AMI, who was supposed to be the eyes and ears of the Trump campaign, you're talking about really nine years later having this case be brought. So, there are a number of issues people find with them. By the end of the day, he has a burden of proof, and he feels he can meet it.",

All the gag order says is he's not allowed to comment publicly about witnesses, jurors, court staff, prosecutors staff, or their families. He is allowed to complain, vociferously, about the case itself, about Judge Merchan, about the DA Alvin Bragg. And just over the weekend, Donald Trump has been publicly posting attacks on Michael Cohen, known witness, Stormy Daniels, known witness. He called them, quote, \"sleaze bags,\" his word. He commented earlier about Mark Pomerantz, a potential witness. And so, is the DA - I want to see in the next few minutes, first thing out of the DA's mouth should be, judge, he violated the gag order. If you tolerate this, it's like raising a child. If the child breaks a rule and you let it go, you've lost them. And so one of the challenges for Judge Merchan here is going to be enforcing discipline in this court.

Donald Trump's team then entered into what's sometimes called a hush money agreement with Stormy Daniels, where they paid her and she remained silent.Now, it's important to understand how that agreement worked. First of all, Michael Cohen, then Donald Trump's attorney and fixer, and a key player, a key witness in this trial, he paid Stormy Daniels $130,000. Now, the second half of that transaction is really important because after the election Donald Trump and his businesses, they then reimbursed Michael Cohen for that $130,000 plus several hundred thousand dollars more. And it's really important because this gets to the actual criminal charges to understand how Donald Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen. Donald Trump issued a series of 11 checks to Michael Cohen for about $35,000 each. Some of them, not all of them, but some of them signed by Donald Trump himself. There's that distinctive Donald Trump signature. And so that's really what lies at the heart of this. The payment of hush money is not a crime, it's the way they structured the reimbursements.",
