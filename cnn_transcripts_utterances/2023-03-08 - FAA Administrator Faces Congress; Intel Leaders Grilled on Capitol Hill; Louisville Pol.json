I'm Abby Phillip in Washington.The Justice Department has just issued a scathing and disturbing report on the Louisville Police Department nearly two years after a nearly-two-year civil rights investigation. Now, Attorney General Merrick Garland launched this probe in the months after the Louisville police shot and killed unarmed black woman Breonna Taylor inside of her home. And a short time ago, Garland explained that that botched raid in March of 2020 was part of a practice of abuses by the city. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  LMPD leader told the department: \"Breonna Taylor was a symptom of problems that we have had for years.\" The Justice Department's findings and the report that we are releasing today bear that out.

You see excessive force. You see unlawful stops of African-Americans throughout this entire Louisville metropolitan area. It's also a problem that, according to the Justice Department, the Louisville Police Department knew very, very much was existing for years and years. They did internal reports to study the problem, came up with these reports, and then just buried them. Here's Attorney General Merrick Garland describing more of what they found. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

As you just heard Evan say, I mean, this report really points to widespread abuses. It touches not just on race, but also on gender, on people with disabilities. These probes have happened before. They happen all over the country in police departments big and small. What stood out to you on this one?",

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, it's really essential that you have that sort of collaboration, for a number of reasons.First is that, oftentimes, police departments and police leaders are hamstrung in what they can do and what they can actually change within their own department, particularly where it comes to disciplining officers, because they are restricted by broad collective bargaining agreements that don't allow any really effective, quick, substantial change. And so often police leadership is pleased to have DOJ come in, and basically enforce the law and require that sort of change. And then, as you mentioned, in order for this stuff to really stick, to push cultural change across a law enforcement institution, it's very hard. It takes a long time. It takes commitment over years and years to really change the mentality, and that -- you can't force that on people. You have to have them bought into that process.",

WILLIAMS:  Well, the Justice Department is kind of limited in its ability to set nationwide policing policy. That's a federalism question, where the Justice Department can't really set standards for local police departments across the country. And what can happen is when you have systemic abuses and problems, go in and try to come to an agreement. But let's not forget here, the Justice Department does have the ability to go in and sue and use the law if these negotiations break down. So it is a very powerful tool. Your point is very well-taken or the question is very well-taken, in that why can't -- it's clearly -- it's a bigger problem than just one police department. I think we can all stipulate to that. But what our government gives us is the ability only to handle it on a local, case-by-case level.",

But it piqued my interest because it sounded almost identical to what was going on in Memphis with that SCORPION unit that was involved in the Tyre Nichols case. What are your thoughts about the scrutiny now that we're seeing on these specialized units and whether they really need to be looked more closely at?",

Police chiefs and mayors are under enormous pressure to respond quickly to raises in the crime rate. And so they're often compelled to pull together these units and to kind of give them the green light to pursue some very aggressive law enforcement tactics. I think it's a great idea that DOJ is coming in here and at least opining and offering some guidance on how to best equip, train and most, importantly, supervise those units, so they don't become units with a -- with a broad remit and basically out of control and not subjected to the rigorous sort of supervision that you need when you're really pushing the envelope on enforcing crime aggressively in places where the crime rates are very high.",

So the city, which has -- for weeks has been promising to release this video, they had every reason to expect to release it today late this afternoon. And then all of a sudden, we get word that one of the attorneys for the now former officers, of the defendant Desmond Mills, his attorney, Blake Ballin, suddenly at the last minute filed this motion with the Memphis court to prevent the city from releasing the video. We don't know why this motion was filed. We don't know why the judge has agreed to this. They had a very quick hearing. My understanding is, it was in chambers. It wasn't even in the public. And this decision was made that they were going to delay the release of this video that certainly we have been asking to see, that the public, that the community has been asking to see, some 20 hours more of what went on in the moments before and after police encountered Tyre Nichols. So we're not getting this video today. And, certainly, I think our lawyers are going to get involved in it, and we're going to try to figure out what happened here. And all of this comes, as you said, as the Department of Justice today announcing that, in Memphis, they're going to do a review, a review of the police department's use of force policies, their de-escalation policies. But also, Abby, you were just talking about specialized units. The DOJ said that, after the Tyre Nichols incident, they got calls from police chiefs across the country saying:  We need help. We want you to start giving us some guidance and assistance on these specialized units. And so, as a result of that, they are now going to start looking at specialized units all across the country. So there's a lot still obviously going on in the Memphis investigation. And now we're seeing DOJ starting to look at what the Memphis police there have been doing. And there's a lot of similarities. You talk about this VIPER unit in Louisville. Same thing here. You had a car stop that was -- we're not entirely clear for why, that then ultimately led to this encounter with police, this aggressive encounter that Tyre Nichols had with police. But, again, a lot happening there in Memphis, as we now have to wait to see exactly what this other information is and when it's going to become public.",

They have had administrative hearings for 13 officers; 13 officers in Memphis have faced administrative hearings in relation to this. Seven have been fired. Three have been suspended. One resigned in the middle of this because they were expecting that they would be fired. And then two actually had their charges dismissed at these administrative hearings. And the city also told us yesterday in a city council hearing they were going to release information about those administrative hearings tomorrow. But now all of that, again, is delayed, as we try to figure out why the judge at this at this late hour, really, just before the city was getting ready to release this information, decided to prevent them from doing so.",

We will get back with you if you have any more information on how that is going to go.But let's get back to Elliot Williams and Andrew McCabe standing by for us. So, Elliot, can I just start with you? I don't know if you have any thoughts on this delay. I mean, it seems odd to me, considering that so much of the other video was released. If it's video of the same incident, what would be the justification for holding it back?",

And perhaps there's some caution the part of the judge about either, number one, prejudicing the defendants who have been charged with crimes or people who are shown in the videos, but haven't been charged with crime, the uncharged sort of free citizens, as it were. I don't know. Now, I would think that this material would eventually come out, given the immense public interest in it and, like you said, Abby, the fact that other videos have been released too. Also perhaps because they're moving toward a criminal trial in a few months, they're worried about further tainting or prejudicing the jury pool, as they might move toward picking one. But, again, it's hard to see why the judge came to this conclusion today.",

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, this is essentially the very beginning of the process we're seeing kind of come to a bit of a conclusion in Louisville.So, DOJ will go in with a team of investigators, and they will really focus on the activities, it sounds like, of the specialized unit, the SCORPION unit that we know was involved in the Tyre Nichols attack. But it will probably go much broader than that. They're going to look at -- look for things that we refer to as pattern and practice investigations to see if they can uncover whether or not the Memphis Police Department is routinely violating the law, routinely violating their own policies, and really creating an environment that tolerates those sorts of violations and bad behavior on the part of their officers. It's important to point out though, Abby, each one of these investigations, even one like Louisville, where we have seen some significant findings, even if it's just a small percentage of the sworn law enforcement work force in Louisville, the bigger concern here is that they were able to do these things for such a long period of time, and really not receive any consequences from their own management and leadership. People knew this was going on and did nothing about it. So, really, the goal of these pattern and practice investigations is to restructure the way the department is supervising their law enforcement officers to ensure they find acts of poor behavior and violations of law and take care of them immediately, so they don't let that stuff persist.",
