The scheduled start date there is March 4, which is about 40 days from right now. And they have to start picking a jury a couple of weeks before that. But of course, that case is currently hung up in the court of appeals on the immunity question. We don't have a ruling. That could come at any moment. Could be going to the Supreme Court next.

Even though it is tentatively scheduled for May, it is widely considered that that date will be pushed. They are certainly concerned about going up against Jack Smith, in any court of law, but they are increasingly optimistic that the longer it takes to get this answer from the appellate court on immunity, the longer it takes to get to the Supreme Court, get an answer for them. And the closer you get to the election, the harder it gets to bring a trial. Although I will note, our colleague Evan Perez tried to press Merrick Garland on just how close to the election are you comfortable starting one of these federal trials. Because historically, they have not taken investigative steps in any case that can impact an election 60 days outside the election. This isn't an investigation now. This is a trial.
