I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us.Vice presidential candidate Tim Walz making a pitch to union workers in his first solo campaign stop since Kamala Harris tapped him as her running mate. Walz's message -- he tried to make it clear he thinks working-class voters, which Democrats, frankly, have lost a lot of ground with to Republicans, have much more in common with the Democratic ticket than they do with Donald Trump and J.D. Vance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TIM WALZ, (D) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The only thing those two guys knows about working people is how to work to take advantage of them. That's what they know about it. Every single chance they've gotten, they've waged war on workers. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Washington correspondent for NY1, Kevin Frey. Welcome to both of you. Thank you for being here. I have to say, look, Democrats have really struggled to figure out how to criticize Donald Trump on this working class. I mean, it is very clear Trump's populist policies have pulled a lot of working class voters, especially white working class voters, but increasingly, also voters of color into the Republican camp. That way of putting it was a little bit sharper than I've seen some Democrats do in the past because yeah, imagining Donald Trump making a McFlurry is an image that, you know, it's pointed. Mychael, how do you view him -- I mean, he does seem like a decent messenger on this topic.",

He was one of the dark horse candidates until -- up until the end when he sort of emerged as one of these top contenders for the job is because something that folks like about him is he's able to talk not in politic talk, not in jargon. He talks straight to the voters. Democrats have referred to him as America's coach, America's uncle, and things like that.He has this ability to talk straight to the voters in a way that they can understand, especially working class voters. He mentioned his experience being a member of a union. I think that could be very effective for Democrats and help them potentially pick up ground in this area. But we have this look back on the veepstakes era and why Harris ultimately went with Walz. We're seeing some more indications of his strengths of things that he brings to the ticket.",

It's one that has strongly divided them. Staunchly pro- Israel Democrats up against pro-Palestinian liberals who are concerned about the mounting humanitarian deaths in the Gaza Strip.This has really become a large matter for the Democratic Party, one that they've had issues working through during this election. Of course, antisemitism should not be tolerated under any circumstances. I'm curious to see, though, if Walz is going to receive more pressure on this. If he's going to be pushed into a place where he has to disavow this.

If English is your second language, sometimes kids say having the phone in the classroom can be helpful. But, of course, the big concern is social media and mental health distractions in the classroom. And a big thing I should note here is that we saw during COVID a huge push into digitization earlier with kids. So it used to be that kids were getting cell phones -- you know, 12, maybe 13 or 14. Now that age is much, much earlier. You're talking 10 or 11 years old.

So that's another reason why they would want to ban it. But the big thing is this is really hard to enforce. Like, you might say that cell phones are banned in some schools. There's metal detectors forcing you to give up your phone. But at the end of the day, teachers -- there's fewer of them, right, and classrooms are being overwhelmed. Sometimes you're looking out at a classroom of 20 or 30 kids, and they've got phones on their laps. It's really hard to say put that phone away. Sometimes you can't even see it.",

We're not learning that the head of the Court of Arbitration for Sports panel that ruled against Chiles ultimately awarding third place to Romania's Ana Barbosu has actually represented Romania in legal cases for almost a decade. So, Dr. Hamid Gharavi was one of the people on the three-member panel that voided an on-floor appeal from Chiles' coach, saying it came four seconds beyond the one-minute deadline for scoring inquiries. USA Gymnastics disputed that ruling and even presented timestamped evidence that the appeal came in 47 seconds. But Gharavi and the panel said rules do not allow them to reconsider their initial ruling. When asked for comment on a possible conflict of interest in the decision, Gharavi told CNN he was not in a position to comment and referred CNN to the court. CNN has reached out to the court but has not heard back. USA Gymnastics said they will be appealing to the Swiss Tribunal for Chiles to keep her bronze medal. Meanwhile, rapper and Olympics hype man Flavor Flav -- well, he's stepping in to help. He posted a video of a bronze clock on X with the caption \"I gots yo back, Jordan Chiles.\" And Chiles' mom responding, saying it means the world, adding, well, her daughter is not on social media right now, as you can imagine. All right, to baseball where Juan Soto had himself a night in Chicago. The 25-year-old homered not once, not twice, but three times against the White Sox. It was the first time in Soto's career he's hit three homers in a game. He's now got 33 on the season. The Yankees won that one 4-1. The Dallas Cowboys, meanwhile, haven't won a Super Bowl in nearly 30 years but that hasn't stopped their value from just continuing to skyrocket.
