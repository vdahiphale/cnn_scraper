For the last 10 months, however, we have not seen the Biden ministration actually use the leverage that it has in order to be able to secure a ceasefire. It's been doing a lot of other things except for actually using its leverage. And this is part of the reason why on the one hand it could be so that a ceasefire could end this escalation and the Iranians will back down and not retaliate.But for that to happen, it necessitates that Biden for the first time actually uses his leverage. Short of that, I don't see any other diplomatic exit out of this escalatory spiral right now. And if Biden had been pressing the Israelis much more forthcoming earlier on, there wouldn't have been a strike against Lebanon and Iran by the Israelis in the first place. So I think the onus is actually more on the Biden ministration to put pressure and make sure that the Israelis agree to a ceasefire and then use that to see whether that can lead to a de- escalation from the Iranians. Last time the Israeli struck the Iranian embassy in Syria they actually demanded a ceasefire as a way for them to not retaliate. This time around, we haven't heard him say that, and I suspect that it's partly because they have very little confidence that Biden actually will use the leverage that he has.",

We're being told that Haniyeh was killed not by an Israeli air strike, but rather by a bomb smuggled into his room. And \"The Times of Israel\" reports this understanding that it wasn't Israeli missile but rather a smuggled-in bomb which was detonated remotely could lead Tehran to step down from its threat to attack Israel, this is according to officials, adding that Iran itself has carried out similar attacks in foreign countries in the past.How credible does that sound to you? PARSI: It does not sound very credible to me at all. I have great doubts about the story that this was a bomb. I think it's actually designed to create a narrative in order to either get the Iranians to back off or to use Iran's retaliation and say that that is wildly disproportionate in comparison to a bomb and use that to actually escalate further. So we haven't seen any clear evidence for that narrative, but I think we should also keep in mind, bomb or missile, whatever it was, this was deeply embarrassing to the Iranians. It was humiliating because it really showed that huge gaps that they have in their security. And I think after first having said so strongly that they will take action, the only way to prevent that is that they have to secure a win elsewhere such as a ceasefire in order to get them to back down. Additional threats of what will be done to the Iranians, I don't think we'll be able to get them to back down. They have to have an exit that provides them with a win.",

And those circumstances obviously getting the hostages out, securing a ceasefire in Gaza will be far, far more difficult than it currently is and it's already hard enough to achieve that.This is part of the reason why inside of Israel there has been a tremendous amount of criticism against Netanyahu for these strikes, not because there's any love lost for any of these figures, but because it further complicates the efforts to get the hostages out and this is something that, you know, by now, quite a few senior folks in the Israeli government or a former officials have criticized Netanyahu for not prioritizing the release of the hostages.",

And total silence from Ukraine on the record about whether their troops are genuinely behind it. In the past we've seen Russian citizens volunteering to fight for Ukraine, making those short incursions into Russian territory.But this, if you believe the Russian narrative, is potentially the Ukrainian regular military striding five kilometers, three miles deep into Russian territory, possibly further. The targets of much of the assault appears to be a town called Sudzha. Russia calling this a major provocation. That's the words of President Vladimir Putin suggesting that the Ukrainians have been firing on residential areas, but rich after Moscow has been doing that in Ukraine for over two years. But he was assured by his chief of staff that the advance had been halted. A very different picture, though, seen on social media videos, some suggesting without -- what we can confirm ourselves that even Russian servicemen were surrendering to Ukrainians, according to some Ukrainian accounts, showing damage inside the town of Sudzha and potentially a multi-pronged Ukrainian move inside of Russia. Why? Well, some analysts are pointing towards a gas terminal near Sudzha, which controls Russian gas that moves through Ukraine to Europe. Still now in the third year of the war, that may now be under Ukrainian control, that may have been the objective. Kyiv often looking to get control or inflict damage or influence on Russian infrastructure. But it's also a rare moment of good headlines for Ukraine in a war where they've seen the Donbass front line find Russian forces moving forwards incrementally, deliberately, but very steadily towards Ukrainian military hubs. It's been simply bad news for Kyiv for quite some time about manpower and frankly in public, too, disputes about the effectiveness of so much of their military strategy. Those same disputes were around this day in reference to the incursion into Russia. Questions about whether this is the best use of Ukraine's skinned military resources. That question I think will persist in the days ahead as we learn exactly what the objectives of this incursion has been, but it has certainly caught the Kremlin off guard, scrambling to try and bring reinforcements to this area and having to deal with a totally unexpected after so many months of Ukrainian probing around those border areas.

On social media, we heard the news from Barracuda Music, this is the promoter for Swift's concerts in Austria.

Now, it was on early on Wednesday morning that was when police in Austria made their arrest. They first arrested a 19-year-old Austrian citizen who is described as being a sympathizer of Islamic State. Now the arrest took place, let's bring up the map for you, in Ternitz. This is a place located south of Vienna and there in Ternitz chemicals were found. These chemical substances were found by officials in that suspect's home. And then later on Wednesday, the police detained another person in Vienna. Police say that the two suspects were radicalized on the internet and they were taking, quote, \"concrete measures\" for a terror attack. And the assumed target were events in the Vienna region. Again, this coming from the police. We also heard from the chancellor of Austria, who says, with these arrests tragedy has been averted. Let's bring up his post on the social media platform X. This is from Karl Nehammer, the Austrian chancellor, who said, \"Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN,\" that refers to Austria's director for security intelligence, \"with foreign services, the threat was identified early on, combated and a tragedy prevented,\" unquote.

But two sources are now telling CNN Hezbollah may go it alone. Striking Israel first before Iran. The Lebanon based militant group, Iran's most powerful proxy, just across Israel's northern border apparently is moving faster and plans to attack Israel in the coming days, according to those sources. On Wednesday, an emergency meeting in Saudi Arabia by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, which held Israel responsible for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, as well as a top Hezbollah commander last week. CNN's Nic Robertson has more now from that foreign ministers' meeting in Jeddah. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And only seven or nine or so landed in Israel. I mean, and caused no damage except they injured, you know, a poor Bedouin girl. So, they can't afford to have something that -- that happened again this time. So, I think they'll want the time to plan this properly. And that might take a couple of weeks. You know, the last time they responded in April, it was nearly two weeks after what was perceived as the Israeli provocation. So, it may take another week or a couple of more weeks for them to get the planning down so they feel that they have a good chance of overwhelming Israeli defenses and doing something substantial this time, that -- that really hurts the Israelis.",
