Just -- we can get -- we can let it go on. Just think about it. If this was your child, would you want them to be in terrorist hands in captivity?

Gospel hymns that meant so much to her, that was by her design. It looks like any moment now, what we are going to see is the casket arrive. Slowly, we see a processional of vehicles. I'm going to have my photographer pan over here, as we wait for the casket to arrive any moment now. And, Sara, when it does arrive, what we will see is all of the Carter's living -- surviving grandchildren serving as pallbearers. But this is bound to be a touching ceremony.
