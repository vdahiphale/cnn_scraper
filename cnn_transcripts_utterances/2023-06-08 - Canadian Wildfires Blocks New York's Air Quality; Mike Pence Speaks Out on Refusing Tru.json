I think Charlie's point had a really good point that in the aftermath of the Stormy Daniels indictment, everyone, the folks who should've been competing with him or not, because they were worried about disaffecting the followers, and these are followers that he spent the last five and a half years tapping into fears telling them that the world has moved on, and that they are being persecuted by a world that does not appreciate them anymore.

How much losing can the party take? Under performance in 2018, 2020, you know, who is in the presidency in the senate, and again in 2022, Republicans certainly under performing in the House races?

We have this extraordinary footage that was released by a brigade of the Ukrainian Army on Wednesday, essentially dropping, using a drone to drop bottled water to a household in Oleshky, which is on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River in Russian-held territory.

And look, the trip is long for secretary of state standards as you said, and I think that should be an indication of the importance that the U.S. Places on this region. And, you know, the Saudis muscling their way into a position of influence in the global game of golf is a perfect example of the growing Saudi soft power that the Americans will tell you, you just can't ignore.They think that, look, if you ignore the Saudis, someone else is going to fill the vacuum. And we've already seen China, we've seen Russia trying to have a greater influence on the Middle East. In fact less than 24 hours after Anthony Blinken met with Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, he was on the phone with Vladimir Putin. You know, often on these foreign ships to western countries, the U.S. will talk about shared values, you know, freedom, democracy, human rights, things like that. It is abundantly clear that the Saudis don't share those values. And so, on this trip, U.S. officials are stressing shared interests, like peace, security, and economic prosperity, and there is plenty of that go around. Even the Americans will tell you that, look, U.S. exports to Saudi Arabia help support some 165,000 American jobs. And so, while there are plenty of human rights issues that the Americans could be raising with the Saudis, I thought it was really telling that in advance of this trip U.S. officials briefed the press and they were asked about what specific commitments they were raising with the Saudis, and they were not specific at all. And even after the meeting between Blinken and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, U.S. officials said human rights were raised, generally, and in specific cases, but they wouldn't say what those specific cases were. And so, while human rights may be a pillar of how the U.S. engages around the world, it doesn't seem to be a top priority, at least on this tour. Paula?",

And from the U.S. perspective, they view it as, look, they can't control what OPEC Plus does, they can control what the Saudis do. They have tried and failed in the past to get the Saudis to do what they want an oil prices, especially going into another election cycle where low gas prices are generally a good thing to make the administration look good.These production cuts haven't moved global oil prices that much. And so, from the U.S. perspective, they don't think it is that big of a deal. And considering all the other issues on the agenda, this one is likely pretty low, Paula.",

He is, of course, accusing the Mirror Group Newspapers of seeking information, obtaining information through unlawful means, phone hacking, voice mail interception, and the use of private investigator. And they went through a number of articles published between the mid- 1990s and early 2000s, which he alleges contains details, private information, which could, in his eyes, could only have been obtained through those illegal tactics, including conversations with his father. Now, he can tells that as well as details around his relationship with former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, at one point alleging he believed a private investigator had fitted a tracking device to her vehicles.These are pretty significant allegations, but he did face a pressing from Andrew Green, the lawyer representing MGN questions why exactly and how he believes he was hacked, where are the details on that, oftentimes telling the Duke of Sussex that he was entering the realm of speculation. That was something that later led to a show of emotion for Prince Harry. He was asked by his own lawyer how he felt to be accused of speculation, how it felt to face hours of cross examination. And he paused for a while before seemingly becoming a bit choked up by the accusation, saying it was a lot to go through these articles. But of course, this hearing is now continuing without him. We are hearing from Jane Kerr now, a former Mirror journalist, whose name appears on 10 of the 33 articles being assessed in court at the moment. She has defended her articles, she denies any wrongdoing, and says that if a private investigator used by the Mirror Group Newspaper were engaged in unlawful activities, this had nothing to do with a journalist who would have no way instructed that sort of activity.

The black actress, Halle Bailey, she has been widely praised for her inspired (inaudible) main character, Ariel, but apparently that isn't enough to win over certain would be viewers in China and South Korea who just can't get over the fact that Disney casts her in the role.Now, the film globally has found success in many countries around the world. In fact according to Calm (ph) Score, the film has made some $327 million globally, but China which, of course, the world second largest box office has contributed a very, very small amount. According to NDATA (ph), this is a Chinese box office tracker, is that in Mainland China it made only $2.7 million in his first five days and compare that to the latest \"Spider-man Across the Spiderverse,\" that brought in nearly $20 million in the first five days of opening in China. And, some people in china have been sharing their objections to the film online. One netizen on a Chinese box office platform said, quote, \"the fairytale I grew up with has changed beyond recognition,\" and Chinese State Media has encouraged and egged-on such responses. In fact, I want to show you this op-ed published right before the films debut in China. In the \"Global Times\" it said this, quote, \"the controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but it is lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy,\" unquote. Now, Disney declined to comment. Similar reaction has been found online and in South Korea. One user said that the movie had been, quote, \"ruined,\" using the hashtag, not my aerial. And according to additional data from the Koran Film Council in South Korea, \"The Little Mermaid\" has attracted some 472,000 viewers in the first week, far-less in comparison to the 643,000 fans that showed up for the latest \"Fast and Furious\" sequel.
