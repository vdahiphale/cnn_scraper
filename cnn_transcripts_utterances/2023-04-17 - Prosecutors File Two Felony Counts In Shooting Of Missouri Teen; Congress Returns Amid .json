We are standing by for reaction from Walker's family in this case, which sparked angry protests.Also tonight, the FBI, arresting two alleged Chinese agents, accusing them of running a secret police station in New York's Chinatown. The feds are describing it as an unprecedented operation aimed at intimidating Chinese dissidents. And a potential roadblock for Democrats' plans to temporarily replace Senator Dianne Feinstein on the Judiciary Committee. Some key Republicans now signaling they hope to block the move and keep Biden's judicial nominations log jammed. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is on assignment. I'm Alex Marquardt, and you're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We are following fast-moving developments in multiple stories tonight. Right now, we're awaiting a news conference from the prosecuting attorney in Kansas City, Missouri, where a black teenager was shot after mistakenly going to the wrong house where an elderly white man apparently lived. CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell is with us. Josh, walk us through what we know about the shooting, which took place several days ago.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Alex. We've been waiting to hear what authorities would say and when they would say it. As you mentioned, we are now standing by. The Clay County prosecuting attorney's office say that they are about to address the press. They're about to provide some type of information. We don't yet know what that will be, if that will be an announcement of some type of charge or whether they will simply describe how their investigation is proceeding, but, again, that should be happening here in just a few moments time. Of course, this comes after 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was grievously wounded last Thursday.And just to walk you through what occurred there, this happen -- appears to be a case of going to the wrong address. If we have the graphic, I'll throw it up there just to show you how close these two residents were. Essentially what we're learning is that his parents asked him to go to an address of 115th Terrace, he instead accidentally goes, it's just about a street away, to 115th Street. And that is where an elderly white man opens fire on Yarl, seriously injured again. Yarl's family says that he was shot in the head as well as the arm. Now, of course, there is this question about whether that homeowner will be held criminally liable. This question seems to come down to how it's interpreted about how one is able to defend their home. I want to show you here under a Missouri law, the so-called stand your ground laws, that allow someone to use deadly force either at home or out and about. What it says is that a person may use physical force upon another person when into the extent he or she reasonably believes that such force to be necessary to defend himself or herself or a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use of imminent use of deadly force by such other person. In layman's terms, what that says, is that if you're going to open fire on someone, under Missouri law, you have to be able to articulate that there was some type of imminent threat that you yourself or another party would have been subjected to dangerous or deadly force. Of course, the question here is that we're hearing from Yarl's attorney that he went and rang the doorbell at this location. So, again, the serious question there about why this elderly man would open fire and what type of reasonable force that that he, you know, can articulate to authorities. We know that he was taken into custody or at least questioned by police for a couple hours and then released. Authorities can only hold someone for about 24 hours until they have to make some type of charging decision. But we're waiting now to see what new announcement may be coming there.",

After a thorough review of the case file, the appropriate laws and information gained during the investigation phase of the case, I filed two felony counts.In count one, the defendant, Andrew D. Lester, is charged with a Class A felony of assault in the first degree, and that on or about April 13th, 2023 in Clay County, Missouri, he knowingly caused physical injury to P.Y. (ph) by shooting him. This is a felony. It carries with it a range of punishment of up to life. In count two, the defendant is charged with armed criminal action. This is an unclassified felony and carries with it a range of punishment between 3 to 15 years. The state is alleging the defendant committed the family of assault in the first-degree, as charged in count one, by, with and through the knowing use, assistance and aid of a deadly weapon. As a result of these charges, a warrant was issued for Mr. Lester's arrest and bond was set at $200,000. Our office worked closely with the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department during this case and we would not be here today but for their hard work. We understand how frustrating this has been. But I can assure you that the criminal justice system is working and will continue to work. As with any serious case, we approached this one in an objective and impartial manner.

We've seen cases before where between the investigation and an actual charge that oftentimes police will have eyes on a location.So, we're just waiting to see how long will pass before he is actually in custody, but we did learn a lot of key details there in that press conference, Alex. You mentioned the two very serious charges. But also we were told by the Clay County prosecutor that two shots were fired, but this is key, through a glass door. And so, presumably, this man, 85-year-old Andrew D. Lester, could see Ralph Yarl on the other side of that glass door before opening fire. And, again, it gets to what you and I were talking about just before that press conference. Under Missouri law, this all comes down to reasonableness. Now, in order to use deadly force, you have to have two things. You have to have a reasonable belief that the subject of your force poses an imminent threat and you have to reasonably believe that your deadly force is necessary to stop that threat. And, of course, the question here is it is not illegal to walk up to someone's door, to ring a doorbell or to knock on a door. The prosecutor just said that there was no indication that Mr. Yarl had crossed what's called the threshold. That is actually going into the property. And, so you know, this appears to be a what has been described by Mr. Yarl's family attorney, Ben Crump, that someone who was at this location who was in the subject of unreasonable force, that, at least according to prosecutors. It is worth pointing out, I want to know one thing, and our colleagues, the legal experts, can speak more to this. But also under Missouri law, say Mr. Lester says that I felt that this young man was trespassing or trying to come into my house to commit some violent act, it's up to -- the burden on the state to prove that this wasn't reasonable. But a lot of overwhelming evidence here, particularly if you have a glass door, someone who could prove presumably see the young man coming up, not posing a threat, according, you know, at least to prosecutors, very evidence and very serious charges.",

To be clear, I feel and do believe that the defendant will certainly avail himself or attempt to of the stand the ground, but there's a couple of important points to be made. Number one of the prosecutors, moving forward, he, in essence, is saying, that is the prosecutor, that the person who shot was not an immediate fear of death or serious bodily injury. That is the conclusion the prosecutor had drawn.Number two, he's concluded that the actions that he took and someone ringing the doorbell and firing shots were not reasonable, were not predicated upon enough evidence which would suggest that he was protecting himself and preserving his life. Quick pivot, when you look at the issue of stand your ground, stand your ground is not a license to kill. Stand your ground says that you don't have a duty to retreat. You don't have to run away. But you cannot just shoot and kill in the event that you don't have enough factual evidence to substantiate you being under attack, that there's a threat, is that threat reasonable. And so, clearly, the prosecutor believed that on the facts, as he knew them to be, based on an investigation, that that was not applicable, justification was not applicable and these would be the charges.",

We've seen these little amazing pictures of Ralph, just looks like an innocent kid whose only mistake was knocking on the wrong door.

He certainly, while he didn't have a duty to retreat, if he was really fearful, he could have. I mean he's inside. The so-called imminent threat is outside. And so it's not reasonable to believe that deadly use of force was necessary. And so I'm happy that they brought the charges.
