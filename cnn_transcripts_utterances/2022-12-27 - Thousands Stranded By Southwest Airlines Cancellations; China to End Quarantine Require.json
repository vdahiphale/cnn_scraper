And if you are just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.At least 49 people are dead in the aftermath of a deadly winter storm over the holiday weekend. Officials near Buffalo, New York, say that number could rise as emergency crews continue search and rescue efforts. And that winter storm is causing travel chaos nationwide. More than 2,700 flights have been canceled today in the U.S. the majority of those by Southwest airlines which reported significant operations setbacks on Monday, too. Southwest has canceled around 2,500 flights so far today -- according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. Speaking with CNN, a spokesperson for the website says the airline should have taken more precautions to avoid the chaos. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Southwest has had a great reputation and known for really outstanding customer service. So, I'm sure this really hurts them hard. But we have to look at the last worst day of cancellations in 2022, the day that broke the record -- until last Friday -- for 2022 was February 3rd. Nonholiday -- why people don't remember it. But the airlines canceled because of a weather event then, they knew a major ice storm was coming across the U.S. airports like Dallas Fort Worth shut down. Airlines canceled thousands of flights preemptively. And what helped them, is that people didn't get stranded.The problem with what's happened now is we also knew again that a horrific weather event was coming and it was going to be almost nationwide. But the airlines didn't really cut too many flights. Southwest cut a few, similar airlines had a few cancellations. But they tried to maintain those holiday schedules for the obvious reason, that the one thing passengers won't forgive you is if you don't get them where they want to be. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The country has announced that from January 8th it will no longer require inbound travelers to quarantine on arrival. China also said it will COVID an infection instead of pneumonia. Saying that's more in line with the characteristics and danger level of the disease. Despite this, the virus continues to spread like wildfire. It's infected so many people hospitals are getting overwhelmed with patients.CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me from Hong Kong with more on this. Kristie, China finally easing more of its COVID restrictions. But tell us more about the impact that this is having on public health in China.",

      "sentences": "Yes, you know, COVID-19 cases at the moment are skyrocketing across the country, and yet news of the international quarantine is very much welcome news to scores of Chinese who have waited close to three years to have the opportunity to travel abroad, to have a chance to reunite to see their loved ones overseas. You know, starting January 8th China will lift all quarantine restrictions for international arrivals. International arrivals will still have to take a COVID test before entering China but they no longer need to submit the result of that test to a Chinese embassy or consulate to get a code.Nevertheless, there's still some elements that are unclear. We don't know how many international flights will be able to enter China. We also don't know how easy it will be for Chinese travelers to travel overseas. But there's a lot of excitement building. And we've seen that excitement build online especially on trip.com. This is a very popular Chinese online travel booking service. And according to the company, it said within 30 minutes of this policy being announced online searches for popular overseas travel destinations reached a three-year high. The top ten included Macao, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the U.S., Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and the U.K. but the outbreak remains serious. And as China reopens its borders, you have countries like Japan, like India now announcing earlier today in the last few hours that new arrivals from China must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. According to Japanese officials, they say this is a policy that will be effective from December 30th. In Italy the officials in the Lombardy region are now saying that new arrivals from China must provide proof of a PCR test effective immediately. Back to you -- Bianca.",

That's according to a new study from the university of Cambridge. Researchers found women excel at cognitive empathy which is when a person is intellectually able to understand what someone else may be thinking or feeling. The study focused on women and men in 36 countries. And in no country did men score higher than women in cognitive empathy. In 21 countries their scores were similar. Just ahead, U.S. law enforcement officials are warning of a new type of cryptocurrency scam sweeping the country. And later, Russian President Vladimir Putin is hosting a summit in St. Petersburg. We'll have details of the event in a live report coming up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

For example, he's visited all five of the Central Asian countries since the start of that war. That is very unusual for him to do in the space of a year.It's clear he wants to cement his influence over this region, his sort of sphere of influence as a counterpoint to the sort of Transatlantic Western Alliance. You see him standing in the middle of that sort of family photo. Russian culture also on display. This morning there even touring the Russian museum in St. Petersburg. Putin telling President Lukashenko of Belarus -- who he has met with multiple times this year that he wants 2023 to be the year of the Russian language. But we have seen countries in this grouping wavering on their support for Russia in Ukraine. Kazakhstan and yet for example the Ukrainian health ministry reports this week that it's received generators from Kazakhstan as Russia continue to shell and bomb its energy grid. So, the support has been sort of there but also not completely full throated. Countries like Kazakhstan have tried to stay neutral. then this is crucial for Russia who wants to cement an economic ties on this day. Putin talked about trade, including about 6 percent in the first ten months of the year. Presumably, some of that displayed for Europe and security as well. Russia wants to be seen as the peacekeeper even as its war in Ukraine and the losses that its military have suffered there have tested that reputation.",

Tagovailoa did suffer a concussion in September after being sacked while playing the Bengals. The Dolphins currently sit in the seventh and final playoff spot in the American football conference just one game ahead of the Patriots.And the Denver Broncos have sacked head coach Nathaniel Hackett just one day after the Los Angeles Rams crushed the Broncos 51-14 on Christmas day. Broncos owner Greg Penner said that the search for a new head coach would begin immediately. Hackett was in his first season as a head coach but the team had a disappointing 4 wins and 11 losses during his tenure. And finally for this hour, an amazing act of kindness and generosity over the Christmas weekend.
