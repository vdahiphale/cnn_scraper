Slovakia's Prime Minister Robert Fico has been shot multiple times. That's according to his official Facebook page. The Prime Minister was rushed to a nearby hospital, and his social media account confirms that he is in life-threatening condition. Now, the shooting happened at a government meeting in Handlova, which is about two hours away from the capital of Bratislava. Now, these images on your screen, these images are from right after that shooting. You see here security officers rushing to try to move the Prime Minister to safety. I want to now bring in Nic Robertson, who has been tracking this story, and he joins us live from London. Nic, as I understand it, this happened within the last few hours. What more can you share with us about the details surrounding this shooting as far as we know?",

And at the same time, in the same images, you can see the Prime Minister literally being physically carried by his security detail. His legs are dragging and is bundled into that waiting black limousine there, taken off to the local hospital. All this has happened very, very quickly. The assailant appears to be really on the wrong side, if you will. He has gotten around the security barriers and has been able, it appears, to get close to the Prime Minister.Now, the images we're looking at there of the medical team around what appears to be the Prime Minister on that stretch there. We know that the first hospital he was in Handlova when he arrived there, he was conscious when he arrived. They say that they gave him life- stabilizing treatment, tried to stabilize his injuries. But, they said that he needed a higher level of care and was flown about 30 kilometers, 20 or so miles by helicopter to another hospital, which is where he is currently being treated. And the prognosis at the moment, according to government officials, they say that the coming few hours will be decisive. It is an assassination attempt, they say, that he was hit by multiple gunshots, and that he is in a life-threatening condition. Now, we know that the police have caught the assailant. We understand it. At the moment, it just was one assailant, but we don't have a full readout from the police yet. We don't know who the assailant was. We don't know what the motivation of the assailant was. But, we do know that Robert Fico was a divisive politician, loved as much as he was hated, if you will, a populist politician who was very strong anti- immigration, anti-Muslim, had been pro-Putin, in other words, tone that down a little since he got reelected Prime Minister in October last year. But, this is a figure who has courted controversy in the past, and there will be any number of enemies with any number of reasons who may want to take him down. We just don't have that information yet.",

We're hearing that Fico, authorities now confirming, was the only person who was injured in the shooting, as those who were on site have said that they heard multiple gunshots. So, the fact that authorities are now saying that Fico was the only person that was hurt is certainly something to consider.I want to show you now some video from the scene and it appears to show the Slovakian Prime Minister being essentially bundled into a car after he was shot. Now, we can't be sure that the person in this video is Robert Fico. But, again, it is one of the few images we have of the moments just after what authorities believe is an assassination attempt on the Slovakian Prime Minister. Let me bring Nic Robertson back. Nic, just give me a sense of your first reaction to hearing that news that despite the fact that this was a government meeting, despite the fact that -- I mean, presumably there were other people around besides Fico, he was the only person who was injured.",

      "sentences": "I think this tells us a number of things. He was the target. The assailant knew who he was, and will have had a reason for being there. This was a government business. But, it was an offsite meeting that was being held, and the Prime Minister had a press conference shortly afterwards. So, the location would have been known about. The timing probably would have been known about locally, at least. The fact that this wasn't happening, this government business wasn't happening in the capital Bratislava, perhaps also will give in the mind of an assailant, at least, the thought that perhaps security around the Prime Minister might be less tight, away from his sort of normal protective security bubble that he would be used to having, and would be around him in the capital.So, it's potential. We don't know the assailant planned to attack him here. I think we have a high level of confidence, those dragging legs that you see being taken and bundled into that -- into the into the waiting limousine, is the Prime Minister. And you can see in the same images there, the assailant being wrestled to the ground. The police by now, because they will have a name of the assailant, they'll have spoken to him. They will very likely have searched his apartment. They will very likely have looked at his social media feed. They're very likely have tried to talk to close friends by now. It's been a couple of hours. So, they will be building a picture of this assailant, and through questioning, may very well likely already know the motivation. The fact that it's not being made public will speak to a number of issues, will speak to the discretion of the police, the need to continue to work and make sure that he is not working in conjunction with others, which could lead to further arrests. But, there is also the possibility that the motives of this assailant could inflame tensions. As we've been saying, Fico is a divisive politician, loved as much as he is hated. And the people that support him, if they feel aggrieved about what's happened to him, particularly if his condition worsens and life-threatening status turns worse, this could escalate the tensions that might exist and develop around it.",

They've been turned against the West, NATO, the United States. They blame the United States, in particular, and NATO for provoking Russia. They have much more sort of sympathy with Putin and Russia on the whole than they do with Ukraine. And Fico used that to win reelection.

But, what the police want to know is, has he got accomplices who was helping him? Who else could be shot next? What could be the next move? Is this an individual or is it a group at work? And if it's a group at work, then you can expect the police to really hold their information close to their chest, because they're going to want to try to round up any other individuals associated with this person.They're going to be looking at his social media. They're going to be looking at who he made phone calls to. They're going to be looking at who his neighbors were? What conversations he had? What sort of person was he? Was he known to the authorities already? How was he able to get so close to the Prime Minister? All of these questions are going to be the immediate questions. And as yet, there is no indication. And I think the longer the hold goes on or the inflammation, then you can understand that the search may for potential accomplices, potentially other people involved, even peripherally, that will be going on in an information vacuum because that benefits the police.

And he has focused his agenda for the next four years on mass deportations of the 12 million undocumented immigrants. We already saw news about what's going on in Ukraine. Donald Trump would essentially hand Ukraine to Putin on a silver platter. That is not something that we need for our democracy. And speaking of democracy, he is someone who does not believe in our Constitution, who already tried to essentially have a coup here in the United States. And so, our democracy is on the line as well. So, that huge contrast, I think, will be tremendous advantage for President Biden going into the fall elections.",

So, the good news is, is that after months of inflation picking up, we saw it actually move in the opposite direction, it started to cool. That is obviously good news, one, for consumers, but perhaps even for Biden. The bad news is, is that consumers are really pulling back on their spending, and we still may not see rate cuts until the fall. And so, my question, Maria is, as you know, there is not a lot in the President's toolbox to fight inflation. That is the job of the Federal Reserve. So, what can he do? I mean, what differently can he do when he is talking especially to young voters who really feel the pinch of inflation? What does he say differently? Well, how does he reach them?",

How many young voters have been strapped with student debt? And this President has canceled millions and millions of dollars in student debt, mostly for black and brown students. As you know, that is transformational for a family who has maybe one or two huge debts because their kids are the first ones to go to college. That is going to be huge for young voters, and they will applaud him for that, and they will support him for that.The other issue is housing, rent and mortgages. President Biden and his administration just put forward a proposal to help voters who are struggling with rising rents and with difficult mortgages because of what you just mentioned. Because of inflation, the mortgage rates are high. So, these proposals will help those voters who are struggling, and again, they will look to that as transformational for them. And they will support President Biden and they will applaud him for that. The other issue for young voters, as you know, Rahel, is the climate. Climate change is a huge issue for these young voters because they know that it is an existential threat for them, their families, and for the future of our country, and frankly, the world. And President Biden is the only President that up until now has put together proposals and has passed laws that will actually make climate change better. So, I think President Biden has a ton to run on for young voters. And once he lays that out or continues to lay that out, they will support him in massive amounts, and say no to the dark MAGA extremism that Donald Trump represents.",

Now, we don't know the motivation of the shooter and his attempted assassination today, but certainly, that tells us a lot about the sort of the levels of tension in EU states at the moment, especially with the EU elections coming up in just a few weeks' time.",

I mean, he is in handcuffs. This is someone who has been detained. Authorities have not identified this gentleman as a suspect that he is, at this point, a suspected shooter. Of course, we will work to identify exactly who we're looking at and get more information from the authorities as it becomes available. But, Dominic, let me bring you back into this conversation here, and tell us a bit more, if you might, about the politics of Fico. As we have said earlier this hour, he was an ally of Viktor Orban. He is a friend of Putin. And so, talk to us a little bit about his allies and his politics.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, I think he has been around for a long time. He was first elected before Slovakia even became an independent nation state. He was elected when it was still Czechoslovakia, all the way back when he was in his late 20s. He is now almost 60-years-old. This is really Fico 3.0. He was previously Prime Minister in 2006, then in 2012. But, this new brand of Fico is one who, yes, his party is officially a kind of left wing nationalist populace. Lots of small parties in his country, like in many other European nation states. It's a parliamentary system. And in order to come to power, you have to form a coalition with the ultra-right nationalists. And essentially, the election played out around Ukraine and Russian support.So, there is on the one hand kind of fatigue with some member countries of the European Union for funding the Ukraine conflict, the war with Russia. And on the other hand, you have certain nation states that have this long-standing affiliation and loyalty to Russia. And this is what has played out in this context. The thing about Slovakia that's also interesting is it's a landlocked country surrounded by, in many ways, a group of countries around which EU politics are playing today. So, his most loyal neighbor, of course, you'd mentioned, would be Hungary, and Prime Minister Orban with whom he has the greatest kind of ties around Ukraine, around Russia, around the question of immigration. But, it also borders Ukraine and Poland and Austria, countries around which these politics and these tensions have been playing out in the last few years, if not decade or so.",

You think about Hungary. You think about Ukraine, obviously, and Russia, really, really fascinating politics at the moment. Of course, we don't know this situation or the scenario that may have motivated this person. That is a detail that we are still waiting for. But, we'll leave it here for now.

      "sentences": "Hard to explain. The cost of housing is tied back to rents. That's the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the keeper of the data, calculates the cost of housing. But, if you look at rents (inaudible), it rose a lot in the wake of the pandemic. When the economy reopened, a lot of households formed, and when they increased, rents jumped. But, over the past year, year and a half, almost two years, now rents have gone flat to down in most parts of the country, and that still hasn't made its way through.Now, the growth in the cost of housing services as measured by the BLS is slowing. It's just not selling as fast as it has historically. Now, when usually things don't stick to script like this, when they don't fit historically, they'll change. So, I would be surprised if we don't start to see further improvement in the growth of the cost of housing in the next few months going forward. And here is the other positive thing on this front, Rahel. We are getting a lot of new multifamily units constructed. The construction is very strong. And vacancy rates, which have been very low, are starting to rise, and that means that we'll see continued downward pressure on rents and I think that'll translate through. But, you're right. That's been the most frustrating part about the way we're measuring inflation and how inflation is going.",

They've been flat and trending lower, and they trended lower again in this last report. So, Mark, if you are at the Federal Reserve and you are looking at a report like this, and it's just one, it's just one report, and obviously we got a different report yesterday, that's something very different, that wholesale inflation report, what do you do with this?

The unemployment rate is below four percent, done that now for more than two years. In inflation, except for that persnickety growth in the cost of housing services, is already back to the Fed's inflation target. So, I'd be an outlier here on the consensus on the Fed would be to wait and get more evidence that inflation is actually coming in. But, I think they've got enough evidence.And the other thing I'd say is, look, rates are very high. Interest rates are very high. It's putting a lot of pressure on households. You mentioned all that credit card debt that is putting a lot of pressure on particularly lower income households. The longer they wait, the greater the chance that they break something, somewhere, and I don't see the reason why given, again, that they've achieved their goals of full employment and low and stable inflation.",

It's interesting, Mark, and it was interesting to hear you say you're an outlier, because the conversation that I hear more of is that, look, they need to stay where they are because of concerns of inflation picking back up, and so maybe they need to do more, in fact. So, that's really interesting.I do want to point out really quickly that the markets apparently love what they see in this report. I mean, all of them are higher. The Dow is off. That was up, I should say, six tenth of one percent, inching closer and closer to that 40,000 mark. So, Mark, so, let me ask, I know what you would do if you were at the Fed. What do you think the Fed will do? What's a good sort of guess of when they may start cutting rates?",
