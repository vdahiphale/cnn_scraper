And indeed, this strike, even if the Israeli military is saying that it was a tragic mistake, this is the kind of strike that underscores why the United States and so many other countries have been urging Israel not to go all out in Rafah because there are so many people packed into such dense areas like this camp for displaced Palestinians in the western part of Rafah. And the images from this strike were just absolutely tragic. As you could see, people not only hurt by the immediate blast, but by the fire that engulfed these makeshift shelters that people have been living in for months now. People emerging from the fire with bodies burnt, corpses blackened, being pulled out of the rubble. There was even an image of a baby with no head circulating online from this very incident.

You have to understand the people in Rafah, Rafah, which was a city of 300,000 people and then 1.4 million, twice the population density of New York City, but with none of the high rises. So, hundreds of thousands of people who fled because their own homes, the homes that they had saved and bought, had been bombed or destroyed, and in doing so had lost family members.So, these people who are living in tents, four, five, six months, you've got children who've lost, who've had mothers killed. You've got husbands whose wives have been killed. You've got children -- I've sat with children in these tents, Boris, who have had amputations, who need to be in hospitals, both for the psychological trauma that they've endured, but also the physical. But hospitals can't cope with them. So, we are in uncharted territory in terms of the trauma. And then you've got people side by side on top of each other. A teenage girl, a pregnant mom, an elderly woman, they will queue all day. They will queue 10 hours to use a shower. Sanitation at woeful levels. But this is where they've been forced to go. But we know nowhere is safe. We've been saying that for five months. Legally safe, you mustn't bomb it. But legally safe must also mean it has to have food, water protection. So, those things aren't there, David. So, children look into their mother's eyes and they know their parents can't protect them. And the same thing, parents know that they can't protect their children. So, we have this moment, Boris, where it blows up into this inferno, where the worst-case scenario is a direct strike in an area with massive amounts of civilians turns into a fire. And I guess, Boris, the point is that we should be appalled. We should be heartbroken and we must be outraged. But we should not be surprised. This will continue to happen.

Then the food, the central food kitchen disaster happened, and that's what prompted the president, of course, to cut off the 2,000-pound bombs. It doesn't look right now from what the Israelis have said as if that's a weapon they were using, but obviously they used something that was quite lethal to at least 45 civilians. And so, it strikes me the president's red line has been crossed here but it was the initial one, which was don't go into Rafah or risk having the United States cut off offensive weapons.",

So we will hear from Todd Blanche making the summations.And we're expecting, you know, the defense only put up two witnesses over the course of about 90 minutes. Donald Trump did not testify in his own defense. But of course, the defense doesn't have to put up a case. It is all up to the prosecution to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. And that's exactly what the defense will stress here. And they'll probably focus much of their closing on Michael Cohen. They'll talk about how the jury should doubt his credibility, talk about the fact that he's a convicted liar, and then ask the jury to really be skeptical of Michael Cohen pointing the finger at Donald Trump, tying him directly to this scheme, and more importantly, tying him directly to the repayment. When it comes to the prosecution, they'll talk about Michael Cohen, but they'll say it's not just Michael Cohen's testimony. It's also all of the evidence we have painstakingly amassed through all those other witnesses. And they'll point to the basis of the 34-count indictment for falsification of business records, which includes the eleven checks to reimburse Michael Cohen, many of which were signed by Donald Trump also the 11 invoices and then the 12 vouchers. So they will really focus in probably on that hard evidence as opposed to just Michael Cohen's testimony. So it's going to be hours of closings tomorrow.

Here's why he's corroborated, et cetera, et cetera. But I think prosecutors will also want to make the point, as you mentioned that even without Michael Cohen, they can still convict.And some of that is because there's only really one area where Michael Cohen provides the only direct evidence, and that's as to whether the former president knew about the way the reimbursement scheme was happening. And even their prosecutors will say, listen, you heard evidence from so many witnesses here that he never paid a cent without knowing exactly what it was for. You knew that the invoices were stapled to the checks. You know, there's just no way, given all that you've heard, that he didn't know exactly what was going on.

CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in the war zone with more on the fighting and the suffering on the eastern front. We should warn you, some of these images are disturbing.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The fragments of loss and losing so often go unheard, but fast unravel lives all the same. Two missiles hit this comfortable family home just outside Pokrovsk. Now only dust and the smell of a decaying family dog. We're close enough to the Russians. We can pick up their radio station. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (Through Audio Translation): The West will not give modern equipment to Kyiv. So, the ordinary Ukrainian soldiers will be the ones to suck it up.",

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Through Audio Translation): Something burns on my side. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Through Audio Translation): Where?

That's all, it's done honey. WALSH (voice-over): The doctor says last year during Bakhmut was much busier. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Through Audio Translation): Two hundred people a day. WALSH (voice-over): The beds here are empty now not because the war is getting better, quite the opposite. This unit, the 93rd Mechanized Brigade, say it's because they're running low on infantry.",
