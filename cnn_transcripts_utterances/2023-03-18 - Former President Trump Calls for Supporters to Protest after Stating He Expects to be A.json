      "sentences": "Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we continue to follow major new developments involving former President Donald Trump. Trump now saying he expects to be arrested on Tuesday and is calling for protests. He made the announcement today in a social media post, lashing out at the Manhattan district attorney's office, which has invited him to testify before a grand jury. The arrest would be part of their investigation into alleged hush money payments to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election. And in the post, Trump called for protests over his possible arrest, to quote him now, \"take our nation back.\" This development comes as sources tell CNN that law enforcement agencies in New York are also now preparing for the possible indictment of Trump. CNN's Polo Sandoval is outside the Manhattan criminal courthouse, and CNN's senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz is with us from D.C. Katelyn, you first. What more are we learning about potential arrests according to the former president?",

Right now his spokesperson has been telling us today that there has been no indication formally from the district attorney's office of when and where he may be indicted and arrested.But he does have this expectation. That's because this investigation has been clearly in its endgame. In recent days he was invited to testify to the grand jury, as New York law would allow him to do if he wanted to. He declined to do that. That is a signal that it was nearing the end. We also do have reporting today at CNN that there is another witness expected to testify in this grand jury investigation on Monday. So, Fred, what's clear is that it's nearing the end, but the grand jury's work is not done. And we also do not know what the grand jury will be approving, when that would happen.

The concern is that given the former president's call for protests is that it may not stay that way if and when we do reach that point where charges would potentially be filed.And that is why, according to several sources speaking to our colleague John Miller, you do have local, state, federal law enforcement agencies that for the last several days that have been engaged in sort of these behind-the-scenes conversations about how they would handle the safety and security at some of these facilities here given what has been experienced in the past. So because of that, you do have the planning that's happening, and also addressing this sort of choreography that would be needed in terms of getting the former president potentially from Florida here to New York to officially face these charges when and if they are filed. And that comes with Secret Service agents, both in Florida, part of this detail, and here in New York, basically working and coordinating with the Manhattan district attorney to make sure that Donald Trump would be able to get in and out incident-free. But still a lot of uncertainty here, Fred, not only when and if we'll get to that point, but as we've learned in the past, authorities in New York are certainly not going to take any chances. And that's why they are, again, engaged in these ongoing discussions about Trump supporters potentially responding to Donald Trump's call for protests should he be charged.",

So one is, of course, the White House, but more specifically secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas ensuring that the pool of people that are part of this effort are ones that are reliable.We certainly have sufficient reporting to suggest that there were or are members of the Secret Service who essentially aren't working for the United States. They are working for Donald Trump. That I have no doubt is ongoing because of this reporting. The second piece, Fred, just to make up, part of it is going to be also the threat assessment. Donald Trump throws something into the air, he doesn't control law enforcement anymore. He hasn't really specifically said when and where, he just sort of has thrown out the take America back. So unlike January 6th, he's not driving people anywhere. His supporters now know he cannot give them a get out of jail free card. And of course, as John Miller has been reporting, law enforcement is ready. So this is not January 6th again. People have a right to protest, people have a right to be jerks on Twitter, people have a right to support the president. They don't have a right to take up arms. And I think Donald Trump may find himself very disappointed by the dog that didn't bark when this happens. You're just not seeing that kind of rally that we saw, certainly, January 6th.",

They will have -- if they haven't already, they will have significant security details, not just now for the day, but obviously when and if there's a trial in the weeks to come.Look, these public servants are essentially saying, I have no privacy anymore for what they are doing through the lawful law enforcement mechanism. And this is what Trump has been doing against judges, law enforcement, secretaries of state. And that's why when people are sort of defending Trump and saying he's just talking about protests, that's, like, you'd have to ignore six years of this man using language to incite his supporters. When he says take back America, when he talks about specific individuals, he knows how some of his followers will hear it. And that's what law enforcement has to be focused on. There's going to be a lot of noise, a lot of things on FOX TV. Those matter less than who are those individuals who would listen to Trump, and has the movement become so divided and so broken up by the arrest and the Department of Justice arrest and indictments that it is very hard for it to organize. I follow the movement. My answer is yes, and there will be individuals, but I am not worried about a January 6th again.",

These are serious charges, but he cannot be tried in absentia, meaning he has to show up to face those charges and then potentially go to trial.Of course, Fred, the Russian government would not hand him over, and he would be required to be handed over if he moved out of Russia to a country which is a signatory to that treaty that governs the court. There isn't a great track record in this. But why this is important is not just for symbolism.

You have a major crime wave in New York, especially in New York City. You have literally a Democratic Party that's literally dismantled the criminal justice system in that city, undercut the NYPD.

The firm says that while news of the rescue is positive, the bank has an uphill climb to retain profitability. Meantime, the uncertainty on Wall Street continues with markets ending the week down as investors fear the worst is not over. Let's dig deeper on what this means for the week ahead. I'm joined now by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody' Analytics. Mark, good to see you. So when we consider First Republic Bank, what happened? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  With First Republic, they got caught up in the bank failures, as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. And of course, anyone that has had anything to do with the tech sector or Silicon Valley Bank, it's being painted with a brush. There's a lot of concern about the viability of the bank, the financial health of the bank.

One week you're setting up a facility to provide liquidity to the banks to help the banks out, and then the next week you're going to raise interest rates which puts more pressure on the banks. This doesn't feel like it makes a whole lot of sense. And I do think when we get to the other side, restore confidence, make sure the system is working fine, then pivot back, take a look around, if inflation is still the problem we think it is, you can raise rates again at that point.

This is not a liberal place, it's not a leftwing town. This is a rightwing conservative town and hundreds of people went to the streets and demonstrated. So I think that every week you see that more and more people are joining the protests, and you see it in public opinion polls. You see that even inside Benjamin Netanyahu's party, big numbers I think just in the poll yesterday, you saw that something like 30 percent of Netanyahu's voters support President Herzog's compromise proposal, for example.

Fairleigh Dickinson, they shouldn't even have been in the tournament. They lost their conference title game to Merrimack. But Merrimack is still transitioning from division two so they weren't eligible to go to the tournament. So the Knights got in on a technicality, and they certainly made the most of it.",

It was pretty exciting. But those upsets, while thrilling, may be just the start for schools like Fairleigh Dickinson. The big dance offers a big stage for smaller universities, and that can have a dramatic financial impact. Our next guest knows all about that. Kurt Rotthoff is a professor of economics and finance at Seton Hall University. So good to see you, professor. So you wrote a paper about what you call the Cinderella Effect. Explain.",

And part of the problem with the Cinderella Effect is a lot of theseschools we've heard of. Pitt upset somebody, but we're not talking about Pitt, we're talking about FDU, a school that not very many people know about. And when you talk about these small, private schools, they get this advertisement that can't be bought and isn't available anywhere else. Because in March, we're all talking about basketball. And it has approximately a $10 million effect on a school like Fairleigh Dickinson when they can make a Cinderella run and win a few more games and get in the Sweet 16.",

This type of stuff is bringing schools into the spotlight, and it's been doing it for years. St. Peters had a big run last year.FDU had an amazing upset last and it was an amazing game to watch. And you look at those types of schools, and we always wondered what the impact was for those schools. But the big schools that we already know about, I don't expect much of an effect. But when we see these small schools that put your name in the front of everyone's mind around the time when students are starting to think about where they're going to school and where they're applying next year, it has a major effect on their budgets and their finances over the next few years.",
