      "sentences": "Will Joe Biden blink? That's tonight on NewsNight.Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Tonight, the riddle confounding the Democratic Party, just what exactly does Joe Biden plan to do? Drop out, or keep on running? New reporting captures the mood and the mindset of a defiant president, angry at donors who want to push him out the door, angry at senators and congressmen, angry at Nancy Pelosi, who, according to The New York Times, he views as an instigator, angry at former President Obama, who he sees as a puppet master, that also from The New York Times. Donors are tightening the screws. I'm told that Democratic donors are sending an unambiguous message that not a penny will flow to Biden or even to the candidates down ballot until things change at the top. But, look, calling these tea leaves are charitable to tea leaves. It's a riddle wrapped inside of an enigma projected on a Rubik's cube. Is all this public pressure even working or is the president just digging in? At least for now, he has dug in, and his campaign is now forced to fight back against doubts about the president's commitment to finishing this race. Here is campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEN O'MALLEY DILLON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF: Absolutely, the president's in this race. You've heard him say that time and time again. And I think we saw on display last night exactly why, because Donald Trump is not going to offer anything new to the American people. Joe Biden is more committed than ever to beat Donald Trump. And we believe on this campaign, we are built for the close election that we are in and we see the path forward. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: Now, after she made those comments, roughly 11 members of Congress came out of the shadows asking for Biden to step aside. All together, today, a dozen members have said they want him to go. Plenty to talk about tonight with my panel, Scott Jennings, Jamal Simmons, Karen Finney and Brian Stelter. So, Jamal, which Biden do you believe? The one who is privately saying that he's not going anywhere or the public pronouncements from all these other people that maybe he's thinking about it?",

But the Democratic Party needs to have this conversation, and I think we're going to be okay. The American people are used to watching reality T.V.

If he does that, it would most likely be before the Democratic National Convention begins on August 19th. And at that point, the process for replacing him on the ticket gets a little bit messy.The primaries and caucuses are over. The delegates have been selected and the Democratic Party cannot select new delegates. So, the convention could turn into a free for all. If Biden is out of the race when the convention starts, names of replacements will be put forward at the convention and the roughly 3900 Democratic delegates from across the country would decide who to vote for as the nominee. Biden won almost all of those 3900 delegates, but he would not have control over who they vote for to replace him. He can endorse a candidate but the delegates can vote for whoever they want. In the end, according to Democratic Party rules experts, about 2000 out of the 3900 delegates would have to vote for a nominee in a roll call vote for that person to win. But there are also additional so-called super delegates, about 700 of them who could also be allowed to join in the voting. They're comprised of party insiders and elected officials. So, Abby, there is a serious chance of some real party intrigue at the Democratic Convention if President Biden steps away before them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
