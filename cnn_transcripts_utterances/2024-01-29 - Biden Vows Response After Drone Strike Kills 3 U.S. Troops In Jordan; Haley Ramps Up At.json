U.S. Central Command says the strike may have originated from Syria, in addition to the three killed at least 34 other service members were wounded in the attack and eight of them had to be medically evacuated from the base to get more higher level treatment. The Islamic Resistance of Iraq a coalition of several Iran-backed militias has claimed responsibility for the strike. Iran has tried to distance itself from the attack, denying direct involvement. But again, these are Iran-backed militias we're talking about here. CNN's Oren Liebermann is at the Pentagon. Arlette Saenz is at the White House.Oren, let me start with you. John Kirby, he was just on this morning. And the way he put it is they're still kind of trying to work through attribution, which group specifically is responsible? What's the very latest that you're hearing?",

      "sentences": "Well, he did also say it looks like it was a group supported by Kata'ib Hezbollah. That's an Iran-backed group that has carried out multiple attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. We have seen to date since the beginning of the Gaza war about 160 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Many of those the U.S. pins on Kata'ib Hezbollah.But we've never seen an attack like this, a single one way attack drone at Tower 22 in the northeast corner of Jordan, essentially, where Jordan and Iraq meet Syria there, targeted near a living quarters at the facility that killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded approximately 34 other service members. As you pointed out, eight of those had to be medevac. It is very possible the number of injured soldiers goes up, because sometimes it takes a while for symptoms from traumatic brain injury to develop here. So the U.S. is very closely watching that. One of the key questions here, of course, not only certitude or certainty on what group was responsible, the U.S. looking for that. But also how is it that a single drone managed to evade U.S. air defenses at the facility. President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and others have vowed they would respond. Biden was briefed on several of those options yesterday from Austin, as well as the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. So we'll see which one of those he chooses. But clearly there is pressure on the White House. And the Defense Department to respond here is sending a message not only to these Iranian proxies there that operate and have targeted us groups or U.S. forces in the past year, but also to Iran itself, even as Iran denies responsibility. Here it is Iran that funds, arms, trains and supports these groups in the region.",

      "sentences": "Well, what we're hearing from Lebanese officials and Western diplomats is they are very concerned that this situation could very easily get out of control. They're worried that the United States might overreact. Certainly we've heard some of these calls from Republican members of Congress that they want the United States to hit Iran. The problem is, Iran is not. For instance, Iraq in 2003, there was already sort of crippled by sanctions. The Iranians have been very good at getting around sanctions and developing their military capacity.They have their pro-Iranian militias, in Syria, in Iraq, here in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen. And all of them, as we've been saying now for quite some time, have been keeping up this steady drumbeat of strikes on U.S. forces in Syria and Iraq. And of course, the Yemenis are targeting navigation in the Red Sea. Now, the United States has struck back multiple times against all of them. But the problem is that there is mounting pressure in the United States to go for Iran, which, of course, the Iranians are saying that they aren't giving orders to these various groups. And most observers in this part of the world believe that in generals, many of them act on their own following general guidelines provided by the Iranians. Now, this strike in Jordan, that is the first incident where U.S. military personnel are killed certainly raises the stakes, but diplomats we've spoken with here, believe that the real solution to this situation would be for the United States to rein in Israel, bring the war in Gaza to an end, which would dramatically lessen the tensions and certainly reduce the very real possibility of this low intensity regional war, going into something much, much more dangerous.
