The Southtowns got pummeled at yesterday and those conditions have just been rapidly shifting hour to hour.You mentioned Orchard Park, home of the Buffalo Bills. The stadium looks like a bowl of sugar, it is filled with snow. The game that was scheduled for tomorrow has been moved to Detroit and officials here asking residents to take this very seriously. This is a very dangerous storm. It is extremely cold out and this is that kind of heavy, wet packed in snow as you mentioned. Two people sadly passing away as a result of the storm and officials asking residents here to stay off the road overnight. Several people had to be rescued here in Erie County, which has instituted travel bans and are asking people to just stay at home for as long as possible while the storm passes so that those cleanup crews can get out there and start clearing the roads.

But with Black Friday coming up the areas around Buffalo they've had to find alternate places to put a lot of that snow because they don't want to block people from being able to get to the shopping plazas later this week.So having to kind of be creative, because we're not just talking a few inches here, you're talking feet of snow. And yes, there's even more on top of it. Look at all of these areas that are still expecting snow. It's not just New York, it's also areas of Ohio, Pennsylvania, even Michigan, also looking at additional snow, some of those heavy bands still just to the north of Buffalo right now. So they're getting a little bit of a break. But we expect that snow to shift back into Buffalo again by tonight. Here's what it looks like. Again, this is the city of Buffalo right here in the foreground. This is that wall of snow coming in. So again, right where the camera is, it's not snowing, but maybe about a mile or two away. It's just coming down in blankets at that point. Buffalo itself picking up just about 14 inches of snow that set a daily record for yesterday. But here's the thing, this was that line. And you can see again, just how little it moves. But that little movement makes a huge difference in terms of totals, 14 inches in Buffalo to over 60 inches for places like Hamburg, Blasdell, and Orchard Park, which already is just sitting at about 66 inches of snow. Now for those of you who aren't familiar with where those are and about here's those bull's eyes. OK, basically stretching from Buffalo down to Erie, and then the area around Watertown, that's where we had our highest focus points of that snow. But we also have more snow expected for areas of Wisconsin, Michigan, again, across portions of upstate New York as well.

Most recently, he worked at the International Criminal Court at The Hague, where he investigated and prosecuted war crimes. CNN's Evan Perez has more. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Amara and Martin, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed war crimes prosecutor Jack Smith to serve as special counsel to oversee two criminal investigations related to Donald Trump. The decision was triggered in part by the former president's decision in recent days to declare a third run for as a presidential candidate. Smith most recently worked as a prosecutor in The Hague, overseeing Kosovo war crimes. He'll take over investigation stemming from the alleged mishandling of classified documents which the FBI retrieved in a search from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, as well as portions of the January 6 investigation dealing with Trump's efforts to impede the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Garland said that the important appointment was intended to show that the investigations will be done with independence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he is a candidate for president in the next election, and the sitting President stated intention to be a candidate as well. I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel.

Appreciate your reporting, Nic Robertson, thank you very much for that.All right, joining me now to discuss all of this is CNN military analyst, retired Major General \"Spider\" Marks. Good to see you again this morning, sir. So, first off, just give us the big picture here in terms of the state of this conflict especially in light of just, you know, days ago, Ukrainians did declare victory when they were able to retake Kherson.

Look, warfare is a human endeavor that affects all aspects of society, and he described that so incredibly well. And so, this is the brutality. This is the nature of warfare.So back to your question, look, the Ukrainians are doing magnificently at a tactical level. Their engagements with the Russians have really demonstrated their creativity, their ability to adapt, their ability to really out-think the Russians. The Russians are very stodgy, very hierarchical, and they have really one thing that they do well, and that is launch artillery. The Ukrainians are doing magnificently, and they -- and Russians departed Kherson. It was a foolish move on their part to take Kherson because they were isolated on the other side of the Dnipro River. And you can't supply it, you can reinforce it across, you can't conduct operations from there, and they realized that they were at great risk. So they came back across the river. That doesn't mean that Kherson is back entirely in Ukrainian hands. I could see where that would be contested again going forward. So the nature of this fight is just moving forward, and the biggest conditions right now that the Ukrainians have to deal with, and as described by Nic is certainly the weather. But also, the victories that they are achieving right now are setting the conditions for what might be a negotiated settlement, not a fully negotiated settlement, but at least maybe a ceasefire in the near term that then gets an opportunity to grow and establish itself so that there might be -- might be a little bit of trust. There would have to be a third party involved obviously to monitor that, but there might be some trust between warring partners or at least, they can cut down on the killing. That's the main effort right now, and Ukraine is in a good position to move forward with the discussions like that.",

Look, Ukraine still remains an independent and sovereign nation, and they stared down this threat from Russia which nobody thought was possible except those who understood the Ukrainians. That this in fact, was a possible outcome. But they are not -- I don't think they have the momentum to push the Russians back across the border established before 2014. And if you look at the geography of Crimea without getting into all the military tactics, that's a tough target. There are only a couple of passageways down, it would be very difficult to try to conduct an assault operation, whether it's by sea, by air, by using the passage ways down there. You take that, how do you isolate that? How do you reduce that? How do you get the Russians to depart? That becomes a very tough nut to crack. You can do it, of course, you can do it.
