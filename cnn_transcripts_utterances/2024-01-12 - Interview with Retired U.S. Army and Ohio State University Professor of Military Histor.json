I asked retired Colonel Peter Mansoor. And Israel defends itself against genocide at the U.N.'s highest court. Political scientist Dahlia Scheindlin joins me for more. Then, on the brink of famine, World Food Programme's Cindy McCain tells Walter Isaacson Gaza is starving. Also, journalists in the crosshairs. We revisit Christiane's conversation with reporter Lindsey Hilsum and actress Rosamund Pike, who portrayed the late legendary war correspondent Marie Colvin the film \"A Private War.\" Plus, a birthday celebration for one of the world's top composers. Sir Karl Jenkins joins the show from Carnegie Hall. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Dramatic moves in the dark of the night as the U.S. and U.K. struck Houthi targets in Yemen. Washington warned that this could be coming after the Iranian-backed Houthis continue to attack commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The Houthis, who run most of Western Yemen, including the coastline, say they're doing it in support of the Palestinians. But the Americans say the Houthis are targeting ships indiscriminately and disrupting a vital waterway for the global economy. Massive protests broke out in Yemen's capital of Sana'a, and the Houthi leaders say that the strikes, \"will not go unanswered.\" It is a complicated geopolitical web, and the risk of a wider war keeps rising. Retired Colonel Peter Mansoor is a professor of military history at Ohio State University, and he joins me from Columbus. Thank you so much for joining the program. So, as noted, these strikes were to be anticipated by the Houthis, and together with the U.K. and others in the alliance, more than 60 targets were hit overnight, spread over 16 locations. This includes Houthi air bases, munitions depots, launching sites, radar helping guide some of these missiles. In totality, and what we now know following these attacks, how effective do you think they have been in preventing further types of attacks by the Houthis? COL. PETER MANSOOR, U.S. ARMY (RET.) AND PROFESSOR OF MILITARY HISTORY, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY:  Well, the attacks won't prevent further attacks. In fact, it's a certainty that the Houthis will respond having been attacked on their soil. But the purpose of these attacks is to degrade their capabilities, reduce the number of missiles at their disposal, reduce their ability to target vessels transiting the Bab al-Mandeb Strait. And so, we'll see how effective these attacks will have been. But my guess is that they will be -- need to be repeated in the future to really put a dent in the Houthi capabilities.",

It's attackedU.S. forces in Iraq using Iraqi militia groups. Hezbollah is attacking Northern Israel with rockets. Of course, Hamas is tied up with a major conflict in Gaza. And now, the Houthis trying to interdict international shipping in the Red Sea, very indiscriminate, though. These ships aren't headed to Israel. They're not owned by Israel. All they are trying to do is interrupt world commerce in order to gain attention on the conflict, and they've done that pretty well.",

And since the Houthis started attacking these ships, nearly 15 percent of global sea trade passes through the Red Sea. So, it's understandable why this viewed through the lens of the global economy and not just a regional problem. Can you talk about why the Houthis have grown from such a nuisance in the region? Because there's a history there, a multi-year war with the Saudis, a much richer country, a larger country with a larger military that had to settle really on a truce after years of war with the Houthis, a militia of just roughly about 100,000 soldiers. Why are they as strong as they are?",

These are not produced in Yemen. They come in from outside the country. And they're purchased and provided by Iran. So, this is Iran attempting to spread its tentacles around the Middle East and make the Middle East Iranian territory in essence. And by forcing international shipping away from the Red Sea, they have put the world on notice that they are the great power in the region.

In the coming days and weeks, the ICJ's panel of judges will decide whether to grant South Africa's request to order a halt to the Gaza offensive. A final ruling from the court on whether it believes Israel has committed genocide could take years. Here now to discuss this and much more is political scientist Dahlia Scheindlin. Dahlia, welcome to the program from Tel Aviv. It's really great to have you on. So, yesterday we heard South Africa's arguments accusing Israel of genocide, committing genocide against the Palestinians or at least the presumption about the plausibility of genocide, which is a lower standard that would have to be met by the court. Today, we heard the Israeli defense from multiple attorneys there and advocates defending Israel. I'm curious to get your take on what stood out to you from what you heard and how effective their arguments were. DAHLIA SCHEINDLIN, ISRAELI POLITICAL ANALYST AND AUTHOR, \"THE CROOKED TIMBER OF DEMOCRACY IN ISRAEL\":  Yes, I think the most important argument that Israel was trying to make, both in court and in its public diplomacy, is sort of messaging within the public environment, was all about context, a word that has been sort of fallen into a controversial situation after October 7th. But what they're trying to say is that the context for this war was October 7th. And I think, to me, the interesting argument was that Israelis believe that this entire accusation of genocide is completely unfounded because Israel was responding to what it considers to be a genocidal attack, certainly an attack on its civilians on sovereign territory. But that's not a strong legal argument because even the worst attack, as the South African team said yesterday, doesn't justify breaches of the Genocide Convention. However, I think, to me, the interesting distinction Israel tried to make today was that this an ongoing threat, and that in its perspective, from Israel's perspective, the war is facing the ongoing threat of Hamas, which continues to pose a threat to Israel's people, its sovereign territory, rocket fire, and of course the hostages. So, to my mind, that was one of the strongest arguments. I think there are other arguments that weren't quite as strong, which is essentially Israel's broader argument that is either an anti-Israel plot, absurd, politicized, antisemitic, and that is something that we heard in, you know, pretty much every forum outside the court. And I think that it's unfortunate in a way. The other problem, I think, is that Israel's trying to make the case that South Africa's argument that senior Israeli officials who have made statements that can be interpreted with genocidal intent are not meaningful because they're not coming from the most senior officials. But of course, South Africa's team preempted some of those arguments by citing statements from the prime minister, from the president, from the defense minister at the highest levels. And so, I think there is still a tough case to make, but still most Israelis think that these charges are frankly spurious. I have to say that it's not making much of an impression on Israeli society. They are simply viewing this as an anti-Israel kind of unique singling out of Israel for actions that they believe any other country would have undertaken under the circumstances.",

And just a fewhours ago we heard from Germany saying that they do not support these accusations by South Africa as well. But it's worth noting that no matter where on the political spectrum Israelis lie, I'm not speaking for every Israeli, but it does seem that a large portion of the country was not only glued to these hearings, but also took the view that you just described, the sort of shocked response as to how Israel of all countries could be accused of genocide not only because Israel was attacked itself in a terror attack on October 7th, but obviously its own history. You wrote a piece this week say called \"Israelis Can't Understand How They Could Be Accused of Genocide.\" And here's what you wrote, as a decades old student of conflict, the creativity of human savagery never ceases to amaze me, but it's time to accept that we've simply joined the grim list of people embroiled in mass atrocities with perpetrators and victims on this side or the other, wildly mixed.

Theyhave had a fairly easy time rallying large swaths of the Israeli population to make the case that the government was not prioritizing it sufficiently. Many people feel that the government probably wouldn't have reached that original ceasefire that saw the release of over a hundred hostages if there hadn't been so much pressure from the families. And I think that the government has tried to make the case that it prioritizes both equally, but it seems like the government is not really rushing to reach yet another ceasefire agreement that could see the release of further hostages. And -- but that brings me back to the point that I made earlier, which I think is really strongly conveyed by the situation, which is ongoing. In other words, there are egregious violations of international law, human decency, of course. These are atrocities, holding these hostages, violates, you know, all of those things. And so, Israelis, again, it makes it harder for them to see both sides of this. It makes it hard for Palestinians to see both sides of this. The fact is there are ongoing violations, crimes, and, you know, damage -- the damage to civilians is endless. This happening on both sides and both sides have to take responsibility for it.",

Beginning at New York's Carnegie Hall. Where else? And he joins me live from there now. Sir Karl Jenkins, thank you so much for joining us. It is quite an honor to have you on the program.

I've just written a piece called \"One World,\" which talks about the planet, how we got here, and deals with issues like slavery, mendacious politicians, of which there are quite a few, in the U.K. and in the USA. So, it's all -- it's quite depressing, really. But it's what I do. It's my -- well, not livelihood, it's more than that. It's like a drug. I'm addicted to writing music. So, that's what I do. So --",
