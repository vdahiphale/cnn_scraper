      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.Ferragamo, an adult website and Botox? A scathing new report says that George Santos misspent thousands of his donors' dollars. And tonight, the calls are growing, for him to be expelled, from Congress. Plus, the Israeli military says it has recovered the body of a hostage, near the Al-Shifa Hospital, also releasing new video that it says shows a tunnel shaft, inside Gaza's largest medical center. We'll go one-on-one with a top U.S. official, in moments. And why has Osama bin Laden's two-decade-old manifesto, justifying 9/11, gone viral on TikTok? And more importantly, why are some young Americans sympathizing with it? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Indicted congressman, George Santos, now says he won't be running for reelection, next year. But reelection may have been the least of his troubles. Tonight, he could be facing even more legal jeopardy. The House Ethics Committee has just referred its new findings, on Santos, to the Justice Department. The report finds quote, \"Substantial evidence\" of additional uncharged, unlawful conduct, by the New York Republican. The Committee suggests that more crimes were committed than the 23 that Santos was already charged with. I should note, he has pleaded not guilty to those. The report finds that Santos quote, \"Blatantly stole\" from his campaign, and those funds, to pay for his own personal expenses. Here's what that report says that he bought. Nearly $3,000 worth of Botox, purchases at Hermes and Ferragamo, Sephora, taxi and hotel charges, in Las Vegas, during the time, when the Congressman told his staff, he was on his honeymoon. And also, quote, \"Smaller purchases\" from the website, OnlyFans. If you're watching and you don't know what that is, don't Google it on your work computer. Just trust me. Santos called the report, \"Biased,\" and a quote, \"Disgusting politicized smear.\" The Ethics Committee, I should know, did not subpoena him, as part of this investigation. But the reason they gave was partly because he is a serial liar. And they said his testimony would have had low evidentiary value. Santos did admit to CNN, earlier this month that he had made some errors, on his financial filings. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GEORGE SANTOS (R-NY): Were there mistakes made on those forms? Now I know they were. Was I -- were they malicious? No. Did I understand the reporting date? So, this is from last year to current date this year? No, I didn't -- I didn't understand how that worked. And I'm a new candidate, and I'm sorry that like mistakes were made. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A number of House Republicans have indicated they will vote to expel Santos, when that vote comes up again, having previously not supported it enough, to at least remove him, from Congress. But many were waiting, for this report, from the Ethics Committee. So far, at least 10 Republicans, who voted against it, last time, now say they would vote for it. I'm joined now by Santos' fellow New York Republican congressman, Mike Lawler. Congressman, what do you think? Do you think George Santos is ultimately kicked out of Congress? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Oh, no question. He is a serial liar, who, with the report, now out, is proven to be a serial liar. And, everything that I, and many of my colleagues, from New York, have said, for months, has borne out. And I think it is time, long past time, for George Santos to go. If he had any dignity or decency, he would have resigned, yesterday. But obviously, we'll see, between now and the time we get back, whether or not he pleads guilty, or resigns, or both. And whether or not we obviously have to come back and expel him. I bet the votes are there, when we get back.",

This is a big area, a big complex. I should note, CNN cannot verify the IDF's findings. We've been unable to get a comment, from hospital authorities, since this video was released. Doctors and health officials in the Hamas-run enclave have denied these accusations, from Israel. The IDF also says that their troops found large stashes of weapons and ammunition. They also announced that they have recovered the body of an Israeli hostage, near the hospital. Israel says that Hamas killed Yehudit Weiss, a 65-year-old grandmother. It's not clear how she died, tonight, though. We do know she was kidnapped from kibbutz Be'eri, on October 7th. Her husband was also killed in that attack. Also, Israel is now pointing to these new details, as it's facing growing pressure, to provide evidence, of Hamas' command center, at that hospital. The United States says it does have intelligence, to back up that claim. And for more on that, I am joined now by John Kirby, the White House National Security Council Spokesman.

And so, it's a tough dilemma, for the Israeli forces. One hand, you want to be able to eliminate a very viable, very critical threat to your own country. On the other hand, you've got this added burden of protecting people. And as we've said, we don't want to see hospitals, as firefight locations. We don't want to see them as battlegrounds. It is a violation of the law of war that Hamas would headquarter itself, inside a hospital.

And we've been very clear about condemning that kind of activity.The President understands, Kaitlan, that there's strong feelings here, on all sides, with respect to what's going on between Israel and Hamas. But he also believes, and continues to believe, that now is not the time for a ceasefire. A ceasefire would simply validate what Hamas did, on October 7th. And it would give them breathing space and time. What we do support, and what we have talked to our Israeli counterparts, about, are a series of humanitarian pauses. And you've seen yourself, and reported on that fact that they have now put in place, regularized humanitarian pauses. They originally announced them for four hours. But in recent days, they've actually expanded them, sometimes by two or three hours, to allow civilians to get out of North Gaza, through safe corridors. And many people of Gaza are taking them up on that.

Yes, you heard me right, sympathy.This is a letter that was published a year after the September 11th attacks, by the terrorist, who orchestrated it. And it went viral on TikTak with -- TikTok, with users embracing parts of his message. That message from bin Laden, a broad critique of American foreign policy, defending 9/11, attempting to justify targeting and killing U.S. citizens, it's also filled with anti-Semitic tropes and conspiracies. The premise for the most part of these videos is criticism, of American support for Israel, in this ongoing war with Hamas. TikTok says that the videos promoting that letter violate their platform's rules, against supporting any form of terrorism. Many of the posts have now been removed. We also even heard the White House weighing in on this, today, telling CNN that the videos are an insult to the victims of the terror attacks. Joining me now is the last Western journalist, to actually interview Osama bin Laden, CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller. John, my question here is how it is the -- how's the intelligence community treating something like this? Are they trying to figure out, if these are bots, if this is a foreign government, if this is real? I mean, how did they look at the popularity of these videos?",
