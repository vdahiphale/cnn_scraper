Similar fears of sending tanks were debated for weeks, but on Wednesday, the U.S. President announced the deployment of 31 M-1 Abram tanks, the equivalent of Ukrainian battalion. While acknowledging they were unlikely to arrive before the long awaited Russian Spring offensive. Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Germany will send 14 Leopard II tanks, which could be ready in three to four months, with more to come. And NATO Secretary General says while the tanks will strengthen Ukraine's combat capability, much more assistance is still needed. (BEGIN VIDEO LCIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATIO SECRETARY GENERAL: We need to provide even more support. Not only to ensure that Ukraine survives, but actually ensure that Ukraine is able to liberate more territory, win, and prevail as a sovereign, independent nation in Ukraine.
