A special episode of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS comes to you tonight from the French capital. Tonight, we're talking and bringing to you gang violence explodes in Port- au-Prince. CNN's David Culver gets a firsthand look at the chaos gripping the nation. The IOC is meeting tomorrow, the International Olympic Committee amid debate over how many Russians will be allowed to compete. The final countdown to the Paris Games. The Paris Olympics chief is with me next and shortly on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And inside Notre Dame's reconstruction after the fire. It's actually Paris' most popular tourist site. It is closer to the very reopening, and as you can see from these pictures, I've been to the roof. We are live tonight in Paris, the Eiffel Tower sparkling magnificently as it does at the top of the hour. It is Monday, it is March the 18th. It is wonderful to be here. I'm Richard Quest and in the City of Lights, I certainly mean business. And a very good evening to you from the French capital. We start our coverage tonight in Haiti, where CNN is most firmly on the ground and reporting live from there. From Port-au-Prince, where the gang warfare just seems to never end, get stronger, and has no seeming direction. So far 10 bodies have been found today. It's perhaps an understatement to say chaos is everywhere. Anarchy, more likely. Food shortages as a result - - everything -- businesses and schools are closed. You'll recall that the prime minister, Ariel Henry resigned last week, that did not bring any peace to the proceedings. CNN's David Culver has been -- well, is in Port-au-Prince at the moment and he has walked through a police station, one of those police stations that's doing everything possible to repel the gangs.

They've built barricades all around here.

And that's what's most terrifying here is when they're coordinating with each other. But that's why the community has looked at this and said, okay, if we don't have this international force, if we don't have our own police, just hearing a few gunshots there, that was just off the distance here -- if we don't have our own police who are able to repel with a sizable amount of resources, then we've got to step in. And that's exactly what they've done. They've had to basically be self- sustaining, and it's total lawlessness across this city and yet, you have pockets that have been able to maintain some sense of security and stability. If you ask people what they want, and how this is going to be solved and stabilized, they don't necessarily want to say on camera that it's going to take foreign intervention. That is a very fraught subject here within Haiti and in Port-au-Prince in particular, but they do realize there needs to be some sort of international approach here.

It is just more than four months to go before the Olympics take place. The final throes of preparation, where they have been rethinking pretty much how to do the games, working on getting the Seine swim-worthy, a project that's caused the best part of a billion.

Now, YouTube said that it is investing in resources to better detect when creators aren't adding these required labels, but it will be sort of like the proof is in the pudding here as this starts to roll out this requirement starting today. Now creators won't be required to label videos that are generated with AI, but are obviously not realistic looking, so if I use AI to generate a video of myself walking on the moon, and it looks like an animation, I won't have to add the label. This label is really just for videos that look realistic and could potentially be misleading to the viewers who watch them. On the viewer end, users will now see an AI-generated label, usually in the description of the video. Although for potentially sensitive topics like politics, they'll see a more prominent label on the actual video player itself. So an effort by YouTube certainly to increase transparency around AI generated content and avoid misleading users, but we'll have to really see how the company does in terms of detecting when creators aren't adding that required disclosure.",

The West, of course is calling the whole election a sham. 87 percent of the population or 87 percent of the electorate voted for President Putin. And there was no genuine opposition, so says the critics. As for President Putin himself, he appeared at a red square rally where he was marking the 10th anniversary of the annexation of Crimea. Life Inside Crimea has changed greatly over the last 10 years. CNN's Clare Sebastian reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Ten years ago the woman in blue dreams of being a teacher, life under Russian occupation brought Lutfiye Zudiyeva a new calling. Journalist and Human Rights activist. LUTFIYE ZUDIYEVA, JOURNALIST AND HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST (through translator): This was the first time I was searched. But I had been preparing for this for many years. I was expecting them. SEBASTIAN (on camera): You're not afraid you have a family, children. ZUDIYEVA (through translator): I hope that my work will lead to the end of repression in Crimea. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): This was Zudiyeva's third arrest in four years. This time for several social media posts. Scenes like this are increasingly common, especially in Crimea and Tatar communities. Forcibly deported by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in 1944. And only allowed back in the early 1990s. 2014 brought another decade of persecution to anyone opposing Russia's rule. President say the full-scale invasion intensified crackdown. ZUDIYEVA (through translator): In the current situation, even those who before this were protected from prosecution are at risk. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): On March 5th, 10 Crimean and Tatar men were arrested in mass pre-dawn raids. ZUDIYEVA (through translator): They came through this way. The FSB or riot police officers says the wife of one visibly out of breath. A few hours later, she gave birth to her sixth child. KRZYSZTOF JANOWSKI, SPOKESPERSON, U.N. MONITORING MISSION TO UKRAINE: Well, we have seen a systematic effort essentially to raise Ukrainian identity, forcing people to take Russian passports, drafting Crimea men for Russian military.
