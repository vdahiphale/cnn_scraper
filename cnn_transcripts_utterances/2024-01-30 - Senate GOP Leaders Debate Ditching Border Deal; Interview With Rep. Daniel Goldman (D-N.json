We're keeping them honest.   Also, there is breaking news, the former president's $50 million legal bill last year, you may be surprised to learn who is actually picking up that tab.

Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with the breaking news and the most important issue to voters right now according to recent polling, and even more so tonight, the ones with perhaps the widest gap between what certain elected officials are saying about it, and what they're actually doing. The issue is immigration and border security and we have just learned that Senate Republican leaders are tonight debating whether to shelve the proposed bipartisan legislation to actually address the problem, a deal now in the ropes, which is said to be the most restrictive set of border measures in decades, in which was already being repeated at the former president's behest by House and Senate Republicans, including the very same one saying things like this.

Now, no decisions have been made. Negotiators are still planning to release bill text sometime this week, but the challenges for this compromise and getting signed into law are enormous. They might be insurmountable, in fact.   House Speaker Mike Johnson made crystal clear today in both a private meeting with his members and also in a subsequent press conference that this deal has no pathway in the House. And now you have some Republicans who are openly saying that legislation isn't even needed because President Biden already has the authority to crack down on the southern border, despite the fact that it is Republicans who are the ones indeed pushing for policy changes in exchange for Ukraine aid. In fact, Congressman Troy Nehls, he is a Texas Republican who is very close to Donald Trump told me that Congress doesn't need to \"do a damn thing\" to address the border.

But Democrats say Republicans are just trying to score political points and that if they really wanted to solve the crisis at the southern border, they could approve that emerging Senate border deal which Republicans have made clear they will reject whenever it comes over from the Senate.So this meeting has grown quite contentious. Democrats have forced a number of procedural motions hoping to derail or delay this meeting as long as possible. But we are expecting those articles to pass out of committee sometime late tonight.

The executive branch, Secretary Mayorkas, President Biden only have so many authorities and so much funding to secure our border and we are facing unprecedented migration patterns. So they need more authority, they need more funding in order to address the asylum backlog, in order to secure a border, in order to address the fentanyl trade in order to interdict with the Mexican drug cartels, in order to do their job and that funding can only come from Congress. So it is false to say that President Biden has the necessary authority to secure the border or to address this the situation at the border.

Here's a part of that statement. It said, \"We are announcing the suspension of military and security operations against the occupation forces, that's U.S. troops, in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government.\" Now the statement goes on to say that the group will take some acts of self-defense against any American hostilities. And when the Pentagon was asked about this, a spokesperson basically said actions speak louder than words. That the U.S., of course, has been demanding that these attacks stop for a number of months now. So they need to see exactly if those attacks will stop. And that until then, the U.S. will continue to proceed and prepare to respond in a time and a manner of the U.S.'s choosing. Anderson?",

There's more than 1,000 electrodes that are connected to those threads.So think of it like this. You are not moving, but you think move a cursor to the right or move a mouse pad to the right. When you do that, your brain gives off a specific burst of electrical energy. And after a while, this device that you're looking at can read that and say, oh, the brain is saying move that cursor to the right and it starts to -- it develops a dictionary, essentially, of movement. It can then take that electrical signal and translate it to a mouse, for example, or to a smartphone. This is the first time for Neuralink, not the first for other companies.
