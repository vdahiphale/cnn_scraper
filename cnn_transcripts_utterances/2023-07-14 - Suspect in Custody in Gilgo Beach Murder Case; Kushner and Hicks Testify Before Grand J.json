CNN's Katelyn Polantz is covering both special investigations for us right now. She's joining us.

So really recently. And that some of the focus of what these two witnesses and others that were close to Trump in the White House have been asked about is that how - they're - they've been asked about how much Trump was aware he lost the election and how people were telling him one-on-one this - there's no election fraud. You have lost the election. And having some sort of understanding that Trump knew he lost, that he didn't win, even though he was publicly saying he won the election. And so that in and of itself is pretty significant.It's also very significant just that Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks are going into the grand jury. We have seen so many different aspects of this investigation, Kate. We've seen the fake electors. We've heard about interviews with officials in battleground states who ran elections. We've heard about Mike Pence and his top advisers going into the grand jury. The top White House council people. And now coming into that real inner circle of Donald Trump. The grand jury is hearing from them. We know Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, has always been close to the former president in his time in the White House. Also was working with the campaign. And Hope Hicks was one of the long-time top advisers who notably really deeply disagreed with what Donald Trump was doing after the election. Was quite vocal about it and really was unhappy with what happened on January 6th as well.",

Walt Nauta's defense team. Donald Trump's team. They have a lot of the information that is not classified, that would be evidence in this case that they are allowed to be getting. The Justice Department just confirmed that in a filing last night. And now they're going to be able to start seeing the classified information in this case because the lawyers for both Trump and Walt Nauta have confirmed to the court that they've taken the steps needed to be taken in order for them to get security clearances to have access to some of the classified materials here. So that part's going to be moving forward.And then, Kate, we've got a hearing on Tuesday, the first appearance before Federal Judge Ailene Cannon. That trial date, there's been a lot of back and forth. The Justice Department really wants it to be early. Trump's team doesn't even want a date to be set. And so they have made their arguments to the judge. We're going to be watching and seeing if she says this is when the date will be when Donald Trump goes to trial or if she'll pick it down the road a bit more.",
