At least five people killed, and thousands of homes and businesses destroyed as five major wildfires rage in Los Angeles County. The death toll is expected to rise. The newest fire is the Sunset Fire in the Hollywood Hills triggering new evacuation orders. The most destructive fire in Los Angeles history, the Palisades Fire is still scorching the seaside area between Malibu and Santa Monica. It has exploded to more than 16,000 acres with zero containment, destroying at least 1,000 structures. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, (D) CALIFORNIA:  I really am long-term optimistic but the devastation -- to hear people wailing and crying, concerned about their pet and their family -- they're just bewildered about what's just -- what they're experiencing. And again, not just experienced. I'm just not talking past tense. This is happening in real time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well Kasie, this morning I was encouraged to see this -- video of helicopters flying in the sky using their water techniques to help douse the fires on the ridges with the ongoing big -- large wildfires that are still out of control across Los Angeles. Remember, that's the major difference between this time yesterday and what's happening right now. So the winds have relaxed enough for that firefighting aircraft to actually fly because yesterday they were restricted because the winds were too erratic, too strong, and too intense for those aircraft -- fixed-rotor aircraft and helicopters to come in and help with the containment efforts. So that was encouraging for me.But what does the future hold? What does the next several hours hold? Well, that's so important because we still have our five large, active fires across Los Angeles County, most of them at zero percent containment. You would know about the Palisades, Sunset, and Eaton fire. The Lidia Fire at 40 percent containment. The Hurst Fire at 10 percent. So making some ground there just north of the San Fernando Valley. That's good news. But the winds unfortunately are going to pick up through the course of the day, so we have another stretch of strong winds not as powerful as yesterday. However, this will fan additional flames and it will continue to blow embers around. That's the concern. North to northeasterly winds -- that means it blows off shore. Still, our typical Santa Ana wind-prone areas. And then we look towards Friday for real considering -- real relaxation in the winds. So that's when we anticipate the winds to really start to participate in this effort. Now, the winds have knocked down power for so many people, not to mention the amount of people who have lost electricity because of the ongoing fires. Red flag warnings. No longer a particularly dangerous situation. But another factor to add on to this is the quality of the air from all of the fires that have been burning. The smoke that has just engulfed Los Angeles is thick, it is palpable, and it is dangerous. So people here are breathing in what I like to consider is toxic smoke, especially if you're in the thick of it. So wearing those masks are so incredibly important if you're in Los Angeles County.",

Obviously, those firefighters that have been out there -- some of them are looking at having been out 24-36 going on 48 hours.What does it look like if you are a firefighter?

People are extremely strapped for resources right now, so it partially depends on where they are.If they're out in the -- there's three zones that you normally talk about. You have the urban zone, you have the wildland urban interface, and then you have the wildlands, and each on its own will look quite a bit different. But I think just expanding on this point it's important to broaden out to the bigger context as well and not just think of these as natural disasters but think of these are results of some of our political choices to continue burning fossil fuels and to continue driving climate change, which is putting firefighters in these situations to where they're working all-night shifts or working for nights on end without getting any rest, or working all year round fighting fires instead of having the opportunity to recover.",

And what's really important is that you can't just blame California for this land management because over half of California's land is under federal jurisdiction. So if we want to be managing these lands correctly in ways that don't have these wildfires happening we need federal investment into the public agencies that are managing these lands in California, like the Forest Service. While right now a lot of rhetoric is the opposite where there's a lot of rhetoric about slashing public agencies. If we want to take responsibility for these wildfires we need to take responsibility for our public lands as well, which is over half of California's land.",

Across the country Republicans are falling in line. The Georgia GOP voting to oust a Trump critic who was once one of its leaders. In a unanimously passed resolution this week the state party expelled their own former lieutenant governor Geoff Duncan, arguing he undermined Republican candidates and used his affiliation with the party for personal gain. The resolution also bans Duncan from running in any future races as a Republican. Duncan, who has criticized Trump for his efforts to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results, endorsed Harris in the 2024 race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEOFF DUNCAN, (R) FORMER GEORGIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  If Republicans are being intellectually honest with ourselves our party is not civil or conservative; it's chaotic and crazy.

If he shows up and wants to be a serious leader that takes on some serious challenges and tackles them with a level head, I think there's an opportunity for the Republican Party to kind of heal up and get back on its tracks. But if he continues to be a petulant child and only look to satisfy grievances that him and his family have, then this is going to be a train wreck for four years. But I think the second part to that answer is that both parties have a leadership problem, right? Republicans have the wrong leader at the head of their party and Democrats have no leader at the head of their party. And so there's this vacuum of genuine leadership. And this has -- this has been something I've been saying for a long time now. I even wrote a book about it that this vacuum of leadership is just leaving Americans to just, you know, be -- you know, one issue at a time just blowing in the wind. And we, the people, have got to be more -- you know, more strict with our requirements for who leads us as to giving us exact reasons why we go down these paths. I mean, looking for press conferences to talk about taking over Greenland and trying to merge -- you know, annex Canada, and rename the Gulf -- I mean, these are unserious ideas that don't take us across this -- these serious policy gaps that we have coming across our plate.",

It's his only print interview.Now, he did tell Susan Page when -- she asked him directly, \"Do you believe that you could have won in November?\" And he says, \"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes, based on the polling...\" And then she jumps in and she says -- and it's this part that really stood out to me. She said, \"Do you think you'd have the vigor to serve another four years in office?\" And Biden responds, \"I don't know. Who the hell knows? So far, so good. But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\" It strikes me, and I'm curious what you think about that admission considering that he did -- when everyone knew that Donald Trump might be returning as the nominee of the Republican Party and Democrats were casting that as an essentially apocalyptic outcome considering what happened on January 6 -- what they call threats to democracy -- that he went ahead and ran for re-election anyway.",

And the honest balls and strikes call there with Joe Biden is no, he would not have won. I think Kamala Harris was an electoral improvement and gave the Democrats a better chance to beat Donald Trump, but unfortunately, obviously it came up short.And with regards to his age, I had a conversation with him a few weeks before that debate -- the CNN debate -- and he was very cognitively aware and very charismatic. But obviously when we watched the debate play out, he -- there was a demise that we weren't aware of. And look, the truth of the matter is I don't believe he was prepared -- physically prepared to be able to lead this country for four more years. It's unfortunate because if you're now looking back retrospectively I think the campaign for a Democrat to win the White House was lost within hours of him being sworn in in 2021 when he walked back from the Capitol -- or drove back from the Capitol to the White House and signed a stack of executive orders unwinding the border policy, and then waited three-plus years to actually say that was a mistake. That was huge. That gave a huge marketing opportunity or campaign opportunity to Donald Trump, but also was real. The void at the border was real and felt by Americans in all -- pretty much all 50 states.",
