And clearly, if they've never seen it, it likely doesn't exist.What's so great about Zach's reporting is it really undercuts so many of the public explanations and public defenses that the Trump team has put forth, right. They've tried to draw this false equivalency between the Trump documents investigation and the one into President Biden and the one that has since been closed into Vice President Pence. Now, we know from our reporting, even though Biden and Trump are both facing a special counsel investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents, these are very different in terms of volume, right? Dozens of documents versus over 100. Also, the conduct, right, cooperation, possible obstruction. But here we know the types of questions prosecutors are asking. They're just asking about boxes and packing, right? The Trump lawyers probably wish those with the questions that they were asking about that investigation. And it's clear that they believe, they do not believe the Trump defense is in the court of public opinion, that he didn't know the process, that he didn't have to follow it. So it's really significant because it shows not only is this our impression in our reporting, but this is a testimony that they're getting in both cases from an expert.",

Now, in addition to Ukraine, these two leaders were expected to talk about economic cooperation as well as regulating artificial intelligence. That's an issue that's been quite important to the British Prime Minister, but this is also a key moment in their relationship. They've met about four times before, but this invite to the White House is really the most sustained interaction that we've seen between the President and the British Prime Minister. While they have been quite united on Ukraine, there have been differences between them, of course, generational differences as well as ideological differences. And in just about an hour, we do expect for the two of them to speak at a press conference where they could be asked a host of questions. But Ukraine is certainly top of mind.",

A reporter tried to ask during that session about all the smoke coming from the Canadian wildfires to the United States. I suspect another one of the questions will be about Donald Trump. Let's get to that in a second. One of the key tenets of the Biden reelection strategy anyway, even before the dramatic news that Donald Trump has received a target letter of federal investigation, is to do your day job and do it well. In that context, how important is this meeting, especially as we are seeing the indications that Ukraine's long planned counteroffensive is beginning? JULIE PACE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR &amp; SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: I think it's hard to know. You know, I always wonder in these moments how much Americans are paying attention to these day in and day out interactions that the President has had. But I think the bigger picture that Biden is trying to portray is even if you're not paying attention, it's because it's all going OK. I have a good relationship with the British Prime Minister. I have a good relationship with the rest of the world. I'm keeping those relationships going. You can count on me to do that and not have all of this controversy bubbling up.

This certainly will be.Again, I think, even though that is the case, and even though you can feel a bit numb to it at certain points, I think certainly our job as journalists is to keep reminding people that this is new. This is unprecedented. It is serious. And even if there's a wide swath of the electorate that just ignores it or washes it away, I think we have to keep reporting on it. It's history, and we are in so many ways doing the first draft of history. CORNISH: I mean, I feel a little bit different because there's a Chicken Little quality to it that I think journalists have suffered from over the last half decade. And fundamentally, I don't think we can spend that much more time looking at our hands, saying, look what's broken. You know, like what happened here. Why -- I think we actually have to face the reality of what is different and start to approach those questions, approach things with more of an intention of questioning than telling.

It's not just, does it offend you? Is it, you know -- does it make you -- does it disappoint you. It's about, is this a fundamental problem in our democracy that I think, you know, it is our job to keep on looking at whatever it is we can uncover about what his conduct was? I mean, there is a lot to still know about this -- the way he handles these classified documents.
