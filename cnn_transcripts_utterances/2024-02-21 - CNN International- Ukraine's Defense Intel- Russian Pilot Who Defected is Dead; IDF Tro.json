      "sentences": "Meanwhile, Putin is calling Ukraine's withdrawal from Avdiivka an unconditional success, but he says his forces can't stop there, and he says they need to push further into Ukraine.According to Ukrainian defense intelligence, the Russian helicopter pilot who made headlines last year by defecting to Ukraine is now dead. One source says the body of Maxim Kuzminov was found in Spain, shot to death a week ago. CNN's Melissa Bell has that story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SERGEI ZENI, RUSSIA 1 TV CORRESPONDENT (through translated text): They speak calmly about Kuzminov's fate. The order has already been received. Ant its fulfilment is a matter of time. MELISSA BELL, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): An eerie warning, just months before police cordoned off this crime scene. A Russian state media journalist claiming last October that Russian special forces were seeking to retaliate against helicopter pilot Maxim Kuzminov, who defected to Ukraine last year. Kuzminov, now discovered, fatally shot in Spain, Ukrainian defense intelligence sources confirmed to CNN. His body found in a parking garage, according to Spanish authorities. Asked whether Russia had any knowledge of the death, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had no information on the matter at all. Despite Russia's foreign intelligence chief speaking indirectly, saying that Kuzminov became a moral corpse the moment he'd planned his, quote, terrible crime. The crime in question, a daring operation last September that saw him fly his helicopter across the Russian border and into Ukraine. A decision Kuzminov explained to journalists just after arriving in Kyiv. MAXIM KUZMINOV, RUSSIAN HELICOPTER PILOT WHO DEFECTED TO UKRAINE (through translator): If I had one question, why would my beloved homeland need such a war? I went to church. I lit candles with one wish that it would end as soon as possible. I realized that this is evil, horror and crime. Any war is a crime. BELL (voice-over): Maxim Kuzminov said the trip took six months to plan. Then, once out of Russia, he used his voice to encourage more of his countrymen to do the same. KUZMINOV (through translator): Of course, if you commit what I've committed, you will not regret at all. You will be provided for with everything for the rest of your life. You will be offered jobs everywhere, everywhere you would want and whatever you would want to do. You will discover a world of colors for yourself. BELL (voice-over): That world of colors, however, cast in the Kremlin's shadow. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translated text): Of course we will find him. We can reach them all, our arms are long. BELL (voice-over): BELL (voice-over): The warnings on state television reminding dissidents that Moscow's grip extends far beyond Russia's borders. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The Wall Street Journal reported 19 weeks more worth of munitions of weaponry. That's going to send a very different signal. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jovenel Moise was killed in the presidential residence in 2021, when more than two dozen armed men swarmed the compound and shot him 12 times.His wife, Martine Moise, was also shot repeatedly, but survived. The indictment accuses the former First Lady and the former Haitian Prime Minister of conspiring with 49 other people to replace President Moise. The law firm representing the former First Lady insists she is innocent and had no motivation for the attack. What might the prosecution of the former First Lady and her dozens of co- -- well, alleged co-conspirators look like? Well, we spoke earlier with a Haiti-Caribbean correspondent for the Miami Herald about just what is happening. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JACQUELINE CHARLES, MIAMI HERALD HAITI/CARIBBEAN CORRESPONDENT: Former First Lady Martine Moise is basically being accused of being complicit in her husband's assassination. She's charged along with about 49 other individuals, actually 50 others. But there's a group that are former allies and government officials in former President Jovenel Moise's administration who are being charged with this as a result of their behavior in the days leading up to his assassination. Both the former First Lady and Claude Joseph, as well as the former police chief, have all denied any involvement in this. So when you look at the judge's indictment, what you see, though, is that a lot of it is circumstantial. I mean, for instance, you know, the Haitian banks did not cooperate, but we don't really know how much money on the part of Haiti was spent on this. We don't have a ballistic report. But what the judge is saying is that, based on the testimonies of witnesses and some of the suspects, that their behavior is very suspect in this. For instance, the former First Lady, two days after the assassination, according to the administrator of the palace, you know, basically said, hey, open the president's office because former prime minister -- or at the time prime minister, Claude Joseph, wanted to have a meeting so that he can organize an election and, quote- unquote, I can be president in three months. Two days prior to her husband's assassination, according to this administrator, she went in and she cleaned out the office. I will also have to add is that she has refused two invitations by the investigative judge in Haiti to go before him and to talk about what happened on the night that her husband was assassinated and she was home and wounded.
