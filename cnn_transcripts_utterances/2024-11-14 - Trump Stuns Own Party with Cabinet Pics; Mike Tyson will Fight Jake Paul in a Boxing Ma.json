It's not something that you have to request or take a look at. This has been one of the problems with Mr. Kennedy's approach to what we call science, and his words is a fact that he consistently mixes up messages, he mixes up different disease problems, and you're trying to follow him and understand what he is talking about, often like kind of nailing Jell-O to the wall.

Jared is very worried about what RFK would do over vaccinations. Whether or not RFK gets to do anything else, who knows? But this is a gentleman who has absolutely no training in public health, no experience in public health nor does he have any experience in biopharmacologic processes either. He is a quack scientist. It is obvious. And Mr. Trump is doing this to be provocative.Now, tearing down government when children's health is on the line is not okay. I was disappointed in Jared, who I love, who is one of my favorite senators -- forgive me, governors, but it is not okay. It's not okay to do what he did, to cast doubt on processes that are well established in science. It makes parents scared. When parents are scared, they don't take an action. If people freeze and we lose 10% or 20% of our vaccination rates, you'll see disease spread widely across America. And remember, you've got a lot of children who are too young to be vaccinated, who will be very vulnerable when these diseases spread. You'll see some polio come back. You'll certainly see outbreaks of measles and mumps and chickenpox. All of these things don't just sometimes kill you, they also will cause serious neurologic damage when children are ending up with infections because they couldn't get immunity. So, look, there's going to be different opinions. I'm the only physician governor in the country. I actually had to cross paths with RFK. He has now lied about what he did in Samoa where he discouraged those individuals from getting vaccinated, and it's very dangerous. We've seen a lot of this kind of misinformation from the Trump universe on many levels. But this is our children's health. This is not a political thing. This is not Democrat or Republican. This is your kids. And so, when Republicans go to vote, I pray that they will not allow this gentleman to be confirmed.",

That is six lives for every minute for the last 50 years.So, if I were a senator asking question, I'd want to know exactly what data are citing to say these vaccines aren't safe? What data are you citing to imply that, you know, it's a health problem that's being caused by things other than vaccines?

Thank you, gentlemen, for joining me tonight.Matt, let me begin with you. \"The New York Post\" editorial board says tonight that RFK Jr. is a bad choice as health secretary because of his embrace of conspiracy theories, and their warning -- quote -- \"that he leaves a lot of room for things to go wrong -- and for people to wind up harmed or even dead.\" Now, this is the paper that's owned by longtime Trump ally, Rupert Murdoch. Will Trump listen? MATT GORMAN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, FORMER SENIOR COMMUNICATIONS ADVISOR TO SENATOR TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  We'll see. I mean, look, I'm a \"New York Post\" subscriber myself. I get my news at my doorstep every morning. So, I get it. I get the power of it. It also has a lot of circulation down in Palm Beach. I remember when I would go down there and visit, you get it just like you would up in New York. So, look, this is going to be an influential thing. We'll see. A pick like Kennedy, right, is where the rubber really meets the road. Gaetz is controversial for its own separate reasons, right? But a guy like Kennedy, Trump is very open about campaigning with him, obviously. And, obviously, as you know, they floated him quite a bit before Election Day. So, folks like Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and others, it's going to be a tough decision for them.",

The only thing we know about him is that he's a conspiracy theorist with a famous last name. Does that make him qualified to run the Department of Health and Human Services? Of course not.But the whole point of this decision, like so much of Trump's decisions, is simply to appoint these people for the purpose of shock and awe, because they are loyalists. Trump wants people who will be loyal to him above all else, regardless of whether they qualify for the job, regardless of whether they will actually do the job that they're supposed to do. Because part of what he wants them to do is the reason why he's creating all this shock and all, is because he wants to get us so caught up in the absurdity of it all that we forget about the corruption. The corruption that he's appointing people because of nepotism, he's appointing people to serve his own personal interest, he's appointing people to serve corporate interests. That's what's happening below the scene, beneath the smoke screen of the chaos that Trump is creating right now. I think we should all be concerned about that because it bodes poorly for the future of our democracy.",

So, let's cut out all the B.S. and let's get real about what's going on.Donald Trump doesn't care about government. Donald Trump is using these people to help dismantle the government for two reasons. One, because he wants to protect himself, and he wants to make sure that he can do whatever he can to escape any culpability or liability or accountability for his own crimes and misbehavior. And two, because he wants to create an open playing field for corporate interests, for his rich friends and the Elon Musks of the world, to be able to run rampant across the nation and be able to do whatever they want with no government regulation. In fact, Elon Musk will be one of the people regulating the government regulators while he's receiving federal government contracts.",

By resigning Congress, he's pushing chips in the table here. And he's essentially saying, confirm me, I'll be the attorney general, but if he doesn't, then he'll -- he's out of Congress but he is likely to be rumored to go run for governor of Florida anyway, and he can run as kind of a martyr who Republicans, you know, railroaded in this process.

But again, Donald Trump does this for two reasons. One, because he wants to shield himself from responsibility, from legal responsibility. Appointing Matt Gaetz means he has a loyalist there to defend him no matter what, and Matt Gaetz will do whatever. And the other is because he wants to dismantle the department itself so it doesn't go after people who commit crimes like this, his corporate buddies and the rich fat cats. He wants the Department of Justice to be weaponized so we can go after his enemies. And that is a threat to democracy.",

They could turn down the opportunity to get some money.Now, what I think makes this fight appealing to the public, I did a show for HBO called \"Game Theory\" (INAUDIBLE) Jake Paul, and one thing that became very, very clear to me about Jake Paul is there is a generation of people who have children who consume Jake Paul's content. And if you ever remember when you were younger and you had that one friend that your parents thought was just a little bit too stupid to be hanging out with you, what you didn't realize -- (LAUGHTER) -- is your parents hated that friend's guts. And Jake Paul is that friend to a whole generation of kids. And their parents, who grew up watching Mike Tyson, would really like to watch Mike Tyson, not Jake Paul's block. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but there is a -- there is a generation of grown people who have spent a long time seething at the idea of Jake Paul, and that is the only reason that I can figure that there's so much interest in this fight. I have a hard time believing that young people care enough about Jake Paul fighting somebody that's an old man to them, and I have a hard time believing that older people really want to watch Mike Tyson fight except they really, really hope that he can be the one to knock Jake Paul's head off.",
