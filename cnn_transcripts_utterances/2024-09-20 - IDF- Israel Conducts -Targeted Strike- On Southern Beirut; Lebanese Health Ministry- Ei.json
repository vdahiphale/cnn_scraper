We begin this hour with breaking news, a deadly Israeli airstrike in southern Beirut amid a sharp escalation in the fighting with Hezbollah. That powerful blast hitting a residential area in Beirut's dense southern suburbs. You see some of the aftermath there. Lebanon's Health Ministry says at least eight people were killed, dozens more injured. Sources telling CNN, a senior Hezbollah military leader, Ibrahim Aqil, was the target, but it is not yet clear whether he was, in fact, killed. Lebanon's Prime Minister saying the strike shows that Israel, quote, \"gives no weight to any humanitarian, legal or moral considerations.\" The attack, of course, also coming just hours before the UN Security Council's emergency meeting on those pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon earlier this week. In those attacks, at least 37 people were killed, thousands more wounded. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has, of course, vowed revenge, and accused Israel of crossing all the red lines. Joining us for all the very latest, Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv. Ben, first to you, just bring us up to speed on what more we're learning about this airstrike in that southern Beirut area and the fallout.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The strike took place about two hours (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY) news agency. It was an Israeli F-35 bomber, rather fighter that dropped two -- fired two rockets onto a residential building. The Ministry of Health is saying that at least the sort of the preliminary toll is eight dead, 59 wounded. Now, we know that the building that was struck is a multi- storey building that has now been just completely flattened. There are rescue crews on the scene digging through the rubble, trying to find any survivors. This is a part of Beirut. It is very densely populated. And even though we describe it as a Hezbollah stronghold, it's actually home to hundreds of thousands of ordinary people, many of -- and civilians, essentially.Now, according to reports coming out of Israel, the target was one Ibrahim Aqil, who they describe as a senior military official with Hezbollah. This is a man who has been with the group since the early 1980s. And according to some reports, he is the head of what's known as the Radwan Force, which is Hezbollah's elite commando unit. Now, obviously, this comes at a time when tensions were already incredibly high after Tuesday's pager blasts and Wednesday's walkie- talkie blasts, which killed 37 people at least, as well as almost injuring 3,000 as well. So, people here, very concerned that, as tensions rise or skyrocket, that indeed Lebanon and Israel are on the verge of a full-scale war. There is really already a war going on. This is the third time that Israel has struck the Lebanese capital since the beginning of the year. What we have seen in the last 24 hours are intense Israeli airstrikes in addition -- on southern Beirut, in addition to Hezbollah strikes nearing 200 on the Israeli side of the border. So, tensions high, and there doesn't seem to be anything or any power, for instance, the United States doing anything to try to head off what could indeed end up being a full-scale war between Hezbollah and Israel.

      "sentences": "Well, there is no question that this strike today, as well as the pager attacks, which we confirmed were carried out by Israel, were intended beyond anything else to disable Hezbollah, to disrupt their operations, and in this case, a very senior commander. This commander who was targeted in the strike in the Lebanese capital, I'm told, was the head of Hezbollah's Special Operations. He is one of the most senior military commanders in that organization, and certainly the most senior military commander to be killed -- to be targeted, I should say, by Israel since the assassination of Fuad Shukr in late July.When you look at the pace and the number of attacks that Israel seems to have carried out over the last week, it really is startling to see how quickly this situation is escalating. It was just on Tuesday when we saw those thousands of pagers exploding almost simultaneously in the hands of Hezbollah members, killing about a dozen people, most of them Hezbollah members, but at least two children had also been killed. The next day, we saw exploding walkie-talkies. Even more people were killed in that attack, bringing the total to about three dozen Hezbollah members who were killed over just that two-day period. Last night, we saw a series of heavy Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon, and today, now, we see this very significant strike in the Lebanese capital, only the third such time that we have seen the Israeli military carry out a strike from the air in Beirut itself. And so, you are just watching this thing quickly running very -- at a very fast pace in the direction of escalating things further. Hezbollah, of course, has not been silent. We already saw them, in addition to their vows of retaliation over those wireless device attacks. This morning, they carried out a pretty significant barrage of rocket attacks on northern Israel. And now the question is, what more will they do? As Ben was saying, there is very much a sentiment that Hezbollah is being pushed up against a wall, and it seems unlikely at this point that it's going to prompt Hezbollah to say, OK, we're going to stop firing rockets on northern Israel, which is ultimately the goal that Israel is trying to accomplish, so they can return some 60,000 Israeli residents in northern Israel, who have been displaced from their homes. But instead, it seems that the alternative to that, in the absence of a diplomatic solution, which so far has evaded both parties, that the only other alternative beyond Hezbollah backing down is going to be a kind of all-out war between these two sides. And there is no question that we are creeping closer and closer to that. It is ultimately up to the two parties and the decisions that they take in the coming days to see whether or not that actually materializes. But, there is no question that tensions, and we say this all the time, the tensions are high, but right now, there is no question that the pace and number of attacks that we have seen in the last week, all of these incidents are driving us closer and closer to that all-out war that has been feared for so long.",

It's probably in Israel's court, and there are some Israeli officials who have been arguing, not just since Tuesday, since the pager attacks, but they've been arguing for months, that Israel could carry out a limited aerial campaign against Hezbollah without this escalating into the sort of all-out war that everyone feared, and that maybe by carrying out such a campaign. They could push Hezbollah into making a separate ceasefire, independent of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and Gaza. They could push Nasrallah to agree to a ceasefire deal on Israel's northern border.Now, I'm not sure that logic works. But, I think since Tuesday, since the pager attacks, that argument has gained strength in Israel, and there are generals right now who are arguing that our enemy is reeling and we need to take advantage of this opportunity to really push and to carry out an increased campaign of airstrikes.",

I don't know that that would surprise a number of people at this point. But, in terms of this becoming more public, the fact that this is being expressed more, even if it's privately, right, but making it into a very important report, what does that tell you about any hope at all in terms of a deal here for a ceasefire and/or hostage release?",

I mean, the dynamic Benjamin Netanyahu on the Israeli side, Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, on the Palestinian side, neither of them want to make a deal. And in this Wall Street Journal report, you heard Obama administration -- sorry, Biden administration officials putting the blame on Hamas, and rightfully so. Sinwar has been a major obstacle to a ceasefire deal for months now, but so has Netanyahu. He has worked very hard to torpedo everything that the Biden administration has tried to do diplomatically, going back to the spring, and none of the officials quoted in this report or cited in this report were willing to put any blame on Israel, on Netanyahu for reaching this impasse.And so, I think that tells you that while the administration is confronting reality and is admitting that there is not likely to be a deal, it's not seeming to change American policy in any significant way. They're not saying that we've reached this impasse partly because of Israel, and therefore our policy towards Israel is going to change. They're just sort of throwing up their hands and saying, well, we tried, and otherwise continuing with their same policy in the region.",

Stunning new details revealed about a candidate he is backing for governor of a critical battleground state. CNN's KFILE uncovered a series of disturbing posts on a poor website, which were reportedly made by North Carolina's Republican nominee for governor, Mark Robinson, more than a decade ago. Those posts include Robinson referring to himself as a, quote, \"black Nazi\" and calling for the return of slavery. Robinson has denied making the comments. Senior Trump campaign advisors tell CNN there are no plans to call on him to exit the race in North Carolina. Donald Trump, for his part, has a long history of praising and elevating Robinson, who he, of course, endorsed for governor earlier this year.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is Martin Luther King on steroids. I think you're better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two. One of the great stars of the party, one of the great stars in politics, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. And I'm a great supporter of his. You are incredible, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson.

They were able to identify usernames that Robinson had that were also attached to email addresses that he widely used across several sites on the internet, Erica.And so, the KFILE investigation shows very disturbing comments that were made, including about these arousals that he felt when he thought about personal memories dealing with a peeping incident of women in public showers back when he was a 14-year-old. He graphically described that in great detail. There were also a thread where commenters were discussing whether or not they should believe a woman who said that she was raped by a taxi driver when she was intoxicated, that username, that KFILE says, belongs to Robinson, wrote, quote \"And the moral of this story, don't f*** a white bitch.\" These posts included antisemitic, anti-Muslim and homophobic slurs, as well as those that you profiled earlier, talking about calling himself a black Nazi. Again, this is a state that former President Donald Trump needs to win, and polling shows that he and Vice President Kamala Harris are virtually tied here. Most polling has shown that Robinson is trailing his opponent, the Attorney General here, Democrat Josh Stein, but they are very worried, again, about that down-ballot race and what effect, if any, it may have on Donald Trump.",

Of course, this was not what was supposed to be the plan. This is a detour. She was going to go to Wisconsin later today, now stopping here in Atlanta before heading there, and it is because she saw it as important to come highlight the issue of reproductive rights in this state because of this report revealing the two deaths linked to the state's abortion restrictions.Now, just to get into the report a little bit more and the family that you mentioned, this was a woman who died a couple of years ago from a treatable infection due to delays in medical care. And so, that was part of the event last night with Oprah, where the family was able to speak directly to the Vice President, and it was an emotional moment shared between the two. Now, the Vice President, before becoming the Democratic nominee, had done a lot of this type of travel before. It was -- her rapid response travel was part of a strategy, a broader strategy for her to quickly deploy two areas where there was news of days or issue of consequence, and she is doing that again here today. It's a callback to that type of travel that she used to do. And it is, again, the campaign putting reproductive rights front and center. Of course, they see this as a political saliency -- having political saliency among voters. They believe that it's going to drive voters to the polls. And Georgia, of course, is a battleground state. And so, by highlighting this issue here, it's not only elevating the story of these two families, but also driving home the idea that reproductive rights as a broad -- broadly with medical care is important. And so, that is what the Vice President will be doing today. These are remarks that she will be providing until she heads -- then heads to Wisconsin for a rally later tonight. Erica.",
