First off, there are 365 daysin a calendar year because that`s how long it takes for the earth to travel around the sun, right? Well, it`s actually about 365 and a quarter of a day, which means our calendar gets out of sync by a quarter of a day, each year. So in the year 45, B.C. Julius Caesar declared that every four years a day needed to be added to the calendar to balance things out. Thus, the Julian calendar was born. But one caveat, it was later determined that it actually takes slightly less than 365 in a quarter days for earth to rotate around the sun, 44 minutes less to be exact. And over time, those 44 minutes add up. So in the 16th Century, Pope Gregory XIII tweak the system again so that leap ears would occur in any year that`s divisible by four, but only in centuries that are evenly divided by 400, confusing, I know. That means that in the 1600s, the 2000s, those have leap years, but not the 1700s, 1800s, and 1900s. Is that math, mathing? Yeah. OK. Pope Gregory also made February 29th, the official date to add during a leap year. And he dubbed this new system, the Gregorian calendar, and that`s the one used in the majority of the world today. Today`s story getting a 10 out of 10 has us flipping out one of the HBCUs historically black college and universities has become the first to have a gymnastics team. Legends like Simone Biles and Gabby Douglas have inspired a myriad of youngsters to pursue a passion they may not have had otherwise. And now Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee is helping to create a brighter tomorrow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

If you look at the sport as a whole, there`s probably about 10%maybe of athletes who would classify themselves as a black athlete in the sport of gymnastics. The teams I was always on were very supportive, even though, of course, usually I was always like one of two black girls on those teams. I was the only black girl on many of the teams. Gabby was like my idol that watched her win the Olympics. And that inspired me to take gymnastics a little bit more seriously. Getting ready for competitions, you know, everyone will do their hair together and stuff, and my hair is way different texture from anyone else`s. I absolutely hated my hair. You`re constantly surrounded by girls that are just doing slick backs and, like, can put their hair up in a bun easily and stuff. And it`s like, OK, well, my hair doesn`t do that.",
