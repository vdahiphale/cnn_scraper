For the first time he'll appear in a federal courtroom and be arraigned on federal charges in Miami on Tuesday. Trump faces 37 separate counts related to classified documents he allegedly kept and conspired to hide from the government. Some boxes openly stored in a Mar-a-Lago ballroom. Others kept in a bathroom at the resort. Some behind the shower curtain there. Trump's own former attorney general, Bill Barr, saying of the charges if even half of it is true then he is toast. That is a quote. CNN's Katelyn Polantz joins us from Miami. Katelyn, less than 48 hours to go. How are we going to see the former president spending his time between now and then?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, we're going to see the former president traveling but not much else whenever he actually gets to the federal court for these proceedings on Tuesday afternoon.So let's walk through his schedule over the next couple of days. He's going to be traveling to Miami tomorrow, taking the flight down from up north, and then he's going to be staying at his resort in Miami- Dade County. Overnight he's going to be meeting with his lawyers, preparing for what's to come on Tuesday for that initial appearance, arraignment. We do believe he has spent the weekend or at least was with yesterday his body man, Walt Nauta, the man who's charged alongside him in this case. Walt Nauta also has to come to Florida and appear before that judge. He has a summons as well to be here at 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday. But then Tuesday we might not see Donald Trump at all physically walk inside this federal courthouse behind me. That's because there are lots of preparations by the Secret Service and other arms of the federal government that offer protection of the building, of judges, of Trump. And I believe the idea is that he'll be ferried into this building and we won't be seeing him because he was driven underground. And then inside a federal courthouse building there are no cameras, no video cameras, no still photography. And so we won't be able to get to see him in a courtroom like we were able to see him walk into in New York state when he was arraigned there in a separate case, separate charges. But whenever he goes before the judge, he and Walt Nauta, they will be very expected to plead not guilty. That is quite typical at this stage. And Donald Trump says he definitely will do that and then he'll be making a political speech later that night -- Jim.",

Some of our most sensitive national security information.And we saw the pictures on ballroom stages, in bathrooms. There's another photograph of top secret information spilled on the floor. So any other defendant who faced this, as Trump's own Attorney General Bill Barr said, any other defendant who faced this would be in the most grave trouble. And I think Donald Trump is.

Judge Pryor, he may have been the most conservative of them all.And they took the strongest exception to her rulings using words like radical. So I think that presents a challenge under the federal judicial recusal law. I believe if an objective observer, Jim, would say, well, this judge can't really be impartial here, the judge is supposed to step aside from the case. I think there are serious questions about that. And I suspect sooner or later either in her court or in that appellate body, the 11th Circuit, because there are going to be a lot of things that go there immediately appealable, we're going to see those recusal issues emerge.",

Commissioner, what is the latest you're hearing about this fire that caused the collapse there? Do we have any sense of what the cause might be? ADAM THIEL, PHILADELPHIA'S FIRE COMMISSIONER: Jim, it's going to be a little while until we know the cause. Our fire marshals, all of our investigators assisted by our police department and ATF colleagues are there on the scene now. They will be processing that scene for a while, and of course, it's also been a busy day elsewhere in Philadelphia. We've had a couple of other working fires that they're investigating, too. So it's going to be quite some time until we know the exact cause.",

We had about a hundred of our members, a lot of our response partners on seeing. Obviously, it did take a lot of firefighting water, a lot of firefighting activity, our hazardous materials team working with some of those other agencies that you mentioned. Still they're working on that aspect because the product leaked and we had kind of running fuel fires. Just an incredible job though. Our members actually had this fire under control in about an hour, so one hour really. Now under control doesn't mean it's over or out, it simply means that it's not going anywhere. We don't think the incident is going to break containment. But as you heard or as you said at the outset, still going to be a long time for the recovery in traffic on I-95. It is going to be rougher than usual for the next couple of months, I expect.",

And so even if there is a military necessity, and we're not sure in the attack that an attack on a dam requires additional measures to safeguard civilians, provide reasonable precautions, and I think these were completely absent.And frankly, this attack on the dam is one of several, there have been some in the past, and there was a report again today of an attack on a dam up north. So if you think about these attacks on dams, the wide swath of disruption, economic, infrastructure, damage to the ecology and to human lives, is of the scale of a weapon of mass destruction. So this will take years to remediate, and along with the other attacks on dams up north and previously in the Kyiv region, I think we're going to see a major effort to hold Russians accountable. In fact, our team is deploying in the coming days an expert -- environmental expert to that part of the country.",

They are federal records, they are collected by the National Archives. The president does get some say about who sees what for a certain period of time, but they are the records of the American people. And it's quite a simple case, frankly, if you think about it. Did the President have records that he was not supposed to? Yes. Did he know he was not supposed to have them? Apparently, yes from what we've heard, released so far, and therefore he's liable. So I think the president is in some real trouble. And really, there's no excuse for this. My job at the White House was to brief all personnel on the Presidential Records Act. We took it very seriously. Everybody knew that they had to safeguard these records. I wasn't around, of course, at the end of the administration, I was fired two days after he was acquitted, but I think the president is in real trouble.",

There are serious questions in polling about the president's age, and so her job as we look to the next two years is to help the president communicate to an unconvinced American public why he deserves a second term.

And, you know, I think when we think about Anita Dunn, she is a person who is under the radar. You're right. She's not a household name, and she is a person who really appreciates a digital strategy, but she's not really on social media herself. And she actively eschews Washington social scene, despite having lots of connections with lawmakers, members of the Cabinet, other Washington operators, that is by design. The other thing that we have to keep in mind is that for an incumbent president running for re-election, the most valuable commodity is your time, what you say, how you say it, where you say it, that is all things that she is deeply involved in decision making for.",
