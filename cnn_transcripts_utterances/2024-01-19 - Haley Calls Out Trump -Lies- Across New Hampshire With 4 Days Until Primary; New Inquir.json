It kind of eliminate some of your friends which Nikki and he are friends for the greater goal in his mind.

I tell people all the time that I would never vote for Tim Scott, but if he needed a kidney I give it him. With Nikki, this highlights one of his -- one of her greater faults, to be completely honest with her -- with you. I mean, this just shows that the people who know Nikki best like her least, and this is a problem that she has when people get to know where it's -- it's the ability to stand for something. This is a very sharp blow, and South Carolina, this is the blow that will resonate loudest because this is something -- Tim is not somebody to rock a boat. People may see the calculation of the vice president, but they'll also see this as an indictment of Nikki. And I -- you know, listen, what I don't want to do is be on the other end of Nikki Haley's text messages tonight but she is having a fit.

She's in number two. But more importantly, she's running against an incumbent president, so she needs to contrast with Donald Trump but in a way that gets some of his voters towards him. So she needs to work with a magnet as opposed to a spear. If laying into Donald Trump was going to get you the nomination, Chris Christie would have had this thing wrapped up a while ago.

Roman alleges Wade was paid more than others in Willis's office and used money he billed for his work, so far adding up to more than $650,000, to take Willis on romantic and lavish vacations.
