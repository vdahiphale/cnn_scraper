      "sentences": "One, there are so many -- there's so many things lining up to give us increasing confidence that social media, and it's more the phone based childhood in general, is a cause not just a correlate. The simplest reason is that adolescent mental health fell off a cliff in 2012 or 2013, there wasn't much sign of it in 2010, and it was really bad by 2015. And everyone has their theory as to why this might have happened in the United States. But why did the exact same thing happened in Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, to some extent in Scandinavia? So all these theories about you know, it was school shootings, or it was something about American politics, they don't make any sense.Also, climate change wasn't really -- you know, when Greta Thunberg comes out in 2017 and 2018, if everything happened, then then I'd say, OK, you know, climate change that could be a cause for global alarm. But this all happens around 2013. And it's driven especially by preteen girls. I don't think that preteen girls were the main group that was going to be influenced by climate change. So, there is no other alternative theory. There is no theory that the skeptics have proposed that fits international data. That's the first thing.",

This comes from Candace Odgers, who's a psychologist at UC Irvine, she says, \"Two things need to be said after reading \"The Anxious Generation.\" First, this book is going to sell a lot of copies because Jonathan Haidt is telling a scary story about children's development that many parents are primed to believe.\"And this is the part I want you to respond to. \"Second, the books repeated suggestion that digital technologies are rewiring our children's brains and causing an epidemic of mental illness is not supported by science. Worse, the bold proposal that social media is to blame might distract us from effectively responding to the real causes of the current mental health crisis.\" And by the way, in her piece, she points to the 2008 financial meltdown. What's your response?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, once again, the financial meltdown makes no sense, that was 2008. Teen mental health was fine until 2012. And then it's girls, young girls who get depressed so suddenly. So that to me makes no sense.That's her argument. Her main argument in the essay is that I have mistaken correlation for causation. I'm a social scientist, I know that correlation doesn't imply correlation -- I mean, correlation does not imply causation. I've been in this debate since 2019. In 2019, there was a lot of correlational evidence showing that girls who spent a lot of time on social media are more mentally ill, that doesn't prove causation. At the time, there weren't a lot of experiments. Now there are. There are -- I've collected 25 experiments, 17 of which show a significant effect. Once we have experimental evidence, and longitudinal studies, and quasi experiments, where you look at what happens to a whole region when the internet comes in, high speed internet comes in at different phases, the evidence keeps lining up and piling up. So for Odgers to say that there is no -- she says there is no evidence. That's just wrong. I hope that listeners will go to my sub stack after babble.com. I have post after post where Zach Rausch and I, we lay out the international mental health data, we lay out the experimental data. It's not just correlational. There's now experimental evidence. There's evidence of many kinds. Oh, and I witness testimony. You ask the kids themselves, what did they think it is? They say it's social media. Meta did a study and they found this out that the kids say Instagram is the worst. So to say that there's no evidence, that I have no evidence just correlational studies, it's just not true.",

      "sentences": "No. Well, that's basically the story. I mean, basically, human beings had a play based childhood from time immemorial. That's what all mammals do, we played a wire up our brains. And then between 2010 and 2015, phones and screens come sweeping in.Of course, they had, you know, they had computers and T.V. before then. But the smartphone allows them to have it with them all the time, the internet is with you all the time, and you can be online every moment or at least every hour. So things really change. I'd like listeners to imagine, I mean, here's the -- you know, Odgers thinks that I'm making a very, very strong claim that needs very, very strong evidence. But imagine this claim, suppose we invented a toy, let's call it the Furby (ph) or whatever, one of those things in the 80s. Suppose you learned that this Furby is going to take up about nine hours a day of your child's time, they don't -- they won't go outside much, they won't get as much sleep, they won't spend much time with friends, they won't play, they won't have hobbies, they won't read books, and then you -- somebody proposed, maybe the Furbies will be bad for kids. Are you going to say what a fantastical claim? Oh, my God, how could that be? So, you know, when you look at the massive rewiring of childhood into activities that are not particularly healthy, I mean, of course it has an effect. And my book shows is that there's all kinds of evidence supporting that claim.",

We have to protect early puberty especially that's Middle School, ages 10 to 14. And that meant we must protect kids brains in that age. That's when the maximum damage is done, especially for girls. So the most important thing you can do is delay the age at which you give your child a smartphone until high school and delay social media until 16.And while these sound hard, if you're listening at home, this sound hard to do because your child's going to say, but then I'm the only one.

You know, it used to be that you clocked in. You knew you're working and you clocked out and you had some time with family. That's still very important for people.People can still work hard. You can still have start-ups. You can still have long hours. But even in those environments, it's important that we are clear with each other about what time we have to ourselves and our families. This won't conflict with that at all. A lot of the countries that already have this in Europe are thriving including with start-ups and entrepreneurship. And also, I think if we want to compete for these high-skilled workers, they're going to have a choice. They're going to want to go to companies where there is that clarity where they do know they have some time for their kids. And if we -- if we work people to the bone and give them no time these -- the entrepreneurial companies are going to have a hard time to compete for workers and they're going to have a hard time to make sure that they're competitive with the rest of the world.",

If it's an emergency or scheduling or certain things I need them for that still can happen. So, there's enough flexibility. This is really about clarity and making sure that people don't just find themselves 24/7 always available, never able to put their phone down. I think if we do that, we're going to have a hard time finding workers in government, technology or anywhere else. So, this is just really the consequence of this technology and updating our laws to make sure we have that level of clarity with our employees. I don't see any problem in implementing this in government. In fact, we're already doing it. So, it definitely can work. If we don't do it, the lack of clarity, the gray area, even for government, people shouldn't be working 24/7. That should be clear when they're on and when they're off.",
