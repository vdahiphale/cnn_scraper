From Canada all the way down to the Carolinas, thick, hazy wildfires, smoke engulfing much of the East Coast. If wildfires have been burning for more than a month, why did it get so bad today, and how long this is going to last? And, former President Donald Trump swears he's being attacked unfairly again and desperately wants you to hear his side of the story, and he's just released a new TV ad starring some wild animals to make sure you get the message. All this while former Vice President Mike Pence jumps in the race against Trump and Chris Christie believes he can beat them both. I'm going to ask Governor Christie how ahead when he joins me live on THE LEAD. (MUSIC)",

As much of the eastern United States is being choked right now by a dangerous haze of smoke caused by more than 400 raging wildfires in Canada. Air quality alert are out for more than 55 million people across the Northeast, Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. The air is so unhealthy in New York City right now that an actor stopped a Broadway matinee performance this afternoon because she had difficulty breathing. Throughout the Eastern Coast, people's eyes, sinuses, throats irritated from the exposure, schools cancelling outdoor activities. Health experts urging those in affected parts of the country to wear masks if people have to be outside. If you've been checking your phone's weather app, you've been getting the alerts and seeing the unhealthy and in some cases hazardous, hazardous air quality numbers impacting cities from New England to North Carolina. The blanket of orange smoke swallowing up major cities such as New York City, making high rises disappear in the haze. It looks like a \"Star Wars\" movie there. Officials say yesterday's air quality in New York City was the worst since the 1960s before the EPA was created. Right now, it's currently among the worst in the world. CNN's Athena Jones is in New York for us. Athena, tell us what you're seeing and experiencing right now.",

You can see the haze. Now, it feels as though we're living, breathing, working in a giant cloud of smoke. Yes, you can see a few yards in front of you but not much beyond that. Let me just show you -- this is the southern direction. We're on the east side of Manhattan. You can see some buildings a few hundred yards in front but see the big tall building on the right. Usually you can see a lot more skyscrapers beyond that. This is Manhattan. It's a city known for all of its tall buildings. Moving over here, to east 57th Street, along East 57th Street, this street goes up to West 57th Street, it's something some people call billionaire's row, tons and tons of skyscrapers or more, can't see any of it. And then, finally, I want to show you, one of the most dramatic scenes we have. We're right near the East River here, and you can still make out the 59th Street Bridge. Here's the East River. You can see Roosevelt Island, but just past that you can only see a few of the buildings in downtown Queens. Usually, you can see a lot more buildings than that. And so, that gives you a sense of what New Yorkers are dealing with here, and if you -- you mentioned the phone. My phone shows me, that the air quality index is at 244. That is way higher than it was last night when officials were freaking out that this being the worst kind of air quality we've seen in decades in this city. And it is -- qualifies as very unhealthy, and that's very important, Jake. Our own company, Warner Bros. Discovery, sent out an alert to any employees who may want to go outside to consider wearing a mask and that's because of the particulate matter in the air. This is among the tiniest, most dangerous kind of pollutants and it's the kind of thing found in these wildfires smoke. These particles are so small they can get into your lungs when you breathe them in. Get into the blood stream and cause all kinds of health issues. That is why we're seeing all the precautions taking place. In Chappaqua, that's in Westchester County, north of the city here, they just dismissed school early. So, those are the kinds of precautions we expect to see more of as we deal this over the next few days, potentially -- Jake.",

In fact, JFK could be added to the list soon of the next airport that will experience a ground stop. The ground stops have been lifted in the New York area. There was one earlier at LaGuardia.But right now, at Newark, that is where the visibility is the worst, down to about a quarter of a mile. And the delays there, a ground delay program, put in place by the FAA, meaning that flights are held at their departing airport before going to New York, that is up to around an hour and 20 minutes for the delays on average. Even worse at Newark, it's about two hours, or at LaGuardia, excuse me, it around two hours. Philadelphia just added to the list about a half hour delay on average. About a quarter of all flights have been delayed today into LaGuardia. In fact, the New York area is partly the hardest hit, just spoke to a passengers on a flight descending into Newark, he said it was almost apocalyptic as they descended into that thick, red smoke. He can actually smell it from his seat inside the plane. The delays and cancellations just keep going up. We've seen around 2,300 delays, nationwide today, according to FlightAware. So far, the cancellations are relatively low, under 200, but that number could go up. We see the deck of cards occasionally come tumbling down. When airplanes in cruise are put out of position when there's such a major weather event like this, the FAA has put in place these procedures to try to keep it so these planes simply don't get too close together, as they're going to some of these major airports, Jake.",

If they still have symptoms, even after the air quality is gotten better, that might suggest they have developed that as a result of this. So, really, you know, this is something that people are extremely concerned about, there are also warnings for pregnant women, in terms of slightly raised risk of pre-term birth.

The Archives found records with classified markings in them, kicking off this criminal investigation that we are so closely tracking right now.At that moment, Donald Trump wanted to put it out a statement saying, he had turned over everything. And there were people around him who somehow made that statement not happen. They were warning him he should be consulting with his attorney, one of those people was Taylor Budowich, this person who is a close aide to him and was his spokesperson, now works for MAGA Inc., a super PAC. And Taylor Budowich did come to the federal courthouse here today, this morning. We have learned through our reporting that he testified to the grand jury, a little under an hour and he released a statement, not disclosing exactly what he was asked about, or the extent of questioning or any indication he might have of where this investigation is right now, but he said that he fulfilled a legal obligation to testify in front of a grand jury.

He said Mexico would pay for it, we haven't gotten a first peso. And we know a lot of other things. He was going to repeal and replace Obamacare. He had a Republican Congress for two years, didn't get it done. Said he was going to balance the budget in four years, left with the greatest deficit of any president in modern history.
