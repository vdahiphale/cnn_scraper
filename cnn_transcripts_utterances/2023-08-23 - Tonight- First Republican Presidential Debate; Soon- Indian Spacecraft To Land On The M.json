Sergey Surovikin who for three months, from October to January last year -- or January this year, commanded the -- what Russia still calls the special military operation in Ukraine. He has been the head of the Aerospace Forces since 2018.But the real reason why this is so significant is because he hasn't been seen in public since that aborted Wagner mutiny in June. He made a video address while that was still unfolding telling Prigozhin and his men to stop their march. But since then a lot of things have come to light. There was some reporting from The New York Times citing U.S. officials that he might have known in advance about Prigozhin's plans. There were rumors circulating that he may have been arrested and jailed. Then CNN reported back in July that he had actually relatively close links to Wagner -- that he was one of at least 30 Russian generals who had a sort of VIP membership of the group. So a lot of questions swirling about him. And now, we hear this morning from RIA Novosti, which is a state news agency, citing a source -- an informed source that he has now been relieved of his post as the head of the Aerospace Forces and replaced by the current head of the general staff of the Aerospace Forces, Viktor Afzalov. Now, we don't know what he's going to be doing next. Another Russian outlet -- a business outlet called RBC says that he will be taking up another post and he is on a short holiday. And as for officially, we haven't heard from the Russian Ministry of Defense. He is still listed as the head of the Aerospace Forces on their website. But it does look like for now he has been replaced, according to state media -- so highly significant, Danny.",

He is a distant second in the polls behind Trump, but he's still second. So what do you think he needs to do to boost support tonight? STEF KIGHT, POLITICS REPORTER, AXIOS (via Skype):  This is going to be a huge night for DeSantis. Obviously, he has been in that second-place position for a long time now, but we've been seeing him drop so steadily in the polls over the past few weeks and months. He had some pretty worrying financial trends when we saw those FEC reports not too long ago. And his campaign has touted this reset trying to regain momentum after a lot of anticipation and a lot of expectation around him getting into the race. And we haven't really seen that play out into him getting any closer to the frontrunner, Donald Trump. And so he is going to have to really make a convincing showing at the debate tonight to really show the American public -- Republicans -- that no, he is actually the person who should be in the second place spot and he should be the person they should be looking for -- looking to instead of Donald Trump. But, of course, there's the risk that he ends up being viewed as just another candidate -- kind of with the rest of the pack -- falling behind from Donald Trump's steady lead.",

Of course, some candidates might take a little bit of an easier approach.Sen. Tim Scott has indicated that maybe he won't go quite as hard against Ron DeSantis, in particular. He wants to show himself as just his own candidate trying to show why he would be the best person to take on President Joe Biden in a general election. And there will also be some of the lower-tier candidates who this is really their opportunity to let people know who they are. So people like Doug Burgum and Asa Hutchinson. We might see them maybe take less of an aggressive approach and more of an approach of showing the American people -- showing people watching this is who we are, this is what we would do, and kind of distinguishing themselves, taking this as an opportunity to try to get some momentum that maybe they haven't gotten so far.",

She is one person I'll be watching closely. Of course, Chris Christie we're expecting to go pretty hard against the former president. While on the other end of things, DeSantis is already seemingly preparing to go on defense for Trump. So I think we're going to see all of these different strategies become quite clear. Vivek Ramaswamy, as well, has been very defensive of the president, promising to pardon him if he were to be in the White House. Promising to pardon Trump. So it's going to become very clear what these various strategies are and we're going to see which ones are the most effective moving forward.",

This is covering over 110 million Americans and over 20 states impacted by this impressive heat wave.

Record low maximums -- that's a tough one. One hundred ten degrees -- that is what it feels like as you step outside today across parts of the Midwest -- Davenport into Chicago and Springfield. So this is the feels-like temperature. That includes the air temperature and the humidity. And this is why authorities are so concerned.

Well, check this out. A significant difference heading into the weekend for places like Omaha, the Windy City, as well as Minneapolis.

One of the kids was retrieved with the help of an SSS commando through the heli. But then night fell and they had to use zipliners. Experienced zipliners went up there and retrieved the seven remaining. They were administered. They were given help. Health officials were there on hand to make sure that they were all right. Their parents were incredibly relieved. They were heading off to school. Again, it's a remote part of the country and it's not uncommon for these kind of almost hokey homemade kind of cables made out of leftover scrap metal and automobile parts that are -- that are used to make these cable cars. So, yes, these kind of things are not uncommon but this level of danger -- the fact that they were so many hundreds of feet above the ground, and the fact that it was such a dangerous operation, and the fact that it ended on a very happy note has relieved the country. There has been a call for a clamp down and better oversight on these cable cars and chair lifts, as they're called here in Pakistan.
