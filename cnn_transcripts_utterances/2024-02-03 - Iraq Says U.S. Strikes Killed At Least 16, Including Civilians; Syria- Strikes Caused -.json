The Iraqi government, of course, saying that 16 people have been killed in Iraq as a result of these airstrikes.

And two things are almost certain about President Biden and South Carolina this election season, almost certainly that close. He will win the primary today. And he's going to lose South Carolina in the general election. South Carolina has not gone for Democrats since people were dancing to disco. Jimmy Carter in 1976. But what happens today in South Carolina is important. First, because South Carolina is now at the front of the line. It's the first opportunity for Democrats to award delegates toward the nomination, but also because of what South Carolina did for Joe Biden. Before South Carolina's primary and 2020 the political obituaries for then Vice President Biden were drafted. Do you remember just how bleak it was for the Biden campaign in those early contests? It was a crowded field and Joe Biden was lost in the crowd. After he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, the Atlantic ran this headline, How Biden Blew It. Eight days later, Biden finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary and the headline from Politico was blood in the water. Biden campaign reels after New Hampshire trouncing. It was awful for the Biden folks. He finished second in Nevada, but more than 20 points behind Bernie Sanders. Yet the Biden campaign kept saying wait until South Carolina, that's where the campaign will really take off. But it wasn't certain. Biden's bet was that black voters, when they got an opportunity to weigh in, that they would choose him, the man they'd known for decades, and the vice president of the first black president of the United States. He was right. Congressman Jim Clyburn endorsed him and said this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us.",

He is a Pennsylvania state representative, and a member of the Biden Harris campaigns National Advisory Board. Representative. Good to see you again. Let's start here with two of the issues into the comments. We heard from the lady as we saw in the last segment. Tierra says that for her and a lot of her classmates she's a student at Claflin. This is a choice between the lesser of two evils and frankly, every cycle someone says that a lot of people feel that. But how do you change that narrative because if you're choosing between the lesser of two evils maybe you choose the third option and you don't show up at all. MALCOLM KENYATTA, MEMBER, BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN'S NATIONAL ADVISORY BOARD. Well, first of all, Victor, thank you. And thank you for having that -- for having that conversation. I think what you see consistently, really consistently from this President and this vice president, is that they actually do care what black voters have to say. And I think this administration, you know, doesn't treat black voters as disposable, but as indispensable. You know, what always makes me feel proud to speak about the President's accomplishments is that I know that he legitimately listens to people, it's never be quiet and vote. The President wanted to start this primary contest in South Carolina, because he wanted to make sure that the backbone of the Democratic Party black voters aren't heard late in the process, but actually get to be front and center as we nominate presidents not just in this year, but moving forward. And I think what we continue to know is that we have to do two things. We have to first of all lay out the stakes of the election, because at the end of the day, this is going to be a critical choice between a president who cares about the voices of black people who hears them, and hears all voters, when they say, Hey, thank you for doing this. But we need more in this area, and then works to try to do it. But you know, as was brought up in the conversation, we know that this President has been up against big obstacles and big forces in government that don't want us to make the type of progress that we need a Supreme Court that blocked him from doing the type of expansive student debt relief. But this is the president who said, Okay, you're blocking me this way. But I'm not going to stop. And so what I'm proud about is, when I hear conversations like this, it makes me you know, better. I know that it makes this administration, I'm doubled down on trying to achieve the types of transformational systematic changes that will make sure that all Americans but particularly black Americans, have full access to the American promise and everything that comes with it.",

And what came with that was $551 million, specifically, going to South Carolina, to help build out the broadband infrastructure that's necessary. And for a long time, we have people talking about it, paying lip service to it.This is a president that got it done. But what this President has also been able to do is to make the types of critical investments that take time, frankly, you know, the infrastructure bill was passed. And when I think about, you know, lowering the cost of insulin to 30 bucks. That didn't happen a month after the bill was passed, but it started this year. People are feeling it this year. And we see that with this president. He has the eye on the on the long game, but he also has his eyes on how do we fix the structures? Let me ask you one other thing here.
