      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from \"The Source\", five American hostages held in Iran for years are now on their way home. As political backlash is growing on the terms of the deal, Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie is here.Plus, a special CNN sit-down tonight with Democratic Party powerhouse, California Governor Gavin Newsom, on 2024 speculation and the state of his own party. Also, a big break, just a few moments ago, is the mystery of the missing U.S. fighter jet. How does an $80 million plane vanish from thin air? I'm Kaitlan Collins, and this is \"The source\". Hostages no more tonight, as five Americans are on their way back to the United States. They were freed early this morning after being wrongfully detained in Iran for years. Three of them were in prison for over five years, and two others have not yet been publicly identified over their own privacy concerns. But, what led to their release is leading to harsh criticism from some Republicans tonight, because the U.S. unblocked $6 billion in frozen Iranian oil revenue, and dismissed federal charges and released five Iranians of their own. White House officials say that that money can only be used for things like food and medicine, and will be subject to strict oversight. The deal was sealed as President Biden arrived here in New York where he is preparing to address the United Nations tomorrow. All of this is coming as another foreign policy crisis is looming on Capitol Hill over Ukraine. The President is expected to continue to rally the world to defend Ukraine against Russia. But, in Washington, there is a growing divide that is on clear display right now among House Republicans over funding that effort. President Zelenskyy also here in New York ahead of his own meeting with Congress later this week. Let's get straight to \"The Source\" tonight with Republican presidential candidate, 2024 candidate, Chris Christie. Governor Christie, thank you for being here tonight. Five Americans are now on their way home. If you were President, would you have made this deal today? CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would not have made the deal, Kaitlan. No. And the idea that Iran would use this money for only humanitarian efforts. Let me say what humanitarian is in Iran, Kaitlan. That means they cut your hands off before they kill you. That's humanitarian in Iran. This is one of the most barbaric regimes in the world. They are the biggest exporter of terror in the world. And Joe Biden has given them now $6 billion to go and make mischief, more mischief, dangerous mischief, around the world. I wouldn't have made this deal as much as I would have liked as Americans to be home. You cannot give $6 billion to a terrorist state.",

You continue to work as hard as you can to get them returned home, but you don't get them returned home to make matters worse. They are now -- Americans are now more of a target for Iran than they were before, because they took five this time, maybe they'll take 10 next time. And then, there'll be looking for $12 billion or $15 billion. This never ends. It's a slippery slope that you slide down.As a leader, you have to say \"no\" to that type of thing. I would not have had a problem with exchanging five hostages for five hostages, but -- for five prisoners rather, but I would not have given them $6 billion. This empowers that regime to sport terror, and encourages them to take more Americans in order to try to get more money from assets that are frozen because of their own terrorist conduct.",

These folks are connected, all three of them, Kim Jong Un, President Xi, President Putin, are committed communist authoritarian dictators, and they want the world to look like what Russia, China, and North Korea look like. That sounds the way I think the world should work.And if we don't stand up to China now, we will be fighting China in Taiwan. And then, it won't be just sending arms there.

Joe Biden has given the Ukrainians just enough not to lose. He should have been more aggressive right from the beginning. But now, he has a job to do. His job is to convince a majority of the United States House and Senate to continue the support for Ukraine. The fact is that they are making progress in their counteroffensive, and they'd be making even more if we had armed them with F-16s earlier, if we had given them the artillery they needed earlier. We didn't do those things.And it's naive to believe, as some in the Republican Party believe, that somehow we can negotiate something with Vladimir Putin, which will quench his thirst for aggression. This is a former KGB operative, Kaitlan, who wants to put back the old Soviet Union. He wants to put it back together. He will not be satisfied until that's done. And we need to stand up and say no to that, and make that very clear to him by our support of Ukraine.",
