The IDF saying there was another couple of explosions. The IDF saying that they've captured 50 Hamas rockets, now taking control of a number of Hamas rocket launch sites, some of them in children's play parks. And also that they've cut off the north from the south of Gaza along the length of the Gaza Strip. They're operating a humanitarian corridor. The IDF keeps it open to allow some hours of the day from civilians to move from the north to the south of Gaza. But it's really what happens next around Gaza City. We're hearing the explosions. But are the troops going in on the ground, and how is Hamas dealing with that? There's the concern about Hamas creating kill zones where they can entrap the IDF troops and rain fire on them. We don't have visibility on that. But we can hear the explosions, Erin.",

But he says that Israel would have to administer it and run it for awhile. We've heard that a few weeks ago from other Israeli government ministers. I think one of the interesting things we've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu this evening is saying when asked about the question of having a ceasefire, he said no ceasefire without the full release of hostages. On the issue that the United States is pushing for, humanitarian pauses, he is saying, okay -- well, tactical pauses maybe, we've had them before, maybe that can get some humanitarian aid in, maybe the hostages can be released. This is Netanyahu it sounds like softening his position. He's been hard-lined, no ceasefire. Now he's hinting maybe these short humanitarian pauses, this is a new position.",
