Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy just left Capitol Hill after meeting with House Speaker Mike Johnson and the entire United States Senate. Zelenskyy is trying desperately to secure the critical funding his country needs to defend itself against Russia. But time is running out. Just moments ago, House Speaker Johnson spoke to reporters right after his meeting with Zelenskyy ended.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA): The Senate has been MIA on this. The House passed H.R.2 six months ago -- more than six months ago. It's been sitting and collecting dust on Chuck Schumer's desk. I have told him personally. I've told the national security adviser, the secretary of state, and the secretary of defense that these are our conditions because these are the conditions of the American people. And we are resolute on that. It is not the House's issue right now. The issue is with the White House in the Senate. And I implore them to do their job because the time is urgent. And we do want to do the right thing here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's been echoed down the line by Republicans saying that there needs to be a deal on immigration policy first to deal with the surge of migrants across the U.S. border with Mexico before they will allow more aid to Ukraine to move forward. But their proposals to clamp down on border security provide deal with issues about asylum policy, parole policy, things that Democrats say they simply will not accept, which is why we are seeing a round of finger pointing. Despite the efforts by Zelenskyy to try to unite the two parties behind the Ukrainian cause, a division within Congress about how to exactly go about approving that critical aid.Now you heard from Zelenskyy there -- sorry, Johnson there. But in talking to senators as well, people who left that meeting that they had with Zelenskyy, it is clear that that divide over immigration still persists with no clarity about how they will get resolved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL): I'm angry and I'm disappointed. Angry that we would consider walking away from Ukraine at this moment in their history. For almost two years, they have fought off the most powerful military in the world and given their lives to do it. And we said we stand by your side. SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): There is zero chance that an aid package to Ukraine and to Israel will pass the House without real meaningful -- a real meaningful border security. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Punting this issue even further into the new year.Even as Zelenskyy made that push for money immediately saying is needed for air missile, defenses and systems and warning about the possibility of Ukraine unable to beat back Russia if that money does not come. He did tell lawmakers I'm told that he is still counting on U.S.A to come through. But as you can hear right, they're unclear how that will happen.

What necessarily has changed in U.S. perception, I think there's a recognition that the counter offensive didn't go the way that NATO or the way the Ukraine had hoped, didn't have the glowing success that could have justified the billions spent.But requests from those on the Hill for a kind of ultimate price tag, I think misunderstand the nature of the war here. It's essentially about giving Russia an adequate setback that potentially Ukraine can be happy with imposing terms of peace. But every day here it is absolutely clear. Russia will continue to push forward. We're seeing that in the eastern around a town called (Inaudible) where there is heavy fighting at the moment across Ukraine. Right now, clearly there has been some sort of cyberattack which is damaging cellphone access. Ukraine security services pointing the finger -- clearly Russia for that as well. It means they're here in Zaporizhzhia. The streetlights are going to be turned out manually tonight because cell phones are out. It means in some areas too. The S.O insistent (Ph) that comes up on your phone isn't going to work, a feeling of infrastructure, again being attacked by Russia here to make this already miserable winter, yet more grim for Ukrainians. And the frontline too hear -- you know, we saw ourselves down in Kherson, a city liberated pretty much a year ago now. But bombarded daily intensely by Russia from just across the other side of the river in Russian occupied territory. It's kind of a symbol for why Ukraine doesn't want to talk about a sort of hot piece to accepting diplomatically, its current frontlines with Russia in occupied territory as being a new border for them. Kherson is pounded relentlessly. Russia won't let them be. And so many Ukrainians are worried that they're essentially going to have to live with that sort of aggressive neighbor trying to take more ground off them again and again as Moscow refits re-equips in potentially the months ahead. So, the conversations happening now between Zelenskyy and congressmen, senators, utterly a matter of life and death here for the frontline soldiers. We've been talking to. They're angry, they're steadfast and they're going to have to fight forwards because they have no choice. But they're very aware that U.S. aid is essentially the reason and European aid too and that unity is the reason why more of Ukraine is not currently under Russian occupation. This is an existential question, frankly, for European security. And it's Ukraine, holding Russia back at the moment. Dana?",

Paul Kane of The Washington Post, Laura Barron-Lopez of the PBS NewsHour, Jeff Mason of Reuters, and CNN's Eva McKend.Jeff, I want to start with you. You've covered the White House for a few years. How frustrated are they inside the White House that they cannot convince the Congress, even Republicans who are the most supportive of Ukraine, of course, Republicans are divided on even defining Ukraine at all.

But there's also a legitimate political risk to President Biden if this doesn't go through.One of his main foreign policy, sort of victories that he likes to talk about is having coalesced NATO, coalesce the West and to stand up against Russian aggression. If they're not able to put money where their mouth is, which right now, it looks like he won't be able to do. That makes him look weaker going into the 2024 election.",

I will say this, we don't see Democrats outspoken on this issue in the House. But I think that they are glad for Republicans to sort of take the fire for this.

One Republican close to Sununu told CNN, there's no doubt it is a boost for Nikki Haley. But the question of course is, will it be enough to matter? When you look at the big picture. CNN poll last month in the Granite State had Donald Trump up by more than 20 points. So, Haley is a strong second.Our political panel is back with us. Eva, you've spent a good amount of time with Nikki Haley on the campaign trail. What's your sense? MCKEND: Well, I think the Sununu endorsement further reinforces her as the pragmatic choice in this Republican primary. She has been honing in on this electability argument. In a general matchup, I would be a better person to go up against President Biden than Donald Trump. But it could also serve as a liability, right? Some of these Republican primary voters don't want the pragmatic choice. They want someone who is going to throw them more red meat and someone that is closer -- if not Trump closer to Trump, which would be Governor DeSantis. So, we'll see how much this helps her.

And it could very well help her because this endorsement could -- with those independents that you mentioned. Because New Hampshire, I think more than Iowa and some of the other early states has a contingent of, you know, right leaning independents or Republicans that aren't exactly in favor of Trump. We've seen where candidates like Chris Christie and Nikki Haley seem to be getting a bit more attention in a state like New Hampshire because there are more independent minded Republican voters there. That being said in the grander scheme of things, do I think that this endorsement helps Haley surpass Trump? No. I mean, right now, Republican voters -- the Republican base, in poll after poll has demonstrated that they're not necessarily interested in the type of policy forward campaign she may be trying to run.
