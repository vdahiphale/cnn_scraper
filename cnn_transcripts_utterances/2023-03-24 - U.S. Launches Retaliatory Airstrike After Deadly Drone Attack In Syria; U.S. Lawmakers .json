I mean, you know, what's interesting is, of course, they know that Emmanuel Macron is term will end in 2027. I mean, that may see it seem a long way off.But ultimately, what's I think ironic about this situation is that the Upper House, the Senate, voted in favor of this, which of these reforms, it was the lower house where Emmanuel Macron was unable to get the support that he needed, and ultimately then pushed it through with Article 49.3, but then ultimately, his government then survived two votes of no-confidence, right. So it's an interesting kind of situation. Now, we're in a semi presidential Constitutional Republic here. And it's really less the office of the president that's at risk. It's his government, that at the end of the day, John, if Emmanuel Macron was to push for legislative elections, and not think that the configuration in Parliament would change in any way in his favor. And even if he wants to reshuffled his cabinet, or ultimately asked his Prime Minister, I don't see a president that is willing here to back down on his legislative agenda. And at the end of the day, that will therefore mean that their focus will remain on him and on opposition to his to his legislative agenda, John. But I think we also need to start looking to Emmanuel Macron, his own party, to his cabinet, and to those elected representatives of his movement and office party who are going to become going to come under increasing pressure from their own constituents moving forward. And then ultimately, what people in his party will be arguing is that they will have to be a candidate in 2027. And is it worth the risk of this particular party being essentially obliterated, because of the way it's handled this? Or is there an opportunity here to kind of go about rebuilding by 2027. And that may require Emmanuel Macron to back down in order to mitigate that kind of damage. But until he does, there's no way in which these kinds of tensions are going to dissolve, and we're just going to see it growing exponentially, John.",

That's the country that has an authoritarian model and is seen around the world as having go to third that authoritarian model. In fact, it even bans TikTok in the country. There's a censored version of the app in in China.And if the U.S. starts banning social media apps, because it doesn't like them, we start to look just a little bit admittedly, but it's a slippery slope, we start to look like those countries, at least in the eyes of other countries around the world, who will say, Gee, America says it's open and democratic.

Instead, there is a separate version of Byte Dances. App in China called Douyin boasting more than 600 million daily active users, Douyin is already a viral sensation in China before TikTok launched overseas. So I've got TikTok pulled up on my U.S. phone and Douyin on this China phone. They've got very similar homepages and interfaces. The only reason why I can access TikTok here in Beijing is because this phone has got an overseas sim card in it and a VPN to get around China's internet firewall has some more. But Douyin users under 14 can only the app for 40 minutes a day and (INAUDIBLE) safe content. Plus Douyin automatically puts on the heavy beauty filter when I opened up this camera function. Media is heavily censored in China so if I type in a topic sensitive to the Chinese government on Douyin, say like \"Tiananmen 1989\", nothing pops up and I get a text that says \"No search results\" available. Versus on TikTok. You'll see that a bunch of videos pop up about the massacre. One of Washington's concerns is that because of its Chinese ownership, Beijing could use its propaganda and censorship methods on TikTok, too. The other fear is that TikTok could be forced to hand over data to the Chinese government. But security experts say the national security risks are hypothetical at best. Beijing says the U.S. government has been abusing state power to suppress other countries companies. But the irony is that China has outright blocked countless foreign Web sites and apps, including Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Netflix and more. On Douyin, Chinese state media has been sharing TikTok videos from angry Americans.",

For years, though we had this failure to meaningfully address the doping related issues, that meant the suspension stayed in place. Until this very week though the Russian Federation reinstated now after meeting conditions set by World Athletics Russia task force. On Thursday Coe revealing that ban had been lifted, but that athletes, officials and support staff from Russia and in fact Belarus, too are still to be excluded due to Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine with no timeline either as to how long the exclusion is to remain in place. And another really significant development on Thursday, and we'll get to some reaction from this in just a few moments, but world athletics also deciding to exclude transgender women who have gone through what it called male puberty. This from female events in international competition. At the heart of this argument, (INAUDIBLE) they're trying to strike a balance between inclusivity and making sure there is no unfair advantage when it comes to competition.
