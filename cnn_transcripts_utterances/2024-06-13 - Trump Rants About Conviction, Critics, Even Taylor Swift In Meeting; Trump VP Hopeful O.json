He compared him to opium and heroin for the white working class. But -- before he apologize for those comments, when he ran for Senate in 2022 with Trump's backing.But I think what's really interesting about these, these Twitter likes. It shows a side of a J.D. Vance that we really didn't even necessarily see publicly when he was such a big Trump critic because he was this Trump whisperer. He's a public intellectual and people flock to them to sort of explain why Trump was doing so well with the white working class. But when we see these likes, we see the sort of things that he'd agreed with that he wasn't even going to say publicly and I want to walk our viewers through a few of them. So take a look at this one, and this is from October 2016 and this is the Access Hollywood tape, when public and he liked this tweet that said maybe the Central Park Five could take out a full-page ad to condemn the coddling of thug real estate barons who commit serial sexual assault.",

Is Vance is under serious consideration to possibly be the VP for Trump? A person who said he would serve perhaps in Clinton administration. How likely do you think it is that he'll be Trump's pick? FRED UPTON, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R-MI): Well, he's on the tap lift, the short five, I guess you could call it. I don't think the things that he said back in 2016, maybe 2017 really matter much. He's a MAGA Republican. He's been as loyal as can be to Donald Trump and all that is in the past and forgiven. I don't think he's going to be the vice president. I've been wrong before. I think Marco Rubio. I think Elise Stefanik. I think Tim Scott are all ahead of him. But he's on the shortlist. There's no question about it, but I don't think those comments from 2016 have any bearing in terms of the vetting that Trump is doing now? He is okay. He's an A plus in the Trump book right now. BURNETT: You know, it's interesting, I guess you could look at it from two sides, Congressman. You could look at it if the fact that what it says about Trump, that he can get past this if he does with people. And then on the other side of it, someone like J.D. Vance, who is an incredibly intelligent person, right? \"Hillbilly Elegy\", right? This it -- thoughtful and nuanced person is able to go from where he was to where he is now, that how one person can do that is truly stunning. It has been a short time where he's made this transformation and, you know, his criticism of Trump, Congressman, did range from harsh, some of the stuff Andrew was sharing to frankly, much more thoughtful nuance things like he told me once when he was criticizing Trump's exaggerating and his shortcomings as president, he put it this way.

And the White House knew that that answer and that exchange had sort of taken on a life of its own when in reality the issue was that some aides actually hadn't discussed that matter with the president directly. We heard Jean-Pierre telling reporters on Air Force One: I haven't talked to him about it. I'm just not going to have anything to say on this. But it was nonetheless a really remarkable moment. Aaron seeing the president on the global stage with the eyes of the world on him having to address in such a manner what has been such a painful issue for his family to deal with. And I was checking in with some White House and campaign aides after the press conference, just asking how they thought at all went. And a couple of them said, look, I think he accomplished what he sought to accomplish, the press conference accomplished what it needed to accomplish, basically that they wanted the focus to be on Ukraine and that was interesting to me because there was a moment in a press conference where the president it seems to bristle when a reporter asked him a question about the ongoing ceasefire negotiations and the Israel war.

State media has reported that major banks were blocking customers from withdrawing cash and that was coming from state media. So consider that. It comes as Putin is sending a nuclear-powered sub and other warships to Havana, just 90 miles off the Florida coast. But what is so striking about Russia's massive so forth. So we can all see right now off the U.S. coast is the truth, the reality of Putin's navy, a fleet that's been decimated since the beginning of the war with Ukraine. Fred Pleitgen is OUTFRONT. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): Ukrainian sea drones racing to attack a Russian warship near Crimea in the Black Sea. The cheap unmanned vessels have allowed Ukraine to decimate Vladimir Putin's Black Sea fleet. Their weapons are not designed to deal with such small sea drones. The soldier says, in most cases they use anti-ship guns. It's a far cry from the power Moscow was trying to project, not far from the us is shores sending some of their most advanced warships to Cuba. Russia's ministry of defense saying that the frigate and a nuclear powered sub, quote, practice the use of high precision missile weapons by computer-based maritime simulation at the ship based groupings of a mock enemy. Vladimir Putin has invested heavily in Russia's navy, which now has a permanent base in Syria, and boasts hypersonic missiles. It's no paper tiger, but also not an invincible force as Ukraine has shown. Ukraine's sea drones as well as sabotage and air launched missiles have destroyed about one one-third of Russia's Black Sea fleet since the spring of 2022, Ukraine says, including large landing ships like this one, blown up in Crimea at the end of last year, and submarines destroyed in a dock. The Russians have even lost the flagship of the Black Sea fleet, the Moskva, to what Kyiv says was an attack by Ukrainian made missiles. And the fleet's headquarters in Sebastopol was struck by missiles last year, the repeated humiliations pushing Russian ships further and further away from Ukraine and eventually leading to the dismissal of Russia's navy chief in March. Not so long ago, Russian state media would celebrate the navy's single aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, the jewel in the crown. But the ship has long been plagued by mechanical problems and has been in dock for years and more months. Some Western analysts predict it will never set sail again. Despite Putin's glorification of Russia's naval prowess, many of its warships appear vulnerable to both air and sea attacks and lack the technology to compete with western navies, or even cheap maritime drones made in Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And, Erin, the Ukrainians say that while the Russians might be gaining -ground in other areas, they feel that they've really hurt Moscow's Black Sea fleet and essentially rendered it ineffective and the Ukrainian say they will continue to develop those sea drones to hurt Vladimir Putin's naval forces even more -- Erin.",
