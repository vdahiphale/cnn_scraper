Secretary of State Antony Blinken just arriving in Kyiv for a previously unannounced visit to Ukraine. This is for third time visiting the Ukrainian capital since the Russian invasion. You are looking at pictures from a previous trip. Now, Kyiv, we should remind you, is the still very much an active war zone this morning. In fact, just hours before the secretary arrived Ukraine said it's fended off a Russian missile attack on the city. Let's get you live to CNN's Melissa Bell. She is on the ground in Kyiv. Melissa, what exactly do we know about this secretary visit and what he plans to do there?",

What we understand is that Secretary Blinken is here to hear from the Ukrainians themselves. How those counteroffensives have been going.We have been hearing from senior source that State Department speaking about the American assessment that impressive gains have been made, but he is here to here for himself what they have to say about the progress being made and about what more they may need. This is also, of course, David coming as it does less than a month after President Biden asked Congress for an extra $24 billion in aid for Ukraine, about finding out what is needed and taking the message of what is happening here back to the American people to convince them at a time when polls are showing that that support for American funding of this war is softening. It is also, of course, it comes also, as you say, David, at a critical time more broadly for the country. We saw in Kyiv this morning a series of ballistic missile attacks, cruise missile attacks as well. All of them fended off by Ukraine's air defense system. Still, some of the debris causing damage here in the Ukrainian capital. So it is an important, visit comes at a critical time and it is about hearing also what Ukraine has to say about its ongoing fight against corruption and, more broadly -- the video of the damage there, that shows some of the damage being done to the Ukrainian capital. But this is also, David, for Secretary Blinken who has just been with his Ukrainian counterpart laying a wreath at a military cemetery in -- to remind everyone and to pay tribute to all of those who lost their lives. This is also about taking back the Ukrainian message that they're going to be carrying to the United Nations later this month about how they see this war going forward, the need to hold together this alliance of some 50 countries. We are now 19 months, David, into the war that the entire world, not least Ukrainians, are getting extremely tired of.",
