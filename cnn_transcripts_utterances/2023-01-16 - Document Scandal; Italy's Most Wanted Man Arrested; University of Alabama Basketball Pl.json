He's running the Oversight Committee talking about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMES COMER (R-KY):  We want to know the visitor logs to the residence. We want to know who had access to the Biden Center for Diplomacy, because this is the same type of investigation that the Democrats were so outraged and launched and demanded happened to President Trump.

He traveled up to Wilmington because he has a security clearance. And he said he handled -- he handed over documents to the Justice Department that came to pick them up. The question there that this immediately raises is, why is a government employee, somebody who works in the White House Counsel's Office, going to the president's personal residence? As Arlette pointed out, one reason why they don't have visitor logs is because it's a personal residence. Well, now you're mixing the personal with the government, and that's going to make Sauber a new witness that the Justice Department, the FBI is going to have to talk to. It's just they're adding messy components to something that's already a pretty big problem. And here's a final thing I'd say. For investigators, often, when they see shifting narratives like that, they begin to suspect that there is something else that's being hidden.

At least 40 people are dead. The search for survivors goes on, and just some heartbreaking moments, including this scene. This is a young girl cleaning up the rubble in the aftermath of that attack. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is at the scene. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  The morning brings to light the full extent of the destruction, the residential building, home to dozens of families, annihilated down to the foundation. Even though rescue crews still work, the chances of finding survivors now virtually zero. All night, residents watched in fear, anger and grief. Olha Mevchanaya (ph) says she passed by the building only about half- an-hour before it was hit. \"There are many friends and people close to me here, many, many,\" she says. Elena Loyan (ph), stunned by the scale of the destruction, curses the Russians. \"I simply hate them. Children, people die here.\" And then she can't speak anymore. Throughout the night, the death toll continued to jump. On top of the many killed, Ukrainian authorities say dozens were injured, many of them children in just this location in Dnipro, one of many sites in Ukraine, Russia targeted with barrages of missiles this weekend. (on camera):  The Ukrainians say the reason why the damage here is so extensive is that this building was hit with a cruise missile called the Kh-22. That's designed to destroy aircraft carrier strike groups. And, obviously, when it hit the building, it completely annihilated it, burying dozens of people underneath. (voice-over):  The Ukrainians call the attack state terrorism. And the president says rescuers will continue to try and save anyone trapped here. \"Let's fight for every person, President Zelenskyy says The rescue operation will last as long as there is even the slightest chance to save a life.\" But even the slightest hope has now all but died. And this is essentially a recovery operation, the crews searching for bodies where so many lives were violently ended in an instant Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Dnipro, Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

On Monday, rescue teams retrieved the black boxes, the flight data and cockpit voice recorder that could help understand the moments leading up to the crash. The Himalayan country has a record of air accidents due to its mountainous topography and sudden changes to the weather. But, in this case, officials say, it was a clear day. The Nepal government has set up a panel to prove the air accident and will hopefully find answers to what led to the third worst aviation accident in Nepal's history.

But really the issue is, because there has been so much rain, storm after storm after storm, for the last three weeks or so, there is so much saturation, there's nowhere for the water to go. So, those mudslides, the roads giving way, that is still going to be happening as the day progresses. Here, this traffic backup is because of a closure on State Route 37 here in Novato. And if we have a couple of the still pictures that Caltrans has sent us, that's an example of water just flowing over the roadway. And they did a good job pumping that water all off yesterday. But then they told me, this morning, it flooded again overnight because of that extra rain. That's a common story that we're hearing all across the state, where I continue to see these alerts from different county emergency management officials telling people about road closures because of mudslides. That soil is just so saturated. We're also, of course, seeing some incredible footage of rescues, including in Orange County in Southern California, where, in Laguna Hills, a woman was rescued when -- after she was hanging on to a tree by a fast-moving creek right there. And the same Orange County fire authority also sharing a picture of them rescuing a man out of the water overnight as well. And then, in Southern California as well, you -- we saw the multiple trees coming down on a number of cars in a shopping mall parking lot. So these are the types of things that may continue to happen because, again, the ground, the rivers is all so -- it's so saturated from what we have experienced over the last couple of weeks -- Erica.",

That's because he has been charged with murder, along with another man, Michael Lynn Davis, 20 years of age. The two men were arrested after an incident that authorities in Tuscaloosa say they were called to around 1:45 a.m. Sunday morning in an area about a half-mile off campus, an entertainment district. When police arrived on the scene, they said they found a female dead inside of a vehicle 23 years of age. She died of a gunshot wound. The driver of that vehicle said that the two suspects opened fire on them. The driver says he returned fire, believed he wounded one of them. And it was after talking to witnesses, looking at surveillance video that authorities were able to make the arrest. And, yes, one of the men was wounded. We don't know which one. The question here is why. [13:20:00] And authorities will only say that there was apparently some minor altercation that led up to this and then came the gunfire. And now comes the heartbreak.
