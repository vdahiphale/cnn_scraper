Tonight, a hugelyconsequential week in Ukraine with weapons not seen before in the nearly three years of conflict now being fired. We are live on the ground. Also ahead, a sixth tourist dies of suspected methanol poisoning in the popular backpacking destination of Laos. Tainted alcohol believed to be the culprit. And pro-sports leagues in the U.S. now warning their players after organized crime groups are allegedly targeting their homes. More on who those burglars are and what they're after. Russian President Vladimir Putin just a short time ago saying his country will keep testing a new hypersonic missile in combat. It's been a week of dangerous intensification for the war in Ukraine underscored by Kyiv closing its parliament today amid the threat of missile strikes. President Putin's warning coming after Russia struck the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with an experimental ballistic missile that carried multiple warheads. Experts believe it is likely the first time such a weapon had been used in combat. Russia says its new missile launch was in response to, quote, \"reckless decisions and actions of western countries.\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine is now discussing new air defense systems with its allies. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator): And in particular, on my instructions, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine is already holding meetings with our partners on new air defense systems, the kind of systems that can protect our lives from new risks.

She's also the co-chair of the President-elect's inaugural committee. Donald Trump is expected to meet with her soon at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

In an interview, Gaetz said he won't re-join Congress, but does plan to serve Trump in a different capacity. Gaetz, of course, withdrew his name on Thursday after Donald Trump told him he didn't have the votes in the Senate for that AG role, in large part over his alleged sexual misconduct. He claims this was all part of a smear campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT GAETZ, ATTORNEY &amp; FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN: I was dealing with a politically-motivated body. They didn't like me because of what I did to Kevin McCarthy. All of them were handpicked by Kevin McCarthy, they had an ax to grind. So, that was going to serve as at least enough of a basis to delay my confirmation as Attorney General.

Putin's comments come after Moscow struck the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Thursday with a new medium-range ballistic missile that western officials say carried multiple warheads. As that conflict intensifies, so does the manpower needed for combat, and the stakes are high for the families of Russian soldiers. CNN's Fred Pleitgen speaks with mothers in Moscow.

Vladimir Putin saying more than 700,000 are currently stationed in and around Ukraine. We got rare access to an event in Moscow honoring the mothers of Russian soldiers battling in what the Kremlin still calls its special military operation. Mothers whose sons are fighting have been killed or injured.

It's the trailer from the 2013 movie The Bling Ring, inspired by the real life group of the same namewho 15 years ago were responsible for numerous robberies targeting celebrity homes, including Paris Hilton's. It may feel a bit too familiar tonight for some well-known professional athletes. The national football and -- the Nation Football League and the National Basketball Association here in the U.S. warning their players after a string of break-ins at the homes of several sports stars. An NFL security bulletin issued on Wednesday details how organized groups are using team schedules and social media to target players' homes. The NBA issuing a similar alert recommending players use updated alarm systems and sort their valuables in a locked safe. All of this coming about after several recent burglaries of athletes' residences including those of Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes and his teammate Travis Kelce. CNN's Josh Campbell following all these developments now and joins us with more. This is fairly sophisticated in terms of what this this crime ring, how they're allegedly operating, Josh.",

That's because authorities believe that some of these incidents may have been conducted by transnational burglary groups coming into the U.S. We've long reported on the so-called burglary tourism. First, there was a warning from the NFL, then the NBA, then the National Hockey League. And authorities are finding certain attributes in these various incidents. I'll take through some of them. For example, they're seeing that a lot of these burglars are conducting extensive surveillance around some of the homes that are being targeted, going so far as to pose as delivery drivers and grounds keepers just to try to give a sense of the coming and going of the residents. They're also scaling walls, targeting master bedrooms on second floors for example, going after cash, going after jewelry. Now, these burglary groups have been long concerned to law enforcement here in the U.S. from coast-to-coast. A lot of these groups coming into the U.S. from South America, officials tell us. Take a listen here to one prosecutor who told me that these aren't keystone crooks. These are sophisticated operations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

A civil jury found he sexually assaulted a woman in 2018. The woman claimed McGregor raped and battered her after night of heavy partying at a penthouse. The jury awarded her more than $250,000. Police investigated the woman's complaint but prosecutors declined to bring charges saying that there was insufficient evidence and conviction was unlikely. McGregor has maintained his innocence, testifying that the sex was consensual. Music mogul Sean Diddy Combs returning to court today where he is making a fourth attempt to get released on bail. Multiple judges have raised the risk he may tamper with witnesses. And this time his attorneys claim that it's prosecutors who altered a video of Combs attacking his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2016. Combs has been in a Brooklyn jail now for 10 weeks awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges which is set for May. He has pleaded not guilty. President-elect Donald Trump pushing Republicans to reject a bipartisan bill that's known as The Press Act. It would give journalists more protections under federal law. Well, this week, Donald Trump posting on his social media platform \"Republicans must kill this bill,\" in all caps as you see right there. The Reporters Committee for Press -- for Freedom of the Press says, \"The Press Act would bar the federal government from using subpoenas, search warrants, or other compulsory actions against journalists to force the disclosure of information identifying confidential sources as well as other news-gathering records, except in very limited circumstances.\" CNN Senior Media Analyst Brian Stelter joining me now.

Two sources who spoke with Joe and Mika said to me that they were worried about governmental and legal harassment and they basicallywanted to take a target off their backs by making peace with the President- elect. Brzezinski and Scarborough, they used to be friendly with Trump. Then they became, you know, opponents of Trump. And if there were an enemies list, they'd probably be on it. So, this meeting, you know, I think rattled a lot of people and raised a lot of eyebrows for that reason. It also turned off a lot of MSNBC viewers and ticked them off because they're upset about the meeting. But it raises this larger point that that I've been writing about, I wrote about today in the Reliable Sources Newsletter, there's a wide range of opinions inside media outlets among editors, journalists, lawyers for journalists about what the next four years are going to be like. Some people maybe think it's going to be like a rainstorm, others think it's going to be an actual hurricane. There's a real range of attitude. And honestly, I've seen that among other institutional reactions as well. Take Senate Democrats -- again, going back to the Democrats for a moment. You've seen some Democrats say we can't overreact to every move Trump makes. Then on the other hand, you have Senator Chris Murphy today telling the Bulwark I'm preparing for the worst. I'm worried that nonprofit groups are going to be shut down. I'm worried about arrest warrants for members of Congress. So, I would say there's a kind of a similar range of opinions or attitudes among members of the media, among top editors, among top publishers about how Trump will behave, whether he will actually seek retribution or whether he will end up just treating the media as irrelevant, because that's another option here. He might just bring in right-wing podcasters, bring in pro-Trump outlets into the White House Press Briefing room and try to diminish the relevance of the traditional news media. That would be I suppose a different kind of form of retribution.",
