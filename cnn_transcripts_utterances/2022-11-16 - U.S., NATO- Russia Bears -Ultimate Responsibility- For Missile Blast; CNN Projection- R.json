A major Russia ally also jumping into the fray with an ominous warning. Plus, dropping Trump. Some of Trump's biggest allies are now turning on the former president big time publicly, including billionaires who are now saying they are going to spend their millions on other candidates. How much will it hurt Trump? And the breaking news, Republicans now officially control the House of Representatives. What does this mean for President Biden? Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, blaming Russia. Fingers pointing at Russia for bearing ultimate responsibility for the deadly missile explosion in Poland. U.S. officials tonight say it was likely a Ukrainian defense missile trying to intercept one of what was a barrage of a hundred Russian missiles striking Ukraine yesterday. But the U.S. and NATO both making it clear that it is Russia's fault for killing two people in NATO territory and causing a crisis that could have quickly led to a major escalation.

So if there is going to be a negotiation, it is going to have to be from a position of strength where the Ukrainians and the allies can impose minimum settlements. We aren't there yet. But over the coming weeks and months, we'll be in a better position. Ukraine will be in a better position. I think that's what General Milley is getting at here. He's saying, not that suddenly the Ukrainians should be suing for peace and giving up territory, but rather that creating Ukraine as what will be the strongest-armed country, best trained, best defended in all of Europe, is a very different position than they were in when the Russians invaded on February 24th.

This is the first time since 1934 in which the president's party had a net gain in governorships, less than a net loss of ten House seats, and no net loss in the Senate races. So this is a great midterm. And, as you sort of look far right and you say, okay, we're now past the midterm, and let's look forward to the next presidential election, look, the fact is we know that presidents, when they run, they pretty much always get renominated. I think the number is something like 96 percent of the time. And when it comes to re-election, they win a little over 60 percent of the time.
