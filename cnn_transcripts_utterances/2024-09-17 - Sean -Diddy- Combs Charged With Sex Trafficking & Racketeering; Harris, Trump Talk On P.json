My exclusive interview with his attorney, live tonight. Also, hours after blaming her for the second apparent attempt to kill him, Donald Trump was on the phone, with Vice President Harris today, as his running mate is defending amplifying lies, about migrant -- about immigrants. And the inside story, from the person who was there, the moment the Secret Service agents dove on top of the former President. We're going to speak to Donald Trump's golf partner, live tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. In just moments, the attorney for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, will join me on set, in his first interview since a pretty dramatic court appearance, this afternoon, where the megastar pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering, conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation of prostitution. Diddy remains in jail, tonight, as his team is arguing for his release. This is all coming as prosecutors are painting one of music's biggest moguls, as a monster. All the names that Sean Combs has gone by, over the years, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy, they're now all being used as officially government aliases, replaced, for the time being, with an inmate number. Diddy went from receiving the key to New York City, not that long ago, to being held, right now, at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, as he is facing the possibility of decades in prison. Federal prosecutors accuse him of running, what they call, a criminal enterprise that went on for years. The evidence is laid out in a newly-unsealed federal document, accusing the three-time Grammy winner of being a violent man. And I'm quoting from them now, saying that he \"Engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" abuse that they say, quote, \"Was, at times, verbal, emotional, physical and sexual.\" Prosecutors say that Combs \"Manipulated women to participate in highly orchestrated performances of sexual activity with male commercial sex workers,\" maintaining control of these women, they say, by, quote, \"Distributing narcotics to them, controlling their careers, leveraging his financial support and threatening to cut off the same,\" and also \"using intimidation and violence.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Combs allegedly planned and controlled the sex performances, which he called freak offs, and he often electronically recorded them. The freak off sometimes lasted days at a time, involved multiple commercial sex workers, and often involved a variety of narcotics, such as ketamine, ecstasy and GHB, which Combs distributed to the victims to keep them obedient and compliant.

My lead source tonight is Marc Agnifilo, attorney for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was there with him in court today. And it's great to have you. Because the bail part was what you were arguing for, that he should be released. The judge disagreed with you today. You're appealing that actually tomorrow. How likely is it, do you think you'll win on that appeal, given the judge today said there were no conditions, as she saw it that could ensure that he would show up for court? MARC AGNIFILO, ATTORNEY FOR SEAN \"DIDDY\" COMBS: So, thank you, Kaitlan. So, I think we have a good shot tomorrow. Tomorrow, we argue in front of the district court judge, whose case this is. Today, we argued in front of a magistrate judge, whose case this is not. We'll never have this magistrate as our judge again. But tomorrow, we argue in front of Judge Carter, and it's Judge Carter's case till the end. So, hope springs eternal and -- but I think we have strong arguments, and I think we have a good chance.",

I called the prosecutors myself. I said, Mr. Combs is in New York. Do you want to know where he is? If you want to know where he is, I'll tell you where he is. But he wants to surrender. He's here to surrender. They didn't want him to surrender, because if he surrenders, they don't get to tell (ph) the judge that he's a flight risk and he's a danger.

This is not my first or 100th rodeo. That this was going to come as a matter of time.What I realized in early September is that it was coming soon. And so, it was time for Mr. Combs to come to New York, which he did. And let me just point out one very important thing. The prosecutors are seizing on something that happened eight years ago. This video that we've all seen? And it's a -- it's a bad video for Mr. Combs, and he said so himself, when he gave his apology. This is eight years ago. And the prosecutors are talking about him bribing a hotel security worker. There was no criminal investigation. This was just a matter of personal embarrassment because he and the person in the video, were in the midst of a 10-year relationship that was difficult at times, that was toxic at times, but it was mutually so.

It's a state crime. It's too old. This isn't a federal crime. And defense lawyers often try to do that, because they want to try to knock down piece by piece. The problem that the defense is going to have here is the RICO charge, count one of this indictment, which I used to charge all the time, use all the time as a prosecutor. It allows prosecutors to show the jury the entirety of the evidence. Even if some of it is not a federal crime, even if some of it is a misdemeanor, even if some of it is a state crime or too old, you are allowed to put that all together and give it to the jury and say, If you find this was an ongoing enterprise that committed more than one crime, then he's guilty.

As listening to Trump talk about his call with Harris today, the crowd was booing, and he said no, as he was describing it as very nice. I was just thinking back to him, yesterday, and the language he was using, saying that he does believe Democrats and Harris are to blame, for what happened to him, on Sunday. Obviously a marked difference than how they talked about this, after what happened in Butler, in July. KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; POLLSTER: Well, look, Donald Trump has been very clear that he thinks people are after him, that he has long said that the world wants to keep him from being president. And so, this is part of that consistent message. And while, I think, right now, at least in terms of the first assassination attempt, there's really not a lot of evidence, of any kind of clear political leaning. And the second shooter, or attempted shooter, still seems to have very unclear motives. I do think that at a certain point, Donald Trump's allowed to be mad that people are trying to shoot at him. And I understand that it's probably not wise to blame your opponent for it. I don't think that's smart.

The political branches of the Alabama government, who are elected by and accountable to the people, promptly passed a new law that guaranteed access to IVF in Alabama, the same way every other state guarantees access to IVF. This bill in the Senate was not about guaranteeing access to IVF, which is not threatened in any state. It was about radical, experimental, controversial treatments like things like gene editing or cloning. And it infringes upon religious liberties, which, again, shouldn't be surprising, because the Democrats are the party that want to harass and persecute nuns or investigate Catholics for going to traditional masses. That's why we oppose that bill, and will continue to oppose it.",

This bill doesn't require anyone to perform any operations or procedures. It just says that people should have access to IVF. And it also talks about having insurance companies cover the cost for fertility treatments, something that your candidate supports. So, just to be clear. I'm not misrepresenting the bill. You can say you don't like it. You can say that you think it's a show vote. You can talk about those aspects of it. But this is something that was put up there, and it would have guaranteed access to IVF. So, let me ask you, while you're here, given you're a major surrogate for the Trump campaign. His proposal here is that he would like to either have the government, or insurance companies, cover the cost for fertility treatments. Has the campaign explained to you yet how he would pay for that plan?",

That's the hole that is fronting Congress Avenue. I was up the entire time. I just, for some reason that I can't really explain to you, I just never crouched down or got behind the golf cart. So, I was looking to my left. The President was being -- was being taken away. The Secret Service were amazing, by the way. They were -- I mean, the job they did was exemplary. They were on top of him, probably after the first shot. Then, I heard another three, and they were getting him out of there, in what seemed to be like 15 or 20 seconds.
