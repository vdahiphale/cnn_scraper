Three explosions were heard near a major military air base near the Iranian city of Isfahan. Right now, the Israeli military is not commenting on the strikes.Sources tell CNN the U.S. was given advance notice of the strike and did not endorse it. Earlier, Iran's foreign minister told CNN that any retaliation by Israel would be by a response that is \"immediate at a maximum level.\" Joining me now is CNN military analyst Col. Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton -- I mean, this was starting to flare up as probably you and I were trying to go to bed last night, and we woke up to things not spiraling out of control. So, I mean, where do things stand at this point? COL.

There is no threat to respond at this stage. The Iranian -- the Iranian military saying that those three explosions were the air defense systems shooting at unidentified objects in the sky. They're promising more information to come at a later date. It wasn't just strikes on Iran. There were also things targeted in southern Syria, according to Syrian state media. These were air defense systems and there was some damage done. The Israelis have not officially commented. The Iranians have not said much beyond what I explained already. And, of course, each of these two sides have their own internal domestic pressures to deal with -- non exemplified perhaps better than the reaction from the far-right Israeli national security minister who tweeted his apparent thoughts about what Israel has done here with one word, \"lame.\" There have been calls to de-escalate from plenty in the international community from the U.K., the EU, Italy, the Chinese -- the list goes on. But from within the Middle East, Jim, there has been very little. Perhaps countries in this part of the world -- they're waiting for the dust to settle a little bit more before saying much of anything. We have, though, heard from the Omanis, who have condemned the Israeli strikes -- condemned Israeli attacks in the region more broadly and called on the international community to do more to get to the root cause of the tension. We have also heard from the Egyptians, who have -- the Foreign Ministry putting out a statement calling for restraint and warning about the consequences of conflict and instability. And the Israeli -- or the Egyptians, excuse me, have made clear in the past that this is entirely predictable given the shadow war that we have seen between the Iranians and the Israelis play out in this region for some time -- years, really. Egypt has been among the countries that has been in contact with both the Israelis and the Iranians, urging them to turn down the temperature. And that has been a common theme amongst countries in the Middle East where, over the last few weeks, there has been this flurry of diplomatic activity from in and outside of the region. Some of it private. Some of them -- some of it done out in public. First, it was to try to get the Iranians not to respond against the Israelis. Then it was to try to get the Israelis not to respond back to the Iranians. Because nobody really has any interest in this expanding further. Turkey has been among the countries that has sort of shuttled messages between the Americans and the Iranians more than a week ago now. It's not clear of their role here. But there has also been some criticism not only from Turkey but from others in the region against the West. That the West has been very quick to condemn Iran but not so quick to condemn what started this whole thing in the first place, Jim -- which was, of course, that strike on April 1 against that diplomatic compound in Syria.",
