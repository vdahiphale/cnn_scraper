Will that language affect his standing with voters, particularly how they feel about the need for increased border security. We're going to ask someone who would know. CNN's senior data reporter Harry Enten joins us now.So, Harry, how do Americans feel about illegal immigration and border security at this point?",

So, take a look at this poll from Marquette University Law School. Want increased efforts to stop illegal immigration at the southern border. Look, you see here, 96 percent of Republican voters want that. But it's 78 percent of all voters. And even among Hispanic voters it's 71 percent.Now, let's take a look more broadly, right? Let's take a look at, do a better job on border security and immigration. In 2020 we basically saw a dead heat between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, Biden up by a point, but that is well within the margin of error. Look at the change that we have seen over the past three years. Donald Trump has opened up a 23-point lead on this issue. Whatever he has been doing or whatever folks have been seeing along the border has definitely impacted their views. And at this particular point, this is an issue that Donald Trump wants to plan, not just in the Republican primary, but in the general election as well.",

Biden still leads, but that margin has shrunk to just six percentage points.And, of course, in 2020, it was one of the best performances for a Republican candidate amongst Hispanic voters in a generation, since George W. Bush in 2004. So, we've seen an increasing trend towards Trump. And you might be asking yourself, OK, what about this rhetoric from Donald Trump? Will this hurt him among Hispanic voters? But take a look here, better job on border security and immigration among Hispanic voters, check this out, the plurality of Hispanic voters actually prefer Donald Trump on this issue, 42 percent to 30 percent. So, look, this rhetoric, I think a lot of people don't like it, but the fact is, when it comes to border security and immigration, a lot of folks are liking what Donald Trump is saying, especially compared to Joe Biden.",

Your man Harry's numbers should make people sober up, especially on the Democratic side.
