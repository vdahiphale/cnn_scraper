Catherine, the princess of Wales, will appear tomorrow at the king's birthday celebration, also known as the trooping of the color. It will be her first public events since stepping away in January originally for abdominal surgery we later learned lead to a cancer diagnosis. And we know the princess is undergoing chemotherapy and say she is making, quote, good progress in her treatment, which is expected to continue for a few more months, quote. Max Foster joins us now from outside Buckingham Palace. Max, good to have you with us. Another very personal statement from the princess of Wales, but good to know. We do get to see her for the first time in many months in an official capacity tomorrow.",

On those bad days, you feel weak tired, and you have to get into your body resting. But on the good days when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well.My treatments ongoing will be going on for a few months. And she also feels ready to appear in public for the first time this year. So she will be here appearing here at trooping the color, which is king's birthday celebration, a big spectacular event as you know, Julia, and well see her throughout the morning really, we'll see her in the carriages, going up to horse guards, parade with the children was here coming back and also on the balcony behind me. So there will speculation we might see her, but, you know, they were just -- they're just trying to treat it as carefully as possible. She might not even appear tomorrow. They're making very clear she is committing to engagements now, but they're going to take each one as they come. And if it's a bad day, I think everyone will say to her, including her medical team, it's not -- it's not worth it.",

It's not as interesting, maybe to some people, but she, she I think Kate feels that she is updating the public as much as she can. You know, in the past, they wouldn't give us any medical details. They have at least told us that she has cancer. She's going through this therapy and it'll be going on for many months ahead. So actually for the palace, they've been quite open and they feel that they have a duty to do that. But the same time, they want this privacy, and part of that privacy and part of her treatment as she sees it, is trying to get back to normal life behind the scenes, there are paparazzi pitchers of going about her normal day. We haven't been showing them. They want her to have that privacy so she can progress and spend time with her family and get better mentally as much as physically. And, then the deal is that she will appear in public every so often. So we do get updated. So that's the way they're treating it.",

Just very quickly, Sally, what do you make if the picture because I think what defined the video when she told the world that she had cancer and that's what she's been suffering with, was that she chose to do that alone.

And, of course, the king will be not riding on horseback, but in a carriage which probably will see from now on, we tend to forget the queen stopped riding on horseback, when she was 60- years-old? And Charles is 15 years older than she and she never had to wear a bear skin on her. So I think he's wise to be doing it in a carriage even if he is wearing a bear skin, whether you will or not, we'll see. But I -- getting back to the picture.

He talks about A.I. as being a tool and he talked about it as being a function of the human mind, you know, God-given, if you will, to -- that we have the ability to have scientific discovery technological discoveries, and this tool, A.I., is just the latest of those, he said, the good, and the bad directions, and he laid them out. The bad -- he gave the example of an automated weapon, a gun that could choose a target by itself, aim at the target by itself, shoot the target by itself. He said, there should never be a situation where a machine can kill a human. He went on to say that also that this should benefit everyone, that there should be not just for the benefit of one country or the rich countries, they shouldn't benefit the haves over the have-nots, and that really sort of chimed with the discussion that was held to his opening remarks. We heard from a White House official who said that there were two things is in essence. One, the global governance, the G7 trying to find a combined way to govern, put guardrails on A.I. It's obviously, you know, a global phenomenon. It's available everywhere, so you have to work together as the rich, powerful democracies, but also making sure that, you know, the scientific developments, their health care benefits that come from it, the agricultural developments, they benefit poorer nations as well.

She said, essentially that this will make everyone on safe in the United States and she also said that the Congress's regulation of machine guns is going to be eviscerated by this action. It means that people will be able to essentially have these more deadly versions of guns as a result of this ruling.But as you pointed out, what this does is it invalidates a regulation that was written by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and it was done in 2017 frankly, we covered at the time, at a moment of cowardice by the U.S. Congress. You had a Republican president who did not want to put Republicans on the spot to have to vote for something in that period. And so, what he did is he instead had the ATF issue this regulation so that Republicans didn't have to vote on something like this. And so what you have now is Congress, I'm sorry, you have the conservative majority on the Supreme Court saying that you can't do things this way, that if you want to pass a ban, then you have to go through it by passing a law in the United States Congress, which, of course, doesn't want to do that. They don't want to touch gun issues at all. And it's not even clear whether that would even survive a further challenge. And one other thing, you know, there are a number of states that pass laws that mirror some of these regulations from the ATF. There are a number of states that passed their own bumps stock bans. So, for now, those are still standing, but you can bet that as a result of this ruling today, that there will be some challenges which will go back to the Supreme Court and well see where the conservative majority lies on this in previous. In the last few years, what they've attended to do is to say that the United States Second Amendment means that anything that wasn't around at the time of the framing of the Constitution, that any of that -- any of those restrictions should not stand. So, we'll see when this comes back, but you can bet that this will come back to the Supreme Court at some point.",

Does that give you any hope that perhaps even just on this specific issue, Congress perhaps could come together and decide to act to limit this in some way? Do you have any hope of that?",

But look, we're in a Congress that is constantly gridlocked, in the partisan gridlock, and we know the uphill battle that it takes to pass to gun control in this country. March for Our Lives is fighting that every single day.And got the first gun round prevention bill to pass through Congress in three decades, after Uvalde and Buffalo, and we haven't seen anything since. It's very hard. We're fighting every day, but most basic common sense, some safety measures. But for some reason, Republicans just cannot get onboard to protect the American people. So while it's great that the Supreme Court didn't outright say, no, we -- bump stocks cannot be banned, but that it's now referred to Congress that basically is a death sentence. The justices knew what they were doing. They knew that bump stock bans would never pass through the Congress that we're facing now. So, I would like to say that there's hope because March for Our Lives is invigorated and we are fighting for it tooth and nail. And I think it'll take an election that some congressional turnover to do so, but it really was a calculated move by the Supreme Court to delegate this to Congress.",
