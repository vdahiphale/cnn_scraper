And that is really occupying his mind around the clock. When I heard and many of us heard what had happened to him and to his extended family, you know, we all reached out to him. I think he was overwhelmed with the amount of phone calls and messages he received. So, I'm -- you know, I just -- I hope if he's watching us now, he understands that we all care about him.
