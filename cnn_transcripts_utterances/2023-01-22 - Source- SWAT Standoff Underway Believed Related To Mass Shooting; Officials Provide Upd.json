I'm Jim Acosta in Washington and we are following breaking news this hour as a police standoff situation unfolds in Torrance, California.This is believed to be connected to the mass shooting in Monterey, California that killed 10 people and left another 10 people injured. Police have just released a photo of the suspect who they described as an Asian male calling him armed and dangerous. Witnesses say people in a dance studio were celebrating the Lunar New Year when shots rang out. The motive for this attack remains unclear and CNN's Natasha Chen joins me now from Monterey Park, California. Natasha, what more are we learning about this standoff?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, a law enforcement source tells our colleague, Josh Campbell that it is related to the investigation into this shooting that happened here in Monterey Park just a couple of blocks away from where we are, behind us is an FBI mobile unit, lots of law enforcement State, local, Federal, and so we are waiting to hear more details about the possible connection hereto that standoff that you're seeing.That standoff that you're seeing through aerials from our local affiliates, that is taking place in Torrance, California. That's 30 miles southwest of us approximately closer to the coast. And we've been seeing for a little bit now, these vehicles, armored SWAT vehicles to the front and the back of a white cargo van. It's been still for quite some time. And the reason that a white cargo van could be important is that in an earlier press conference at City Hall here in Monterey Park, the Sheriff of Los Angeles County said that they were looking for a potential suspect vehicle fitting that description though to be fair, there wasn't a lot given out about the possible suspect and other things to look for. These photos, we did get within the past hour. You see there photos related to an incident, however, in Alhambra, California, a city to the north of us, and they are trying to see if the Alhambra incident may be connected to this Monterey Park incident. The shooting in Monterey Park began when police got called at about 10:22 PM local time, and they said about 20 to 30 minutes later, they were made aware of a suspect, also an Asian male being described as going into a dance hall in Alhambra armed and there were people there who wrestled with this man, tackled him and took over his weapon. And the law enforcement who were at this press conference told us they have recovered that weapon in Alhambra. They would not give a lot of details about it, only to say that it was not an assault rifle. Beyond that, Jim, we're being told that the victims are five women and five men who were at this dance hall down the street. I've spoken to people who have been to that business in the past, including Congressmember Judy Chu, who represents this district and lives here. She has also been there before in the past and she says that this is a place where dance lessons, ballroom dance lessons are given. It's a place where people have fun and couples go there to learn. And obviously this weekend is Lunar New Year weekend, and there should have been a festival behind us with more than 100,000 people who were here during the day yesterday. And of course, today's continuation of that festival was canceled. This is supposed to be a joyous time for this community. Monterey Park is about 65 percent Asian according to the city's website, and you know, this is a huge holiday for this area, and there are plenty more celebrations going on both conducted by local entities, as well as private families and businesses throughout the area. The Sheriff is telling people please still go out and enjoy yourselves and feel safe about that. But in speaking to residents nearby, we know that they feel a lot more hesitation. We know that they are shaken by this tragedy and that some people who have lived here for a decade or two have never seen this kind of violence in Monterey Park -- Jim.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Jim. A law enforcement source tells me that this ongoing standoff in Torrance, California is believed to be associated with that Monterey Park mass shooting.Now, what we see from aerial footage from our affiliate there in Torrance, which is just about 30 miles southwest of Monterey Park where that incident took place is you see this white van that is there at a standstill, that's involved in some kind of standoff with law enforcement and this appears to be a white GMC or Chevrolet van. The reason we can't tell for certain is because it is hemmed in, bumper to bumper by police SWAT Bearcat vehicles. Now, what we saw at the outset was there was one Bearcat that was nose to nose with this white van, and then eventually you saw the second SWAT vehicle come in, and now they've essentially fully immobilized this van. We haven't seen any movement thus far. We've seen dozens of black and white police vehicles, since that time show up in and around that scene. Police, they have much of the area taped off. Our colleague, Paul Murphy is reporting that some of the businesses in and around this area are now in a state of lockdown. Now, again, we don't know exactly what is happening inside that van. We have not seen any movement since the standoff began. We have seen in incidents in the past, you know, you and I, Jim have covered so many of these mass shootings and incidents of violence that sometimes when suspects are actually confronted by law enforcement, sometimes they take their own life. So that is certainly a possibility here, but law enforcement, treating this, obviously, with great care. You have some of the officers that have been staged behind that Bearcat. You have officers who have been keeping a distance behind their patrol cars. And the first thing that they would want to do is try to open up some kind of line of communication with the person inside, again, assuming this is the suspect, they want to you know, make contact and order that person out. We'll have to wait and see how this actually transpires. It is worth pointing out to our viewers that CNN is not showing this image in real time. That is obviously for officer safety purposes. Bad guys watch television as well, and so this is on a delay, but we'll have to see how they actually finish this situation, as it's called, whether they bring in some type of explosive robot that, you know, is equipped with a camera that can pry inside that vehicle and give them more intelligence about what is happening, or whether we see officers actually stack up and move toward that vehicle to try to determine what's going on inside. But right now, time is certainly on the side of police. That vehicle is not going anywhere. It is, as I mentioned, it's been hemmed in by these tactical vehicles. And you know, I can tell you, Jim, there are a lot of questions we know about how this came to this point. Obviously, it's in a parking lot. That van is not parked in a particular spot where a vehicle would normally be. So it could be that law enforcement actually confronted this vehicle once they located it. You know, I was a FBI agent here in Los Angeles, and there are multiple jurisdictions, multiple police agencies in this region that share information in real time. There are law enforcement portals set up for one agency to provide information to a host of other agencies. We know from the earlier press conference in Monterey Park with the Los Angeles Sheriff, that there was a white van that was believed to be somewhat connected or associated or a vehicle of interest as the Sheriff described. And so that information being pushed out, certainly every law enforcement agency in the Los Angeles greater metropolitan area would be on the lookout for these types of vehicles. And so again, we'll have to wait and see why this specific vehicle whether they had additional information about the license plate and the like, it is worth pointing out that these Bearcat vehicles that you're seeing on your screen, these are not vehicles that are typically out on patrol, they would have to be dispatched to a particular scene for a particular reason. And so the question we have is, was that vehicle confronted by a local black and white officer who made -- you know, a police vehicle that made contact with it, and then they brought in additional tactical resources. A lot of that we'll have to wait and see. We are -- we have seen vehicle coming in with a trailer, so it could be that we're about to see that robotic scenario that I described. Again, they would use a robot to try to pry into that vehicle rather than a human being, because if this is indeed the suspect, we know that he is armed and dangerous, based on that just horrific tragedy that happened last night, and so they will be leaving nothing to chance. So we'll have to wait and see how this unfolds, but again, law enforcement source tell tells me that the scene that you're seeing unfolding on your screen in Torrance, about 30 miles southwest of Monterey Park, California is believed to be associated with that tragic mass shooting last night -- Jim.",

      "sentences": "We're looking at this these live or not live pictures, you said they were delayed pictures, but almost live pictures of what appears to be police personnel and tactical gear behind that Bearcat vehicle, the one that is nudging up against the back of that van, might they be preparing to do something more in terms of trying to figure out if the suspect is in that vehicle? Or is it possible that they've determined at this point that the suspect is not in the vehicle.It is strange how the van is parked, sort of in the middle of that parking lot, not really in a space or anything. So, perhaps it was abandoned? I guess we just don't know the answer to some of these questions. CAMPBELL: Yes, we don't, at this point. It looks as though the brake lights are on in the vehicle, and if you look at that image, we have, again, we can't tell the direction, obviously, the sun that maybe is illuminating those lights, but this vehicle came to a stop for some reason, and it became of interest. Again, a law enforcement source tells me this is believed to be associated with that Monterey Park, shooting, and so, after they got onto this vehicle, they were able to mobilize it with these tactical assets, and then after that, you know, again, time is on their side, unless the person inside poses a threat to the officers outside, law enforcement is going to slow down, they're going to take their time. Again, they're in the intelligence gathering phase now. They need to figure out who is inside. And again, you know, I can tell you again, having worked in law enforcement, you treat every encounter that you have, based on how a reasonable person would operate. If a reasonable person were confronted by police, they would stop, they would get out of their vehicle. You know, they would be questioned. It wouldn't escalate to this type of encounter, where now you see tactical assets immobilizing this vehicle. So again, that is another piece of information for police that they know that they're dealing with a person, assuming they're inside who is not willing to come out. And so again, the first thing they're going to try to do is open up a line of communication. If there is not a line of communication, if it turns out again, we don't know specifically. But if this turns out like we've seen in other incidents, where perhaps the person inside ended up taking their own life, then police will then eventually move to additional options to gather intelligence, and that could be, again, either bringing in those technical assets, possibly an explosive detection-defusing robot, or police, actually, which we've seen as well getting in a stack behind the shield going up to the car. But there is no reason for authorities at this point to rush in. As I mentioned earlier, our colleague, Paul Murphy was reporting that a lot of the businesses around the area were in a state of lockdown. So they want to ensure that the public is safe if this person inside the vehicle does pose a threat, but at least based on the posture of law enforcement, you see the SWAT officers there gathered behind the Bearcat. There is no reason right now to rush in, and so we'll have to see how long this goes. But I can be -- you know, I can tell you with great certainty that although the public sometimes gets frustrated, you know, why is this thing not over? The police, the longer this goes and no one is hurt, it is a good day for law enforcement. And so they're going to try to gather that information, try to ascertain what is actually happening inside. And then once the on- scene commander makes the decision that we're going to move in either with personnel or with technology, then they should get a greater sense of what's actually happening inside the vehicle. ACOSTA: All right, Josh Campbell, stay with us. I want to note to our viewers on the right side of your screen, you're seeing that there appears to be a press conference in the works in Monterey Park, California. So we're standing by for that. Let me go to CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. She joins me now She is the former Assistant Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. Juliette, before we talk about, you might have some thoughts on what we're looking at right now. I do want to point out what our colleague John Miller is reporting in just the last few minutes. Law enforcement sources telling CNN that preliminary information from the ground in Torrance, California is that the police attempted to do a car stop of a white cargo van which fit the description of a vehicle of interest from the Saturday night shooting. As they gave commands for the occupants to exit the van, they heard and believed the driver may have shot himself. They have now established containment of the van and it appears they may be moving towards a tactical approach to ensure that he is not alive and armed inside. And so that is coming from our John Miller, Juliette. That would explain why law enforcement is taking their time with this obviously.",

But it was -- remember it was only a few hours ago, I'm looking at my clock, maybe it was 11So he was clearly on the run, at least from that moment and didn't get very far. Thirty miles in Los Angeles, it may take a long time on a weekday. On a Sunday, if he had left after the shootings, he would be much further. So that's what we're looking at in terms of geography and in terms of tactics right now. I suspect, I heard you say, in my feed that they're setting up for a press conference. They are not setting up for a press conference, while they have that that van surrounded and do not know what's going on. That's another way of saying they're setting up for a press conference with anticipation that either the van was abandoned or the perpetrator is deceased. Those are the only options that they would have a press conference about.",

But those law enforcement personnel dressed in tactical gear behind that armored vehicle behind the white van.

We would assume that the community and the population are safe at this stage. We have been told and have reason to believe just based on what we know about the gunman that this is not a nationwide threat. This is not a threat to other events. The law enforcement and the community leaders have been very, very wise in promoting continuing celebrations to the extent one can in the surrounding areas. You do not want to have population including the AAPI population living in fear, and that is sort of where we are right now.

So representatives from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the District Attorney's Office and the District Attorney George Gascon is standing here with us, the Red Cross, the Department of Health Victim Services are at the center to assist the victims, survivors, and their families. If anyone believes their relative may be a victim, please contact representatives at this Victims Resource Center that I'm talking again about. And again, if you think that you have questions, you're upset, you haven't been able to locate a family member that you think is involved, please go out to this victim center and we will assist you, that's why we're there. At the center, we also have members from the Psychological Services Bureau from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. And as we go hour by hour, if we see any other needs, there are multiple agencies that have contacted us.

And as the Sheriff said, this is what the county does best, help provide assistance, mental health services, any kind of relief that is possibly and legally conceivable for us to provide. We are here to support all of the families in this community and help them in their healing. It is tragic what happened, but let's also think about the people who put their lives out there on stage every single day as well to protect us, our safety and wellbeing and also our physicians, the ones that I can tell you over at LSC USC, that are right now treating at least four of the other victims there. I also want to say that they have also devoted their service to help provide us in our community. The County's Office of Emergency Management has also been providing support and leveraging mental health resources at this very traumatic time, along with the City of Monterey Park, which as you know, and you can see, are very united and very resilient.

They're trying to make sure that there aren't any other suspects that may be connected with this mass shooting in Monterey Park, California. But in just the last several minutes, we do want to alert our viewers as we were listening to the Sheriff just a few moments ago, there was another law enforcement vehicle there that you can see sort of at the bottom of your screen, we are rolling the tape of this now, where you could see this black armored police vehicle, driving very slowly alongside both the passenger side and the driver side of this white cargo van. And I want to turn now to Josh Campbell and Juliette Kayyem. Let me go to you, Josh, first. Any sense as to what this vehicle was doing when it was passing this white cargo van? It looked as though they were perhaps trying to scan the inside of the vehicle? Perhaps maybe I've seen too many movies, but it looks like they were trying to ascertain whether or not the person inside that van is moving anymore. What more can you tell us?",

I'm told by law enforcement sources, this is believed to be associated with that Monterey Park mass shooting and now, they are going about the process methodically to try to determine who was inside, whether that person poses a threat, and we will have to see how long this goes. Again, law enforcement, certainly not on any timeline, so long as the person inside that van does not seem to pose a threat to them -- Jim.",

The only things I would add to it is also, the number one priority now is that there isn't -- there aren't any booby traps, either, anything that would get triggered, say by the opening of a door. We don't know how sophisticated the killer is, and so they are going to protect themselves.So they are also taking audio to make sure they're not hearing anything or any sound. So that's just basically the intelligence gathering side of this with drones and the vans and the pass by that we're seeing. And once again, you know, not only is it on delay, but this is not an aggressive police action right now, meaning either no one is in there or he is dead at this stage. So then back to the second press conference or the press conference that we heard. There were questions about why is this press conference happening simultaneously with what was happening in Torrance, and I don't need to defend or no one has to have an opinion. I think it goes to the challenge or the horror of what today means for the Asian-American community that this happened on the Lunar New Year. A friend of mine reminded me, for those who celebrate the Lunar New Year, it is believed that what happens on this day or yesterday sets the stage for the year, and that is why there is so much celebration. And so what you saw today with the Sheriff was predominantly an outreach to the community to help them feel that they can regain this year and this day and this horror, tell them what resources are available. The exact timing may not have been ideal, but remember, there are the victims, there's the investigation, but then there's a community who honestly may not even, you know, yes, we care what the motivation is, but it is a community that's been impacted on their day, on the day that matters most to them. So it is like July 4th, or it is maybe even like a High Holiday in the Jewish community and that is what that press conference was about.",

We want to caution our viewers, we're trying to take as much care as possible to not show things to the public that should not frankly be shown to the public in circumstances like this. But just to recap and remind our viewers, if you're just tuning in, what you're looking at, and that is LA County Sheriff's Department officers who are on the scene at a parking lot in Torrance, California about 30 miles away from the scene of the mass shooting in Monterey Park, California and just a few moments ago, an armored vehicle was going up and down the side -- the sides of that white cargo van presumably to make one final check that the person inside that van poses no threat to the community. And then in just the last several moments, we saw officers armed going up to the side of that vehicle, opening up the passenger side window after smashing out that window there. And now opening up the side doors there. We've gone back to that picture that we are showing to you right now. We don't know whether or not just yet whether the suspect was inside, you can see some contents of that van that were pulled out onto the parking lot sitting there on the ground as we speak.

And so now it is just now if there is a body in there, a self-inflicted wound, they will extract that body, and we will hear relatively soon. I'm surprised, I'll just tell you, just looking at this in real time, based on my experience that there are people in there now. Okay, so, it looked like they had abandoned the van. So here we are looking at this image. Now, I see this person here now. And so this is, we'll just wait and see who was in the car and their identification and then move back to, I think a very, very important part of this, which is the specter of what this means for that community. And that's what -- you saw that -- that's what we saw in those split screens. A sheriff talking to a community that is just completely impacted by this on their day of celebration and an investigation unfolding, and so we will see what happens in the next five to 10 minutes.
