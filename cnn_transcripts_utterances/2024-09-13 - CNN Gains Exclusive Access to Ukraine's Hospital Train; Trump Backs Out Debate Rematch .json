A video shows the group's truck in flames after coming under artillery fire on Thursday. The Red Cross says its staff was preparing to distribute cooking supplies to other humanitarian workers who were injured.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirms Russia has launched an operation to recapture its territory held by Ukraine. Moscow claims it has already taken back 10 settlements in the Kursk region. Ukraine says it's holding about 1,300 square kilometers of territory and about 100 settlements there. The Pentagon is describing the Russian counterattack as marginal. President Zelenskyy says it's in line with what Ukraine expected. All right, I want to bring in Michael Bociurkiw, who's a global affairs analyst and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. He joins me now from Odessa, Ukraine. Before we get into some of the issues, I just saw you were tweeting about explosions in Odessa. Give me a sense of the latest there and the mood there in Ukraine. MICHAEL BOCIURKIW, GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST AND SR. FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: Sure. Good to be with you, Kim. Yeah, it was a pretty scary night, about 2:30 local time. A big, big wave of Russian drones coming over the Black Sea towards Odessa. Air defense systems went into motion, which is why I'm able to talk to you now, which is why we have power right now. But it was all things considered, it was quite a big one. And yeah, the mood here. Look, there was a big conference here yesterday on Odessa's economic future and everyone's trying as much as they can to stay here, to make businesses work, to survive. But with this almost daily onslaught of drones and missiles, especially targeting power infrastructure, it's very, very difficult.

You may remember Kamala Harris in that debate with Mr. Trump brought up Polish-Americans living in Pennsylvania. Well, there's a big Ukrainian community as well, you know, big Baltic community. So I think the administration is signaling that we have your back, Ukrainians, Baltics, Polish citizens, and we will help Ukraine push back Mr. Putin.

TODD (voice-over): In an impassioned speech to justice employees, Merrick Garland said it's dangerous now for people at the department to simply do their jobs. And he condemned what he called the escalation of attacks against government lawyers, law enforcement agents and others. GARLAND: These attacks have come in the form of conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods, efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants by repeatedly and publicly singling them out, and threats of actual violence. TODD (voice-over): Garland never mentioned former President Donald Trump by name, but it was clear the recent actions of Trump and his allies fueled much of his frustration. TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": The former president definitely amped up the threats against the Department of Justice, and he has been threatening to put people in jail who work for the Department of Justice, who work for election offices, by threatening them with this idea that they were cheaters during the election. TODD (voice-over): Indeed, in recent days, Trump threatened prosecution and long prison sentences for election officials and political workers who Trump suggested could cheat in this year's election. The former president, posting on Truth Social, quote, \"When I win, those people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" It's part of Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the integrity of this year's election, even though there's no evidence of widespread fraud or irregularity in any recent U.S. election.
