The former Trump Organization accountant has been walking the jury through how Michael Cohen was paid back for allegedly buying the silence of Stormy Daniels in those closing weeks before the 2016 election.Paula Reid and Karen Friedman Agnifilo are back here with me. We've been watching all of these live updates that we're getting from our colleagues inside the courtroom. And one thing that's interesting that I think the prosecution is trying to undermine is an argument that the defense made in their opening arguments with a whole trial began for any witnesses to take in the stand. And they said, well, if he was paying Michael Cohen back for the $130,000, then why did he pay him $420,000? I should note. Donald Trump is walking in the courtroom there with his attorney, Todd Blanche behind him. He gave a thumbs-up to the camera. He didn't speak. But they have been making this argument, you know, why would we -- why did Mike -- why did they pay him back $420,000? It was only for $130,000. This witness though, right now is saying, well, here's why. Because we wanted to basically gross it up for tax purposes and he wanted a $60,000 bonus.",

      "sentences": "Yes, he was complaining about the bonus. And then there was other money that he had spent. My biggest question right now is where is the evidence linking the falsification of business records to the defendant?Because again, we've talked about hush money. We've talked about election interference. What he is charged with here is three, or four counts of falsifying business records. And as of now, McConney has gone through most of the timeline. Maybe they're going to get more documents more into the weeds. But as of right now, these checks are about to start going down to Washington for him to sign, for the then-President Trump to sign. And McConney even acknowledges, look, this was a new system. Suddenly, you know, Trump is in charge of the organization. We have to send these packages down so we can sign things. I have not seen evidence directly linking the defendant to the falsifying of business records. This is day 12. This is the witness besides Michael Cohen, who you would think might be able to provide that. So right now, again, I'm just reminded of the fact that federal prosecutors did not bring this case. Alvin Bragg even waited a while to bring this case. He is under enormous political pressure right now. And that is my big question as a reporter, where's the evidence?",

And it's not less strong if the evidence is circumstantial. Now here, you will have direct evidence of Donald Trump's involvement from Michael Cohen. But then they're going to argue that there's circumstantial evidence that corroborates Michael Cohen. And a lot of that is going to be what you're hearing from other witnesses about how he's a micromanager, about how he doesn't let go of money very easily.So clearly, he must have known what this was about. And I thought Adam Kaufmann made an excellent point earlier when he said, it can also be a bad an omission. Why didn't they charge that? That would have been a very strong charge if they had said, OK, fine, you're saying this was a camp -- this was a -- an in-kind campaign donation, fine.

And I want it to sort of catch us up on what is happening with this testimony by Jeffrey McConney. First of all, the vouchers are business records tied to several of the 34 falsifying business records charges against Trump. Trump's team is objecting to an exhibit. Lawyers are on the judge's bench.

We heard McConney say that if he didn't negotiate enough, Trump had said to him, you're fired. And then he said you weren't fired.

Whether they credit that will be the source of much controversy and much debate among the lawyers. But prosecutors will say Michael Cohen was the one who brought this right to Donald Trump himself.And second, to your point, Andy, lawyers are allowed to argue, and jurors are allowed to draw what we call reasonable inferences. Well -- I mean, the example that judges used to give in our courthouse was, let's say, we're in a room with no windows, let's say this courtroom, we had -- the windows were all drawn, and you saw someone walk in the back of the courtroom and they were holding a wet umbrella and wearing rain boots, and they were sort of -- you know, drops of water coming off, then you can -- you can infer from that that it's raining outside. You can't necessarily look outside and see that it's raining but when you see this guy walk in with an umbrella, you can think gee, that must mean it's raining. So, that's fair play too.
