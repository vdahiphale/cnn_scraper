At least one Palestinian manis dead violence in the West Bank surging this week following raids by the IDF in Jenin and after the killing of four Israeli settlers on Tuesday. Also in your headlines this hour there's new hope in the search for a missing submarine after banging was heard by rescuers, additional air and sea resources are being deployed to assist in the ongoing search near the wreck of the Titanic. Ukraine says it wants to make bigger steps in its counter offensive. Zelenskyy says Ukraine needs success on the battlefield to get more aid from its international partners. And self-proclaimed misogynist online influencer, Andrew Tate appeared in a Romanian court today after being indicted on rape and human trafficking charges. Palestinians are calling for urgent intervention from the U.S. and other countries after a spike in deadly violence in the West Bank. The latest outbreak happening a short time ago the Palestinian Health Ministry says a man was killed when hundreds of Israeli settlers attacked his village. And a Palestinian official says settlers attacked other areas in the West Bank overnight injuring dozens of people. This deadly escalation sparked by the shooting deaths on Tuesday of four Israeli settlers by Hamas militants. Hadas Gold back with us this hour from Jerusalem, Hadas?",

Then we have the Hamas attack that killed those four Israelis wounding four others them saying that's directly in response to what happened in Jenin and then the settlers overnight and into today just even the last few minutes last few hours, we're seeing more settler attacks, mostly concentrated on villages around the Israeli settlement of Eli, where that attack that killed those four Israelis took place. We are hearing, as you noted, of one Palestinian man being shot and killed. It's not clear yet who was responsible, whether it was any sort of police or military or whether it was the settlers who were there. We were there actually at the scene of this shooting attack and some of the villages that had been burned talking to villagers. And we actually as we were leaving, we were being warned that as the funerals were taking place for at least one of the settlers who was killed, that there could be more violence after the fact and that turned out to be true. But take a look at what some of the locals there told us earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GOLD (on camera): The attack started here at this Hamas restaurant that's part of a gas station complex just outside the borders of the Eli settlement in the occupied West Bank. The attackers came to this restaurant shooting through to the restaurant, killing the first of the three victims including two teenagers. The fourth victim was killed at the gas station that's just in front of us. Israeli officials saying that another four people were injured and say it was the work of two Hamas operatives who came here in a car. The first of the gunman was shot and killed by an armed civilian who happened to be on site and the second gunman managed to get away steal a car that triggered an hour's long manhunt by Israeli forces before he was cornered and shot and killed as well just north of here. But here at the scene, we are still seeing evidence of the bloody scene from the night before. We are seeing bullet casings on the ground medical gloves medical equipment as well as bloodstains and here on the restaurant itself you can still see it is riddled with bullet holes, including this one bullet hole that managed to make its way through and smash this window.

And that is really where the question lies. We're hearing from figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Security Minister, the far right flank of this Israeli government. And actually the Mayor of Eli told me himself, this is what he wants to. He actually told me that he is disappointed in Benjamin Netanyahu in the Prime Minister, because he feels as though not enough is being done. There's a question you know, we've been seeing these daily raids taking place by the Israeli military. They say they're targeting militants before they can carry out attacks while they're stockpiling weapons. But now there is a push for something much broader. And that's why I think you're hearing of a lot of people feeling as though they're already back into the Second Intifada, not only because of the level of violence because of what they fear what they think might be happening with a much bigger Israeli military presence in the occupied West Bank than what is currently already there.",
