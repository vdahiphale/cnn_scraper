She's got money, momentum, and no time to waste in picking a running mate as Trump's VP pick is facing major backlash tonight for his comments on so called childless cat ladies. I'm Kaitlin Collins and this is \"The Source.\"Tonight, after one of the wildest stretches that we have ever witnessed in a Presidential campaign, a debate implosion that effectively ended the President's quest for a second term, an assassination attempt on his challenger, the former President, and a new presumptive Democratic nominee, a new opponent for Donald Trump. The race for the White House is once again a tossup. Brand new polling from the New York Times shows that Vice President Kamala Harris is in a virtual tie with Donald Trump. Harris is quickly making up ground from where President Biden's numbers had actually fallen behind. And as for Trump and his part in all the polling that we're now seeing, he's actually seeing his favorable numbers increase to the highest point of his campaign. Of course, that comes after what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania. But really, the takeaway when you look at these numbers tonight, and again, it's just a snapshot, is to really make no mistake, this is anyone's race to win. Now, an unprecedented sprint is underway for Republicans to define the Vice President while she seeks to define herself on the campaign trail. And she says that she is eagerly awaiting a split screen with Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'll tell you, I'm ready to debate Donald Trump. I have agreed to the previously, agreed upon September 10th debate. He agreed to that previously. Now it appears he's backpedaling, but I'm ready. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're going to start tonight with our political sources, CNN Political Commentator SE Cupp, former Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin of New York, and also former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.

Let's do it right now, he said months before the actual debate. Gone is the discipline that Chris LaCivita had managed to hold Donald Trump to, you know, basically through the convention. That's all gone. So what you're seeing now is sort of a desperation, a panic, not really knowing how to handle her new entry into the race.

LEE ZELDIN, (R) FORMER NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN: I think that there are going to be debates. It's my personal opinion. As far as the details, there were two debates that were agreed to between the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign.

Look, if she can talk about the things that Democrats have always been strong on, health care, that the interests and needs of working people, labor unions, the things that, by the way, in that blue wall set of states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, talk about labor unions and the support that she has had for them, which Donald Trump cannot claim. There is so much here to work with. But I agree with SE's point. If the Vice President talks only about the problems with Donald Trump, that's not enough. She has a chance to do what Joe Biden honestly didn't do enough of, except for during the State of the Union, which is provide a positive, proactive vision of how she's going to change America and I think that will elevate her campaign.

There's nothing that Trump hates more than dull people. And J.D., I think, stands for just dull. And so he is not doing well on the stump for Donald Trump. He's hurting him. The memes on social media are killing him. The net negatives are terrible for the Vice President. The Vice President in a Trump campaign is supposed to get out of the way, and he has become an issue for Donald Trump. So he could have picked Nikki Haley or he could have picked somebody. But Trump is such a narcissist. He didn't want anybody taking credit for his electoral success. He didn't want somebody on CNN saying, yeah, he won that and Nikki Haley helped him. So he picked J.D. Vance and now he's got to live, at least for now, with this millstone on his neck. I mean, he may or may not make it to November 5, J.D. Vance.",
