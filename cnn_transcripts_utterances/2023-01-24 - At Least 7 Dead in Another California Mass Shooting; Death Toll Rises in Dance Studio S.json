California suffering its third mass shooting in just three days. The nation as whole up to nearly 40 mass shootings in 2023. This year is just over three weeks old right now. Just look at this map. Nearly 70 people killed already this month in mass shootings. Seventy people who were living on New Year's Day alongside friends and family, they're no longer here. This deadly month coming after America suffered 647 mass shootings last year. That's a significant jump from five or six years ago. One of those includes fourth graders inside their classroom. There are nearly 400 million privately-owned firearms in the U.S. That's 120 guns for every 100 Americans. No other nation has more civilian guns than people. In 2019, the number of Americans who died from gun violence was 18 times the average rate in developed countries. The U.S. is only developed nation to have mass shootings every single year for the past two decades. And remember last year alone, was -- it wasn't just one mass shooting; it was 647.
