We do begin in Israel, where the U.S. and Israeli officials are looking ahead to what comes next in Israel's war with Hamas. U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, says he had a, quote, \"intense, detailed conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\" and the country's war cabinet during their meeting in Tel Aviv Thursday. The U.S. wants Israel to shift from a high-intensity phase, to a more precise, targeted approach in the coming weeks. They say Washington is not focused on specific timeframes. Following these meetings in Israel, Sullivan is scheduled to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank, and that is in the coming days. Prime Minister Netanyahu, meantime, vows Israel will keep fighting until Hamas is completely destroyed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): I told our American friends, our heroic soldiers have not fallen in vein. Out of the deep pain of their having fallen, we are more determined than ever to continue fighting until Hamas is eliminated, until absolute victory. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You have the European Union. You've got 10, 15 years ago was quite skeptical about E.U. expansion, adding Ukraine to the table, and Moldova, which means there are now nine different countries, basically, at different stages now of the ascension process. And that commitment to multilateralism and to expansion is a great step forward for them. However, when you look at it, then, from the Russian perspective, you have a reluctance, and you don't have full support from all the membership on that. But even more than that, you have the reluctance from Orban to provide financial backing from Ukraine moving forward in the conflict, almost as if the question of accession is secondary. And the other aspect, through the eyes of the Russian president, Putin, is across the Atlantic and in the United States, you have a Congress that is incapable of agreeing on the level of funding it wants to provide as a way of opposing President Biden on this.

You're talking about years and years and years before that becomes a reality. Before they're able to align themselves to the very complicated and complex requirements that come along with membership. So in a way, you could say that that decision is -- is deferred. But for the European Union, I think it's absolutely crucial that they are moving forward with this at this particular juncture. Because we see international support for Europe, for Ukraine here, diminishing playing out in the United States and elsewhere.

They say that some of these Hamas members were looking for weapons and a weapons stash that Hamas has apparently been building up here in Germany, and they were tasked with bringing those weapons to the German capital to Berlin to then conduct terror attacks against what the Germans say are Jewish institutions, Jewish places in Europe.
