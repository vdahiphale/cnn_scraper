INSIDE POLITICS, the best reporting from inside the corridors of power, starts now. (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning. Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. Forty-four days out from Election Day. And Donald Trump is dealing with a down ticket scandal in North Carolina that he does not want to talk about. Yesterday, at a campaign rally there, the GOP nominee for governor, Mark Robinson, was nowhere to be found, and Trump made no mention of him or the bombshell CNN report that revealed Robinson made graphic and inflammatory comments on a porn website years ago, with the lieutenant governor, even expressed support for reinstating slavery. Instead, Trump, who had endorsed Robinson in the primary and had been a vocal supporter of his in the past, tried to draw the attention back to Kamala Harris. As both campaigns now battle for the dwindling number of persuadable voters and a race, that poll after poll says is a dead heat and time is running out. Early voting has begun in several states, and this week, mail in ballots will become available to voters in the key battlegrounds of Michigan and North Carolina. Now, as Harris stumped in Georgia and Wisconsin on Friday, Trump in North Carolina yesterday made this pitch to try to cut into Harris's significant lead, with women voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Thanks for being here. All right. Let's talk about this Trump comment first from this morning. He actually followed up from this late night Friday post on Truth Social, all caps, talking about women voters clearly on Donald Trump's mind. He said similar to what he said at the rally, you will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it always had to be with the states. Perhaps this is one reason why Trump is trying to change his messaging of sorts on this potent issue. He's down by 12 points to Harris among likely women voters, according to \"The New York Times\"/Siena poll. But is this a strategy that will be effective at this stage of the game?",

And new this morning, my colleague Em Steck and I have exclusive reporting about the Democratic candidate in the race, Angela Alsobrooks.A CNN review found Alsobrooks improperly took advantage of tax breaks. She did not qualify for, including one meant for low income senior citizens saving thousands of dollars in taxes on two properties. That's according to property records and tax bills reviewed by CNN. Alsobrooks saved about $14,000 in taxes on a property in Washington, D.C, from 2005 to 2017 by using tax exemptions meant for the district's primary residents, lower income residents and senior citizens, even though she's been registered to vote in Maryland since 1995. And according to state records, Alsobrooks also took advantage of a tax exemption meant for primary residents on a separate property in neighboring Prince George's County, Maryland, even after she started renting it out, that could save her at least $2,600. And she's a county executive there. Now, an Alsobrooks senior adviser told CNN the candidate was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both Washington and Prince George's County to resolve the issue. The adviser, Connor Lounsbury, said she's working to make any necessary repayments. He also said she actually has paid more in taxes than she had needed to on a third property. My panel is back. Did you follow these races very closely? Obviously, Republicans will probably make an issue out of this.",

I don't think this is the kind of story that you want to boost yourname I.D. in a competitive Senate race. And I think she's going to have to answer for it.

That's going to almost certainly flip because Joe Manchin has retired. That puts it at a 50- 50 Senate. Then they have all those battlegrounds and those blue states there that they have to hold, that includes Maryland. There are two potential pick-up opportunities, but those are long shots of sorts, Texas and Florida is going to be tough for them to flip. There is a ton of money being spent across the airwaves, Ohio being the top of the list. It's $67 million for the Democrats reserve for future ad reservations, $78 million for Republicans. There's a lot of money in Maryland, not as high as those on the list. Maryland $11 million so far, Democrats have spent compared to $7 million for Republicans.

And then they've got all of these other battleground states that are going to be hugely expensive media markets because of the presidential race where their candidates again, are either on defense or in open seats in very tough states.

RAJU: I can't remember a worst map for any party that Democrats have faced. But Democrats say that they have strong candidates. They can still hang on. We will see. They essentially have to run the table to keep it at 50-50. Then there's the question about what impact does Kamala Harris have on some of those red-state Democrats. You're talking about -- Molly was talking about Ohio and Montana. I caught up with the Montana Senator Jon Tester and I asked -- he's actually the one senator who is not endorsing Kamala Harris right now.

But the reporting that I've got up this morning is actually about what is happening legislatively around the country aside from these bans and these ballot initiatives, and how there were all these big promises that have made by anti-abortion activists and politicians and leaders who said once abortion is illegal, once Roe is gone, we will step up and do things about adoptions. We will do things about maternal health care, about childcare, and in basically no case has anything major been done. There're a couple of moves in Mississippi where the Dobbs case originated, and a couple of other states. But you look at, for example when Dobbs came out of the Supreme Court, a couple of days later, there was this congressman who said, we're going to have this Unborn Child Support Act.
