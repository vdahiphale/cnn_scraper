I'm ZainAsher in for Julia Chatterley, and wherever you are in the world, this is your First Move. Warm welcome to First Move, and here is today's need-to-know. Earnings at Wall Street's most important company, chipmaker NVIDIA, beat expectations, but the market wants more. We'll break it all down for you a little bit later on in the show. Also developing now, the Russian-born founder of Telegram under formal investigation in France for offenses related to messenger apps used for criminal and gang activity. We'll have the latest for you there as well. Lego wants to lose the oil. The toy-making giant's planning for a future without fossil fuels as its profits surge. And a story of sweet success for the founder of a candy firm whose tasty idea ended up in a Cardi B music video. That conversation for you coming up. We begin, though, with the earnings report that investors across the globe have been waiting for. The AI chipmaker NVIDIA, arguably the most important tech stock on Wall Street, is now out with its latest results. The company easily beating on second quarter profit and revenue, with sales up 122% from the year before. NVIDIA also raising its guidance for the current quarter, a sign that corporate demand for its high-end chips remains strong, though not as strong as some investors had hoped. It also announced a $50 billion stock buyback. Shares of NVIDIA are lower in after-hours trading, perhaps because the company's revenues did not rise as much as in previous quarters. And it's taking more to impress investors. But to put things in perspective, shares are still up a cool 160% so far this year. Dan Ives is joining me now. He's a Managing Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst at Wedbush Securities. Dan, thank you so much for being with us. So investors, of course, look to NVIDIA's results as a broader indication of AI-related demand. Just give us your take on the results we saw today.",

It actually shows that demand's accelerating in terms of underlying.

French prosecutors say that Telegram Founder Pavel Durov is now under formal investigation. He was detained for questioning Saturday at an airport just outside Paris. Prosecutors say the Russian born billionaire is under investigation for alleged criminal activity on the Telegram platform. They've been looking into Telegram's alleged complicity in things like illegal gang transactions, money laundering and Telegram's refusal to give information to authorities. Durov's bail was set at $5.5 million dollars. He's been prohibited from leaving France for the time being. CNN's Legal Analyst Norm Eisen joins us live now. Norm, thank you so much for being with us.

But even in the U.S., Zain, there's an exception for facilitating criminal activity. And that's what is confronting us here with the allegations. It's just an investigation. Mr. Durov has not yet been formally charged. The most serious allegation is facilitating gang activity that is criminal in nature that can carry up to 10 years in prison under the French penal code.

The list includes journalists from \"The Wall Street Journal,\" \"New York Times\" and \"Washington Post,\" as well as a number of government officials and university professors. Moscow is warning the list will be expanded in the future. Last year, Russia banned 500 Americans from entering the country as well. All right, I want to turn now to the Middle East, where Israel has launched its biggest offensive in the occupied West Bank in years. Palestinian officials say at least 10 people have been killed as the IDF carried out raids and airstrikes as well. Video shows bulldozers tearing up a street in the city of Jenin. Israel's Foreign Minister says the operation is meant to combat what he calls Islamic Iranian terrorist infrastructure, and he's calling for a Gaza-style operation. In turn, the Palestinian Authority is accusing Israel of violation and crimes. Nic Robertson has the reaction from Tel Aviv. Just in terms of what both sides are saying here, Nic, Israel says that it's rooting out militants from the West Bank, trying to thwart and prevent attacks. The Palestinians say that the Israelis are essentially trying to broaden the war and expel them from territories. Just give us your take on what's happening on the ground?",

So they're doing what they always do, which is preemptively try to take out the threat that they say is there. If you look back at what's happened over the past year almost, since October 7th, 622 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. That's a massive increase over last year, and that represents a significant security presence, and from the Israeli view, a deterrence in the West Bank. But what we've seen right now is some really specific allegations about Iran and a very significant force going to the West Bank. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTSON (voice-over): Before dawn, the biggest Israeli raid into the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began October 7th. Airstrikes near a cluster of northern towns, Tulkarm, Jenin and Tubas, backed by hundreds of troops and border police on the ground. The IDF says it's a counterterrorism operation intended to thwart what they claim is a systematic strategy in Iran to smuggle weapons and explosives into the West Bank. Outside Jenin, a drone strike killing three men in a vehicle, whom the IDF claim were terrorists, and seriously wounding another. Near Tubas, the IDF says another airstrike killed four terrorists.

It was the first of its kind in decades. Hamas, however, reacting to the raids, calling Palestinians to restart a suicide bombing campaign abandoned almost two decades ago. Unclear how long the operation will last, but by late Wednesday Palestinian officials saying ten people dead and more than 20 injured making it one of the most deadly days in the West Bank since the Gaza war began October 7th. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROBERTSON (on camera): And in the past hour or so, the IDF has released a video of what they claim was a terrorist headquarters. A drone flies into a room that they say is part of a mosque. You can see a lot of monitors on the wall. You can see a lot of pictures of men that the narrator says are terrorists of ones who've died. Those very much look like the pictures that some of the groups inside of the West Bank do put up of their fallen soldiers. So there's that. And on the other side of the room, the little drone swings around. And you can see equipment that could be used and the narrator says has been used for making explosives. And it flies further inside the mosque and there's more equipment. So the IDF is presenting evidence here of what they say that they've found of areas where the explosives they say were being or could have been prepared. We're also seeing on social media as well late into the evening some videos appearing to show some of these big diggers being targeted by big roadside explosives, big detonations, big explosions. I think there's a lot more to see that's going to come out of this. The real question is how big is it going to be? How long could it last? It could be really big.

So while also seeing other industries, like you mentioned airlines, if they go into this and they also push for it, I think that would actually probably give more momentum rather than less.

Now the company she started is worth millions. Bosch learned her trade from YouTube, spending months testing out candy recipes in her kitchen. She wasn't just boosting her cooking skills, she was also learning how to run a business. Now SmartSweets is enjoying sweet success. The company sold $2 million worth of candy in its first year. And less than four years later, Tara sold her company for almost $400 million. And Smart Sweets have been popping up everywhere. They even received a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo appearance in the Cardi B music video, Bongos. And here to bang her own drum, I'm joined live now by the Founder of SmartSweets, Tara Bosch. Tara, thank you so much for being with us. I have obviously your candy in my hand here. I have to say that it's not every day that you hear that a 25-year-old has sold a business for just under $400 million. And I remember when I first heard the story, this idea that you had sold your company at age 25 and made a whopping $360 million. I was honestly more impressed by the 25 than I was by the $360 million. And that is because you think about what it takes to run a business. You have to be able to manage people. You've got to be able to face rejection. You've got to be able to be scrappy, to think on your feet, to pitch investors. The list goes on. How on earth did you learn to do all of that when you started out at just 22?",

And that if we can kick sugar out of candy, people can actually enjoy candy as an everyday snack instead of a moderately enjoyed treat. So it was really just painting that picture of, you know, this is what's happening, whether you like it or not.

It's really just having the ability to step into your confidence to reach out and to try and to not be discouraged when people don't respond and to not take that personally, but just to be really putting on your bullhorns on and cutting through the noise.

More than 50,000 spectators were expected to be there in place to watch the ceremony and expected 300 million TV viewers as well watching the spectacle. Over 2 million tickets as well sold, Zain. And contrast that with the -- remember the wet, rainy conditions we saw during the recent summer games there in Paris. This is the historical part of it. This was the first time a Paralympics opening ceremony actually took place outside of a stadium. We had much pomp and ceremony, over 100 dancers and performances taking center stage. The parade of athletes as well, starting at the bottom of the iconic Champs-Elysees before making their way into the famed Place de la Concorde as well. The capital's largest square. We are expecting some really inspiring storylines, Zain, over the next 11 days of competition. There is much to look forward to, I can tell you.
