And so from an economic perspective, I think what that means is we need to strategically decoupled.Those industries that are so critical to America's security and economic vitality, semiconductors pharmaceuticals, we've become unbelievably dependent on global supply chains and particularly as it relates to China. Second, we need to put investment restrictions in place that stopped venture capital firms in the Silicon Valley from investing in artificial intelligence companies that work with the Chinese military or the Chinese communist party. That's madness given that we believe, I believe at least, that China is an adversary. The third thing we need to do is be much more proactive about creating the right kinds of alliances to check China's aggression, its aggression in geopolitical terms around the globe, and we can talk more about that. But that's the kind of -- it doesn't mean 100 percent decoupling. When I was on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, I'd go into one place, a manufacturing plant. And they say, listen, you know, China, the globalization is killing us. China's killing us. We got to stop the trade. I go to another and it was a Harley Davidson supplier, and they say, wait a second. China is a big market of Harley Davidsons. So I think there's a trade and investment that we can continue to have with China. It just can't be strategic in a way that undermines U.S. interest.",

One is go to the gym at home and the way we do that is through reforming our education system, through technology policy that makes sure we remain -- continue to have leadership, and through ensuring that we protect our data.But then in terms of China, we need to reduce dramatically this dependence and I don't think there's been a comprehensive whole of nation strategy for dealing with the adversary that China is.",
