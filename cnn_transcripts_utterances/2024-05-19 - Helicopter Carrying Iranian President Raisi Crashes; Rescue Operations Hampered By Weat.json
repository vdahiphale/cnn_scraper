A frantic search and rescue operation is underway in northern Iran after a helicopter crash involving Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. Officials say they have now detected the exact location of the crash site after hours of struggling to find it due to extreme fog and bad weather there.That crash happening early this morning after the president and other officials attended a ceremony for the opening of a new dam near the border with Azerbaijan. CNN's Nic Robertson is tracking all the latest developments from London and Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann is here in Washington with us with reaction from the U.S. Nic, let's start first with you and what we're learning about this search.",

      "sentences": "The search has been hampered because there's dense fog and that's the reason it's understood that the helicopter crashed in the first place. It's raining. I've been looking at video that's been posted on social media by some of the rescue services in Iran and the weather is absolutely atrocious there. The rescue team are sort of struggling up the mountainous hillside in rain. They're sort of leaning into the rain that obviously it's nighttime there and it's dark.So, although we understand from the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in eastern Azerbaijan, that province right up in the northwest of Afghanistan in the mountain, northwest of Iran in the mountains there, they say, although they say that they pinpointed the location, it's actually difficult it appears for them to get in there because it's mountainous. They have to get over high mountains to get their vehicles close. It's been raining a lot. It's the end of the rainy season. The roads are muddy. It's difficult conditions for the rescue workers to move in. There's medics. There's police. There's army. There's the elite Revolutionary Guard Corps. There's even mountaineers on the rescue and recovery team. And the reason that the IRGC says they've been able to locate the helicopter is they say they got a signal from the helicopter and they were able to get a signal from a cell phone that was aboard that helicopter. A few hours earlier, an Iranian official had said that actually had some sort of communication on a couple of occasions with a passenger on the president's helicopter and one of the crew members from the president's helicopter. And they were saying at that time that it appeared that the impact may not have been traumatic. But obviously, the concern is now the middle of the night, high mountains, we're talking close to 600 feet, some of those mountains. It's very cold. It's raining. It's foggy conditions. The Iranians have actually called on the Turkish authorities to lend them a helicopter with night vision to, again, better aid them to get into the exact location. So, anyone who survived a crash up there, and that's about 11 hours ago when this first all got triggered that the president's helicopter had gone missing, will have had to survive some pretty harsh conditions. So, the president -- the supreme leader in the country is calling on Iranians to pray for the president right now.",

But I think that, you know, there are a couple of things to keep in mind here.One is that we really know that the Iranian leadership is quite concerned, obviously, about looking like they are very, very much in control of this. I think that's why we're seeing this kind of unprecedented amount of transparency. They want to be seen as competent and they do not want to be seen as vulnerable. We've seen on social media that there are fireworks going off in parts of Iran celebrating a purported death of Raisi. So, you know, they're trying to warn both the public and also any adversaries, particularly Israel, that you better not dare, we're in control here.",

And look, any search and rescue have a significant reliance on a ground component. First of all, you want to know where it's located and if you can airlift something into that location, great.What we've seen is that that's not possible yet. So, the ground component is absolutely essential and it's been delayed. Any search and rescue, it's all about time. When you're notified and when you can get there to initially provide some first aid and then to try to rescue and evacuate personnel from the site. This is going to take some time. It's obviously at night. You're going to need the light of day. You're going to need this micro weather pattern to go away. They may launch aircraft, recovery aircraft like helicopters from a very nice piece of terrain and a very nice weather pattern. And then you get into one of these micro patterns and it's entirely different. So, a lot remains to be seen. And as Beth has indicated, it's all about at the strategic level to make sure that everybody understands, friends and the opponents, understand that they're trying to breathe through their nose as they go through this. But there is a lot that we do not know and won't know for a while.",

And as Beth noted earlier, Iranians are celebrating. I watch social media, I get a pulse on society on social media, and all the memes online are talking about celebrations.And I just want to highlight one example, Mino Majidi, who was killed by security forces during the Women Life Freedom uprising. Her daughters, who have since fled the country, are posting a video of themselves online celebrating with alcohol in the event that Raisi, the president, and the foreign minister have died in this plane crash.

And you know, this was just preceded by the attack in Moscow by ISIS-K. We warned them, and that still took place. They've had multiple kinds of natural disasters. They never do well.And so, I think that part of this is to really show that they are competent. And as Holly mentioned, you know, to try to put a veneer on, again, this idea that they know what they're doing and that people should think of them as a competent regime. But, you know, if he does end up being dead, we have really some rough days ahead of us in terms of Raisi. Even though he wasn't the decision-maker, he was this kind of point of just steadiness and the person who was going to help provide continuity for the Iranian regime through an upcoming succession of the 85-year-old supreme leader. And so, you know, the regime right now is going to be really, really careful because they know that things are going to be kind of rough in the coming days.",

We were just talking about the tinderbox situation in the region and the domestic situation on the ground. I think it's worth also noting that Raisi was seen as maybe being a top contender as the next supreme leader of the Islamic Republic.And that means that opportunity is gone. And yes, the political situation, domestic politics is not changing, but just the fact that this person that was a top contender for this role might shift the dynamics on the future of the Islamic Republic itself.

But since the war began in October, the Saudis have made very clear that they would not agree to that unless there was a credible irreversible pathway to a two-state solution.But as recently as this weekend, you have the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu making abundantly clear that he does not support the creation of a Palestinian state. Those discussions in Saudi Arabia, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, according to the Americans, brought with him to Israel to brief the prime minister on those and potential for what could happen if there was some kind of a normalization deal. What's interesting is that this normalization deal is also one of the demands that Benny Gantz, the opposition leader, is one of the demands that he is making, that more progress be made on that. But even Gantz does not support the creation of a Palestinian state, but he insists that the Saudis aren't necessarily asking for that. They are asking for the pathway to one. Of course, the situation in Gaza was also brought up, according to both the Israeli side of the meeting and the American side as well. The Americans said that they discussed ways to minimize civilian casualties there, and they also want not only more aid to be getting in, but they also want the Israelis to connect their military efforts there to some kind of an endgame, something that they have been pushing for for quite some time.

People were digging through the rubble with barely more than their bare hands. They don't have heavy machinery to get people out. And so, the chances of finding survivors in time are greatly, greatly diminished. We also got video from the morgue there where you have the floorliterally filled with bodies, some of them literally stacked on top of one another. And some are very clearly women and children. Of course, we know that some 800,000 people have fled Rafah seeking safer areas of Gaza. Some have gone to that humanitarian zone along the coast. But given the lack of infrastructure to accommodate that volume of people, others are trying to find safety in other places. Clearly, they did not find it here. Some bystanders say that people who were there, some of them had recently come to Rafah. What exactly -- or come from Rafah, I should say. What exactly were the Israelis trying to hit in this strike?

Of course, President Biden still confronting that war in Israel between Israel and Hamas. And that conflict was something of a backdrop for the speech that the president delivered earlier today in Atlanta at Morehouse College. There had been some controversy ahead of the president's visit there. Some students and some faculty disagreeing with him, certainly on his approach to Israel and the broader sort of conflict that's unfolding there. There were thoughts that there could have been protests at the speech. In the end, the president's speech was not interrupted although some students did turn their back on him while he was speaking.

And so, it really does kind of raise the question. Now, if you look at what has been happening, as with Black voters, Trump has been gaining among Latino voters in almost all polling largely because of discontent about the economy and inflation.

It's the subject of movies and books. And sometimes, the stories are rooted in real life. CNN's Randi Kaye takes us back to 1990s Boston for a closer look at one of the biggest art heists ever. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Eighty-one minutes. That's how long it took to pull off the biggest art heist in history. It was St. Patrick's Day weekend, 1990. The two thieves posed as Boston police officers and convinced one of the security guards at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum to buzz them in. It was about 1:30 in the morning. UNKNOWN (voice-over):  The path is interesting. They took the guards after they handcuffed them and taped them and brought them into the basement. About 24 minutes elapsed before we see them again. KAYE (voice-over):  Motion detectors placed throughout the museum picked up their trail for nearly an hour and a half.",
