That was really top of the agenda here.But Zelenskyy also took the opportunity during his meeting with Austin and publicly earlier today to thank President Biden for making that policy decision to allow Ukraine to use American weapons to strike into Russia directly in order to fend off those strikes from Russia that are hitting Kharkiv in northern Ukraine. That was really key moment for President Zelenskyy, something that he has been a pushing for for quite some time now so that the Ukrainians can effectively defend themselves. But really, one of the biggest themes here that Zelenskyy was trying to push was the idea of a coming together, of all nations, for this peace summit that Ukraine wants to hold in about two weeks' time. He said that over 100 countries are going to be joining this peace summit where formula for peace and for the end of the war between Ukrainian and Russia will be discussed. And that includes a formula for nuclear security, additional food security, as well as a plan to get the roughly 20,000 Ukrainian children that Ukraine says Russia has kidnapped since the beginning of the war back to Ukraine, back to their families. And the key message, of course, was being sent to China because China, according to the U.S., according to the U.K., is actively supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine, is providing support for its defense sector. And so, Zelenskyy was trying to convey this message to the Chinese that if they say that they care about territorial integrity, about international law as they do when they repeatedly talk about Taiwan, for example. And he says that they need to step up and stop supporting Russia and join Ukraine at this peace summit, where the United States, notably, is not necessarily going to have a major presence. President Biden, for example, has not committed to going to that peace summit yet, but this was really an opportunity for President Zelenskyy to meet with key allies here in Asia and try to get their support for ending this war. And it's something, of course, that he spoke to Secretary Austin about as well earlier today is a bilateral security agreement between the U.S. and the Ukrainians. If this war does not end soon, what kind of assurances can the U.S. actually give Ukraine? They will support them for as long as it takes really until this war finally comes to an end.

And the only reason that that's important is that if you had a crisis underway and you needed some crisis communications to deconflict U.S. and Chinese forces, you want to have some kind of open channels. But the fact of matter is just last week, the Chinese did some pretty aggressive exercises all around Taiwan, even on basically the far eastern coast furthest from China. And that was a demonstration of force after the inauguration of the new Taiwanese president. I would say that at this point, the military relationship is pretty bad.

And we've heard a lot of the allies, including Egypt, say that they were behind it as well. So, the effort here is to both build pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to agree to something whose outlines his war cabinet has approved. And also, to build pressure on Hamas, which has never actually accepted any kind of an agreement that would involve both release of hostages and the ceasefire. It's a three-phase plan.

On Saturday two of those computers gave the green light. The third either was too slow to respond or there was some issue there. And so, that's what triggered the automatic hold. And because this way an instantaneous launch window, meaning that NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams had to launch it this exact time in order to sync up and rendezvous with the International Space Station, that automatic hold is what triggered the scrub. And so, now those two astronauts going back into quarantine. And NASA saying that they are going to try again on June 5th followed by a backup date of June 6. So, definitely a disappointment.

You know, this recent threat by, you know, ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K has really elevated concerns by law enforcement both at the federal state and local levels. And it's how they're assessing this threat. So, I want to just walk through why this is such a concern.When law enforcement analyzes a threat, they look at really three main categories, motivation which is the underlying reasons for an attack, the opportunity which is a moment in time or an event that a hostile group could exploit to engage in an attack, and then really the capabilities. Can they actually do it? Can they carry out an attack in a certain region? When you apply this assessment criteria to the threat that we're seeing come in from ISIS-K, a lot of red flags go off for law enforcement. And that's why you see them uh really vocalizing what they're doing. We know that a motivation of ISIS-K is really to promote their extremist ideology, and in turn attract new recruits. The opportunity for them to launch an attack is really this prime event. This is, as you said, it's the Super Bowl of Cricket. It's the second largest most popular sport in the world. So, you know, this is really a great target of opportunity. And then when you think about how law enforcement is concerned as you said about the ideological appeal motivating homegrown violent extremists and specifically that lone wolf, it's in that context that ISIS-K has the capabilities to potentially launch this significant attack. So, from a threat perspective, what law enforcement is really concerned with is, you know, can they do this? There is a potential.",

The Madrid bombing in 2002 was near the football stadium.So, is it possible to secure all of the venues related, hotels, restaurants, parks nearby, even if they don't go after the stadium on the 9th?",

He's collaborated with University of Wisconsin research scientist Dr. Leigh Orf who utilizes one of the world's most powerful supercomputers to simulate the same twisters. DR. LEIGH ORF, RESEARCH SCIENTIST, UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN: He's capturing some of these low-pressure areas around the storm, little tiny worlds that probably last about five seconds. And you can see the same thing going on in my simulation. VAN DAM (voiceover): Pairing up Dr. Orf's animations with Hank's stormchasing footage provides clarity and realism that gives scientists confidence in their models and hopefully the detail needed to put the last pieces of the puzzle together. SCHYMA: That's another thing that I think these simulations can really help is we need to figure out why one storm is dropping these big tornadoes and why another one is not.
