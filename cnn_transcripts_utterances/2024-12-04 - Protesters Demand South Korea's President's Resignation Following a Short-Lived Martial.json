It is 5 p.m. in Seoul, South Korea, where opposition parties have submitted a bill calling for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk-Yeol.Protesters are gathered outside the National Assembly one day after Yoon abruptly declared martial law only to withdraw the order a few hours later. The demonstrators as well as the country's biggest labor union want him to resign. Yoon's decree sparked clashes between security forces and lawmakers trying to get inside parliament to vote down the measure. The President said he declared martial law to protect against anti- state forces and threats from North Korea. South Korea's opposition party leader who ran against Yoon in the 2022 presidential election live-streamed himself climbing over a fence to get into the parliament building. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout is following all the latest developments for us. She joins us now live from Hong Kong. Good to see you again Kristie. So, what is the situation in South Korea right now after the President dropped his martial law order?",

President Yoon declared martial law. He accused the main opposition party of anti-state activities and sympathizing with North Korea and the backlash was fast and furious. The move sparked demonstrations and I want to show you this viral video and in this video, let's bring it up for you, you see a woman fighting with and tussling with an armed soldier outside the National Assembly. This is the parliament in South Korea and she shouts at the soldier, let me go and when the soldier walks away, she yells at him, aren't you embarrassed? Now this is video that has gone viral. It's been seen and shared about seven million times on the social platform X. Now lawmakers, after these scenes, they voted to block the martial law decree and then early in this day, on Wednesday, President Yoon was forced to lift it. Now resignations have been submitted by the President's chief-of-staff and more than 10 senior secretaries. Lawmakers are calling for more. In his statement to reporters on Wednesday, we heard from the leader of the ruling party, the People's Power Party. He apologized to the public and called for the defense minister to be fired. Let's bring up that statement for you in which he says this quote, \"the President must directly and thoroughly explain this tragic situation. The minister of defense who recommended this martial law should be immediately dismissed and all those responsible must be held strictly accountable,\" unquote. We also heard, of course, from the main opposition party, they've been calling for Yoon to resign or face impeachment. And in a statement from a senior Democratic Party M.P., we heard this, let's bring it up for you, quote, \"Even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down. Now workers from the largest umbrella union in South Korea, they have been protesting this day in downtown Seoul, and they say they will continue to do so until the President steps down. This is South Korea's biggest political crisis in decades. President Yoon may have lifted martial law, but questions are swirling about him, about his political faith, and also what will happen next in South Korea, one of the world's most important economies.

And ever since South Korea's democratization, South Koreans are expecting democratic processes for all political decision making.

And what's also mysterious is that, you know, we've heard reports that even his closest aides, even his cabinet members, even his closest allies in his own party were unaware of this plan. And seeing the footage of how martial law was enacted at the National Assembly, there are many political commentators, even legal commentators are scratching their heads wondering, is this actually martial law or not? Was this really a well-conceived, well planned, well prepared plan? And so there's still so many question marks.

And this is something that really is, is, you know, curious for many of his supporters, too. And, you know, it really has ruined not only his credibility at home, but also his credibility and his reputation as a symbol of democracy overseas as well. And so it really, you know, his forward leaning foreign policies, the fate of those also remain in question. They perhaps are even bleak. We're, you know, we're hearing reports already of, you know, meetings and signature initiatives, meetings over his signature foreign policy initiatives being postponed indefinitely. And so, you know, we're, the country here in South Korea, the political leaders, they're trying to scramble to restore some sort of order so that there is no chaos.

That's because over the course of the last week, we have seen near daily accusations of violations of the ceasefire on both sides of the equation.And the past 48 hours have seen an uptick in violence between Israel and Hezbollah. On Monday night, after Hezbollah fired two rockets towards Israeli occupied territory, Israel responded with a series of airstrikes that resulted in the deadliest day in Lebanon since the beginning of the ceasefire. Nine people were killed in Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon, but they are not the only airstrikes that we've seen from Israel. Every single day of the ceasefire, Israel has actually carried out some kind of airstrike. They say that they are doing so in order to enforce the ceasefire, claiming that those strikes were targeting Hezbollah operatives who were violating this ceasefire agreement. But we do know that not only has the Lebanese government accused Israel of violating the ceasefire, but also U.S. and French officials who are part of this monitoring mechanism have raised serious questions with Israel about these potential violations. There have also been concerns about the fact that Israel appears to be flying drones very low over Beirut, which could also be a violation of this ceasefire. A source with UNIFIL says that there have been more than 100 Israeli violations of this ceasefire over the course of the last week. And now there is a new warning from the Israeli defense minister, Israel Katz, who is saying that should this ceasefire break down, should Israel return to a state of war with Hezbollah, then this time will be different. Israel will not only strike deeper into Lebanese territory, he says, but will also go after the Lebanese government itself, meaning not just going after Hezbollah targets, but also going after the Lebanese government, the Lebanese military, which would be a dramatic escalation of this conflict. Now, that's not something that we're foreseeing right now at this stage. It seems like the political will is still there to maintain the ceasefire. But the question is for how long as we watch this very fragile moment of this truce. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He spoke as well about Russia's increasing reliance on Iran and China for support, financial as well as military.These are not new themes, but the way that it's being framed at the moment is an expansion of Russia's war efforts.
