      "sentences": "Day Two of our coverage live from Mongolia's Ulaanbaatar. I'm Richard Quest.Look at the markets, and we will be talking about how democracy is facing this country. Let's look at the markets, and you'll see what's happening there. Things are down, I'll go into great explanation, but as the program wears on, we're off over 234 points. It has been a strong decline over the course of the afternoon. We have an hour left to trade and it will be interesting to see how that progresses. What we will be talking about here in Ulaanbaatar, we'll have a one-on-one with the Mongolia house speaker, we will discuss managing the internal problems and making the democracy less fragile. The budget conscious consumers are turning to Walmart, the world's largest retailer, as we have results. We'll talk about that. Grocery sales, e- commerce is all driving growth, and it is called the Ger, no not yurt Don't call it that. I'll explain why. But it is called a Ger. It's the traditional national dwelling. It's still popular. I take a look inside these residences to see how comfortable they actually are. It is Thursday, it is August the 17th. I'm Richard Quest in Ulaanbaatar, where of course, you better believe it. I mean business. A warm welcome to our day to coverage from Mongolia, a special series that we have here, that was last night, tonight, and we'll be here tomorrow night as well, talking to the decision makers and finding out this extraordinary resource rich country, which finds itself slap, bang wallop in the sandwich between Russia and China and yet sitting on vast amounts of resources. But tonight, we're going to focus -- we did the economy and the resources last night. Tonight, we focus on the country's role in the world, the strategic significance of Mongolia, which is greater than you think when you realize just the potential of the country, the challenges within on beyond are truly a tremendous way. If you've got the bear to the north and the dragon to the south, as you can see from this map, then you end up with the wolf economy in the middle. It's a young democracy that is trying to build institutions with a government that came to power in 2021 and faces an election next year. But because it's surrounded by these non-democratic countries, the internal challenges are tremendous. The protests last year were over a corruption scandal, when around 400,000 tons of coal went missing. Well, the source of the export revenue that they did generate, and obviously it didn't really go missing, but it was sold and the money went somewhere else. It was the money that went missing until they found it, and then they found those people who had taken it. Anyway, you can imagine. Eight people were arrested, eight officials were arrested and it rocked the government because the people basically said that democracy at the moment isn't working for us. So I spoke to the chair of the Mongolian Parliament who joined me earlier today. He told me even without Russia to the north, China to the south, he is most concerned about the internal problems that are making this democracy perhaps too fragile. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

He says they must work with next door neighbors, of course, the North and the South, Russia and China and to that extent, in June, the Prime Minister was in Beijing to meet with Xi Jinping.

Shoppers are a little bit squeezed right now, so they are pulling back on some of the general merchandise that Walmart sells home goods, clothing, some of these more expensive items.
