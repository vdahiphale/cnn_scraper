Also, it affects some of the rules and changes that the FDA had made about when exactly in a pregnancy this can be used.But this morning so far, the White House simply saying they're going to continue this legal fight.

But really the White House and the Biden administration is quite limited in what they can do beyond just fighting this in courts. There's not much that the president can do on his own to try to protect the full access to mifepristone. We've heard of some of the Democratic governors in various states trying to stock up on these pills in the event that the FDA does suspend approval, and the White House has really pushed back on this suggestion by some that the FDA just simply ignore this ruling from that Texas judge.So I think over the course of the next day, we should have an idea of how the Justice Department is going to act, whether they will try to take this to the Supreme Court immediately or just wait and let the appeals process play out.",

He had been doing so at a faster clip than the former president.One of the issues that they're going to run into with this request is it's going to require a resolution to be passed, which typically at the start of a Congress, that goes through unanimously. But this could be an opportunity where Republicans maybe try to block it. We don't know how Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is going to act on this. He has a history in the past. If you think towards the end of the Obama administration, he really had stalled and blocked some of his nominees, which then created vacancies for former President Trump to fill.

It's probably, again, going to be hundreds of thousands who are going to protest against that proposed pension reform bill.And we say that, and of course, the key to that pension reform bills is they want to raise the pension age from 62 to 64. But a lot of French people are coming out here today because they're angry at the way that the French President Emmanuel Macron is pushing this law through, essentially used executive powers for that, bypassing a vote in the parliament. And it's quite interesting because you can see here that lots of folks who are coming out on the street, a lot of them are older folks, folks of trade. But a lot of them are also younger people who are just extremely angry at the way the French president is doing this. It's becoming a big problem for him, Macron. Many people are already referring to him as a lame duck president. He is in the first year of his second term, he's still got a lot of time ahead of him. But he has lost a lot of popular support because of the way that he is trying to push through this pension reform. And, of course, that's led to a lot of these protests. It's also led to some of the violence among the protesters. In fact, earlier today, there was a group of protesters that actually stormed the headquarters of the largest luxury goods maker here in this country, for instance, that makes Louis Vuitton handbags, stormed the headquarters and actually occupied that building for a while.

So, we are expecting the Former President to arrive probably a little bit later this hour for his second deposition with the New York Attorney General's Office. And, you know, as you said, at the first deposition last August, he asserted his Fifth Amendment right against answering any questions and self-incrimination more than 400 times. That was before the Attorney General's office filed that lawsuit. That lawsuit was filed in September, and now, they're doing all of this pretrial work. And as a part of that, the New York Attorney General's Office has asked Trump to come in for a second deposition.Now, the question here is will he answer any questions this time? There are a couple of different factors that plan or could be some strategic decisions being made here. The Former President as a defendant in this case and having asserted his Fifth Amendment the last time, that's something that a jury could hold against him. It's called an adverse inference. So, if you know by the jury could look at him not answering questions and say, OK, that, you know, is that goes against him? If he does answer questions this time, you know, they already know the 400 plus questions that he was asked. The last time they also already know what he's been charged with having done wrong, so they can prepare in a different way for this. If they choose to answer our questions, and they can answer some, they can answer none, they can answer a combination. It's really up to him when he's in there shortly this after, you know, in a few hours. He will be behind these doors behind us and be sitting there across the table from likely the New York Attorney General Letitia James herself. She was there the last time, she introduced herself, they greeted each other and then she turned it over to her top investigators working on this case. You know, of course, though, there is a gamble, the Manhattan District Attorney's office which just brought the indictment against Trump, they are still investigating the accuracy these financial statements. So, anything he says today if he doesn't answer your questions, is something that they could look at for their investigations, Don.",

      "sentences": "Truly, yes, right, exactly. 20 to 25 inches of rain is rare and historic for southern Florida. And this is the type of rain that southern Florida would experience in a high-end hurricane for instance. Now, the National Weather Service, using that one-in-1,000-year event terminology. And basically, this means that the probability of this happening in any given year is very, very low. It's like winning the lottery, could it happen? Yes, but it's extremely rare. Would it happen tomorrow? Very unlikely, look at how the storms kind of formed and trained over the same location right over this heavily populated Fort Lauderdale region. And by the way, we have the potential that we broke a 24-hour state rainfall record which was set back in 1980 in Key West. Climatologists will be on site to analyze the data and assess the information. But we still have flood watches and flood warnings for Fort Lauderdale, Miami-Dade as well as Broward. It's all thanks to the storm system, as if warm front lifts northward is going to trigger more thunderstorms today that could be severe.And we could see some localized flash flooding as well, another one to two inches of rainfall possible. Just incredible video coming out of this area, look at this aerial video of downtown Fort Lauderdale of stalled-out vehicles. Now, the National Weather Service has a slogan, turn around, don't drown. This is what they mean, six inches of water on a roadway can stall a vehicle. 12 inches of water on the roadway can actually float an entire car but 24 inches of flash flooding water, that can actually tow away an entire SUV.
