So my camera man's perched up on a balcony while I bring you this ground level view of one of the main thoroughfares here in Jenin camp. As you can see, it's completely torn up. Piles of rubble everywhere. The streets turned to mud and, for many families, many residents walking around, this is the first glimpse they are getting of their own homes, that they are getting of their own neighborhoods. Because they were forced to flee in the fighting. They were forced to flee when this massive incursion began. And I want you to get a sense of the sheer force of that. Take a look at this vehicle, take a look at what has happened to this car. You see those kinds of images, these vehicles, seems repeated all across this camp. We understand from the Palestinian Red Cross that some several thousand people have now been made homeless by this Israeli raid. What's even more extraordinary Eleni, I know you have those pictures to show our viewers, is that people still feel this is a place of defiance and resistance. The streets earlier today were filled by thousands of people attending a funeral, a burial for those killed in Israel's raid. Israel says that it was taking out a terror network, that it was dismantling weapon sites  it was neutralizing terror sites, what they called a terror hub here in Jenin. But the Palestinian armed factions you see, again, in that video, that you have seen marching through those funerals saying they are resisting, fighting occupation. And they will continue to do so, even though Israel says they reserve the right to come back anytime.",

This was something which was a last-minute decision. And Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said yesterday this was not a one-off, saying, they will go back in if they feel that Jenin is once again a safe haven for militants. Regarding the casualty count, one Israeli soldier killed, 12 Palestinians killed, more than 100 injured. Now the Israeli military has told me that they think all 12 of those killed are what they are calling combatants. They said no non-combatants were killed. We are hearing from some of the militant groups claiming at least some of them as their fighters. Not all of them but some of them. I think what is interesting -- also I should note the Israeli military is acknowledging civilians are among the more than 100 injured. But what is interesting is what we are seeing from the funeral today. Two things I thought were interesting, from those images of the funerals. One is the presence of the militants. The militants were out on the streets. They were masked but showing their flags. They had their weapons with them, guns with them. I think that is definitely a show of defiance, a message to the Israelis, saying, you tried to dismantle us but here we are, the day after, the day that you guys withdrew from Jenin. Here we are, back out on the streets. Another thing that was interesting from the funerals is that the Palestinian Authority officials were actually chased out of the funerals by crowds, who were yelling at them, \"out, out.\" That is an indication of the anger at the Palestinian Authority. It shows you the Palestinian Authority does not seem to have much authority in Jenin. The Israeli military, of course, is now going on a regular basis. It goes to show you how Palestinians on the street feel about the situation right now. And that, of course, contributes to the reason why you are seeing these militant groups rising up. I don't think this is now over, the Israeli military operation might be over but the story of this ongoing violence, this cycle of violence of the Israeli military raids, attacks on Israeli spy Palestinians, this is just going to continue. The question will be, will continue in Jenin, will it continue across the rest of the occupied West Bank? There will be a continuation to it in some form. Eleni.",

I want to go back to Salma. Salma, it is really great to have you on the ground, giving us that perspective. I think the images that are striking today, this is what we have seen yesterday, during the incursion, was that the streets were very quiet. We had thousands of people who had to leave. And as you say, people are now coming back and picking up the pieces. I want you to give me a sense of the mood right now and, as Hadas says, defiance perhaps from militants, even attending the funeral, really interesting to see all of these different perspectives here.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And we were in the middle of those funerals that my colleague Hadas was talking about. We could pull those images back up foryou. She is absolutely right. You saw several Palestinian factions, flags up, proudly shooting celebratory gunfire in the air. Some have claimed some of their dead, particularly the Jenin brigade claimed several as their own. I spoke to one father of one of the young men who was killed in this Israeli raid. He made no secret of it. He said, my son was a fighter, a member of the armed resistance and I am proud of him for that. He told me his son was just 19 years old but that he had vowed, ever since he was a young kid, that he would do nothing but fight for the rights of his people, in his father's words, to fight against the occupation. Again, in his father's words. In the wider context here, it is important. When you look at Jenin camp, when you look at this damage and destruction, you have to understand, before this Israeli raid happened, this was already one of the poorest, one of the most marginalized communities in the West Bank, which is already a very marginalized place. There is little hope, little future here. So for many of the young people, growing up in areas like this, subject to raids like this, you can understand that resentment and anger that we saw today on the streets is only fueled further by these Israeli raids. I don't think anyone here has any doubt the Israeli military will come back, will carry out another incursion at some next point. But what is extraordinary is hearing from other people. They still believed that standing up, the form of resistance that they saw, the funerals today where those Palestinian factions were still out in force, shows they are unbowed, unbroken by the Israeli military despite the damage and destruction and havoc that you see.",

It is quite high and warned of catastrophic consequences. Both Kyiv and Moscow frequently accusing each other of plotting attacks on the plant. President Zelenskyy sat down for a wide ranging, exclusive interview with CNN's Erin Burnett recently in Kyiv. He says the Russian president's response to the Wagner mutiny led by Yevgeny Prigozhin was weak. I want you to take a listen.

We know from our intelligence reports that Kremlin was conducting all of those surveys; 18 or 19 regions of Russia firmly supported Prigozhin's actions; 21 regions of Russia firmly supported Putin.

CNN traveled to the plant in April. There, we saw some of the facilities used to filter and dilute the water. While there will be remnants of a radioactive element, known as tritium, it falls under the international standards according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan wants to gradually release more than 1 million metric tons of filtered water in the Pacific, part of the process to slowly decommission the plant. Still, not everyone is convinced this is the right thing to do, including the Chinese government. It is a topic which came up at a recent briefing at its ministry of foreign affairs.

And lining the route, you will see huge crowds of people, of course, thousands of supporters have come out for a glimpse of the king and queen. But also protesters. They were very audible, particularly as King Charles and Queen Camilla got out of the car as they arrived at St. Giles' Cathedral. You could hear the chants of \"Not my king,\" from various protest groups. There's the antimonarchy group Republic, which is a U.K. wide group. There's also a Scottish one called Our Republic. Those chants were audible even over the national anthem, which was played pretty loudly. So I imagine the king and queen would've heard that. An interesting one particularly in Scotland of course, because the ruling party is the Scottish Nationalist Party. They have long maintained that an independent Scotland, one day, they hope, will make a choice on whether they want to be a monarchy or have a republic.

There are more guns in the United States than there are people and obviously that poses a significant challenge to public safety. As far as the wave of mass shootings we have seen over the last couple of days, there are different motivations. For example, in Philadelphia, it appears, in that mass shooting, the suspect was shooting randomly but had multiple weapons, multiple rounds of ammunition, was going on this shooting rampage, trying to kill as many people as possible. Eventually, that suspect was taken into custody. But in other cases, like Ed Lavandera mentioned, in Ft. Worth, where you have shootings after these gatherings, obviously, 4th of July type celebrations, supposed to be communities coming together but you also see time and time again people settling disputes with their guns and firing. Oftentimes it is innocent bystanders who are obviously victimized by this. So for our viewers around the country -- excuse me -- from around the world, this is why we have seen many nations issue travel advisories for people when they come to the United States because we have seen time and time again, that no place appears to be safe, whether you are out in public, business, restaurants.

We have also seen-- this is more on the progressive side of the aisle -- a lot of progressive district attorneys coming under fire for not prosecuting cases, where you have someone who illegally has a weapon.
