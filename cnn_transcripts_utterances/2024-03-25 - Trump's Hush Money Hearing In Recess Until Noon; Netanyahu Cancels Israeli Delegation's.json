He said, in fact, it wasn't obstruction. He thought the people though -- the government went above and beyond what they had to do in order to provide these documents that Trump's lawyers are trying to get from the federal prosecutors who were bringing their case against Michael Cohen five years ago.And so, you know, he's really pressing Trump's lawyers to try to defend why they were seeking this relief now. And he said he was detecting a pattern. And this pattern was that the judge said he would read a case and read it one way, he would see facts and interpret them one way, and Trump's lawyers would interpret them repeatedly in a different way. And so, he was saying he didn't really understand why that was happening. So, signaling that he is not believing Trump's side of this, and he doesn't see based on the evidence before him. He said he read through all the materials, all of the correspondence between the prosecutors both at the state level and the federal level, and Trump's lawyers. and didn't see the facts to support Trump's claim that there was some kind of prosecutorial misconduct. You know, Trump during this whole time has been sitting at the defense table. He's been largely either leaning forward or leaning back listening to the arguments pretty intently, looking over at the attorneys, you know, whispering at times to one of the lawyers who were -- who's working with him. But otherwise, he's been pretty quiet. You know, the judge kind of surprisingly, took a 45-minute break. It's unclear if that's a signal that he is going to make some kind of determination since he has laid out pretty clearly that he doesn't think Trump's lawyers have supported the serious claims that they have levied. He seemed at some points, a little frustrated, asking you know, why are we even here based on the record before him? So, we're expecting everyone to reconvene in the courtroom at about 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, and then we'll see what the judge says if he is going to make a ruling on this case. I mean, as for now, this trial is set to start on April 15. Trump's lawyers, in addition to the claims of prosecutorial misconduct, were looking for additional time setting, the Jewish holidays saying that there's also spring break in New York. The judge has up to now not looked to give much weight to those arguments. But we'll be interesting to see if he does address any of that when we do get back inside court in a short while.",

And the judge is making it clear. If you're going to make those kinds of accusations, you best come to -- prepared to show your work with case law with facts. They couldn't do that here. And that's what really drew the ire of the judge.And as we see in all the other criminal cases, the Trump team is always accusing prosecutors of some kind of misconduct, of some kind of conspiracy. They do it in the federal case. They do it in Georgia. They do it here. But Judge Juan Merchan making it clear in, his courtroom in this case, if you make those kinds of very serious allegations, you have to be able to support it. And here, they couldn't do. It was interesting our colleagues in the courtroom report that just before he gavel to -- gaveled out for this break, he said I'm not even sure you know why we're -- why exactly we're here. But we hope that was odd that we were here. But I hope when they come back, they will lay out the trial date because that's really the most significant thing that we're looking for today. Does he delay this again? 30, 60, 90 days is a huge range in terms of what the parties are asking for, but having clarity on that, it's really why we're here today.",

And you see so often his lawyers struggling with this. They know they are bound by certain parameters via a case law -- via the rules of conduct that they have to abide by. And that's hard when you're trying to play to an audience of one. And notably, the Supreme Court is probably the only place I can say that we've seen over the past few years where his lawyers didn't do that at all in the oral arguments over putting him on -- back on the ballot. You saw them just completely ignore who their client was and just focus on the case law. And they were successful there.",

Two of his top advisors were set to leave for D.C. tonight.Let's go straight to the White House and CNN's Arlette Saenz.

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. The White House has already responded. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said it was disappointing to learn the news that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had canceled the visit by these two senior Israeli officials to meet with officials here at the White House to discuss planning for a possible operation into Rafah.Now, this comes after Netanyahu had threatened to cancel the trip if the U.S. did not veto a resolution at the U.N. Security Council that called for an immediate ceasefire as well as the unconditional release of hostages. The U.S. ended up abstaining in that vote. Kirby saying that it's not a change in the U.S. position, but instead that the U.S. couldn't support it because it did not include a condemnation of Hamas. But abstaining from it allowed this to move forward, which is really rankled officials over in Israel. And it comes as the White House had been preparing for these meetings with Israeli officials to talk about alternative paths forward to an operation in Rafah. That is something that the White House has been warning about for weeks. They want to see some type of concrete plan that would ensure the protection and evacuation of the 1.4 million Palestinian civilians who are in Rafah. Netanyahu has vowed to go ahead with an operation with or without the support of the U.S. They had been hoping to have that meeting this week to talk to the Israelis in person about possible other steps that they could take. But even though -- this meeting that was scheduled are expected to happen a bit later in the week. Even though that is not happening now, there are expected to be meetings today and tomorrow with Israeli Defense Minister Gallant. He is in town starting this afternoon for a meeting with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The focus of that meeting was expected to be on the release of hostages and surging more humanitarian aid in. But certainly, the White House will try to use this meeting to also talk about planning for Rafah. Gallant is also expected to meet with the secretary of defense, as well as the secretary of state while he is in town. But the cancellation of this trip really lay your spare the latest tension point in the fraying relationship between the U.S. and Israel. And it really calls into question what the U.S. influence will be like with Israeli officials as they are planning these types of operations going forward. So, we will see what else comes from the White House today. But they are initially expressing disappointment with the fact, that is, Netanyahu had canceled this meeting. They say that they will find other ways to try to press the Israelis on the issue of Rafah as there is great concern here about what can happen to the civilians if an operation were to proceed.",

But that's just what's happening to the tune of six million dollars last month alone. So, I think we're going to start to see some knock-on effects from all of this stuff.

It's clear that he also could not come up with the money which undercuts you know, what he was saying on Truth Social over the weekend that I've got the cash and his whole persona, I think. So, I think that we have to recognize this is going to be cut two ways. For some of his base, they're going to see it as you know, further -- you know, grievance, right, which he's no doubt pushing.

He talks about this \"being a witch hunt.\" He says this is unAmerican. He says that how dare they try and touch Trump Tower. He says look, this all started down the golden escalator and now they are trying to seize his property. And what he is continuing to do, whether on Truth Social or in an effort to raise money is paint the picture that he is the victim of an overzealous Justice Department. As he walked into the courtroom today in New York for the hush money case, his one word was this was a hoax. And that's what he's telling his supporters out there. And he has also suggested these are not the Alvin Bragg, the Fani Willis, Letitia James, Jack Smith cases. These are the Joe Biden trials that they are using to go after him because he is a major threat to the Biden administration. And that works for his base. It gets them ginned up. The question is how will this impact or move voters that are independent and undecided voters who are the critical voting electorate as we head into November? And that's the question.
