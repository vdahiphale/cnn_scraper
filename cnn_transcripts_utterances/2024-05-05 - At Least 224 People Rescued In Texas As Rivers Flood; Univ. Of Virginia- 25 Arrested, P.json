But campus police not responding to our request to verify that claim. The Department of Safety and Security at the university did announce that it was an unlawful assembly on Saturday afternoon. A couple of hours later, they declared the situation to be, in their words, stable. The university did respond to a request for comment from CNN saying that it had informed the participants repeatedly that the tent policies are in place, and that these sort of tents that were set violated said policy, and that's what initially prompted the university to respond. But really wider picture, this just reminds us that UVA is really just the latest university where tensions between protesters and the police have resulted in some confrontation.

The former president cursed on occasion while railing against the former -- excuse me -- Special Counselor Jack Smith, as well as others who are leveling their criminal indictments against him.And you're right, at one point in the speech, Donald Trump had even compared the Biden administration to the Gestapo, further trying to equate them to Nazi Germany. Now, Donald Trump also used the speech to lavish praise on some of his vice presidential contenders, including many of them who he actually called up to to the stage. People like J.D. Vance, Tim Scott, Doug Burgum, Elise Stefanik. A lot of people that we know are currently on his short list to become his running mate, even though, while I talked to his advisers, they insist that he has no plans to announce his running mate anytime soon. They say that decision will come closer to the Republican National Convention in July. Now, you mentioned there as well that he also called up former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, someone who was sent to prison on corruption charges that in that sentence, Donald Trump while president commuted that. I actually spoke with Blagojevich on the sidelines of the event this weekend. And he told me that he describes himself as a Trumpocrat, a Trump Democrat. So, a lot of interesting characters at this event this weekend. Now, I also just want to give you some insight into some of the other things that were happening at the Republican National Committee retreat this weekend. At one point, Donald Trump's co-campaign managers, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles, as well as his upholsterer, Tony Fabrizio, watched the group through their recent fundraising numbers. They said that they raised $76.2 million in April. Of course, we can't independently verify those numbers because the FEC reports won't drop until later this month. But they said they were very happy to see that kind of progress. And, of course, all of that comes in the context here is that one of the main events, this Mar-a-Lago luncheon where Donald Trump spoke and the RNC retreat even more broadly was really used as a key fundraising opportunity for the Trump campaign. They have been aggressively trying to to close the gap with the Biden campaign, which ever growing war trust continues to kind of, you know, elude the Trump campaign as they try to catch up with them. And so that's really what a lot of this weekend was about with Donald Trump at this event trying to get many donors to give him money. At one point, he actually called up some people and said, if you give me $1 million, you can take the podium and two people actually decided to do that. And so he was surrounded by his supporters and really aggressively trying to raise money this weekend. Victor, Amara?",

They have positive and flexible positions, he says, and pointing out that Hamas is keen to reach a comprehensive, interconnected agreement, which does have to include a ceasefire and does have to include the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza. Also a serious prisoner exchange deal.Now, this isn't necessarily seen as the official line from Hamas, even though he is the political leader. That decision will come from Yahya Sinwar, who is the leader of Hamas within Gaza itself. Now, there is this Hamas delegation in Cairo. [07:20:06:] They have been given this Egyptian-led proposal well over a week ago, and it's believed that they have an answer to that. We haven't heard that yet, but we do know that the CIA director was in Cairo as well. And so there is certainly hope that at least this first stage of this this deal could be agreed on, which is believed to be up to 33 hostages in the first stage would be released. The women, the elderly, the sick, the wounded in return for some 40 days or so of ceasefire and Palestinian prisoners to be released. It does seem more positive than it has for some time, but also, we have had a number of moments like this in recent months where it seemed a deal was close hence the caution on many sides. And also, what other potential difficult moment has come as the Israeli cabinet has unanimously voted to shut down the Arabic news channel Al Jazeera in Israel to shut down those offices. Now Al Jazeera is funded by Qatar and the Israelis believe that it is biased against Israel which Qatar has denied. And of course, Qatar is one of the key mediating parties when it comes to trying to secure this hostage ceasefire deal. So the timing of that is very interesting that they have unanimously voted just now, just today to shut down the Al Jazeera offices. Back to you.",

Biden's remarks come as there's a rise in antisemitism across the U.S. and as colleges and universities continue to grapple with pro-Palestinian protesters on campuses.CNN's Camila DeChalus joins us now from Wilmington, Delaware. So, what is the president expected to say? CAMILA DECHALUS, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, President Biden really wants to make it clear that he stands against antisemitism. And White House officials tell us, Victor, that part of the speech will also focus on what the Biden administration is doing to combat the rise of antisemitism that is happening in this country. Now, this speech is coming at a very pivotal time. You just saw a few days ago, Biden made his first ever public remarks about the college campus protest. And part of those remarks, he was really trying to convey that he believes that there is no place in this country and on college campuses for threats of violence against Jewish students. And so, you'll see that even in these days ahead that he wants to be more forceful with that message and he wants to convey what his administration is doing to combat antisemitism, and just the rise that you've seen in the past few months of the rise of antisemitic incidents that are taking a place across the country. Victor, back to you,",
