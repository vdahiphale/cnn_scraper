      "sentences": "Welcome back.The jury in Hunter Biden's federal gun trial continues deliberations today. The defense rested yesterday after Hunter declined to testify in this historic case. It's the first criminal trial against the child of a sitting president. During closing arguments, prosecutors tried to convince the jury that Hunter was a drug user at the time that he purchased a gun six years ago, saying, quote, :had he continued to use narcotics, smoke crack every 15 minutes throughout 2018 and decided not to buy a gun, we wouldn't be here in this courtroom. Choices have consequences and that's why we're here.\" Later, Hunters defense attorney argued the prosecutor's case was similar to a magicians trick, adding, quote, \"there is nothing there.\" Joining me now from Wilmington, Delaware, is Alex Thompson, the national political reporter for \"Axios,\" who has been covering this trial day in and day out. Alex, wonderful to see you. How - like, just catch us up with what you saw in court yesterday during these closing arguments. And I want to dig into how the family in particular is playing into this because my understanding is the jurors were told not to be intimidated by the fact that it's the family of the president of the United States. ALEX THOMPSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Yes. So, yesterday you saw both very lengthy closing arguments. I believe Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's lawyer, went for about 87 minutes. And then the prosecution got two shots at it. And they probably got about the same, about 87 minutes. And, you know, to your other point, you know, they - the prosecution said, if they had not proven that Hunter Biden was a crack addict then no one is a crack addict. And it got a little chip between the two sides. Abbe Lowell, at one point, said that the prosecution had been, quote, \"enormously cruel\" to Naomi Biden, Hunter Biden's daughter, the president's granddaughter, in how they cross-examined her. The government came right back and said it was them who put her on the stand, that put her in that position. And it was Hunter Biden who, according to text messages at the time, had been erratic and texting her in the middle of the night and had, you know, I think they put it, as said, blowing her off. And so it got very personal. In terms of how the family, you know, yesterday was the most family that we have seen in this trial. You had aunts, uncles, cousins, the - you know, cousins' spouses. It was, you know, at least a full thing. And it was interesting that both sides, in their closing arguments, you know, made, you know, made allusions to the family. Now, Abbe Lowell, Hunter's lawyer, has been really trying to, you know, portray Hunter as like a family person and, you know, has been referencing the family as part of that, that he is just, you know, I think, one of you. Whereas the prostitution is basically saying what you just alluded to, which is, don't be intimidated. This is not - you know, these people are not evidenced. These people are not really part of the trial.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think they - you could see a little bounce in their step after Abbe Lowell's closing. You know, having just a fulsome 87 minute defense from - of Hunter, you know, when, you know, I think a lot of the family feels he has just been hit day after day after day for the last several years. And I think, you know, I even saw Val Biden, the president's sister, sort of give them a go - give Abbe a go get them right - right afterward.But, you know, after - at the very end, you know, I don't think the family likes being at felony trial for, you know, Joe Biden's son. And you could tell there were certainly moments Ashley Biden, in particular, the president's daughter and Hunter's sister, has, you know, been very emotional at moments in this trial, you know, having to leave at some point, (INAUDIBLE) lots of tears. And you can tell it's been harder on some than on the others.",

One of the attorneys said, quote, \"poor Hallie Biden, who had to be dragged through this period of her life again, who understandably did not remember a lot of the details. Was she remembering what she saw that day or dozens of other days when she too was using. If you noticed, she could remember what the prosecutors asked her. The prosecutors who also gave her immunity, but not so much for any number of things.\" So, that - that, I guess, coming from - from Abbe Lowell. Clearly they felt like they needed to defend other members of the family too. How did that kind of fit in?",

      "sentences": "Well, this has been a key part of Hunter Biden's strategy from the very beginning, which is to really try to undermine the credibility of Hallie Biden, who's Beau's widow, who is also his sister-in-law. And the reason is because her testimony he, you know, very, very troubling if you're Hunter Biden. The fact is that she was the one that found the gun. She - and when she testified that when she went into the truck, she found crack cocaine paraphernalia, suggesting that he had been smoking very recently, that she found powder that day, which also suggested he had been using, and was the one that he was texting during the period he had the gun in which, you know, he said that he was smoking crack.And, you know, this goes to a larger sort of dynamic within both the defense and the prosecution, which, you know, at the very end of the day, beyond the facts of the case, I think it will really come down to, do you relate to Hunter Biden or do you resent Hunter Biden? And, you know, the prosecute - the - Hunter's team basically wants to make you think he's a family man, that he was suffering from a disease, that he's one of you in Delaware, home grown. Whereas the defense is saying, no, this is a bad guy. This is a guy that, you know, what - you know, the little details, that he was withdrawing $151,000 in cash withdrawal in just three months, that he was a millionaire, that he was Yale educated, that he gave $800 to his 24-year-old girlfriend to buy clothes for his daughters. You know, these little details that are meant to, you know, portray a different sort of person. And that may end up being the difference maker with this jury.",
