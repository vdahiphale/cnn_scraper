Last month, the commonwealth's attorney told us Taylor's six-year-old son who shot teacher Abby Zwerner in that first-grade classroom on January 6th, that he will not be charged in this case.James Ellenson, Deja Taylor's attorney sent CNN a statement saying in part, quote, Deja has cooperated from the first day of the incident. She has no criminal record. She is 26 years old. She has one child. Most criminal prosecutions are adversarial in nature, but we will make our best efforts so that these proceedings will be more collaborative than most. Now James Ellenson had previously told us that the boy's parents had claimed that they kept that gun at their home secured. That the gun was secured with the safety and kept on the top shelf of the mother's bedroom closet. But Erica and Bianna, there you have the latest charges for Deja Taylor here.",

That he had choked a teacher during the previous school year when he was in kindergarten. But also in kindergarten, he had touched a female classmate inappropriately on the school playground.

Since then, we've seen the likes of Reagan and even Obama come here to trace their roots. But the Irish sometimes celebrate their president -- U.S. presidents in unusual ways. Have a look.
