It's a busy day here in the NEWSROOM.Turmoil at Twitter and serious questions about the social media giant's future. We're covering a mass resignation after Chief Twit Elon Musk gave employees an ultimatum. And a month's worth of snow in just a few hours? It could happen, as a monster storm continues to pummel Western New York. Imagine, 21 inches in less than six hours just this morning. Plus, more questions and new details in the gruesome killings of four college students in Idaho. One victim's dad says his daughter fought for her life during this attack. But, first, minutes from now, President Biden speaks on the economy just days before the unofficial holiday shopping season kicks off. The White House says the president will focus on progress made. What progress? CNN's Matt Egan is on it for us. Matt, in terms of numbers, we have seen some signs this month that inflation is easing. But in terms of how people are feeling, are Americans feeling that progress yet?",

      "sentences": "Well, Ana, I think the good news is that inflation is cooling off.I think the bad news is, it's still pretty hot. And so that means that people may not really be feeling this in their wallets. Consumer prices jumped by 7.7 percent year over year in October. That set off a thunderous celebration on Wall Street, raising hopes that maybe the worst for inflation is over. But there's really no celebration Main Street, because the cost of living remains way too high. We have seen some categories having price drops, apparel, airfare, used cars, month-over-month price declines. That is good news. But food remains a sore spot, and people are going to be filling up this Thanksgiving. The average cost of a Thanksgiving feast for 10 people, $64 this year. That is up 20 percent from a year ago, 38 percent higher than two years ago. We have seen a little bit more progress, though, when it comes to another pain point. That is prices at the pump. A gallon of gas is now selling nationally for $3.71, down eight cents from a week ago, 16 cents from a month ago. That is good news. The Fed is fighting inflation by bumping up the cost to borrow, so that has sent credit card rates to record highs. Mortgage rates have skyrocketed. We did see a bit of good news on that front, the average 30-year fixed rate going from 7.1 percent to 6.6 percent. That is the largest weekly drop since 1981. But, Ana, 6 percent or 7 percent, mortgage rates, they're still pretty high. And this volatility is making it hard for home buyers and sellers to know what to do next.",

The other, of course, is jobs. And so we do see, in the next few weeks, we're going to have upcoming inflation reports and jobs reports. And so the Fed is hoping to see further signs of a cooldown on those fronts. And, if that happens, then maybe, during the next meeting on December 14, they can go from a 75-basis-point-rate hike to a 50- basis-point hike. Maybe they could eventually go down to 25 basis points or even pause altogether. Ana that, of course, would be good news, because, right now, the Fed is slamming the brakes on the economy, and, eventually, they could end up causing a recession. CABRERA:  Matt Egan, I know you're watching closely. Thank you. Now to the turmoil at Twitter that has suddenly gotten even more tumultuous, the social media site's future in question, as offices closed after hundreds of employees resigned en masse. They delivered a hard no to Elon Musk's -- quote -- \"extremely hardcore ultimatum.\" CNN senior media reporter Oliver Darcy is joining us to explain.

And, really, the trouble spot is right here in Western New York, as you mentioned, just to the south of Buffalo. Hamburg has gotten pounded all morning long. We have continued to see two to three inches of snow an hour. And this has been going on since the wee morning hours. So we are talking about several feet of snow. And look at this video. You can see looks like a wall of snow, a curtain if you will. I remember flying into Buffalo in 2014 during that snow event, and it was one of the most remarkable things I have ever seen, such a dividing line where the snow starts and the snow is. We have seen already three feet of snow across portions of Western New York, current snow depth already more than 18 inches right there in the Hamburg region, just to the south of Buffalo. And, really, Ana, the wind is going to steer where this snow goes. So, just a change in the wind direction is going to change who gets the most snow. And you can see it starts to inch up to the north around Buffalo. By the time we get into tonight, into tomorrow morning, they will be more in the snow. And then it's still continuing by tomorrow evening, so really snowing all day tomorrow. A front moves through. It does push a lot of that out, but do expect snowy conditions to remain throughout much of the weekend. This is going to create incredible problems, not only on the roads, but air traffic, as well as the weight of this snow, Ana, on roofs.

And if you were to take that trajectory and stretch it out, it means that this missile could, at least theoretically, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry, have hit the mainland United States. It's not the first time North Korea this year has tested an ICBM, but it remains concerning anytime they test one of these, because it means they're learning more. They're improving their equipment. They're learning about the launches themselves and their trajectories. And that, in and of itself, is cause for concern. It also comes one day after they tested a short-range ballistic missile. So North Korea's frenetic pace of testing continues. In response, the U.S. and South Korea carrying out a live-fire exercise with four U.S. and four South Korean jets. The South Koreans say they targeted what they call a transporter erector launcher, which is essentially a mockup of a North Korean ballistic missile launcher.

They still believe that MBS directed the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.They say this is not disagreeing with the case that has been brought against him by Khashoggi's fiancee here in federal court in Washington, D.C., two years ago. They say this is about a legal precedent, international law, which states that foreign heads of state, foreign heads of government, like MBS, should be given immunity from prosecution. We heard just a short time ago from the National Security Council's John Kirby. He said, in part: \"This legal determination has absolutely nothing to do with the merits of the case itself. It is a legal determination requested by State and -- by the State Department and provided by the Justice Department at the request of the court.\" Ana, let's break this down a little bit. MBS, of course, is the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, but, a couple of weeks ago, in fact, at the end of September, his father gave him a new title, that of prime minister, and that made him technically the head of the Saudi government. That, therefore, shielded him from prosecution. It gave him immunity. Now, critics and experts that I have spoken with, as well as activists, they say that was a ploy in order to get this immunity. And, in fact, the Justice Department in their filing late last night, really at the 11th hour on the day of the deadline, they did say in their filing that because he is the head of the Saudi government, that he therefore deserves immunity. Now, as you just noted, there is growing anger. There is growing outrage on Capitol Hill. We have seen people like Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he tweeted: \"We should seek justice, and relentlessly so.\" I have spoken to several activists who are stunned and angry. They say that the Biden administration is shielding the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. And, Ana, I have also spoken with the fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi, who e-mailed me to say that she is devastated today. She says that Biden himself betrayed his word, betrayed Jamal, and that history will not forget -- Ana.",
