      "sentences": "Rosemary, I think it's fair to say that Israel and the United Nations more broadly have had an uneasy relationship for the past few decades, but Israel reserves particular ire for UNRWA itself. It says that UNRWA effectively perpetuates the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by, among other things, conferring refugee status not just on Palestinians that were displaced in 1948 when Israel was created, but on all of their descendants, and that it's the only agency that does that, that it keeps Palestinians in refugee camps and holds out the hope that they may one day be able to return to the homes they lost in 1948 inside of Israel, something that Israel says is never going to happen.And I suppose what these allegations that Israel has presented to the U.N., the United States, and others that about a dozen employees of UNRWA were actively involved in the Hamas-led massacre of October the 7th, is it gives Israel a kind of smoking gun to say that UNRWA is not fit for purpose. And indeed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, addressing U.N. ambassadors yesterday, saying that I think it's time the international community and the U.N. itself understand that UNRWA's mission has to end. The problem, of course, is that it's not clear if UNRWA can be reformed, which is what the United States says needs to happen for it to resume funding the agency. But if it is going to be replaced, what would come along in its stead, because as we've heard from the U.N. Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, so many of the two million Palestinians inside the Gaza Strip are completely reliant on UNRWA for their humanitarian needs, for food, for shelter, for medicine and the like. And that if UNRWA cannot continue beyond the end of this month, as it says will happen, if it doesn't manage to plug the gap in funding that all these countries freezing their funding has created, then the question is what will come in its place. And I suppose, politically speaking, Rosemary, Israel, of course, doesn't want to be the one to step into the breach and to be responsible for all of those Palestinians' humanitarian needs.",

Netanyahu trying to reassure the representatives of these 18 families that he met with yesterday in Jerusalem that he's doing everything that he possibly can to bring them home, but he won't do a deal that will, in his words, see the release of thousands of Palestinian terrorists, and he will not do a deal that conflicts with Israel's war objectives of dismantling Hamas and preventing it from ever visiting the kind of attack that it did on October the 7th, again, or to continue governing in the Gaza Strip.

The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development says it will take tens of billions of dollars and decades of work to reverse the damage done by this war. The U.N. report says the military campaign in the enclave has led to a precipitous decline in living conditions as well as soaring poverty and unemployment. The report says the level of destruction has rendered Gaza uninhabitable. And economic activity has ground to a halt with the exception of minimum health and food services. The war has dealt a massive blow to living conditions in Gaza which were already precarious before the outbreak of this war.

And how long would reconstruction take, do you think?KOZUL-WRIGHT: Well, clearly the Palestinian Authority, which has been in its own very difficult economic circumstances now for years, cannot foot that kind of bill. So it's the international community and the occupying power that is responsible for reconstruction. The length of time depends on lots of factors. It depends upon when the military operation ends. It depends upon how quickly we can get growth going in Gaza, because obviously reconstruction of that level also requires domestic resource mobilization. So we need to see a growth recovery in the Gaza Strip. I think what we say in the report is, if we don't do this, then we're talking about decades just to get back to where we were before, before this current military operation began. And business as usual really is not an option given not only the consequences for the people of Gaza, but for the wider geopolitical consequences of an ongoing conflict.",

Where do you start?KOZUL-WRIGHT: I mean, you know, and often in these circumstances, people return to the one successful model of recovery and reconstruction that we know work, which of course was the Marshall Plan that the United States implemented after the end of the Second World War. And obviously, the circumstances are different, the times are different, but, you know, the principles of being generous, which the Marshall Plan was, both in terms of scale and also in terms of the kind of aid, it was not debt, it was grants that were given with the Marshall Plan. You need to be sustained. The Marshall Plan lasted for five years. This has to be more than that, and we need institution building that will deliver on that kind of agenda. And it needs to be inclusive. It needs to involve the people in the Palestinian territories, as the Marshall Plan involved the Europeans in their own reconstruction. So we have models of that in the past. You know, this was 80 years ago, the Marshall Plan.

President Zelenskyy just 68. Now, that's pretty high. But that rift had apparently been growing.Lots of speculation now, of course, about who will take over. But much more importantly, as you heard a moment ago, and this has been something of a complaint for months, if not since very quickly into this war, the lack of ammunition, the fact that this stalemate appears to have been reached on the battlefield. And in fact, Valeriy Zaluzhny had spoken about that fairly openly in an article in an interview in November. The fact that this was the First World War they were in so far, Rosemary, technologically, they were now at a stalemate.

Bearing witness is based on the accounts of refugees from the war-torn region who have fled to eastern Chad.The humanitarian organization warns that more than 10 million people in Darfur are displaced and nearly half of them are on the brink of famine, making Sudan home to the largest displacement crisis in the world. The report says at least 13,000 people have been killed since April in the battle between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary rapid support forces. Meanwhile, another half a million refugees have fled to already overwhelmed refugee camps in eastern Chad, and there's not enough humanitarian aid to go around. Daniel Sullivan joins me now. He is the Director for Africa, Asia, and the Middle East at Refugees International. Thank you so much for being with us.",

This is based on a trip I did to Eastern Chad, interviewing dozens of refugees from Darfur, including some who were at the time, fleeing and just arriving on the border from a town called Ardamata, the latest massacres that were happening.And, you know, the stories that I heard were just horrific and, you know, people being house-to-house searches, people being summarily executed, sexual assaults happening, and people being targeted because of their ethnicity being called black Africans. And it was really, for me, for somebody who worked on, at Save Darfur some 20 years ago, it was eerily reminiscent of what I heard at that time in the genocide that was happening. So the main finding is that atrocities, mass atrocities are happening again and they're ongoing in Darfur and in other parts of Sudan and that there really is an urgent need for the international community to step in and step up pressure to stop those atrocities and to get aid in.",

You know, at that time, the infamous John Dewey, the devil on horseback, the Rapid Support Forces that have descended from them are the ones who and them and allied militias are attacking.And they're attacking based on the ethnicity, the tribes of the people. They're -- they're asking about that identity, going house to house, burning places, you know, people telling me about people being thrown into fires. You know, men being targeted or women targeted for sexual violence, spoke to, for example, one woman who arrived with a five-year-old and said that was the only thing that she was able to bring with her. And just countless stories like that just made clear the level of atrocities that were happening. And I should mention that, you know, 85 percent or more of the people who are arriving into Eastern Chad are women and children. So there's a clear targeting of men and huge needs in Eastern Chad.",

And so much like almost 20 years ago where initially most of the deaths were happening because of violence. Eventually more of the deaths were happening because of hunger and disease and we're heading on that trajectory.So to stop that, what we want to see is first of all, a diplomatic surge in trying to get at the root causes of this fighting. And that needs to happen in ways, for example, with the U.S. government, we're calling for the appointment of a presidential special envoy, somebody who has knowledge and relationships in the region with the key players who can really bring the attention that we need to see the level that this gravity of abuses deserves. The second thing is to support accountability and evidence collection. There's been a fact-finding mission set up by the U.N. or authorized by the U.N., but it isn't functioning yet. And then finally, for all those people who are suffering now, the 10 million people who have been displaced in the largest displacement crisis now in the world and the 500,000 who came across the border to Eastern Chad and hundreds of thousands of others to other countries to find ways to get aid in and to surge that aid because that's one thing, getting aid into Sudan is very difficult, but getting aid into Eastern Chad and other places where people have fled doesn't have the same barriers, yet what you found there, what we found there was a really overwhelmed and under-resourced response. So there really needs to be a surge in resources to save lives now.",
