It will be part of their final public meeting on Monday at 1:00 p.m., where members are also going to be presenting their final report to the American people. The Department of Justice is definitely going to take a look at whatever the committee sends their way, particularly that evidence supporting these charges that the committee might bring forward, because there hasn't been much shared between the committee and DOJ up into this point, and the DOJ wants to see what the committee has. But some of these charges have been out there when it comes to Trump. A federal judge has recently said that Trump may have been involved in the obstruction of an official proceeding. So that's been out there. But taking a step back a criminal referral from the January 6 Committee to the Department of Justice is largely symbolic in nature. The DOJ already has a wide-ranging criminal probe into January 6, but if members get up there on Monday, and say and issue criminal referrals for Trump, that is a powerful message. It says that, throughout its 17-month investigation, interviewing more than 1,000 witnesses piecing together a minute-by-minute timeline of Donald Trump's actions on January 6, that putting all of that together, that members believe that their evidence reveals that Donald Trump committed a crime.

They have more evidence gathered than DOJ as far as we know, at this point.And so, if the prosecutors on the January 6 committee, and there are many of them who sit as members or a staff, say to the DOJ, we've looked at this evidence, and we think it meets the standard of convictable crime of sustainable on appeal, then I think DOJ takes a harder look at it than if there was no referral. So, I think it's meaningful to the DOJ when it comes. It's not dispositive, but I think it will be meaningful.

They may be referred to the Ethics Committee on the Hill, as well. They may be cited for contempt.So, there are opportunities here for not just the DOJ to look into this, but for the ethics people, because whether or not this was a criminal offense, it was surely an ethical breach and a moral breach.

Now this sell off really got started almost exactly at 2The Fed statement and projections raise fears of more Fed right -- rate hikes ahead. And remember, the more the Fed does, the greater the risk they do too much and they cause a recession. Jerome Powell's press conference that only further reinforce the same concerns. But this self is not just about the Fed, Thursdays weaker than expected reports on retail sales and manufacturing suggested real cracks are already forming in this economy. So, if you add a tough talking Fed to weakening economic numbers, you get rising recession fears. I would note that Powell and the Fed are probably just fine with this sell off. I mean their inflation fighting campaign. It requires tighter financial conditions. They know the more hawkish they sound the less work they have to do. They don't want the market to boom. In some ways, this market is in a lose-lose situation right now. Because good economic news is being treated as bad news by investors because it means a tougher fed. Bad economic news is bad for investors and everyone because it raises the risk of a recession.

So, we know for a fact that people bought crypto on FTX because of these celebrity endorsements.And if you go back and actually look at some of these ads, and what the celebrities say, is really troubling. I mean, the Steph Curry ad in particular, you know, it's all premised on the fact that he's not an expert on crypto, but he ends the ad by saying he doesn't have to be because with FTX he has everything he needs to buy and sell crypto quote, safely. Well, obviously, that wasn't the case here. And when you're a celebrity, I mean, you've certainly have, I think, a moral obligation, and in many cases, a legal obligation to know what you -- to know something about what you are promoting. You know, we're not talking about a footlong Subway sandwich here, right, we're talking about something that people put their life savings into, you know, their kids college fund into, and that's all gone now. And a lot of that is gone because of what the celebrities were saying. And when we look at FTX they were listing, you know, unregistered securities. And so, it's illegal for celebrities to promote securities and certainly unregistered securities without disclosing, you know, the nature and the amount of that compensation. So, there's ongoing, you know, civil class action complaints. And for a lot of people who lost in FTX The reality is they're probably not going to get much out of the bankruptcy estate. And you go back to the Mt. Gox exchange that imploded in Japan in 2014. You know, those creditors haven't gotten anything yet.

She issued a statement really thanking everyone involved in this effort in bringing her home and it is quite a lot of people. But beginning with President Biden, her wife Cherelle, and many of the other activists and U.S. officials who played a role behind the scenes and in public in advocating on her behalf. But one of the aspects of the statement that was incredibly notable was that Griner announced that she would be returning to basketball. Now this was a huge question that faced her as she went into the spring, would she go back to play for the Phoenix Mercury? And she said in this statement that she will, she wants to be able to thank her fans and to thank her teammates who really put her case at the top of their priority list. She also had this to say, to President Biden, about Paul Whelan, another American who remains in Russia. She said, \"President Biden, when you brought me home, and I know you are committed to bringing Paul Whelan home and all Americans too, I will use my platform to do whatever I can to help you. I will also encourage everyone that played a part in bringing me home to continue their efforts to bring all Americans home. Every family deserves to be whole.\" And I'm told by Griner's family and agent that this is really key to where she is right now. She is really focused on how she can use her platform to help others but especially Paul Whelan, who, for so long, his fate was viewed as being intertwined with hers, but he remains imprisoned in Russia and not clear yet what it will take to get him released from prison. Abby Phillip, CNN, Washington. SANCHEZ: Abby, thank you so much. Five law enforcement officers involved in the May 2019 death of black motorist Ronald Greene have been indicted on state charges by Louisiana grand jury. It marks the first time that charges have been filed in this case. Police say that Greene died after resisting arrest and struggling with officers. But his family says that state police initially told them Greene had died in a car crash after a police chase. Video leaked two years after the incident showed officers kicking and punching and using a taser on Greene before he died in their custody. Here's what Greene's mother had to say about the indictment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

After going through three years of this draconian heavy-handed approach to COVID, now the government trying to downplay COVID.People here were caught off guard by this sudden reopening, many feel like they weren't given enough time or resources to get ready. Across the country, fever medicine and antigen test kits are incredibly hard to get and out of stock here in Beijing. The country is scrambling now to boost the elderly vaccination rate and increased ICU capacity. At a state media event, some health experts even admitted that, quote, we were not super well prepared in certain aspects. The chief infectious disease doctor at a Beijing hospital said there have been outbreaks among doctors, nurses and other staff putting strain on the system. The doctor continued that, quote, we expect the overwhelming strain on medical services to be on hospital wards, as infections reach the elderly population. This decision to relax COVID restrictions during China's winter when millions are expected to travel across the country for the New Year holiday, and also, while seasonal flu could further strain hospitals. Well this timing, it's led to a wave of criticism on Chinese social media. State media has reported that all vacations for doctors and nurses in China's central Hainan province will be canceled until March. The report said, quote, health workers must be on duty 24 hours a day to ensure we smoothly pass this transition period. Hainan, which is the third most populous province in China is ranked among the top destinations during this Chinese New Year travel rush. Experts say that considering how obsessed this government is with control, it is striking just how little preparation there has been for such a dramatic exit from zero-COVID.
