      "sentences": "Good to see you, Richard.I am Jim Sciutto in Washington, notably outside the Manhattan criminal court where Donald Trump stands accused. The prosecution and defense have just finished questioning a new batch of potential jurors. As Richard said, we are actually down two seated jurors from the seven we started the day with. One of them said she believed her identity has essentially been made public by the media. Judge Juan Merchan then dismissed her and urged news outlets not to provide really any physical descriptions of the jurors, their jobs, et cetera. Prosecutors found information on another one that called his truthfulness into question. They said someone with the same name was arrested in the 1990s for tearing down political advertisements. That juror was also then excused. So, let's return now to the potential jurors who were just questioned. Prosecutors told them that the case was not a referendum on Trump's presidency. The defense told them that some witnesses have a personal animus against Trump, and therefore might be seeking revenge. Trump's attorney also pressed a potential juror on her son's work for a congressional Democrat. Zachary Cohen is in Washington following the events inside the courtroom. So, we are were seeing a lot of questions, including some quite probing questions from Donald Trump's defense attorneys. What have we learned inside? And is there any progress towards selecting or seating new jurors today?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, it is important to keep in mind, too, that Donald Trump is sitting there listening to allof these potential jurors as they are asked questions, you know, even questions as personal about him saying, do you like Donald Trump? What do you think about Donald Trump? And several of these potential jurors took issue with Donald Trump's demeanor, Donald Trump's political performance. One juror, a potential juror even saying that they disliked Donald Trump's \"persona\" and was forced to explain that. So Donald Trump there and listening to these potential jurors. We had 38 potential jurors left from this new pool of 96 that were questioned by both sides, by attorneys on both sides. The questioning just concluded. And now, both teams of attorneys are deliberating and talking about which of these potential jurors do these 18 potential jurors that have been questioned, which ones they want to try to challenge for cause. And then after that, they're going to decide which ones, if any, do they want to potentially try to strike using the four remaining strikes that each side both have left. And look, that means that we are close to potentially finding out if we are going to get any new jurors seated today and if so, how many? As you mentioned, we are down two jurors, seated jurors from where we started today. We will see how much closer to the 12 needed we get once things wrap up in court today. We also need those six alternates as well. So still a lot to accomplish there, but we will see if we make any progress at the end of today.",

And I think this is making it much more complex that he is very -- he is somebody who has never been disciplined, I think in his life. He acts to me like a seven-year-old who is still arrested at that stage of his development and just won't listen to other people, including his lawyers. The question is, is he going to listen to the judge when the judge comes down on him if he continues to make disparaging remarks about the jurors or people and witnesses and people like that in his online postings.",

The court is going to hear arguments and then take some time to decide, but that case will then relate to his other potential criminal cases for how his handling of classified documents, but also his participation on January 6, and I wonder how important a moment is that to you?

I mean, it is very absurd and Fort Knox would be in deep trouble because if he prevailed with this argument, which I cannot believe he will, he would just back up a truck to Fort Knox and empty it for openers. So I think Jim, that we've got a court that is giving him some time.

The former president's lawyers are trying to get another potential juror dismissed from the case for cause. Now, they say she posted anti-Trump content on social media.

Back in Washington, the fight over U.S. funding for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan is now heating up and it seems making progress. Hardline Republicans are still threatening to remove the House Speaker, Mike Johnson. His allies are urging him to change House rules to quash that revolt. Speaker Johnson is holding firm, though on his decision to push through the aid package. Here's what one of his colleagues told me just earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. FRENCH HILL (R-AR): I absolutely believe that Speaker Johnson has done the right thing, when he became Speaker, suddenly, out of the blue in October. Speaker Johnson was confronted with completing Fiscal 24 spending, reauthorizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and getting this supplemental support for our allies, Taiwan, Israel, and Ukraine. He's worked hard. He's now reached that point. I think he recognizes the threats that people have made toward him. But he's committed to these objectives and he's completed two of the three. And I hope this weekend is successful in completing our responsibility in passing this defense supplemental. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
