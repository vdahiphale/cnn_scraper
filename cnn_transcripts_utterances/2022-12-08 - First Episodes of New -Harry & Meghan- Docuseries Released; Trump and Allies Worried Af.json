We have breaking news this hour.We'll begin with that breaking news. The new \"Harry and Meghan\" docuseries was released one hour ago and all over the world viewers are tuning in to hear from the Royals. And we're doing the same right here on CNN. In fact, I have it in front of me on my laptop. Here's what we can tell you so far. Early on Prince Harry issues a scathing rebuke of the media and Meghan talks about her reasons for working on the documentary. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Three hours into one. Well, we're getting through it. You know, they've explained their reasons for doing this documentary, which is largely that they want to tell their story. And it's how they got together, very much describing how this was a love story and how they didn't want to ultimately conform into the Royal system.At the very beginning they had this caveat. They did ask members of the Royal family to contribute and they declined to do so. So, that's why we don't have that side of the debate here. But I don't know what conditions that, you know, offer was made to other parts of the Royal family. It starts actually with cell phone footage, the two of them recording their thoughts as soon as they've left the Royal family. So, they were -- or not left the Royal family but left their Royal roles. So, from a very early stage they were filming elements of what would become this documentary that came out today. A couple of sort of sound bites that really stand out to me, they're both from Harry. One from where he says, I think so many people in the family, especially obviously the men, they have a temptation or an urge to marry someone who would fit the mold as opposed to someone who would perhaps be destined to be with them. The difference between making decisions with your head and your heart suggesting that men in the family had married people they weren't destined to be with and weren't truly in love with, which is quite a thing to say about other members of your own family. Also talking about how what a struggle it was growing up with so much media around them. And this idea that there's a conspiracy really between the media, the Royal rotor, as he describes it, and the palace. So, this idea that certain U.K. media are given privileged access to the palace system. And the deal back is that they give positive coverage in the media. I personally don't -- we're not part of the Royal rotor but I'm, you know, involved with them. I don't really see that there's a conspiracy there but that's very much what Harry and Meghan felt because they didn't benefit from that system as much as other members of the family.",

I know from working with you, Kate, is not the case in terms of I've observed. But Kate, it does seem that the antagonists, if you like, in the early parts of the episode, just be set up as squarely the British media which can come as no surprise given the harassment that Princess Diana was subjected to and that we've seen occur to members of the Royal family as well. Does it strike you that perhaps that will be the target of some of the criticism rather than the Cambridges?",

Within the other system where ultimately it is a hierarchy. So, you know, William and Kate would always get a higher precedence for example at formal occasions.But one of the issues that Harry speaks about to -- which is very concerned about -- is some of what he saw as the racist coverage in the British tabloid media. And particularly one article that appeared in \"The Daily Mail\" online. Which has been the subject of various court cases. But this is how he pushes that towards the family. He says: As far as a lot of the family were concerned, everything that she -- Meghan -- was being put through they had been put through as well. So, it's almost like a rite of passage. Some of the members of the family were like, right, put my wife had to go through that so why should your girlfriend be treated any differently. So, he wanted extra help because she had this race element that other members of the rest of the family didn't have and he didn't get that back. And that's I think one of the kernels of what the frustration of the couple and how they weren't mishandled by the palace system, weren't protected and ultimately left.",

Prince Harry is referring to the fact that he was afraid of not having anyone that he loved, or relationships in his life staying with him because of this press intrusion and what it means to be a royal.

And Republicans are looking ahead now to 2024. Donald Trump's already announced his intentions to run for president again. But his track record of picking winning candidates has come to an end especially after Herschel Walker's loss in the Georgia Senate race. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Allies and advisors to former President Trump are deeply concerned about what Herschel Walker's loss means for the former president. They had hoped that Walker would win. Of course, Walker being Trump's handpicked candidate in that Georgia election and that it would breathe new life into what has been really a lack luster launch of his 2024 campaign. They also hoped that a win would end the calls for new GOP leadership after so many of Trump's candidates in the midterms failed. Now what they are saying is quite the opposite. They are concerned that this loss is going to lead to more people, more demand for people to challenge former President Donald Trump when it comes to 2024. And remember, this loss of Walker is coming off a very bad week for the former president. And we are told that he has been stewing at his Mar- a-Lago resort. He is calling his allies, he is calling advisors. He is upset about his campaign's success so far. And he is upset about those verdicts in New York and he remains upset about Herschel Walker. Now there is a reason for this. We are hearing from a number of people who are former Trump supporters who are saying that it is time to move on. And I want to read you one quote here. And this is from someone who is close to Trump. This is what they said. They said, Donald's got his problems right now and they are so numerous that I don't think he can win and I want to back a winner. There are a lot of friends of mine who don't want Trump at the top of the ticket because they feel like it's a killer. That is a pretty strong statement here from somebody who has backed Donald Trump and even spoken to him recently. This is somebody who is close to the former president. One thing to keep in mind though, is even with all of this, we talked to advisers, we talked to Republicans who don't support Trump but who say they are weary of him. Because they say they've been down this road before. And they believe there is still a portion of the base who doesn't really care about any of this and only cares about supporting Donald Trump. So, that is something, of course, that has yet to be seen. But this certainly seems like a pivotal moment. A moment in which the former president has been the most politically vulnerable that he's been in years. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Chairman Bennie Thompson says that the panel is aiming to make its final report public by December 21st. It will come almost two years after Donald Trump supporters storm Congress in a deadly attempt to overturn the 2020 election.Simultaneously, the committee is preparing a list of criminal referrals to the U.S. Justice Department. Which sources say could include Trump and some of his closest allies. Committee members have yet to vote on a final list. The referrals do not mean the Justice Department will pursue them since it has its own ongoing investigations but as one prominent Democrat on the committee said, the facts all point to possible criminal charges, including against the former president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I think the facts support a potential charge against the former president. And, you know, the Justice Department, in my view, needs to hold, you know, everyone equally responsible before the law and that includes former presidents when they engage in criminality.

The Fulton County grand jury is focused on efforts by the former president and his close associates to pressure state officials to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. Like others before him, Flynn who was fired as Trump's national security advisor, had gone to court to block the grand jury's subpoena but ultimately failed and was ordered to appear in person.In just a matter of hours, the U.S. House is expected to take up the Respect For Marriage Act following its passage in the Senate last week.

The announcement came after officers returned some of the victims personal belongings to their families on Wednesday. Now police say they're looking for at least one person in a white Hyundai sedan that was seen near the crime scene on November 13th. Officers say people in that car may have critical information about the case. The students were stabbed to death off campus in their home in Moscow, Idaho, most likely while they were asleep. So far police have not announced a suspect or a murder weapon or a possible motive. Millions of Americans are under dangerous winter weather.
