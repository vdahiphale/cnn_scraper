So clearly an area of concern for administration officials as they look to set up this border barrier. Now, in last month, Customs and Border Protection had announced and sought public input from the community as they were looking at doing this. And this would be up to 20 miles of border barrier and would include a number of fixtures for example, lights, cameras and gates, as well as access roads. But to do it and to do it in an expedited manner, there are waiving certain laws that includes the Clean Air Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act as well as the Endangered Species Act. Now, they are sure to come under criticism by Democrats for making this move. In fact, Texas Representative Henry Cuellar said that they shouldn't be taking a 14th Century solution to a 21st Century problem. And the officials when you talk to them say, when they see border security and they talk about border barriers, they would want to focus instead on border technology. The funds have been appropriated for these physical barriers. But look, the White House is acutely aware that this is an area of concern for them. There has been an uptick in border crossings. They are facing criticism from cities across the country, including from Democratic allies. And so this is an area that are going to focus on for this wall. We should also know that Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Attorney General Garland are all in Mexico this week for annual security talks.

This is not, we're just going to do border security and not focus on what we do with the migrants who are already here in this country and how we are treating them. It has to be from the administration's perspective, for their political purposes, a comprehensive kind of solution that we were saying last hour, of course, there is no comprehensive legislative solution. That's not available here to actually resolve this in this way.

You heard President Biden yesterday, Phil, preview, that he's going to be giving a big speech on this. You saw him gather on the phone with the Western leaders this week. This is a clear moment and the leadership vacuum on the Republican side in the House definitely further complicates this moment, which is why I think you're going to see the President step up.
