That is what U.S. secretary ofstate Antony Blinken is pushing in his fifth tour of the Middle East since war started. Blinken just arrived in Qatar and will be in Israel later. He's already sat down with leaders in Saudi Arabia and in Egypt, trying to shore up support for another temporary truce. This happening amid the increasingly dire situation in Rafah, with more than half -- half -- of Gaza's 2.2 million people now crammed into that city. And these are images of what life looks like there. Israel set to ramp up its operations on the ground there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator):  We will continue this action and we will reach the places where we have not yet fought, in the center and the south of the Gaza Strip and especially in the last remaining center of gravity in the hands of Hamas, Rafah.
