Alon, always great to have you on. Everything I've read and people I've spoken with seem to back up your assessment and view this as just political grandstanding domestically for Prime Minister Netanyahu. And that can be just relayed, given the people, the team that he's sending to the U.S., including Ron Dermer, who's never -- I don't believe he's even served in the IDF, along with the National Security Advisor. So, if this is just what you described, sort of a mirage for Netanyahu to use politically, is President Biden playing into his hand unintentionally here by continuing to stress on Rafah itself, as opposed to the other crisis on the ground there?

What bipartisan meant was that Israel will do everything in its power not to become a wedge issue, not to become a hyper- partisan issue. What it has been doing since 2015, and you made that remark earlier, since Mr. Netanyahu's speech in Congress behind the President's back, Barack Obama, and Vice President at the time, one Joseph Biden, what Mr. Netanyahu has deliberately done is turn Israel into a partisan issue.

And today, atleast for the Dow, we are on record watch yet again, sort of to see if it hits and crosses that 40,000 threshold. It's not far off, about 150 points as shares are up about eight tenths of a percent for the index. A few things that are at sort of play here. So, yesterday, of course, we heard from Fed Chairman Jay Powell at the conclusion of their two day March meeting. And while he said that they were not cutting rates, he did the next best thing. He said, we're not cutting rates this meeting, but stand by, stick by, because we still expect three rate cuts this year, sort of reiterating its rate outlook for this year. So, investors love that because there had been this sense, Zain and Bianna, we had gotten two inflation reports this year that were hotter than expected. We got two job reports that were hotter than expected. And so there was a fear. You started to see banks revising their forecast for rate cuts. You started to see banks sort of say, well, maybe we won't get any rate cuts this year. And essentially, what the Fed did yesterday is said, look, we see the reports, but we still think we're going to be able to sort of get the three rate cuts this year. At least that's what they're signaling. And not just that, they also signaled in their forecast, their summary of economic projections is what it's called, that they expect a rosier 2024 in terms of unemployment. The unemployment rate was ticked down slightly in terms of their projections for this year. GDP was ticked up, so they're expecting a stronger U.S. economic growth for 2024 and inflation as well. And so, you still have those rate cuts. You put it all together and it's -- it's a party that the investors clearly like. They sort of -- it seems like they are soon going to tackle this inflation problem, but also give us the rate cuts. Now, one thing I should point out is the Dow would be over 40,000 if not for Apple because of that antitrust lawsuit that you guys had mentioned. There are a few stocks that are weighing the Dow, but nothing like the Apple stock, which is off about three point five percent on the back of this news from the DOJ. So, the records keep coming. The Dow looks to be on set to hit another record today. And Zain, as I said, you manifested it wearing the green today.",

An investigativejournalist who has followed Trump for years came up with a list of properties that if sold quickly could actually be used to pay the nearly half billion dollar fine. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is tracking this story for us. So, at this point, without an underwriter, what are the options for Donald Trump just in terms of selling assets at fire sale prices, perhaps reducing the amount or getting the amount reduced to a hundred million, which is said to be a bit more palatable for him, or even declaring bankruptcy, which I know that he's loathe to do?",

That was a necessary legal instrument required by Kenyan law to send Kenyan police to any other foreign country. But he never made it back to Haiti because he resigned after the gangs took over Port-au-Prince and the airport. And so, all of those kind of cascaded out of this development in Kenya.
