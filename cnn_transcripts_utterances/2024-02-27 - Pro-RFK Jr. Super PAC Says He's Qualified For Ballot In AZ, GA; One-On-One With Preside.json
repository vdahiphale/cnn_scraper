I mean, we've seen the example of our dear brother Aaron Bushnell.When he set himself on fire and killed himself, what was he saying? These are moral issues and moral causes. These are not just brands and strategies and tactics. And as you know, since that, Dana, so much American politics is about strategy and tactic. These are deeply moral and spiritual issues having to do with arbitrary power being used. And when I hear sister Rashida say, well, Biden is not hearing us. No, Biden is the enabling the killing of us. That's what's taking place here. And so you can imagine it. My Arab brothers and sisters in Dearborn and other places are saying, we're not just pieces of me moved on a chessboard. These are our families. This is mama and daddy. This is grandmama and granddaddy. It reminds me in some ways of the the rabbis who marched in the early 40s led by the great Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel and FDR wouldn't even come out of the White House. He sent Henry Wallace and those rabbis were sitting there saying, look, massacres are taking place. War crimes are taking place. Crimes against humanity. Genocide is taking place. What did the White House do in the early 40s? Nothing at all, hardly. Why? Because it's an electro political issue. The Jewish vote didn't mean X. The Jewish vote didn't mean Y. These are human beings and America is enabling the killing of them. So it is now in 2024. Where is the space for truth, justice, love in a moment --",

But at the same time, you and I also know that you -- the root of what we're talking about here is an ugly occupation, is an embargo and siege and then we can call for a ceasefire. So, in calling for a ceasefire, it ought to be on the way to get at the roots of the problem, which is the ending of an occupation. So you can then have forms of resistance that don't have to take the form of killing innocent people. Now, I believe in just war. Combatants can kill combatants. I'm not like Martin Luther King. I'm not a pacifist, but combatants must not kill. Civilians are innocent people, no matter who it is, IDF or Hamas. But the problem is, if you're going to call Hamas a terrorist group, and the IDF is killing innocent people, they're terrorists too. If American soldiers kill innocent people, they're terrorists too. We have to be morally consistent in our language, in our deeds. And this is what I pull from Hebrew scripture. This is what I pull from following a Palestinian Jew named Jesus.",

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D), MINORITY LEADER: Let me first just thank President Biden for convening us for this very important discussion to address important challenges that are confronting the American people. It was an intense meeting. It was an honest meeting. And, ultimately, it was a productive meeting. We discussed three issues. First, the need to avoid a government shutdown and to fund the government so that we can address the needs of the American people in terms of their health, their safety and their economic wellbeing. We are making real progress on the appropriations bills that are scheduled to lapse on March 1st and I'm cautiously optimistic that we can do what is necessary within the next day or so to close down these bills and avoid a government shutdown. At the same time, it may be important to come to an agreement that's bipartisan and anchored in common sense to extend the pending expiration of the eight additional bills that are scheduled to lapse on March 8th so that good faith, tough negotiations can continue in the absence of a government shutdown. Second, we discussed the urgent national security priorities of the American people as captured in the bipartisan, comprehensive Senate passed legislation. This is an existential moment for the free world. As it relates to being there for our democratic allies in Ukraine, in Israel, and in the Indo-Pacific. And also at the same period of time, making sure that we provide humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians who are in harm's way in Gaza or in other theaters of war through no fault of their own. Third, as Leader Schumer indicated, we had an open and honest and a candid, firm discussion about the border. We all agree that we have a broken immigration system and there is a need to address the challenges at the border in a thoughtful, bipartisan way. As Democrats, we support a safe, a strong, a secure and a humane border. We just need our House Republican colleagues not to play politics and engage in political stunts relative to the border, but to sit down as was done in the Senate and enter into good faith discussions about fixing our broken immigration system. As Democrats, we stand ready to do just that.",
