That's not good enough for the Starbucks workers, they say.But this strike is going to go to the 24th. And there's going to be more cities added as time goes on.

So, it sounds like we are getting more back to where we started, separating government funding from the conversation of suspending and raising the debt limit. But this is something that Republicans are now going to need to sell to Democrats, because they're going to need a lot of support to get this to pass Congress.But taking the - separating these issues and taking the debt limit out makes it a harder deal for Democrats to turn down. But, of course, they are very frustrated that these new negotiations are happening with them not involved. They are not in the room as these meetings are happening. So, we are hearing from House Speaker Mike Johnson that he wants to vote today, but he's in the process of trying to sell this plan to Republicans as 38 of them voted against the bill last night.",

I've had conversations with - with senators on both sides of the aisle who are tired of the bickering and the partisanship, who want to get constructive things done, like permitting reform, so we can actually deliver on the economic interests of the American people. So, I think, look, we're in the last days of an outgoing Congress. We've still got divided government. I want to remind folks, Joe Biden's still president. There's still a Senate Democrat majority.
