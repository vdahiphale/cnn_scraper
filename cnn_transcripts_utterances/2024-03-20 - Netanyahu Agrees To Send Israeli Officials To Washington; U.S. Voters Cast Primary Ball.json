What narrative have we constructed. And how we actually connect to the people to the crisis. I fear that sometimes we've sort of made it a distant phenomenon, kind of disconnected people from what's actually going on. And unfortunately now as we're seeing heatwaves increase in intensity and frequency and duration as we're seeing a greater proportion of tropical cyclones, in category 4 and 5 as we're seeing greater food insecurity as a result of climate change, those effects are being brought to people's doorstep. And I fear that we didn't quite prepare them for understanding just how much climate change will impact our daily lives. Look, there was a study done just a couple of years ago, interviewing 10,000 young people across ten countries and nearly half said that their emotions around climate change impact their daily lives. This is a real toll and I fear that we haven't quite gotten the messaging right.
