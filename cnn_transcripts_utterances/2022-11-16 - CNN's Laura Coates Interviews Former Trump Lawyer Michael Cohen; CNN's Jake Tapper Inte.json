On the night the GOP wins control of the House with a slim majority and the political world reacting to the defeated twice impeached former president's now third run for the White House, CNN talked to a one-time member of his inner circle because Michael Cohen is here.I want to know what he thinks about his former boss's candidacy with billionaire backers now turning on him, even if you saw a savage takedown from his favorite hometown tabloid. And you heard Mike Pence tonight in our CNN town hall saying that he was angry with the then-president in the days following the January 6th insurrection which was deadly, when rioters chanted, hang Mike Pence, and saying Trump was part of the problem. We've got more on all of that tonight. Plus, what would you do out there if your new boss told you, look, either commit to hardcore work or get out? That's the billionaire new Twitter owner Elon Musk is now telling his employees about this fork in the road email. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of chaos, frankly. I want to bring in Donald Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen. He is the host of the \"Mea Culp\"a podcast and author of \"Revenge: How Donald Trump Weaponized the U.S. Department of Justice Against His Critics.\" Michael, good to see you tonight. I actually -- I've been wanting to really hear your opinion and your reaction to the announcement. It's probably the worst kept secret in the political world. It was always the idea of not if but when. Well, when was last night. And I want to know what you think about the fact that Trump is running again for the presidency. MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  So, truth be told, I didn't think that he was going be making the announcement. You know, I was actually very sure that he was not because it didn't benefit him. The reason I say it doesn't benefit him is because he had that super PAC that had raised several hundreds of millions of dollars to which he was permitted to use 90% of it at his own discretion. Well, that now stops. On top of that, statistically, he knows that he cannot win a general election. He may not even be able to win the primary, which is why now I believe that he did choose to run because he started seeing all the great press that, for example, \"DeSanctimonious\" was getting, right, there in Florida and the fact that they're claiming that he is the future of the Republican Party. So, this angered Donald because he's not the -- you know, he's not the man in charge.",

Now, I mean, the one that came in today, I call it pretty savage, it was the idea of a headline and then way down below in that blue, page what, 26, is that Florida man makes announcement. I mean, that's pretty telling about how they're trying to literally downplay and downgrade.But not just the press. It's also a lot of the billionaire backers who are pulling out their money. The idea of you got someone like Schwarzman, the CEO, I think, of Blackstone, who gave I think $35 million to the midterm elections. You got Griffin, who is on the screen as well, $68.5 million at different points in time. You got of Ronald Lauder. These are all billionaire GOP donors that are now distancing themselves from him.

Also, I wonder, you know, watching his announcement last night, I remember in 2016, I remember really different rallies he's had even since then where there has been a different level of enthusiasm, charisma, bravado displayed. There's a different level -- a different tone.I wonder what you made of last night.

They certainly had him on the front page, which is taking over where Donald Trump believes that he should potentially or he should always be.Again, I don't think -- I don't think anything that came out of this town hall did any favors for Mike Pence. And one thing I want to make clear to Mike Pence, Donald does not have a remorseful bone in his body. He doesn't care about Mike Pence, he doesn't care about Karen, and he doesn't care about Charlotte, if you even know who she is. It's just who he is. Donald only cares about himself. And at that point in time, he was ecstatic. He was elated about the fact that these people were attacking the Capitol on his behalf, wearing his MAGA clothing and carrying his flag.

And Mike Pence still said that the responsibility is with the rioters.And I think that that's sort of his political calculation perhaps on his part where he knows that former President Trump is still very popular with the republican base, and so he's kind of distancing himself from Trump, saying there are better options in 2024, but at the same time trying not to alienate Trump's supporters.
