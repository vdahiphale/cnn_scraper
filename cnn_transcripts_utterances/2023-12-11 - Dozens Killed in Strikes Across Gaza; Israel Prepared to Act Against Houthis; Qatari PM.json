Take a listen. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I think the intent is there, but the results are not always manifesting themselves.

And not only did they survive; they became much more aggressive and powerful. And so I'm not sure if it's necessarily going to achieve the objective that Israel has in mind. And also take into account that part of the reason the Houthis are doing this, which is completely in line with what Hezbollah is trying to do in Lebanon, as well, is to distract Israel from what's happening in Gaza and also to deter U.S. and Israel from further expanding the war because of the consequences that it might have.

It would be very difficult for the Houthis to effectively target Israeli territories. It's a very difficult chart for them, geographically.

Zelenskyy will speak to all senators in a meeting in person, and he will meet, as well, with the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson.

As Ukraine remains bogged down in this counteroffensive, that hasn't necessarily changed the battle lines so far. But already, you're hearing some Republicans sort of oppose Zelenskyy's visit. J.D.

And many of its neighbors, including the Philippines, because Beijing claims sovereignty over almost the entirety of the 1.3 million-square-mile South China Sea. But there are both tactical and strategic regions why we are seeing more of these, what you -- as you described more dangerous encounters, because the Philippines, under President Marcos, has been increasingly publicizing these incidents, really trying to draw more global attentions to this issue. Because there is some urgency on the Filipino side. Part of what the Philippines has did -- has done, starting in 1999, was actually running ashore a World-War-II-era warship on the Second Thomas Shoal, which is part of the Spratly Islands, to stake its claim. And, for the most part, of the two decades since, they have been able to use that as a military outpost, rotating its marines in and out and re-supplying it with civilian ships. But since Chinese Leader Xi Jinping took power, we have seen, of course, the Chinese foreign policy and military operations in the region becoming more assertive and, some will say, aggressive. That's part of the reasons for this -- for these clashes. But time is running up for the Philippines. Because that ship is literally rusting away and disintegrating structurally. So a lot of analysts have said the Chinese are simply waiting for that ship to be washed away by water and then just swoop in and potentially seizing that territory and even militarizing it, as they have done in many other islands and islets in the region. So that's why time is critical for the Philippines, and they need to prepare that ship. And there are, of course, some reports the U.S. is advising the Philippines doing so. But strategically, though, what we have seen is Marcos expanding and deepening the Philippines cooperation with the U.S. since he took power by, for example, granting the U.S. additional access to Filipino bases and restarting joint air and sea patrols with the U.S. and Marcos himself. Even stopping in Hawaii, on its way back from the APEC summit to visit the U.S. Indo-Pacific command. That's why, from Beijing's perspective, the Philippines is now just doing the U.S. bidding to stir trouble, to challenge the Chinese supremacy and power to, quote unquote, \"surprise Chinese interests.\" So that's what the U.S. has very much seen as part of the saga, even though there is this perceived, quote unquote, \"thawing\" between Washington and Beijing.
