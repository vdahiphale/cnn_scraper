As Nikki Haley and RonDeSantis step up their attacks on each other, Donald Trump once again spending the morning in a Manhattan courtroom. Plus, I'm going to speak with former Republican Presidential Candidate Will Hurd. What does he think the candidates need to accomplish in New Hampshire and who might he support in November? Plus, congressional leaders will head to the White House in the coming hours to meet with President Biden about the supplemental spending bill, immigration, the border, central to those negotiations, and voters in 2024. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Wednesday, January 17. There are just six days until the New Hampshire primary and 292 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Welcome in. Less than a week from the pivotal Republican primary in New Hampshire with Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis wrapping up -- ramping up their attacks on Nikki Haley and on each other. In a CNN town hall last night, DeSantis argued that he, not Haley, is the candidate that can bring the party together. He warned that Republicans will lose in November if Trump and all of his legal baggage are the standard for the GOP. As for Haley, last month, she had to backtrack after she failed to cite slavery as the cause of the Civil War. Yesterday, she had this exchange on Fox News. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You played some of the comments of her campaign, doubled down on those comments, saying America has had racism but is not a racist country. Of course, we've had periods like segregation and slavery where racism was literally built into the fundamentals of this country. But, again, it's how that lands with the voters that could make a difference for her here in New Hampshire. She has events over the course of today, but also so does Ron DeSantis, and former President Trump, who will start his day in court in New York before making his way here. Both DeSantis and Haley are trying to chip into what has essentially been Trump dominance up to this point, which we saw in full display in Iowa just a few days ago at this point. Haley does seem better positioned to actually put up a serious fight here based on the polls coming in, some of which showing her within single digits of the former President. But, DeSantis is also still campaigning here, trying to find any sort of momentum here. His campaign saying this morning that they are going to really push for delegates across all of the states, including DeSantis visited South Carolina immediately after Iowa, which -- South Carolina votes after New Hampshire. So, clearly trying to make a footprint in some of these early states. The question, though, is if the New Hampshire performance in a few days' time now isn't ideal, isn't strong? Does it show him in strong footing? How long does that campaign actually last? And it's a big question for Nikki Haley as well, if they don't have a strong showing here since they've put so many resources into this particular state, is a major question. But, the best part about it is all the polls that lead up to this matter less compared to what the voters actually say in their ballot boxes in just a few days here.",

She is a senior Royal, got full private care, of course, and best medical care. I don't know what the explanation is for that period of recovery because we don't know exactly what the surgery was. There was some concern about it. But then they confirmed it wasn't cancerous. She is out of action now, obviously, for public engagements, and they've also canceled all of the future travel as well. So, as far as the princess is concerned, there is concern, but they are saying she is recovering as much as she could, and she is very fit and healthy. Does a lot of sports.

The other campaigns have to put signs up on the highways, and Trump has nailed to people's barns. Jim, can you explain a little bit about where you see the undeclared segment of the electorate breaking this time in terms of how many of them actually vote in the Republican primary? Because some of this polling that shows Haley close to Trump seems to rely on a massive number of undeclared's (ph) coming into the Republican primary.

And so, we can goback in time and look at different cycles when one side had activity and other didn't. In 2000 with the McCain-Bush and then Bradley and Gore, Bill Bradley did a pretty good job of hanging on to that undeclared vote for a time but down the stretch faded. And so, that energy really migrated over to John McCain. And so, I think this time, notwithstanding Dean Phillips's efforts, there is -- he is really not been able to make that happen. There is not much interest or enthusiasm on that side. So, what the clerics will, I think, to the extent they vote, they will vote in the Republican primary. And Nikki Haley has made pitches for them. She has done that through, I think, the way she has campaigned, what she has talked about. And it says -- what it says to me is she is trying to build a broad coalition, which is what you try and do in New Hampshire. Her theory of the case has been to do that versus what Trump or DeSantis have done. But, as you pointed out, you're absolutely right. The states that fall in New Hampshire are constructed differently. Closed primaries, a different set of circumstances. So, I think she has campaigned smartly for New Hampshire. And she has put herself at least within shouting distance. Pulling off will be a real upset. But, it does depend heavily on having undeclared voters who do vote and oftentimes can be conservative, just not affiliated with a party, come out next Tuesday.",

And look, Chris Christie punched Trump in the face every day here in New Hampshire for nine months. And that got him 12 percent and a pocket watch into retirement. So, that clearly wasn't the right approach. And I think at this point, clearly, part of Haley's message and part of what I think makes her interesting to people is she isn't next generation. I mean, speaking as a Gen Xer, I'd love to see a fellow Gen Xer have a chance at leading here. I think -- I worry we're going to miss that opportunity. But, it's late in the game to do that. I think she has done a great job, building herself, to get herself into striking distance. I mean, that was a big hill to climb. She has got another one to climb now over the next six days.
