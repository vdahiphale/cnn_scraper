And he's going to continue to push forward.Now, that being said, if -- I think we start to see some really bad polls and Democrats running for reelection or running in some of these competitive seats start to really freak out about their own electoral chances we might start to see a shift. But as the story that we wrote today in The Washington Post says, the Biden people are quite happy that no real well-known Democrat elected official has called for him to step aside. That, in their book, is a win. They know that they have a lot of work to do. I think the path forward is how do they change course? How do they go forward?

They want to see people sort of fall in line here.Vice President Harris is obviously someone who would be obviously the perfect person to sort of fill in that role if Biden were no longer to be able to run. She has access to the campaign. She would be the person who has the legal right to fundraising money there. And so, we're seeing some of the biggest names in Democratic politics. We're seeing Obama. We're seeing the Clintons come out strongly in support of Biden. I think the frenzy right now is really mostly with donors. It's with DNC members. And the campaign is really trying to overcome that. They're fiercely on defense. We've seen multiple memos this weekend just continuing to defend the president here. They're really saying that they have a lot of time. They feel like we have 100 days until the election. They're trying to say that there is a short-term memory of the news cycle here.

And we had been hearing these concerns for months, Kasie. As you know, people have been worried about Biden's ability to carry the ticket. I wrote a story with my colleague Paul Kane about this reverse coattails effect where the -- where the down-ballot members -- senators and members of Congress -- were going to lift Biden up. And they are worried about him being a drag on the ticket and not just losing the presidential race but losing the House and the Senate.

Obviously, it's the weekend. It's the July Fourth week so we may not have a clear picture immediately. And honestly, more time for Joe Biden's campaign where there are not Democrats out calling for him to step aside is a win in their book.

And I think that determination -- there's two real things, right? The first is, of course, the Constitution provides for impeachment as it relates to behavior that's pretty bad, right? High crimes and misdemeanors.And then I think it really does provide for -- though it's a case of first impression, it's never really been before any court which is what can the president be prosecuted for, and because we've seen a pardon as it relates to Nixon, of course, right -- he was pardoned by Ford. We saw Clinton give up his law license, et cetera. So I think there is some contemplation for prosecution thereafter. The question is what is prosecutable, and should it be limited to this official-unofficial acts or should there just be a blanket determination that says if you commit a crime, you do the time, so to speak. And, you know, Judge Tanya Chutkan, at the district court level, said it pretty clearly, saying the president certainly has a lot of concerns and really, intending to commit federal crime should not be one of them. And so it really will be interesting to see how the court parses this out and whether or not they just remove the question from the table and say that everybody certainly has to act in a way that's in accordance with the law. You, as the president, have the duty to faithfully execute the laws. And so, how ironic would it be, Kasie, you have the duty to execute the laws faithfully, but you don't necessarily have to follow them. And that's what, really, I'm looking to see whether the Supreme Court really take that seriously, grapples with that issue, and just moves us on in a country where everybody could be faithful and secure that no matter who commits the crime, ultimately, you're going to be held accountable.",

      "sentences": "All right, welcome back.This morning, as Democrats grapple with calls to replace Joe Biden as their nominee, the president's campaign is trying to move on from his alarming debate performance. Over the weekend, we learned Biden's condition on stage apparently surprised many of his own staffers. New reporting from Axios revealing the president's closest aides shielded him from White House personnel. They write, \"Biden's behavior stunned many in the White House in part because Biden's closest aides took steps early in this term to essentially rope off the president. Even the White House's residence staff, which serves the first family in the mansion's living quarters, has been kept at arm's length.\" [05:50:07] Joining me now is the reporter who wrote that story, Axios national political correspondent, Alex Thompson. Alex, good morning to you. Can you explain more about what you've learned that led to this report? And also, just kind of take us inside what's going on with the family right now. ALEX THOMPSON, NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, AXIOS (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, absolutely. So basically, I have been gathering sort of string and heard these little bit of stories about they don't really see the president that much. And these aren't just low-level staffers but mid-level and even the staffers that are very close to the top. They only see the president every once in a while. There's really only a core group of a dozen to 20 people that see him on a regular basis. And I can tell you that there is not just shock among some of these White House staffers but real anger, too. Because, in some ways, you have the same things that the senior staff were telling reporters, and Democrats, and donors that the president is sharp. There's no acuity issue. This is a right-wing narrative. They were telling the staff, too. And now the staff is looking and saying it's not even just about whether or not Joe Biden can still pull this off -- can still beat Donald Trump -- there's still deep concerns now about him doing the job he is running for in 2028-2029 at 85 and 86 years old. Now, in terms of what's going on with the family, basically what you're seeing is the family take the wheel. This -- Biden's political career has always been a family endeavor. They have always been involved in his political campaigns from the very beginning. And during times of crises they often over and over sort of withdraw and hunker down, and that's what you're seeing now. The fact that they went to Camp David was not this intervention meeting to get out of the race. Instead, it was a rallying around effect. I don't think you have a summit thinking about getting out of the race and then do an Annie Lebovitz photoshoot, which is what they were doing in Camp David yesterday. So, basically, what you are seeing is sort of the inner circle just already pretty small getting even smaller.",

I think they are not understanding some of the concerns about sort of acuitying his fitness for the job that the debate performance has done.Now, in terms of the logistics of how this happened, the Annie Lebovitz thing had been in the works for a while. They had already done portraits of previous -- of previous presidents and his. And the president's family sort of, I think, saw this as an opportunity to sort of be embraced by the establishment, sort of. But honestly, some people very close to the Bidens that are longtime Biden defenders thought it sort of spoke to the fact that maybe some of them have fallen a little bit in love with the life.",
