This as Russia is showing a lot of interest lately in Norway. Why?Plus, it's a state that should have been a slam dunk for Democrats. But why is the New York governor's race suddenly so close? And no word or sighting of former President Hu Jintao after he was abruptly escorted out of the communist party's meeting. This as anti- Xi protesters are now writing their messages on the walls of public bathrooms. It is the story you'll see here first. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, exhausted, emotional and not always rational. Putin's former speechwriter says the Russian leader knows he cannot survive losing his war in Ukraine. Because he is almost assuredly to lose power if that happens, and losing power means jail at best. This warning coming as criticism of Putin's war tonight was loud and clear on Russia's state TV. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Russia initiated the special operation having overestimated its military strength. It is the eighth month already.

You will hear from Putin's speech writer in just a moment because he is warning of Putin's compromised state of mind. It comes as Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, doubling down today on Russia's claim that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb. It is a claim that is being dismissed as a possible false flag justifying a Russian nuclear response. The U.S., U.K. and France even issuing this rare joint statement andit reads in part, quote: The defense ministers of each of our countries spoke to Russian defense minister, Sergei Shoygu, at his request. Our countries made clear that we all reject Russia's transparent false allegations that Ukraine is preparing to use a dirty bomb on its own territory. The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation. Putin laying the groundwork for a false flag attack that allows for nuclear escalation because his conventional forces are losing. Tonight we found more new video of Russian soldiers talking about their dire reality. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  Just take a look at our uniforms. Each of these we bought ourselves. All of our gear we purchased ourselves -- our masks, our combat boots, our gloves. One guy bought a flat jacket for 60,000 rubles. By the same evening the price had already gone up to 80,000 rubles. Now that same flak jacket cost 100,000 to 150,000 rubles. We know how this works. But every time we go to another store the price keeps going up two times what it was before. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  I will just add a comment about the weapons, which were rusty and jammed. Such weapons are not fit for battle. We haven't been fed for 2 days. There wasn't even any water. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is the person who we now know is running this war, making day-to- day detailed decisions. What is the significance of that for the war itself? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  You know, Erin, there's a lot to break down about the reports you just had. One of which is Mr. Gallyamov, who just spoke to you. I served -- I'm afraid to admit this, but I served for a year as a speechwriter to a four-star general. When you do that kind of work, you went into the individual's head, you know their intellect, you know their emotion, you know what they're thinking because you have to portray their words on paper. What he's talking about is seeing Mr. Putin in this case very different than what he saw him when he was in a more rational state. It tells me that something we all know, Mr. Putin is scrambling. He is trying to address things that he can't control right now, and when you're talking about the use of nuclear weapons or the detonation of a dirty bomb. And, by the way, Mr. Gallyamov did not really truly understand what a dirty bomb is. It is a nuclear weapon. It is a normal bomb surrounded by nuclear material, very different but it's something that could cause Mr. Putin to then retaliate with nuclear weapons. And the very fact that Mr. Putin has now talked to -- Mr. Shoigu -- Mr. Shoigu has talked to the U.S., the U.K., France and now Turkey tells me he's trying to co-opt decision-making in NATO if he does consider using the potential of using a nuclear weapon.

And so, we'll get a sense how much longer the Supreme Court is going to weigh what Lindsey Graham is arguing.Remember, what he is arguing is that his status as a senator means that under the Constitution, he cannot be questioned because of the protections of the speech or debate clause. Two courts have ruled that, you know, the speech and debate protections aren't all- encompassing. That certainly his communications with Georgia lawmakers about the election results in 2020 certainly should not be protected under the Constitution.

And, you know, that's kind of where we are often in American life. What -- the reason I wanted to do the Lincoln book was to understand not only how he did what he did but why he did it. Why did this man, who was an antislavery politician but who kept losing. He lost two Senate seats, two Senate races. He only won 39 percent of the vote in 1860. A civil war ensues. And yet he stands by the antislavery principle. And why did he do it? Well, he did it because it was the morally right thing to do. And at a certain point, politics has to be about something other than the accumulation and maintenance of power. If it's not about more than that, then we fall into a state of kind of war against all. And I worry that we are in a very, very bad place in this country.

Was this really health? Was this power struggle on display? Was this the former top leader taking a stand? Now, I have spoken to several experts who say they don't buy the pure health explanation, partly because the party Congress is a highly choreographed event, and this moment happened after foreign journalists were allowed in the room, which is why the world is able to see this event. Something else that's interesting is that many people also see this as symbolic regardless of the explanation. It represents the exit of a man who represented collective rule, who ruled with more balanced leadership while Xi Jinping, we have learned, has stacked all of the top leadership positions with his closest allies and proteges, leaving out several members who were closer to Hu Jintao's orbit, including the Premier Li Keqiang, the current premier who you can see in that video, he taps on the shoulder before he exits, Erin.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WANG (voice-over):  Graffiti with angry messages scribbled all over bathroom stalls might be a common sight in much of the world. But not in China. The Chinese characters scrawled in this Beijing bathroom reads, anti-dictatorship, anti-COVID tests. Messages like this are spreading in bathrooms in several Chinese cities. It's because public restrooms are one of the only places in tightly surveilled China without security cameras. This graffiti says: Remove dictator and national traitor, Xi Jinping. Some of them even written in English. No to COVID tests. Yes to food. No to lockdown. Yes to freedom. No to great leader. Yes to vote. Don't be a slave. Be a citizen. Their messages copy the slogans written on two banners hung on a busy overpass in Beijing, a rare protest in the capital just days before the start of the communist party congress. The banners cleaned up, then quickly censored from Chinese social media. But it didn't stop people from replicating the act around the world. The same slogans hung on London's Westminster bridge and draped over the Chinese embassy in London. But inside China, public displays of dissent towards xi are extremely rare. It could lead to long prison sentences or even worse. We spoke to one man who graffitied in a bathroom. We're shielding his identity because of fears of retribution. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I had to wear a mask and when I was writing, I was worried someone might catch me.
