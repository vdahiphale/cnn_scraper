We are now on day six. Inside that courthouse, this historic criminal trial underway. First order of business on this Tuesday morning is the judge holding a hearing on these alleged violations of the gag order, which he put in place. That gag order bars the former president from discussing a number of people involved with this case. Basically everybody except for the judge and the DA. He is not allowed to talk publicly about witnesses, about the jury, about the court staff and their families, about the prosecutors. And so right now, he's hearing from prosecutors who say they can point to at least ten times they believe the former president has violated that gag order. They are asking that he be fined $1,000 for each one of those violations. The former president himself has railed against the gag order multiple times, said he's being silenced. His lawyers are arguing that social media posts, his social media posts don't actually violate the order. CNN national correspondent Brynn Gingras here with me outside the courthouse. So, they're going through sort of the nuts and bolts of this right now, according to our colleagues who are there in the courtroom following it, talking about those specifically, prosecutors saying they believe that he violated this knowingly and willingly.",

So, that's the first time we're hearing this argument with what Trump has actually said to the cameras. The rest, as you mentioned, are from social media posts, and they're going through them, like you said, each by each one explaining why they believe it has been violated. They talk about how there's a tweet talking about Stormy Daniels, who's of course at the center of this case, and she's going to be a witness in this case. They said he called her a sleaze bag. Her and her former attorney, Michael Avenatti, and says this is an example of him attacking their credibility. He talked about the same thing with Michael Cohen, another major witness, of course, and foe of the former president.

They have to keep building their case if there's any hope of reining him in andany hope of giving the judge a good enough record to show this pattern of violations. There are a couple of nuances to the judge's order. This question of whether if he is quoting someone else, if Trump is quoting someone else or reposting it, and that probably has to get sorted out. Frankly, I think the judge needs to do away with some of the nuances to his order. I've said this before, adopt more of a Will Smith style. Keep the whole trial out of your mouth, minus the violence part. I think the judge is going to want to proceed incrementally. Today may be his first opportunity to really put Trump on notice, to say, look, there's this whole pattern of violations. You're obviously violating the spirit of my order. Maybe you can argue about the language. I can correct that. Probably hit him with these rather small fines. Really just making the record. And this will really, I think, serve as the true warning shot to Trump to say, I'm taking this seriously. You can't affect the integrity of this trial by making these kinds of comments. And of course, it's not just the integrity of the, let's say, demeanor of Trump in the courtroom or outside the courtroom, but speaking this way also can intimidate witnesses, can intimidate jurors if they happen to hear of it, even though they're supposed to avoid media because people get the impression, you know, if he can say these things about witnesses as the trial's going on, if he talks his way about the judge then, you know, what could he possibly do to us if I'm on the jury, if I'm a witness?

I mean, it's a First Amendment issue in terms of what people can say. There is a sense that if you're saying something about politics, it's like a more protected class of speech. But his argument, Trump's argument is a little bit flawed here. He's saying, well, people are making political attacks on me, so I can say anything I want to about them. The problem is, he's not on the campaign trail. This isn't a political debate. It's a criminal case. And the people he's attacking are people involved in the criminal case. So, that really changes it because you are able to be controlled in the context of a criminal case. He naturally wants to turn everything about the case into a political issue, but it's not.

So, prosecutors, you know, are asking for of the ten offending posts, they want them removed from aid (ph) or on social media tour (ph) on his campaign website (ph). They want them removed. And they also want the court to, quote, remind him incarceration is an option, should it be necessary. Could be a little tough because we're also dealing with the Secret Service there if he is put behind bars. And Todd Blanche has just come up to say there was absolutely no willful violation of the gag order. Just bringing everybody up to speed, Shan, when we look at that, though, the fact that prosecutors are saying, look, I want you to remind the former president that violating this order could, in fact, lead to time behind bars.

And first of all, the judge is going to be hesitant for anyone. They're just not going to say, oh, you violate the gag order, off to jail you go. He wants to make sure there's a full record that shows, look, I've tried to warn you. I've tried to fine you, and nothing works, and then you're going to jail. So, the judge is going to want a very strong record with a history of these violations before he takes that step. But the Secret Service issue, to me, is just not that big of an issue. I think there's no reason why he can't be protected in jail, and he's not going to be in there for years over a contempt violation. I think the judge can do that, but he needs a strong record.",

Outside Manhattan Criminal Court, a gag order hearing in Donald Trump's hush money trial isunderway at this hour in that courthouse behind me.

Usually, if someone is in violation of a court order, there's a lot of arguments on paper that happen, and then the court sort of says, puts the fear of God into the defendant, and things correct themselves and they move on. But this is such an unusual situation with Donald Trump as the former president, with Michael Cohen, that key witness that he was repeatedly saying things about out there publicly here, too, talking about him over and over and over again, clearly trying to poke him, provoke him, even potentially.

You know, there were three components to the gag order: witnesses, court personnel and DA personnel and jurors, and they have different criteria for when a violation occurs. And I think he's going to have to be clearer about what constitutes a violation in each of these categories. For example, does reposting count? Or does he have to speak kind of originally? And then what does it mean when you talk about the witnesses to say something that involves their participation in the case? And then finally, with Michael Cohen, it's so challenging because no one has control over him. So, Michael Cohen's going to continue to speak. He's not a cooperating witness, so the prosecutors can't really do anything about him. And is it fair for Michael Cohen to be out there calling Trump a liar, saying all these things about Trump and Trump being unable to respond? And if there is some part of the judge that says, well, maybe Michael Cohen's in a different boat because he, of course, is not intimidated, I don't think, as opposed to some of the other possible witnesses.
