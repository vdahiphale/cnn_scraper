The agency says that it has spread at an alarming rate in long-term hospitals and other healthcare facilities. It's being called candida auris, and has been detected in more than half the country. CDC data shows that more than 1,400 cases were reported 2001, a 200 percent increase from 2019. It's not a risk to people who are healthy, but it can be a very serious danger to people who have compromised immune systems, including the elderly.",

As you remember, the former attorney, Alex Murdaugh, was sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and younger son. Now investigators have reopened the investigation into the death of 19-year-old Stephen Smith. He was found dead in the middle of the road near the Murdaugh family home - Murdaugh home back in 2015.Now, Smith was a classmate of Murdaugh's older son, Buster. And questions remain about how Smith died. His family now pushing for Smith's body to be exhumed. And for more we turn to CNN's Dianne Gallagher. She joins us live from Charlotte, North Carolina, this morning. Good morning to you. The Smith family attorney says this is about seeking justice and has nothing to do with the Murdaugh's.
