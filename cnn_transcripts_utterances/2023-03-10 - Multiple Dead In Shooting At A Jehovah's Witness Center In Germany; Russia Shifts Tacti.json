Why they're using them now. Unprecedented. Christiane Amanpour conversation with an American hostage being held in Iran's most notorious prison. And its official, say hello to the prince and princess of Sussex. But we begin in Hamburg, Germany where police are investigating a deadly shooting at a Jehovah's Witness center. Beliefs were seen entering the three storey building with guns drawn. According to local media, six people were killed and seven others wounded. Authorities say it's not clear whether the shooter is among the dead. According to police an event was taking place at the Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall at the time of the attack, which is believed to be an isolated incident. There is no word yet on the motive. We will bring you more information when it becomes available. Kyiv says Russia is switching tactics and it strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Moscow unleashed what's been called an unprecedented barrage of missiles and drones across Ukraine on Thursday. The attacks left at least six people dead and more than 20 wounded. Ukraine says the power is now back on in most regions that initially lost it. Kyiv also says Moscow use a new tactic this time, firing different types of missiles and drones at the same time hoping to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses, or that included some missiles that Ukraine cannot shoot down such as Russia's hypersonic Kinzel weapon. Despite all that President Zelenskyy says his nation is still standing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We have already shown what Ukraine is capable of.

You can trace all the way back to south of Hawaii. This plume of moisture there it is in the satellite loop you can see all the cloud cover and that streams right into the state of California so this will be a milder storm, meaning that's going to produce rain on top of that impressive snowpack.

There will still be snow across the highest elevations but this will be more of a rain event throughout the Central Valley all the way to the coastline.

But what Doctors Without Borders has told CNN is that this clinic in the city Soleil neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, a neighborhood that has long been known, it's been with the most dangerous in the city, that has simply deteriorated. That is not a question of gang violence of crime. It is an all-out war that described other clinics as being on the front line of this award that is going on between rival gangs. They say that they've had patients are targeted as they've tried to go to the clinic that is not safe, that there have been stray bullets that have hit their clinic, and simply for the time being, at least, that they cannot continue to provide medical services in this part of the Haitian capital. And that will mean for the hundreds of thousands of people that live in Soleil that they will not have access, many of them at least to any medical services. Because this is one of the -- we are told one of the few clinics that is operating in this part of Port-au-Prince. And what that will mean as the gang violence has gotten worse and worse over the last several months is that the aid groups that provide these very basic services because these are services the government in many parts of Haiti is not able to provide and they will simply become unavailable to many the Haitians who desperately need the services and Haitian government has called on the international community to provide more assistance to the Haitian police to combat these gangs. And there has been assistance by the part of several foreign governments but what the Haitian government has asked for actual pour military boots on the ground has not come -- a few countries, no countries at this point, seem to be willing to provide that. So as Haiti, the situation gets worse and worse for the people on the ground, Haitians that are trying to go to work, trying to go to their school or trying to just receive medical attention.

Today I'm in the general ward, the situation in the general ward is far better than in the corner hell that used to be in at the detention center.It's far from a pleasant place to be in, but everything becomes relative. It's still extremely difficult the very basic fact that I am denied many of the rights of a prisoner because I am a hostage. I don't know how to convey that. I see hardened criminals. I see member of Dash. I see people who are human traffickers have more rights than I do. And I dk. So yes general circumstances in the general ward are ok and I would say that we do the best that we can to adapt to our circumstances. I personally take comfort to use that word again, the fact that I know that I am doing everything I can to fight this injustice. I want to say that my situation today is very different than the first 27 months of my arrest when I was still being held at the detention center. There my situation was really precarious. I did not feel safe at all. And I want to mention that the Obama administration knew exactly, exactly how unsafe I was. I make sure of that. At that point I could see that my captors had made it a mission to strip me of any semblance of human decency. I spent months caged. I spent months caged in a solitary cell. It was the size of a closet, sleeping on the floor, being fed like a dog from under the door. And honestly, that was the least of my troubles. And to this day -- I'm sorry.
