What most people agree on is the need for governments to catch up now. To assess all of this and to separate the hysteria from the hyperbole from the facts, we brought together a panel of leaders in the field of artificial intelligence. Nina Schick, Global A.I. advisor and author of \"Deep Fakes,\" renowned computer science professor, Dame Wendy Hall, Connor Leahy, an A.I. researcher who is the CEO of Conjecture, and Priya Lakhani, an A.I. government advisor and the CEO of CENTURY Tech. Welcome all of you to this chat, to coin a phrase. I mean, it's such a massively important issue. And I just thought I'd start by announcing that when I woke up and had my morning coffee, A.I. is all over this page on the good, on the bad, on the questions, on the indifference.

And I guess, what I would say what keeps me up at night is that a couple million years ago, the common ancestor between chimpanzees and humans split into two subspecies. One of these developed a roughly three times larger brain than the other species. One of them goes to the moon and builds nuclear weapons. One of them doesn't. One of them is at the complete mercy of the other and one of them has full control. I think this kind of relationship to very powerful technology can happen. I'm not saying (INAUDIBLE) it is the default outcome unless we take our agency, we see that we are in control, we are the ones building these technologies, and as a society, we decide to go a different path.",

The E.U. is issuing its own laws and guidance. But what we want to see is execution, Christiane. And, you know, on the sort what keeps you up at night, I felt sorry for my husband because actually while I -- what keeps me up is actually other issues, such as things like disinformation with generative A.I. And I've got two children who are 11 and 13, are they going to grow up in a world where they can trust information and what is out there, or are these technologies, because of lack of execution, on the side of policymakers, means that actually it's sort of a free-for-all, you know, bad actors have access to this technology and you don't know what to trust? But actually, the biggest thing that keeps me up at night is a flip from what we've heard here. It's, are we -- as a human race, are we going to benefit from the opportunities that artificial intelligence also enables us, you know, to have? So, we often talk -- and Christiane, you know, forgive me, but for the last six months it's all been about ChatGPT in generative A.I. That is really important. And that's where a lot of this discussion should be placed. But we also have traditional A.I. So, we have artificial intelligence where we have been using data, we have been classifying, we have been predicting, we have been looking at scans and spotting cancer where we've got lack of radiologists, right, and we can augment radiology, we can augment teaching and learning. So, how are we also going to ensure that all around society we don't actually exacerbate the digital divide, right, but we leverage artificial intelligence, what the best it can provide to help us in the areas of health care, education, security. So, you know, it's scary to think we are not using it to its full advantages while we also must focus on the risks and the concerns. And so, really, I sort of have this jewel sort of what keeps me up at night, as I said, I sort of feel sorry for my husband because I'm sort of tapping on his shoulder going, and what about this and what about that?",

If we tried to regulate the automobile industry then, we wouldn't have gotten very far because we wouldn't -- couldn't see what was going to be coming in another hundred years. And I think we have to move very fast to deal with the things that are immediate threats, and I think that disinformation, the fake news, we have two major democratic elections next year, the U.S. president and our election here, whenever it is, could even be at the same time, and there are other elections, and the disinformation, the fake news, the pope in a puffer jacket moments, these could really mess up these elections. And I think there is an immediate threat to potential democratic process.

We have facial recognition, face recognition on our smartphones. Actually, with the rise of generative A.I., biometric security is seriously a threat.

The reason why these godfathers of artificial intelligence are all quoting and, you know, writing and leaving big companies and stating that there is a risk is not to have a dystopian versus utopian conversation, because that's not healthy to get to the issue if the way in which this technology, this called transformer models, it's this idea of foundational A.I. models, which we don't need to get into the details of, but it's about training a system and models that goes beyond the one task that it was trained for, where it can then copy its learning and then do other tasks, then copy its learning and then do other tasks, then copy its learning. And so, the idea is that when I teach you something or you teach me something, we've got that transference of information that we then learn. That's the human process, and we want to teach it to 1,000 other people, we've got to transfer that and they've got to learn and they've got to take it in. The learning algorithm of A.I. is a lot more efficient than the human brain in that sense, right? It just copies and it learns, right? And so, all of this conversation is, there is no AGI right now. I think everyone's in -- even the godfathers of A.I. are in total agreement of the fact that's not there now. But what they are looking at is, wow, the efficiency of this A.I. is actually better than the human brain, which we hadn't consider before. The way in which it works, we hadn't considered before. So, all that they are saying is, look, it is -- I think people should be excited and opportunistic about A.I. and they should also be a bit terrified in order to be able to get this right.",

Similarly, the PC unlocked the bottleneck of road computation. So, it made it less necessary. You know, the word computer used to refer to a job that people had, to actually crunch numbers. Now, this bottleneck was unlocked and new opportunities presented themselves. But just because it's happened in the past, it doesn't mean there is an infinite number of bottlenecks.

And it isn't necessarily that A.I. is going to automate you entirely. However, will it be integrated into the processes of all knowledge and creative work? Absolutely. Which is why it is so interesting to see what's unfolding right now in Hollywood with the SAG strike and the writer strike, because the entertainment industry just happens to be at the very cusp of this. And when they went on that strike, you know, when Fran Drescher gave that kind of very powerful speech, the way that she positioned herself was saying, this is kind of labor versus machines, machines taking our jobs.

Now, this used to be something that would take them an entire career as a researcher to achieve, but now, with the of A.I., to help their kind of design and creative process, intelligent process, being distilled down to hours and days. So, I think there will be intense productivity gains in those various kinds of reports that have begun to quantify this. A recent one from McKenzie saying that up to $4.4 trillion in value added to the economy over just 63 different used cases for productivity. So, if there is this abundance, you know, the question then is, how is this distributed in society?

So, you know, if you have enough radiographers looking at every breast cancer scan, can you use artificial intelligence to augment that? So, actually, you can ideally spot more tumors earlier, save lots of lives. But then, you also have that human in the loop, you have that human who is able to do that sort of quality check of the artificial intelligence. In education, we have 40,000 teachers short in the U.K., we're millions of teachers short worldwide. Can we provide that personalized education to every child while classroom sizes are getting larger, but then provide teachers with the insights about where is the timely, targeted intervention right now?

We certainly don't have a stick. We don't have investors in the private market or shareholders trying to push companies towards any kind of, you know, moral or ethical framework for how we should be rolling out artificial intelligence. And finally, I don't think we have the luxury of time.

So, it's -- I think that it is a sum of the things that we, as human beings, have been putting in. And these large language models, if they are trained on conversations and tons and tons of web pages where an opinion like that could exist, again, this framework is not intelligent in and of itself to understand what the context is, what a fact is, it's really just kind of a predictive analysis of what words should come after the previous word. So, if it comes up with a phrase like that, it doesn't necessarily care about the veracity, the truth of that phrase, it will just generate what it thinks is a legitimate response. And again, if you look at that sentence, it's a well-constructed sentence. And sure, that's as good as sentence as any other.

But the inverse is actually true. Over the past 15 years, at least in the United States, one in four journalists have been laid off or is now out of the profession completely. And lots of forces are converging on that, but if you are caring about the bottom line first, and a lot of the companies that are in the journalism business today are not nonprofits, are not doing this for public service good, they are wanting to return benefits to shareholders if they see these tools as an opportunity to cut costs, which is what they will do, then I don't think it automatically says, well, guess what, we will take that sports writer that had to stay late and just do the box scores for who won and who lost the game, and that women or that man is now going to be freed up to do fantastic, important, civically minded journalism.

Now, when those smaller newsrooms are under the gun to try to make profits and try to stay profitable, I don't think that these particular kinds of tools are going to allow them to say, let's go ahead and hire another human being to go do important work. I think there's a lot more cost cutting that's going to come to local journalism centers because they are going to say, well, we can just use a bot for that. What do most people come to our website for? Well, they come for traffic and they come for weather. And guess what? Weather is completely automated now and we could probably have an artificial robot or an artificial intelligence kind of a face, like you or me, just give the traffic report, if that's what needs to be -- anything else.",

But that is not necessarily what the cost benefit analysis is going to say. Well, maybe, we can cut back on the field reporting and we can have this person do more and more of the headlines, as the audience gets more used to it, just like they've gotten used to people video conferencing over zoom, maybe people are not going to mind. Maybe people will develop parasocial relationships with these bots, who knows? Again, this is like very early days.
