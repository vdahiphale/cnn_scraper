A live look at Capitol Hill on this Monday after Thanksgiving weekend. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. The Biden Justice Department has been politicized. That's this message -- the message this morning from, no, not just Donald Trump, but from President Joe Biden himself. The president issuing a full and unconditional pardon to his son, Hunter, after repeating insistently -- repeatedly insisting in public that he wouldn't do it. And to defend his decision, the president adopted an argument that could have come straight out of Donald Trump's playbook. Blame your political opponents and claim unfair persecution. President Biden said this: quote, \"The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\" The president adding, quote, \"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son, and that is wrong,\" end quote. President Biden pardon -- pardoning his son not just for the gun crimes for which he was convicted and not just for the tax crimes, for which he pled guilty. Instead, Biden gave his son an extraordinarily sweeping pardon for any and all crimes he committed, may have committed, or even merely been involved in at any point in the last ten years. That broad language, unlike any in recent history and reminiscent only of President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon for, quote, \"all offenses against the United States,\" end quote, that the former president had or may have committed during his entire presidency. Trying to explain his decision to Americans, President Biden made a personal appeal. He said this, quote, \"I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision,\" he said last night. Understand? Americans might, though they'll have to be forgiven for thinking that all of this was off the table. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The -- the Justice Department is politicized, right? And now Joe Biden has said that his Justice Department, under his administration, was what was pursuing these cases, was what had gotten the guilty verdict in the -- the gun case and was -- we were waiting for the sentencing in this tax case. That's a -- that's an issue for Joe Biden to face now, when he has put himself forward, not just as an opposition to Trump, but as someone who is standing on principle and on norms and on keeping in -- in that way. I do think, though, it's important that we can hold multiple thoughts in our heads at the same time, right? That Donald Trump will, perhaps use this. His, certainly, allies will use this as justification or something to point to when he does things that -- whether it's pardoning people who were involved in the January 6th riot or other things. But it's not like Donald Trump wasn't going to do some of those things anyway. Right?

And they're left with an aged president leaving, former head of the Democratic Party after being president, and now he's done this.

But \"The Journal\" sort of interestingly, they really went after Jim Comey in this op-ed. They say the FBI's abuses under Comey were the worst since J. Edgar Hoover, as documented by the Justice Department I.G. And they referenced the special counsel, John Durham. FISA officials lied to get a warrant against Trump campaign official Carter Page. They lied about disinformation in the Steele dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign. But they reference John Bolton, who told our Jake Tapper over the weekend that Trump has nominated Kash Patel to be his Lavrenty Beria, who was of course, the head of Joseph Stalin's secret police.

I think that the way those two men handled this on the Senate Judiciary Committee holds the fate of Kash Patel's nomination. For sure, there are probably two or three Republicans who could vote no.
