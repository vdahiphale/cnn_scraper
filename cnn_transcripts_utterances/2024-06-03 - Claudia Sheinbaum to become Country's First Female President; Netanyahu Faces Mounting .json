And in just one hour, possibly the most famous doctor in the United States, Anthony Fauci will testify about the COVID-19 origin and response. Well, stock markets in New York, will open in around 30 minutes from now let's check in on those futures. And as you can see, DOW is slightly to the negative, you've got NASDAQ and S&amp;P pointing to positive starts. Of course, we are officially in the second half of 2024 bit of momentum being built here as we await a lot more economic data that will drive the markets going forward. All right, we'll check in on those numbers as we expect the opening bell in New York. But for now, we begin at the start of a historic New Era in Mexico. The country has elected its first ever female president, Claudia Sheinbaum officially winning Sunday's election, according to the votes counted so far by Mexico's National Electoral institutes. Sheinbaum is the Former Mayor of Mexico City, as well as being a climate scientist. She says her leadership will be inclusive of all Mexicans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CLAUDIA SHEINBAUM, MEXICAN PRESIDENT-ELECT: Our duty is and always will be to look after each Mexican without distinctions.

TheMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says that this is perhaps the largest numbers, number of votes any President has gotten in the history of Mexico, which is something that he celebrates, because he feels like it's a validation of his ideas. Claudia Sheinbaum started her political career in the year 2000. She became the Ministry of the Environment here in Mexico City when he was the head of the government. And as since they have developed a robust relationship to the point that now she's poised to succeed him as the head of the government. But she is an accomplished woman on her own right. In fact, she was part of a group of about 600 scientists worldwide that presented a paper on climate change, and won Nobel Peace -- Nobel Prize. They were not individually named, but the work was celebrated. So she has extensive academic background, and then she has become a politician. Now the question is going to be what kind of person is she going to be? Is she going to just continue what Lopez Obrador started six years ago? Or will she be able to walk from under his shadow, become her own person and lead the country in a direction that she sees fit?",

And obviously, as well, this is happening in Hunter Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. A state that has a lot of connections to the Biden's personal connections even the First Lady, Jill Biden is there at court this morning, showing support for Hunter Biden and giving him a hug in the courtroom.

Now his attorneys are going to argue that he was a person who may not have believed he was an addict at that moment in time he was trying to recover, he was coming out of rehab. But the prosecutors have quite a bit of evidence, including text messages about him meeting with a dealer in that same week, smoking crack where he admits to it in a text message. And then also they are going to be calling people very close to Hunter Biden a trio of women, his ex-wife, and his brother's widow, who was in a relationship with at that time. And then another woman that he eventually had a child with all of those women, the prosecutors say, will be able to be on the stand and testify about them witnessing Hunter Biden's drug use around that time of October 2018.

Now, one interesting thing we have seen is that there are other members of this coalition that are in fact, not even those in the coalition. You've got the Opposition Leader, Yair Lapid, for example, saying he is willing to be a safety net for Netanyahu, not because he likes Netanyahu, not because he wants to see him in power, but because he wants to see this deal done. He has said this deal is on the table. It has to be done. And so you do have some political entities who normally would not want to be in the same room, as Benjamin Netanyahu saying we will support you to make sure that this can go through.

It's led by Saudi Arabia and Russia. And it accounts for almost half the world's supply. Now over the last two years, OPEC+ has been holding back supply, producing about 6 million barrels less, than they had been right, that's deep cuts 6 percent of world demand. And so if OPEC+ had done nothing at this past weekend's meeting, then some of those supply cuts would have on -- and that could have driven prices down which they don't want. So OPEC+ agreed to extend most of these supply cuts into the end of next year. They will be gradually adding some supply back but only at a very slow rate and only starting in October, and only if the conditions really warranted. So if we look at how the oil market is reacting, it doesn't seem like traders or analysts have really been shocked by this. They know that OPEC+ does not want oil prices to go down. So we saw oil prices just slightly lower this morning. Now from a consumer perspective, what's interesting is that we've actually seen gas prices go down and continue to move lower. The national average here in the United States is 353 a gallon. That's not cheap. But it is a two month low, it's down 14 cents. Over the past month, some major U.S. States have seen even bigger price drops. We've seen drops of 25 cents a gallon in Oregon and Arizona, Tennessee, within 30 cents in California and Nevada and Utah. And so I talked to a veteran oil analyst -- and he told me that he thinks the national average will keep dropping by another 5 to 10 cents a gallon. Of course, it would be going down even more if OPEC+ had been adding supply, but it's all of that U.S. supply that is really helping to cushion the blow. And Eleni, as you know, there's some big political implications here right of Americans do not like high gas prices. So whether or not we're looking at a $3 national average or a $4 national average, you know, that could be enough to swing some voters in some key battleground states this November, Eleni.",
