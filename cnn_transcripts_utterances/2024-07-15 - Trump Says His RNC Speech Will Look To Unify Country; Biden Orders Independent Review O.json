Milwaukee's mayor insisting the city is fully prepared, telling CNN that security here is at a maximum. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR CAVALIER JOHNSON, (D) MILWAUKEE:  I have confidence in the Secret Service. I have confidence certainly in the Milwaukee Police Department. As was mentioned, we've worked at this for some 18 months -- some 18 months. And Milwaukee is designated a national special safety -- or security event, so this is the highest designation -- even higher so than what we saw in Pennsylvania just the other day.

Everyone was stunned and kind of frozen until the police started to tell people they needed to leave. That it -- that it was a crime scene. And someone who has spoken with Trump told one of -- one of my colleagues at The Washington Post, Josh Dawsey, that Trump is sounding spiritual since the experience, which is a different sort of mode for him.

I talked to her yesterday. He said to her, \"I'm not supposed to be here.\" And then he also talked about how he's going to change his speech. He said, \"It would be very bad if I got up and started going wild about how horrible everybody is and how corrupt and crooked, even if it's true. Had this not happened, we had a speech that was pretty well set that was extremely tough. Now we have a speech that is more unifying.\" You know, I think the questions sometimes with President Trump has always been the campaign apparatus that he has is a professional one. They have pushed him to try to say the kinds of things that could unify the country -- that could bring more people into his fold. He has not always gone along with that but it seems like perhaps that's the track he's on here.",

I mean, you had Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles put out a statement saying any kind of violent rhetoric is not going to be tolerated by the campaign and so -- in the immediate aftermath of this. I'm paraphrasing there. I don't think that was their exact words. But really, I think consistency here and the -- on both sides, keeping everyone tamped down and keeping it to policy.

That isn't in contrast with what we've all been talking about. And look, I think also, it's very -- it's smart because -- with what you were talking about, Jackie. I completely agree. Because what I would tell President Trump is like, look, not only do you have the high ground, you have the leverage, but you're also winning this race, right? There's no reason to squander the moral high ground, possibly a lead, by going all over the place in a speech that really takes and tears down what you've had built for the last four days or so at that point.

And -- because there are all of these legitimate questions about how on earth could this have happened. There are actually a lot of complicated undercurrents around trust from the current President Biden. He has put someone at the top that had previously served on his detail who he does trust. But I am -- I have been talking to people who are suggesting that this is something that is going to be discussed as to whether the leadership of the agency needs to be held accountable. What is your understanding of how people inside the White House are talking and thinking about this right now? MEGHAN HAYS, CONSULTANT, DNC CONVENTION, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE PLANNING (via Webex by Cisco):  Look, I think that they are waiting to see how the investigation all unfolds. It's really easy to place blame on the people who are in charge of the security right now and that -- and that is very warranted and very fair. But I do think we need to wait to have an investigation. We need to see how this all plays out. There's a lot of partners here that work with the Secret Service. There is local and state law enforcement. There is just a lot of different things that happen. It's very layered in the way these events work with security and the advance teams, both from the staff side and the security side. So I think that they are taking a very measured approach. I mean, they released a picture yesterday where the deputy was in the photo. I think that Kim Cheatle, the director, was virtual. So they're involved -- you know, Sec. Mayorkas was there. So I do think that they are taking a very measured approach in trying to figure out the investigation and figure out what happens next before they make any of those determinations. But there was obviously something that happened. There was definitely a lapse in security. I think it's just figuring out where that is and what prompted that. But, you know -- I mean, Secret Service has an enormous job when they are protecting the president, the former president, and all their protectees.

Now, as to your question how it could be -- how that could have happened, simply put, a failure to follow established policy and procedure. Short, sweet, and to the point, that's exactly what happened. The Secret Service has policies and procedures in reference to individuals such as this shooter.
