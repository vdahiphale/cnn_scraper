In just the last week, the acclaimed poem by Amanda Gorman for President Biden's inauguration -- remember this -- was moved out of the elementary section of a Miami-Dade County public school. That's after a parent complaint and school review. And in Iowa, the governor just signed a law that will restrict education about gender identity and sexual orientation, and also ban books with certain sexual content from school libraries. Similar laws restricting certain types of books in libraries have also recently gone into effect in other states. The free speech organization Pen America reports that there were more book bans during the fall of the 2022 semester than in each of the prior two semesters. The bans were most prevalent in states like Texas, Florida, Missouri, Utah, and South Carolina. But in at least one state lawmakers are actually pushing back. New legislation in New Jersey would protect against the banning of books in public libraries and schools and if passed, any library that bans books could see its funding cut. Joining us now are the two Democratic State Senators who introduced the bill, Andrew Zwicker and Teresa Ruiz. Thank you both for being with us this morning. Good morning.

But it was when I talked to a librarian in the district that I represent who talked about how she stood up to the censorship, she stood up to the bullying and the harassment that she received, that I knew it was time for us to do something about this in New Jersey.

If someone doesn't want something read in their household, that's your own private ideology. It should not be let into public spaces. For me, it's clearly important as a Puerto Rican woman with so many times that we were an annotation in our history books, at a time when people are actually putting us up on shelves, seeing ourselves on different pages and in spaces.

The reason for the day, of course, is to honor fallen servicemembers -- those who made the ultimate sacrifice giving their lives for this country.Joining us now, CNN military analyst and retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who served for 37 years. Always good to see you. And I especially appreciate that we are continuing a tradition that we have with you where you share on this day a very personal way that you honor those who died in service -- not just on this Memorial Day, but I know this is something that you go back to on a number of other days and moments throughout the year. Walk us through how you are honoring them and why this has become such an important way to do that for you. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL, U.S. ARMY EUROPE AND SEVENTH ARMY (via Webex by Cisco): Well, first of all, good morning, Rahel and Erica, and thank you for continuing this tradition. This started somewhat as a fluke about six years ago on CNN when I first joined you all as a military analyst. And I was mentioning this box that three of us have -- Gen. Dempsey and Gen. Stapparati (PH), and myself. And it started in 2003 as Gen. Dempsey, who is our division commander when we were in Iraq, started making cards at memorial services. And in this box -- if I were to open it up you would see two -- there is the picture of it -- is 253 cards, which I have from multiple combat tours of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and allies that served under me and made the ultimate sacrifice during our tours in combat. And on a daily basis I open that box -- I have it here on my desk -- and pick out one or two cards and think about where they would be today. You know, some of these things occurred 10-20 years ago in some cases, in 2003. And these young 20-year-olds who were frozen in time with their pictures would have been now in their 40s or maybe even early 50s in some cases. They would have had a family around them. And on the top of the box we all imprinted something called \"Make it Matter.\" And we always thought when we got together after these memorial services that it was our duty to live on for those that were sacrificed for their country in defending their country. And that's just a daily tradition that I have and it's especially pointed on this Memorial Day.",

How we can make it matter. And you wrote how we can earn it.So on this Memorial Day, how would you recommend that Americans make it matter? That they show that they've earned it -- earned this freedom that so many fought and ultimately died for. HERTLING:  Well, you know, Erica, it's interesting because I realized for the first time this year that I'm decades away from the time I served. These young soldiers are fading into the background. I work with an organization called the American Battle Monuments Commission, which is celebrating at 26 cemeteries all over the world outside of the United States commemorating Memorial Day today. And what's interesting is whereas those pictures and those faces fade in history, we can continue to contribute to Memorial Day by saying how do we make this a better country? How we do solve the divisiveness that currently exists in our society and realize that we all sacrifice for our nation's values, which are respect for one another, loyalty to something that's bigger than ourselves? The ability to see other people are coming together and being part of a greater whole. And I think Memorial Day has turned a little bit away from just remembering those who gave the ultimate sacrifice into a day where we can think as living memories of how do we make it better. How do we make it matter for our fellow citizens? What you're seeing now is pictures of the various cemeteries overseas. That's Normandy there. You saw a tombstone. That's Margraten in the Netherlands where every single one of those 8,000 graves are adopted by local citizens who celebrate the freedom that American servicemembers gave them in World War II. You saw a tombstone being replaced -- a cross being replaced by a Star of David. That's part of something called Operation Benjamin. When Jewish soldiers when into the war in World War II they would scratch off their religious preference because if they were captured by the Nazis they were afraid of what would happen. Well, those tombstones are now being replaced with Stars of David by a group that understands that those Jewish soldiers should be respected as well. So these are all things that are part of our dialogue today. The respect for one another. The bringing our nation forward. So that's what I'd ask everybody to think about on this Memorial Day.",
