Yes, he is going to walk into that courtroom, but it does appear that what actually takes place in the courtroom in the next few minutes may be incidental compared to what he feels he can get out of it for campaign purposes.You heard him going after the judge. You heard him going after the attorney general in this case. And, again, this is no longer a bug of the Trump campaign. This is the feature. The Trump campaign is the legal operation that he is facing right now. And one thing we should make clear, though, he is using this, and to some extent, to a success in the Republican primary. He is losing this civil case already. He has already had a major ruling go against him that will cost him money, and as it stands, has lost him control of the thing he has held most dear until this point, which is control of the Trump Organization. He could lose significant control of that. Now, he may be using that for political gain, but right now, he's got no choice. This is the situation he faces. He's trying to take advantage of that situation. I suppose we should ask, as he is speaking here, Elie, and he's said some inflammatory things, he's about to walk into that courtroom. I don't know if the judge is watching T.V., but the judge sooner or later will hear what he just said.",

He's not going to try to please this judge.I think he realizes he's going to lose. As John said, he already has lost the first count, the most important count. I think he's trying to, A, make a political appeal, B, I think his legal approach here is going to be his lawyers. They're going to be hoping to set the stage for appeal, hoping that they can find something that was procedurally incorrect, find some sort of bias in the judge that will justify an appeal.

You're allowed to criticize the other party. You're allowed to criticize the judge. Again, query whether that's a smart decision, but you can do that. But there is a line, and when you get to the point of calling the attorney general a racist, when you get to the point of saying some of the things that I won't repeat about this A.G., about other prosecutors, about the judge, that becomes dangerous. And the question is, will either the prosecutors in any of these cases or the judges in any of these cases do anything about it. We see that starting to happen now in one of the criminal cases, the federal case in D.C., the judges considering a gag order, as we speak.

And I talked to a number of sources for the last several months as to what exactly it would look like when he is in the middle of all of these trials and trying to run a presidential campaign.And it was really unclear how they were going to plan for it. Originally, they said that they thought we've legal maneuvering would help delay the election at the trial so after the election but it became clear that these trials would likely go on while he was running for president. Now it seems as though they have figured out at least one way to campaign while he is going on trial, and that is to make the trials themselves a form of a campaign event. And as you noted he knew exactly where the cameras were and he knew exactly what was needed for the cameras to be ready to take his remarks for the networks, for the news outlets to say he is going up to the podium, he is going up to the cameras and he is about to speak and then waited and then spoke and delivered those remarks, remarks that he says on the campaign trail every day but yet don't get picked up because we often do not report on them because of the fact that they are oftentimes not accurate and not true. And so because of that, though, now we know they are going to be looking at these legal events, these trials as an opportunity to essentially campaign. They paraded him down there. And, again, they know every single twist and turn here when it comes to visual optics and press. I was in Michigan last week when he spoke at that non-union shop and they had set up a stage that had Trump flanked on either side by groups of people that had signs that said Union Members for Trump. That is not an accident. That is intentional. That is for optics it was a made for television event so the cameras would show that union members, which we don't have -- we don't have confirmed that they were union members, but that was the show that they were putting on the camera there for that, that is one thing that Donald Trump and his team are very good at. And I do think it's interesting to note here, again, I have been talking to his team for weeks, months about how he is going to be on the trail if he is in trial every single day. And it does appear that this is one strategy that they are definitely going to try in terms of campaigning for president 2024.",

He is arguably one of the most famous people in the world. And you see in there, headed into court, he was flanked by his lawyers. I'm sure they were not thrilled about this. But this is what he is going to do, likely throughout these cases, especially headed into the election. But I think there is an argument to be made that if he is able to stand in front of cameras and say pretty much whatever he wants about the judge, about the prosecutors, about the case, the American people should have the right to see what exactly is happening minute by minute, second by second in that courtroom. Thankfully, we have freedom of the press. We have reporters in there who will be bringing people details. But it's not the same as if you had cameras in there. And anyone who is interested, anyone who wanted to check what he was saying could tune in and say, well, what is going on with this judge? What is he like? What is the attorney general -- what is she like? What is her office saying? I think the fact that we saw him use these cameras -- he did not do this when he came for the criminal case, the district attorney's case earlier this year. But to see how he's using those cameras, I think that is one of the strongest arguments for having not just still photographers at the top of a hearing, but to have cameras in the courtroom covering this live so that people can see for themselves and don't rely on the former president for the blow-by-blow of what exactly is going on here.",

And she, in a couple weeks now, she will have a hearing in her courtroom to assess a request from the special counsel's office to put a gag order on the former president based on comments that he has made about prosecutors, about the judge, the argument being that he has made statements that are interfering with the judicial process. And I was in Chutkan's courtroom for the first hearing that she held, and she made it clear. She said, look, I understand that he is a candidate for the highest office in the land, but that will not force us to overlook the fact that he needs to behave in a way that does not undermine the judicial process. So, it will be very interesting to see how she rules on that. Look, he says these things, right? They are inflammatory. Very few defendants would make these kinds of comments about prosecutors or about judges because you would expect that this would come back to haunt you. But he's making a lot of these comments in the court of public opinion as an effort to try to warp the public perception of exactly what is going on here. That, though, puts judges in a very difficult position. Because if you do implement a gag order, restrictions beyond the usual, don't talk about the case with other witnesses, you do risk it looking like, appearing like you are potentially trying to restrict someone who is conducting a campaign. It's a very tricky spot for judges to be in, but he is constantly, repeatedly, attesting this, particularly here in Washington, D.C., with Judge Chutkan.

And so they're going to do everything they can to capitalize on this.That's why you're seeing him go to the courthouse, go in front of cameras, and give his narrative. So, that way he can at least spin it into a positive. And for any normal candidate, I think you would see their poll numbers diminish in this kind of situation, but we've seen time and time again that Donald Trump's poll numbers have not just remained at the top among the GOP field. They've actually gone up, and he has fundraised off of this. So, they're going to continue to use this to their advantage as much as they can, so that way he can control the media narrative. And while we're sitting here talking about Donald Trump, guess what, we're not talking about his GOP rivals.",

And for him to act tough in this situation in that he's not scared and he's not going to back down, and that is why he's showing up to the courthouse, because he wants to put on this brave face for his supporters.Like I said earlier, though, I do think that, deep down, he is worried about all of the legal troubles that he's facing, but, obviously, he doesn't want to show that, because then that would show weakness. And that is something that Donald Trump is very mindful of. He always wants to appear strong and doesn't want to seem vulnerable in any situation. And so he's definitely going to act like this is nothing, and that's why he's showing up today, and that he knows that, politically, of course, like his fundraising and his poll numbers have gone up. That's why we saw him tout those things. But deep down, I think he is a little bit worried, because especially in this case in particular, we've already seen the one ruling knock out his way, and he has to be worried, because this is not just obviously the criminal side that he's facing with the other indictments, but in this case, this is going to be impacting his business, his empire that he spent his entire career building.",

Because one thing we saw as he was entering the courtroom is he talked and talked and talked about what is the crux of this case, which is his business and valuations. He could not let this slide. It appears that this is touching on the kryptonite for Donald Trump.He can almost take anything said about him, but if you start talking about how much he's worth and how much his businesses are worth, he loses it. He really won't ever let that slide. And we saw some of that as he was walking into the courtroom.",

He is a businessman and I think that's why he you know he's campaigned on that and it's the differentiator between him and his Republican rivals, you know, back in 2016 and even up until today. And so for them to come after him and say that he's inflating these numbers, obviously, that strikes at the heart of who he believes he very is and his strong suit.And I thought it was really interesting to in his statement that he put out on Truth Social where he said that the valuation for Mar-a- Lago that they put at $18 million was, in his eyes, 50 to 100 times more than that. If it was 50 times more than that, that would mean that it was nearly a billion dollars. And so, obviously, this case is all about him making fraudulent claims over inflating the valuations of his real estate and such and so just very ironic to me that even in his Truth Social post, he's still doubling down on that.",

Now, there's the line in what you allow party to say and not say can be fuzzy, can be difficult to decide, especially whereas here you have someone who's running for political office.I actually think that prosecutors in the DOJ case, their request that's pending right now that was just referred to is overbroad. Prosecutors say he shouldn't be allowed to make any, quote, disparaging statements about anybody involved in this case. That's too much. You're allowed to make a disparaging statement about the other party, even about the judge. It's maybe not a great idea. For me, where I think the line ought to be drawn, and there's some cases that support this, is when your statements cross the line from First Amendment expressive speech into something that could be harmful or threatening to any of the participants. And the two entities that we're most concerned with are always going to be your jury, number one. We don't have a jury, civilian jury in this case and, number two, your witnesses, especially your victims or your vulnerable witnesses, and that we may have in this case.",
