      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, live events happening across Washingtonright now. Any moment, U.S. President Joe Biden will mark the two-year anniversary of the Capitol attack with a special ceremony at the White House. But it's all eyes on the U.S. Capitol as you can see there, as Kevin McCarthy appears to have made a breakthrough in his bid for speaker of the house. Then, Russia accuses Ukraine of violating a unilateral ceasefire, one Kyiv never agreed to, of course. A live update from the Ukrainian capital is just ahead for you. Well, exactly two years after Trump-enraged mob stormed the Capitol of the United States, the specter of the January 6th insurrection still haunts the marble hallways. Perhaps, no one is feeling it more acutely than Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. You're looking at live images there from Capitol Hill. Ultraconservative house numbers are still blocking his election as speaker after 12 ballots. But this time, he did flip 14 opposition votes. A significant development, still it's the lengthiest speaker fight in 164 years. Down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Joe Biden is marking the anniversary at the White House. A ceremony is getting underway there right now. We'll bring you Mr. Biden's remarks as soon as they happen. You can see the podium, of course, there. As soon as we -- as that gets underway, we'll of course, bring you President Biden and his remarks. Let's get perspectives though from both locations. CNN's Kevin Liptak is at the White House, Jessica Dean is on Capitol Hill. Kevin, to you first. What are we expecting to hear today from President Biden?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think certainly, President Biden is watching what's happening on Capitol Hill. And he is notnecessarily separating the two events. The chaos that's unfolding within Republicans and the two-year anniversary of January 6. And while there wasn't necessarily a planned event on Capitol Hill today to mark the anniversary, the White House has been very carefully planning how they would mark it for the last several weeks. And so what you'll hear from President Biden today is certainly remembering the violence, the chaos of that day. Sort of commemorating the events that happened, but also looking forward to ensure that, that sort of event doesn't happen again. And that is something that the president has warned of consistently. The circumstances that surrounded January 6th have not necessarily faded from view. And so you'll see the president today honor several Americans, more than 12 Americans who were involved in that day and sort of put themselves into the breach and held the line for democracy. Among them will be law enforcement officers, Capitol police officers, officers from the Washington Metro police who were involved in the riots that day. He'll also honor election workers from Georgia who had faced so much resistance from Trump and Trump supporters, but were able to count the vote. He'll also honor state election officials, state secretaries of state whose jobs it is to affirm the results of the election, and who also resisted intense pressure from Trump and his supporters on January 6th to actually count the votes. And those are the people that President Biden really wants to honor today on the two-year anniversary. Because as he has said, the conditions that made January 6 possible have not necessarily faded from view. And it's impossible really to separate that from what is going on, on Capitol Hill. In fact, of the 20 holdouts or former holdouts for Kevin McCarthy's speakership, 14 of them were those who refused to certify the election in 2020. So, there is intense overlap between those two groups. And what President Biden has said, what he said this week is, imagine how this looks from overseas just as we potentially emerged from the chaos of the 2020 election. Just as it appeared for a moment that President Trump was loosening his hold on the Republican Party. This is all coming and rearing its head again. And so while President Biden won't necessarily reference the events on Capitol Hill in his speech today, it will be the undercurrent of everything that he's doing from the East Room at the White House.

Thethinking of McCarthy and his allies is they have gotten these 14 to flip, and now they just have to continue to put the pressure on. Now, the remaining people that they're going to need to bring over to their side are harder, because they have these individual needs and wants and asks. And some of them like Matt Gaetz are absolutely hard nose. So they can just put those people to the side, and then they have to get to work on that small number of people to get him to that magic number. And so what we're seeing now is another round of voting, they're going to keep doing this, the negotiating -- the negotiations are ongoing. And what's likely to happen, Isa, is that we now begin to see some of these 14 who have flipped, going back to these others that are still on the other side trying to bring them over to McCarthy. But look, this was a critical turning point for him today, he had to show that he could build momentum, otherwise, he was really going to run up into the end of patience for so many people who have supported him that he had not being able to show that he had momentum. So to get this done was big. And it certainly gives him a lot of push towards the direction he wants to go. The question now is, can he close the deal? And this is where it really is going to be difficult because he's going to have to pick these people off one by one. And what kind of concessions is he going to be making? We now know that some language over raising the debt ceiling, which has huge financial implications, giant financial implications not just for the U.S., but for the global economy. That there is some language in there about how they're going to move forward on that. Things like that, that will come to past later down the road as he tries to get the gavel.

And then, what we have seen over the last couple of weeks is the most militant extreme members of the Republican caucus, have used that narrow majority to demand a series of concessions that will increase their leverage and visibility, and basically move the party further towards the policies that were rejected in those competitive districts in November. And McCarthy focusing on his, you know, understandably, I suppose, on his personal ambition over the institutional interest of the party, really has elevated the most militant members of his caucus to push them in a direction that voters in the swing states and swing districts just said they don't want to go.

And Christmas has come early for the Ukrainians. They've managed to secure commitments to get armored vehicles from Germany, France and the United States. And the senators said very clearly that they are inspired by the people that they spoke to and what they've seen here in Ukraine, to go back to the United States to try to expedite the shipments of even more weapons even more quickly to try to bring this war to an end. But I asked them also whether the shipment of these armored vehicles that the U.S. is sending might open the door to what Ukrainians are really asking for, which is proper tanks. And Jack Reed told me pretty frankly, that there is no connection between those two things, which is not what the Ukrainians would want to hear. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, as you mentioned, it was business as usual for the Ukrainians. They had no interest in this 36-hour Russian-declared ceasefire that they never planned to take part in. And frankly, you'd be hard-pressed to find much of anyone in this country who thought that today would be anything but an ordinary day, say for the fact that it is Christmas eve in the Orthodox faith. And earlier today, I was at a prayer service led by the head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine praying for Ukrainian military. And there wasn't a whole lot of Christmas cheer, but there was a lot of quiet determination to one day win this war. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over):  Christmas eve in the Ukrainian capital, that Orthodox Christmas, January 7th, leaves little to celebrate this year. These men have known nearly a year of grinding war with no end in sight. This service led by the head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine metropolitan epiphany was to pray for Ukraine's victory. This Christmas, more than most, they need all the prayers they can get. Russian President Vladimir Putin invoked Christianity when he said he'd go along with an appeal for a Christmas ceasefire from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, a man openly supportive of the invasion. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the ceasefire declaration as pure deception.

Mexico'sforeign minister earlier said any extradition of Ovidio Guzman would not be immediate for legal reasons. The operation to arrest Guzman on Thursday triggered a wave of violence as gunmen went on a rampage to try to free him. Mexico's defense secretary says 29 people were killed including 10 military personnel. Our Rafael Romo has the story for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN SENIOR LATIN AMERICAN AFFAIRS EDITOR (voice-over):  Residents in the Mexican northern city of Culiacan woke up to what seemed to many like a war zone. Roads were blocked throughout the city including this one, leading to the airport.   This is how criminal groups responded after this man, Ovidio Guzman Lopez was detained by Mexican security forces. His arrest produced clashes between cells of his criminal gang and Mexican security forces. Mexican Defense Minister Cresencio Sandoval said that after Guzman's detention, cells from his criminal group staged 19 blockades and armed attacks in different parts of the city, including its international airport in an air force base. Ovidio Guzman Lopez is also known as the Mouse, is the son of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. The former leader of the Sinaloa cartel was convicted in the U.S. in 2019 of ten counts related to leading a criminal organization, drug trafficking and firearms charges. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years. (on camera):  Mexican Defense Minister Sandoval said Ovidio, El Chapo's son leads the criminal group known as The Minors, part of the cartel of the Pacific, which is responsible for violence in four Mexican states in the country's northwest region. And according to the U.S. State Department, law enforcement investigation indicates Ovidio and his brother Joaquin Guzman Lopez function in high-level commanding control roles of their own drug trafficking organization, the Guzman Lopez transnational criminal organization under the umbrella of the Sinaloa cartel. The Mexican government had already tried to capture Ovidio Guzman Lopez in October of 2019. After he was detained, the Sinaloa cartel unleashed a heavily-armed fighting force. A gun battle in the streets of Culiacan ensued, putting the lives of countless civilians at risk. It quickly became painfully obvious the Sinaloa cartel had outmaneuvered and overpowered Mexican security forces. In the end, Mexican authorities decided to release Guzman to prevent further bloodshed. Rafael Romo, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And as we see it, neither side is in a position to have a decisive victory on the battlefield. But we will continue to work for a ceasefire in the battlefield areas in the days to come, especially around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, which remains a very major security threat for everyone. We want to make sure that no clashes, no accidents happen in the Zaporizhzhia area.",

So the battleitself is taking place on Ukrainian soil, and therefore the Ukrainians are, you know, right to be very suspicious of, you know, Russian attempts to, you know, go for negotiations without stopping this bombardment and war. So -- but at least it's some kind of a unilateral ceasefire, meaning that Russia stops, and then this is followed by Ukraine, and this is what our President offered to both leaders yesterday on the call so that we can have localized ceasefires. Perhaps this can turn into some kind of a negotiating environment where the negotiators can come together again. But, of course, we are adamant to continue to make this call. But realistically speaking, the facts on the ground are such that neither side seems to be willing to lay down their arms and come to the negotiating table at this moment. And we are concerned that in the next few months, we will see a more escalation of fighting in Ukraine.",

But I think they really have to have to see beyond that. What is the end game here? If you want to war to continue, all right, let it continue, then this will be more disruption, more losses for everyone, and this is no good for anyone. I think we really have to ramp up our efforts from all sides, from the Russian side, from the Ukrainian side, from the Western bloc, from NATO countries, the U.S. and others, to try to bring the parties to the negotiating table. I mean, the calls for a, you know, decisive military victory on the battlefield for either side are rather difficult to ascertain, difficult to achieve. The sides may achieve some tactical goals, but they will not serve any strategic goals here. And what is the strategic goal? That is the main question. And when you ask us, on one side, it says it's the destruction of Russia or the removal of President Putin, some others, you know, others, you know, may -- can make other claims, et cetera. But we have to stop the bleeding first. And we have the ongoing war, which is about to enter its first year in a month or so. Therefore, what we're trying to create is an environment in which, you know, the two sides can come together. And if there is a ground for the leaders to come together with all the negotiating terms, of course, on the table, understandably, and the Ukrainians, of course, need to see some concrete action or from the Russian side that is not only a ceasefire, but also a kind of a phased, planned withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine and soil, talk about prisoner exchange, talk about securing the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, talk about the continuation of the grain deal, and a number of other terms, a number of other key issues that have defined the main parameters of this war since the beginning. Those are the things that we need to be focusing on. Otherwise, if you let this war continue, as it is, I think 2023 will be even more difficult for both -- for Ukraine primarily, of course, because Ukraine has been carrying the main brunt of this war, but also for world economy, for the energy security, for grain security, food security, as the IMF, for example, has predicted that 2023 will be a tougher year than 2022 because we will see the global recession in the major economies of the world. I mean, given all that, I think we really have to take a more realistic long-term perspective and here and give our full effort to create conditions in which two sides can come together and stop the fighting.",
