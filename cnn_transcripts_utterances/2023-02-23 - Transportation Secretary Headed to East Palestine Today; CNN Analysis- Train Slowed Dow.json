Someone who clearly was very much loved, even within the local news community, with his competitors. If you just took a moment to watch some of their coverage of this last night. So let's back up and talk about exactly what led up to this, and what is still unanswered at this point. According to the sheriff here in Orange County, he says that around 11 a.m. yesterday, they received a call of a shooting. A woman in her 20s was killed. Then about five hours later, the sheriff says that the suspect returned and opened fire again, shooting that news team, that Spectrum News-13 team, as well as a woman and her 9-year-old daughter in their home. That 9-year-old died. The photographer and the mother of the 9-year-old remain in critical condition this morning. That 19-year-old that you mentioned, Poppy, that is 19-year-old Keith Melvin Moses. He is in custody. And one of the things the sheriff mentioned was that he has a lengthy criminal history that includes gun charges.
