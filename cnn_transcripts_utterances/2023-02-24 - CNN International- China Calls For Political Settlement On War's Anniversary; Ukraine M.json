It wants to present itself as this responsible international peacemaker, while maintaining this No Limits alliance with Russia as it refuses to condemn the invasion of Ukraine.And on this anniversary, this first anniversary of the war in Ukraine, they released this document, this 12-point position paper on bringing about a political settlement in Ukraine that calls for the ending of hostilities, the ending of unilateral sanctions, but also the resumption of peace talks, but it doesn't really give a concrete map forward. Earlier today, we heard a comment from the head of the E.U. delegation in China said that this paper is just that. It's only paper, it is not a peace plan. But we also heard from the Sharjah (ph) affair of Ukraine and China who called this document a good sign and also urged China to do, quote, everything to end the war in Ukraine. Earlier, we heard these very interesting comments from a senior official at the U.S. State Department about a peace plan. A peace plan that would work is a peace plan that would be enduring and just. Take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VICTORIA NULAND, U.S. UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR POLITICAL AFFAIRS: It can't simply be a cynical ceasefire that allows the Russians the time to go home, rest, refit and return. If Xi Jinping can get Putin and his army out of Ukraine, I think we'd all applaud and give a peace prize. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think in the heart of the Kremlin, they knew it wasn't going to be stopped. And -- but on the streets of Moscow, this very weird dichotomy, you know, these huge red walls around the Kremlin, where Putin makes his decisions.

And within a few weeks, these protests frittered away because people have been arrested in some cases multiple times, were facing years in jail. But just walking away from those protests, you could find stop the war spray painted on the walls. But the repression that exists in Russia has suffocated all independent voices and suffocated any protests at all in the past year, but there was a very weird dichotomy in the days leading up to the wall.",

And if he backs down from it, then he knows he's not going to survive long as leader of the Russian people.China has a tremendous amount it can bring to the war. And it's not just ammunition, they can put their finger on the balance of the scales here. And they can say we're going to support Russia, unless you in the West come to terms that are more favorable to Russia, they can do that. Russia is fighting a hybrid war. Russia has been using cyberattacks, not very effectively, because their cyber capability is not particularly strong. It is well recognized. And I certainly heard this last weekend in Munich, talking to a lot of officials there, that China has much better artificial intelligence, much better and stronger cyberattack capability. And many more people than Russia has to implement that. This is also a way should China choose. And we've heard from the officials today saying there's no evidence China's has gone this far in and its support for Russia. But these are ways that the equation, the diplomatic equation behind the wall, can be shifted, as well as shifting it on the battlefield. And I think this is also a moment where the world watches to see what role China is really going to play as independent broker. And there's a huge amount of skepticism from the west on that we've heard already today, or are they going to put their finger on the scale in the favor of Russia.",

But if you look again at this 12-point document, and it does talk about territorial integrity, but does it talk about the fate and future of Crimea or the Donbas? It doesn't address that, and China has not addressed that. And this war in Ukraine has put China in this very, very awkward position. You know, some analysts say that perceptions of Russia's failure in the battlefield is perhaps encouraging China to amplify these calls for peace and for peace talks. That call is just beginning to come out now with the publication of this 12-point position paper, but the devils in the details we're not getting those details yet.",

Plus, as the war crosses the one year mark, China is spelling out its ideas for how to end the conflict. Few hours ago, Beijing released a new position paper about the fighting in Ukraine.

But also a series of events that we've been covering here, Max, over the course last few hours designed to show the important solidarity of the rest of the world on this grim anniversary.In the last few moments, we've seen here in Kyiv just behind me outside St. Michael's the Polish Prime Minister visit the Wall of Remembrance with his Ukrainian counterpart. And of course, we heard from President Zelenskyy himself at a very tightly secured as you'd expect ceremony outside St. Sophia's cathedral within the last couple of hours, where he spoke to Ukrainian soldiers and the families of fallen Ukrainian soldiers telling them that victory was going to be up to them. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): It is you who will decide whether we are all going to exist, whether Ukraine is going to exist. Every day, every hour, it is you, Ukrainian soldiers, which will decide it. (END VIDEO CLIP) [04:45:04] BELL: And of course, Max, even as Ukraine braces for those missile strikes that you mentioned a moment ago, they were warned of by the head of Ukraine's military intelligence only last night saying that it's the 23rd, it's the 24th. It could have been either they are bracing for that precautions have been made across the country to try and spare civilians, children being kept from the school, people being allowed remote working. But beyond that sense of preparedness and bracing for what may come today, there is also that tremendous sadness, I think, here in Ukraine today at the huge cost of this war. Of course, not just for the military, Max, but for civilians, as well throughout the year. This is what we've seen, first of all, in those parts of the country occupied by Russia, Russian troops from which they then withdrew, but also more broadly, the victims of missile strikes and the broader effects of the war. This is a war that has really left no one untouched. And I think today is also for ordinary Ukrainians about remembering and marking, and paying their respects to that. Max?",

Nic Robertson was in Moscow at the time but, you know, we've been expecting something to happen because of this buildup of forces.I'm actually going to go to President Zelenskyy who is speaking at a German events to mark this one year anniversary. ZELENSKYY (through translation): For Europe and the whole free world, what -- the free world got used to this turning to something that need (INAUDIBLE). Diplomacy did not work. The existing security architecture of the word failed. The old European hope that economic relations could stop Russian tanks did not work. But something did work indeed, unity, the unity of Ukraine, Germany and the free world as a whole and the resolve, the resolve to defend the foundations of our coexistence. On Ukrainian soil, we are fighting for something without which you, dear friends, could not fathom and then visit your own life. It's security, basic security, freedom and laws, human dignity and the right of each and every human being and each community to be respected. The blessing to live in a family and the opportunity to dream of a safe and secure future for their own children. It's the simple thing. 1,877 Ukrainian cities and villages are denied of this opportunity. The Russian invaders want to add more and add more of the destinies of millions in our city that was invaded and occupied by Russians in Mariupol. There are no intact buildings anymore. Russia did everything to kill everyone there. We almost had 1.5 million people living in Mariupol. Mariupol is destroyed up to 90 percent. The remains, the ruins of buildings that were burned down and destroyed by Russians are being destroyed and done away with. The rubble is done away with and these ruins are turned into rubble that is to be used for the construction of new roads. We need to do everything in our power to do -- to not allow Russia to occupy Ukraine and our neighbors and turn our cities into rubble. Do we have the resolve and the power? Yes, we are indeed to do so. We're in unity. We stand together. We are capable to end the Russian aggression this year. [04:55:07] From the very beginning, the first minutes of the Russian invasion, Germany stood by our side, Germany helps us to protect Ukraine from Russian terror. And Germany will be on our side on the day of victory and in day of freedom. Germany will stand by our side when we rescue our cities from Russian terror. Mr. President, Mr. Chancellor, German people, today, now is the time to restore peace with our courage and with our weapons and to create a security for all. No one will attack us anymore. No one will attack freedom. If he knows that the free world is resolved enough to defend this freedom, no one will repeat the 24th of February of last year. If he knows that, on the whole of territory of Ukraine, there is no more aggressor, no more occupier. We can make sure that this happens together with you, together with everyone around the world who value life. I thank you for your support. I thank you for standing by our side this past year. Thank you, Mr. Federal President. Thank you, Olaf, for your confidence and trust in Ukraine, in our citizens and in our shared values of a free united and peaceful Europe. Glory to those who fight for freedom, Slava Ukraini. Glory to Ukraine. (APPLAUSE)",
