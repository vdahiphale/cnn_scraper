This was the Biden campaign putting the former president to work. The two spend a lot of time together, several hours I'm told, taping a lot of materials for the Biden campaign that is going to get rolled out in the coming weeks including, of course, related to the Affordable Care Act.And with the general election now fully underway, we do expect to see the former president increasingly more involved with the Biden campaign and certainly hitting the trail more, especially when we get into the fall. And tomorrow, we are about to see this big fundraiser in New York City at Radio City Music Hall, where we will see not just President Biden, not just President Obama, but also former President Bill Clinton as well. The three of them are going to be on stage together, a moderated conversation with Stephen Colbert. And these are tickets. Dana, that range from $225 to $0.5 million. There are going to be celebrities in the audience, some of the audience members will have an opportunity to get photographs taken by Annie Leibovitz, the very famous photographer. So it's going to be sort of that kind of high-dollar event. And our reporting is that the former president believes that this matchup between President Biden and Donald Trump is going to be extremely close to November, and he's described this as sort of an all-hands-on-deck moment. And I think tomorrow evening, when we see those three presidents together, physically together, banding together to try to stop Donald Trump from returning to the White House, we are really going to see a stunning visual of how much urgency national Democrats are feeling in trying to stop Donald Trump from coming back here to the White House, Dana. DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR OF 'INSIDE POLITICS': MJ, thank you so much for that great reporting. We are going to pick up on that with the panel. Let's look, first, Jeff, I want to come to you on this, about what a big part of the former president that most recent Democratic former President Barack Obama is saying about the health care law that bears his name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARRACK OBAMA, (D) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Before the ACA, young adults would be kicked off their parent's health care plan, often right when they were getting ready to head out on their own. All it takes is one diagnosis or one injury, one accident to throw off your plans if you don't have insurance. And thanks to the ACA, young people everywhere have some security. They have some freedom to choose how they live their lives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He made several trips to Georgia as well.The fact that they're bringing him in this early in the cycle just shows -- just that sense of urgency to use the word MJ used, that the Biden campaign and Democrats have. We know that Barack Obama has had some concerns about this -- a lack of urgency that he felt on the part of the Biden campaign. So, we are seeing him getting engaged, getting engaged pretty early on in this cycle.

But all that said, I do think there's one thing I want to point out that they have in their story that I find is really interesting, is that Obama is saying this is going to be a close election. He's trying to raise alarm bells about that. It's something that the Trump campaign and Donald Trump himself also believe. They all recognize that it's going to have to be, as MJ described it, an all-hands-on-deck effort to get their respective candidates elected. And I do think one thing that I've just picked up on and I don't cover -- I cover the Trump campaign. I don't cover the Biden Administration or how Obama's efforts, but I'm surprised they haven't brought him in sooner, to be honest, because I feel like he is such a star as both of you have pointed out and I do -- I take the point that it is very early.
