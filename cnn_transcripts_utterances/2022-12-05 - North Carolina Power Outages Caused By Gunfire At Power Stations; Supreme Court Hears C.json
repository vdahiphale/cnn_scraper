And now federal investigators are getting involved in what's believed to be an intentional attack. Plus, the Georgia Senate runoff in the final stretch, finally, and Tampa's police chief resigns after flashing her badge during a traffic stop. This is what we're watching At This Hour.Thank you so much for being here, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan. Let's start in North Carolina where the FBI is joining the investigation now into power outages that officials believe were caused by targeted attacks. The power, it went out Saturday night after someone opened fire on two power substations causing damage to the infrastructure, about 36,000 customers are without power at this hour. And that may continue for days. Schools in the county closed today, a mandatory curfew may be reinstated again overnight because of the situation. Whitney Wild is live in Moore County, North Carolina where all this is happening. What's the very latest you're learning, Whitney?",

Meanwhile, law enforcement says this is an all hands on deck situation. The FBI is involved.The State Bureau of Investigation is involved, as many local law enforcement as possible is involved, to try to figure out who is behind the shooting. Right now, there are many more questions than answers. At this point, what law enforcement is prepared to say is again, what you had said that someone opened fire on these substations causing millions of dollars of damage. But they don't know why this person did this. They don't know who. And they're not prepared to say what type of firearm was used, or how many rounds were fired at the substations. So a lot of questions remain there. The biggest question, of course, is what is the motive. And at this point, law enforcement is not prepared to say what the motive is. There had been some talk on social media that this may have been connected to a drag show in a neighboring area, but still here in Moore County, that was set to take place around the same time that the power went out. That drag show was supposed to take place at 7 o'clock Saturday night. The power went out shortly after that. Again, rumors circulating on social media that those two things are connected. Meanwhile, here in Moore County, there is some good news. Duke Energy tells me that around 7,000 people had their power restored overnight. However, there are some bad news, they say that the majority of customers will not be able to get back online until Thursday because the damage is just so extensive. Kate?",

And so that's caused some anxiety, obviously, amongst our population. Our medical calls have increased due to people being on oxygen or having other medical devices that require power. We've had an increase in fire alarms. We've had an increase in traffic accidents just because our traffic lights are obviously not working.

The key here is that it looks like the Supreme Court will be poised to finally determine make that decision whether certain businesses can refuse to work with same sex couples, because of certain issues like free speech.Of course, they came close to deciding that about four years ago, but instead they made a very narrow decision in a case involving a Colorado Baker who didn't want to make wedding cakes for same sex couples. This case is much broader. This is a Colorado website designer who says she does not intend to work with same sex couples to design their wedding website, she says because it conflicts with her religious views. And she's arguing before the court or her attorneys are arguing before the court this morning that a Colorado law that is an anti- discrimination law that says you can't discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. She says that conflicts with her free speech rights as an artist here. Now the big question from the liberal leaning justices so far has been where exactly do you draw that line? If you start saying you won't serve same sex couples when it comes to their weddings? What else will people say? What else will people say -- they don't want to endorse the messaging off. So here's the questioning from Justice Sonia Sotomayor and the answer from the websites attorney. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KRISTEN K. WAGGONER, SMITH'S LAWYER: Do you don't believe they should be telling their story and what they're asking you to do is tell their story, then you don't have to do that in the same way. JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR, U.S. SUPREME COURT: So it does't really, there is no line on race, there is no line on disability, ethnicity, none of the protected categories in a public accommodation law.",

I really appreciate it.Joining me now for more on this and much more, Republican Governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu. Governor, it's great to have you here. Thank you for coming on. This is an interesting moment that we have today, especially as we're coming off is we're talking about these oral arguments, because you have two things kind of happening at the same time, which is this case before the High Court. And you also have Congress likely to send a bipartisan bill to the President's desk this week, offering more protections to same sex married couples. So you have -- it feels like unity on one side, and then a major legal fight on the other. What do you think this says about where the country is right now? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R-NH): Well, again, you have two very separate bodies there. And so again, one is going to look at the Constitutional aspects and one is going to look at the law. And those should be actually taken separately. The justices shouldn't be making law and the Congress shouldn't be deciding, you know, what is legal and what isn't. They pass the laws. So it's -- a lot of this has effectively been turned to the States. I think where the country is on same sex marriage is very obvious. It's very clear. We've -- I think New Hampshire was one of the first states to legalize same sex marriage. It's been here, it's working across the country, we're moving on. And so whatever Congress wants to pass here in New Hampshire, we have no problem with it at all. But again, these for me, these aren't the issues of the day, they're important issues, to be sure, but their issues of the day are still for families in terms of where we go in terms of our government is inflation and fuel costs. And, you know, worrying whether the power is going to be on this coming winter. So important issues to be sure, but as a governor, I got to balance a budget. I got to make sure that our citizens are taking care of on their basic needs first, which over these past couple years, surprisingly, it's just not being met and bad policy out of D.C. is really driving a lot of that.",

And unfortunately, it's not going to be consistent. I think it should, I think it should just be a done deal. We're moving on, but you're going to have states kind of like the abortion issue where you're going to have a lot of differences between the states, and then that creates a lot of chaos. I mean, it creates chaos in terms of benefits, it creates chaos in terms of, you know, the process, but most importantly, it creates chaos, because it's not fair. And it's just not right. Same sex marriages is the law. It's what we do. It's fair, it's the right thing for individuals. It's part of their path and their process and their life. And we have to honor that. That's kind of what we do it here in New Hampshire in terms of the Live Free or Die state, we honor that. We let people do what they do best. And that's take care of themselves.",

So now you have a candidate dictating what state is going to go first, again, for no other reason than he did well in that state. So if you look at let's say, turnout data, right, who votes? Well, New Hampshire is always the one of the top states in the country in terms of voter turnout, voter engagement, South Carolina is always below average, Nevada, not only is below average in that category, but I think they're still counting votes from an election about a month ago. So you have to be able to do it, right. And we have the data in New Hampshire that says, look, it doesn't matter what your name I.D. is, doesn't matter how much you spend, everyone's got a shot. New Hampshire is the great equalizer on that political field for presidential candidates. And we worked very hard at designing a system that gets that engagement, has that trust. And again, we're that first filter where we say, you got to look us in the eye, we have to buy off on you as an individual, before we even get to policy. And that's a great first filter to have. But again, you just have, you know, personal, you know, personal partisanship, if you will, coming in Joe Biden says is going to going to be to help his buddies in South Carolina, it's the absolute wrong reason to do it. And it hurts the whole system nationally, it really does. Because you want your first states to be reliable to be with high voter turnout to not be money driven all the time. Unfortunately, for the Democrats in South Carolina, that's the way it's going to be. The last thing I'll say is we're still going first, right, New Hampshire is still going to have its primary when we have our primary, what the Democratic Party does with that is up to them. But we're going to have Democrats on our ballot in the first in the nation primary before any other state. And we can -- our law says that we're going to guarantee it.

And there was very, very limited success in terms of this operation. The Ukrainian Air Force says they intercepted more than 60 of the missiles that were launched. Some of them did hit their targets, however, which has resulted in blackouts, total blackouts, loss of electricity and power in at least to Ukrainian cities, but also power interruptions here in Kyiv, to the east, in Donetsk and to the south, in Dnipropetrovsk. This comes at a time that U.S. intelligence has been saying that the fighting is going to slow down during the winter months, the temperatures are really plummeting here. It is not a good time for Ukrainians to be without electricity. And yet there is still active fighting happening out in the East in Donetsk with Russian troops trying to make an advance towards the west, but having very, very, very limited success. They're being held off by the Ukrainians. So we'll have to see if the fighting does indeed slow down, Kate. Certainly these Russian missile strikes have really revved up the situation once again, they were anticipated, though by the Ukrainians who say it's time now for the United States to make a decision on those Patriot missile defense systems that they say they badly need.",
