I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.U.S. diplomatic personnel and their families are now safely out of Sudan as the African nation descends into increasing violence. They were airlifted to neighboring Djibouti in a dramatic overnight evacuation. About 100 U.S. special operations forces carried out the daring mission. Today, the U.S. embassy in Khartoum is closed and the decision to evacuate personnel comes after a week of heavy fighting between Sudan's military and a rival paramilitary group. More than 400 people have been killed, including one American. The State Department says there are about 16,000, potentially as many as 19,000 Americans in Sudan. Most, though, are dual nationals. And our correspondents are well-positioned here and overseas to bring you all of the angles of this developing story. Let's go to CNN's Sam Kiley live from Djibouti. He's going to be there in just a moment. Let's begin with CNN's Oren Liebermann. He's over at the Pentagon. Oren, you know, this really could have gone sideways. So many different variables, obviously happening right in the middle of these two rival factions fighting with one another, the army and the RSF. How complicated was this? Did it get complicated for U.S. special forces going in there and extricating these Americans?",

      "sentences": "It was complicated from the very beginning, precisely because of the situation we're talking about here. Two warring factions fighting each other on the streets of Sudan in the city of Khartoum, potentially very close to the U.S. embassy there. And of course you're never conducting an evacuation operation in optimal circumstances. So the U.S. and that includes the Department of State, DOD, as well as the White House were monitoring the situation, waiting to see if there was a ceasefire that would hold for long enough.There was a 72-hour ceasefire over the Eid Al-Fitr holiday this weekend that both sides had committed themselves to, but there were violations of that ceasefire and a broad question about whether it could collapse as this hours long operation took place. Take a look at that map there. They had to get, and this is three chinook helicopters from Djibouti across Ethiopia in the Sudan safely land in Khartoum on the ground for less than an hour load up the diplomatic staff, the family members, and a few other nationals, less than 100, but a significant number. And then get everybody out. And that includes, of course, the 100 troops, special operations forces who were part of this back the way they came, a refueling stop in Ethiopia and all the way back out. So at any point along this route, the ceasefire could have fallen apart even more. The fighting could have gotten worse. There could have been all sorts of technical issues, but the operation went off I don't want to say without a hitch, but President Joe Biden made the decision to go ahead with this operation, and it was executed well, and we got news late last night of the safe evacuation of the embassy. Of course, it is still a complicated situation because, as you pointed out, there are still 16,000, or perhaps even more American citizens there, many of them dual nationals, so Sudanese American. We have learned from the State Department that they informed some of those about evacuation convoys being arranged by the United Arab Emirates and by Turkey. There are other options, although none of those are simple at this point. DOD is considering trying to set up some sort of aerial surveillance above some of those routes, which would either lead west to Port Sudan to try to get out by the water or try to cross some of the land borders as well as also considering trying to set up some sort of deconfliction mechanism to assist U.S. citizens who are trying to get out of the country. None of this is easy and that includes the operation to evacuate. But, Jim, as we know that operation carried out and the embassy staff and their family evacuated safely.",

And so, you know, I think that what we're seeing today is really a continuation of that. And I think another reason why is because in 2019 there was a revolution in Sudan. That's what the book was about. And we knew that the path to revolution, it's never straightforward.There's always ups and downs, and it was so inspiring to be in Khartoum in 2019, but you could tell immediately that this was not going to be a straightforward process. You could tell within the first couple of weeks that the protesters who had overthrown Omar al-Bashir that they were going to really have trouble implementing their government, and you've seen this with so many social movements throughout history, right? They overthrow a dictator. They have this mass popular support, but they struggled to implement their ideals. And that's what we wrote in the book, and it was an inside story of how that happened.",

So the RSF are supported by the United Arab Emirates and the Sudanese armed forces are supported by Egypt.And so what really could make this conflict much worse is if these two sides are supported by their external allies. We're starting to get reports that that's the case and we're hoping that those reports are wrong because that would really turn this into a real catastrophe, and it would be good for nobody in the region.",

They didn't really know what they were doing and they didn't really seem to know either.You know, but certainly Russia is a key player in this, but we shouldn't really I think overstate their influence because really Hemetti and the RSF, they're really using Russia to try and get as much money and gold, you know, well, really as much money as they can from the Russians.

The state legislature is primarily Republican and white. But the city of Jackson is primarily Democratic and over 80 percent black.Now supporters of this new bill -- of these new laws, they point to the crime rate in Jackson, which has seen a homicide rate per year that has doubled over the past 10 years, peaking in 2021. The murder rate 12 times the national average, making Jackson one of the deadliest cities in the U.S. Let's dig a little deeper now into these new laws. Here's what you should know. They will allow the state of Mississippi to expand reach of state-controlled law enforcement to the entire city of Jackson. This is a force that has primarily protected the capital and the surrounding area and has not been engaged in city law enforcement. This force does not answer to local officials, but rather state appointed leadership. There's also major changes coming to the judicial system, which will establish a new court within the boundaries of the new capital complex improvement district. The judge there will be appointed by the Republican state chief justice and the prosecuting attorneys will be appointed by the Republican state attorney general. The NAACP filed an electronic lawsuit on Friday shortly after these bills were signed into law, and here's what they said. Lawmakers and Jackson residents have opposed both bills throughout the legislative session, citing outside attempts to increase policing without adequate training, silence dissent from Jackson residents and strip residents of their voting power to elect judges and district attorneys who serve their interests. We also heard from Governor Tate Reeves before he signed those bills into law on Friday. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. TATE REEVES (R), MISSISSIPPI: I want what's best for Jackson, but for us to continue to see young kids getting killed in the streets, for us to continue to see property crimes that are happening here, that are causing businesses to leave, we've got to make sure that we have law and order, and I don't think there's any doubt that if you talk to businesses, if you talk to the residents of Jackson capital police shows up when there's a crime being committed and they're called.

And he only does that if he sees someone as a threat.And look, DeSantis, the Florida governor, is smart. He is pushing back against Donald Trump and saying that we need to have more of a positive, optimistic vision for the future and pushing back on Donald Trump and all of the things that Donald Trump stands for in terms of election lies and conspiracy theorists. We're going to see a whole new ballgame once he gets into the race. But, look, there's tremendous ambivalence across the board with Trump as well as Biden. We see the poll numbers show that nearly 70 percent of Americans, Republicans and Democrats, do not want Biden to run. Similar numbers they don't want Donald Trump to run, so what we're seeing is that most Americans do not want to see a sequel of Biden- Trump matchup in 2024. Sequels might be popular in the box office, but not so much at the ballot box. And so it will be interesting to see. Obviously, Biden is the top of the ticket for the Democrats.

She is a contributing opinion writer for \"The New York Times.\" Kara let's get this out of the way. Your Twitter account is on screen right now, and there is the blue check. Is that current or did you get rid of it? And you didn't pay for it, right? What's going on? KARA SWISHER, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" OPINION: No, no, no, no, no, no. They took it. It was on for years. Many years ago Twitter came to a lot of well-known reporters and other people to try to get them to use the service and then I said it had to be verified, they verified it back then and they got my permission at the time. And then Elon took it off on 4/20. Ha-ha. And then it was back on this weekend. I don't know why. I never bought anything. I never had anything. And then then all these dead people started to get blue checks, and I guess he sees dead people, I guess. I don't know what to say. I don't -- it is really the weirdest business development I've seen. Yes.",

I didn't find it useful enough to pay the money.And what's interesting is that anyone who doesn't want to pay the money, Elon's fanboys, it's mostly boys go after them and says you should say thank you for the blue check. And I was like, why should I say thank you for the blue check? I didn't want it and I didn't really want it the first place, but I see why they had it and the whole thing is just a disastrous business situation. I mean, really, at the bottom of it, and also potentially legally problematic, because they are already under scrutiny for how they deal with privacy and data.

And that's -- you know, that happens and it's happened before, but he should be focused on that and those problems.And of course, Tesla had to cut prices again, because there's a lot of competitors now. So, there's those issues and the stock has dropped considerably over the past a week or so. And he's got to really focus hard on that because you know, Mercedes is coming after him. Toyota, Volvo, Ford, GM, all of them and so that's the issue is that his businesses that are very interesting, and they make pretty good business decisions, not every minute of the day, but in general, he's run them pretty well are really, really going to suffer because of this strange obsession he has with tweaking Stephen King on Twitter.

Every week, I get to pitch the world with airships hauling clean fuel instead of diesel tractor trailers, and Stingray shaped robots that will sink seaweed to bury carbon instead of factoring fishing trawlers that clear cut the sea. Your buses could bring you to school on sunlight and then help power your classrooms. The world's most abundant fuel source might be hydrogen made from sun and sea water, or little nuclear fusion stars and boxes filling batteries made of salt or minerals mined on the asteroid Psyche. While all of this utopian stuff is possible it has to be affordable and scalable and profitable and so our future might be determined by influencers and marketers as much as engineers and policymakers.
