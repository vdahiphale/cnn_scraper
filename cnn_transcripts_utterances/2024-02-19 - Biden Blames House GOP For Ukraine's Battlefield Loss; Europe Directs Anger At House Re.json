President Biden pinning the blame on Republicans for the fall of Ukrainian city, while Donald Trump tries to make himself a martyr after the suspicious death of a Kremlin critic.Plus, with friends like these, Joe Biden facing a new call to step aside, as a prominent columnist says he's a great president, but he shouldn't run again. And this is not my house. Brand new CNN reporting on why so many top Republicans are asking how do they get here and deciding not to run again. I'm Jessica Dean in for Dana Bash today. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First off, today a battlefield loss abroad triggers a blame game on American soil. Joe Biden saying House Republicans are responsible for the fall of a critical city in eastern Ukraine to a staggering Russian advance. Also, today pressure on Vladimir Putin to release Alexei Navalny's body, so the world can assess what caused his death inside a Russian jail. Already, the American president saying he has no doubt, Putin and his thugs are behind the Kremlin critic's death. We start our coverage with CNN's Arlette Saenz who's at the White House. And Arlette, we just heard from the president a short time ago. What's he saying this morning?",

This took on heightened civic significance last week after the death of Alexei Navalny in a Russian prison, something President Biden specifically says Vladimir Putin is responsible for.But this all comes as the president and Democrats are trying to use this moment to pressure Republicans to pass this additional assistance for Ukraine. The president last week expressed frustration that the House went on a two-week break. And earlier today in an exchange with our colleague, MJ Lee. He said it's shocking that Republicans have yet to act. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But he also didn't project any confidence that Navalny's death would nudge along those House Republicans who are skeptical about aid for Ukraine.This all comes as the administration for months now has warned that Ukraine would be significantly hampered on the battlefield if they were not to get this additional funding. And President Biden over the weekend held a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. And the White House says that in that phone call, he says specifically cited the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from that key town in Ukraine as evidence that they need this additional assistance. The president said that he wasn't fully confident that more towns wouldn't fall, since they are facing these ammunition shortages. But the president even as he is pushing these Republicans to get on board with this aid, he's running up against the political reality that there is a small group of House Republicans who do not want to bring this up for a vote. The president was asked whether he would be willing to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson. He said he would if Johnson would be willing to talk about anything. But it really remains unclear what this fate of Ukraine aid will look like with the House so far not bringing it up for a vote, even as President Biden is consistently pushing for Republicans to do so.",

And that full of Avdiivka has a by a local commander at the least, speaking today being blamed entirely on the lack of shells, essentially a lack of that $60 billion that can pay for that ammunition, and also a lack of individuals to have troops. That's a separate issue Ukraine is facing partly financial, but really down to the extraordinary casualties it has slowly been facing, and its desire to slow down mobilizing further parts of its population.But the full of Avdiivka be in no mistake, Jessica, is an exceptionally key moment, not just because it's been fought over for a decade since Russia first invaded in 2014. And more ferociously in the past months, yet another town that Russia is willing to throw thousands, it seems of troops out and lose them in the fighting. In order to gain something of a minor strategic advantage. I should remind you that President Zelenskyy of Ukraine said that for every Russian -- Ukrainian died -- seven Russians died, but because it possibly in the minds of many Ukrainians heralds the beginning of the difficulties they're going to face because of a lack of ammunition, because of that $60 billion being held up in Congress. Just a side note here, we're in Kherson and the lights are off every night pretty much to the fear of drones and Russian shelling. That's why it's pretty dark behind me. But that's a stark reminder that it's far away from those political games in Washington. It's very much a life and death situation here. And the Ukrainians now deeply concerned about where it may fall next. Avdiivka this weekend, Zelenskyy himself from (Inaudible) further north near Kharkiv, trying to shore up troops there. They fear they may be next for resurgent Russia indications in the south near Liubotyn (Ph). That's a tiny village. That was one of the main games, tiny as it was at the southern counter offensive in the summer. That's under Russian pressure too. Service in villages near Bakhmut. The list, frankly, goes on. And it may well be that in the weeks ahead. I'm again speaking to you about the fall of another town hard fought over. Russia seems to have the wind in its sails at this point. And it may be because they've seen how clearly the western aid is just not coming. That's damaging morale. But more importantly, it's practically damaging Ukraine on the frontlines here, Jessica.",

When I asked him in a second question, do you think Navalny's death will end up making a difference, essentially, and prompting House Republicans to take action. He said, I hope so. But he just wasn't sure that anything was going to change. And that is just the stubborn reality that the president is grappling with right now. The fact that House Speaker Johnson and a small group of House Republicans are not willing to go there. And obviously, what House Speaker Johnson is dealing with is his own political future. He knows how tricky it is to bring up something that doesn't include border security. And that's why we've been stuck in the same place for really months now.",

It doesn't teach us anything new about Putin. We mean -- I've never once argued that Putin is a kind and friendly person. We don't have to agree with him.

When he was president, you know, he had a relationship with President Putin. There were always concerns about that relationship. And so that's really starting to come back to the fore now. And I think the one person that has benefited from this is Nikki Haley. You see the Republicans on the Hill, kind of contorting themselves in different positions, trying to stay on the side of Trump but also trying to be, you know, backers of NATO, and then you see Nikki Haley, just really batting it out of the ballpark in such that she's not only saying that Trump has to answer if Putin is to blame for Navalny's death. But also saying, Trump has to answer if it's OK for Putin to be killing his critics if, you know, there's just saying that there's a lot more there.

He still appears to be leading in the polls by double digits and some polls showing him with a 30-point lead. And she's been campaigning almost daily. They're holding multiple events a day.

She was 11 points behind Trump there.Then, in weeks following that she was a little bit less committed to doing that well in South Carolina, just saying that she needed to show momentum. And then just this morning, she said on Fox and Friends that she expects it to be close, she expects it to be competitive in South Carolina. So, I think there's probably a reason that she's saying that this morning. Typically, if you're a candidate, you don't get out there and say you think it's closed unless you're seeing internal polls that suggest that. But really, the stakes couldn't be higher for her. Because if she does lose to him by 30 plus points, and that's where she is in most of the recent polls.

Ron DeSantis at the end, as you know, logging so many miles on the road with him.But look, I think she still has a limited sort of segment of the Republican Party that's available to her. She's going after moderates and other things. One thing that may be a little bit unusual about South Carolina, there's not party registration by party. So, they're hoping that there are enough of the new moderates who have moved into the Charleston area, the seacoast area. There's been a dramatic population shift. It's actually the fastest growing state, the census estimated last year. So, a lot of people were not there when she was governor that can sort of work both ways. A lot of people moved down to South Carolina during COVID. But that's where they're kind of holding out hope for. But the bigger question is, how long does she stay in this race?
