I mean, there are no differences from the North Korean Ministry of Health. This is precisely the problem when we are listening to what Hamas is saying. No matter how we feel about the tragedy that is happening to the people, taking any sort of information from Hamas is just part of their propaganda campaign. When they distribute a video of Mia Schem, who was abducted in anticipation to try and share a humane perspective of Hamas, they're actually engaging in psychological warfare and psychological terrorism. So, this is just where they come from. That is what they're trying to do. And we need to be very, very cautious about accepting anything they say. And I would -- you know, and I would say, there should not be a source of relevance for anybody in these crazy times. And we are taking our operation, and we are moving and now in day 12 now. At the end of day 12 here, we are moving forward and continuing to strike Hamas wherever they are. And it is a very, very challenging military operation.",

You know the warriors, the war -- the warfighters are continuing in their operation to destroy Hamas.

Our role currently as the IDF is to try and differentiate between the civilian population and the non-combatants and the terrorist organization. That is what we're doing by engaging people. Telling them to get out of harm's way. Move -- the Palestinians need to get out, need to listen to our instructions. That is what we're doing. We created -- today, we established a humanitarian zone in the Southwest of the Gaza Strip at Al-Mawasi and -- in order to try and create some confidence in the people.

You've just been talking about it with the IDF spokesman. And we're going to be talking with the head of the UN operations in about an hour on my program. But this is a huge, huge issue.

But this is something that was the very least of what people in the region expected him to be able to take away given that he was, you know, unable to meet with the Arab leaders because they canceled on him.

These are leaders who are not just allies of the United States, but of Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestinian Authority President, how to try to figure out a way out of this, which there doesn't seem to be any effort to de-escalate, no room for it, no mood for it. But what is the -- is the next step? What is the next phase?

The same with deaths in Gaza recently, the same with the killing of an unarmed teenager on the West Bank, who they say was on. All of this stuff leads to a distrust in that world. So, you know, this issue now the U.S. seems to have been confirmed.

Scott, I just want to kind of take a step back because if you're not familiar -- sort of almost intimately familiar with the ecosystem, not just of the Congress, but specifically of the House Republican Conference, you might be sort of scratching your head and asking what is going on even more than the people who are actually part of that conference. And when I say that what I mean is that there has -- ever since I've been covering Congress, which has been a couple of decades, it's grown even more to the point which I'm going to make, which is that they have to get things out of their system, they have to get to the point where they see no other road. But the obvious road that all of us are seeing, which is at this point, Jim Jordan doesn't look like he's going to be speaker, and that perhaps the guy who actually has the gavel temporarily, Patrick McHenry, should have it.

And what you wind up with is just another episode of monkeys getting amorous with football starring the House Republicans. And until you get tired of that show, you know, which is I think coming soon based on what I'm hearing, you're going to have to continue to go through this chaos.This Patrick McHenry business is fascinating. He is one of McCarthy's top guys. He helped him get the speakership. And if this whole thing winds up with him as being named assistant to the regional manager, whatever title they're going to give him here, which is not in the Constitution, this will be like the biggest circle of jerks in the history of circles are jerks. I mean -- I mean, to have McCarthy's guy back in as a temporary speaker. And if you're a conservative and you have followed Jim Jordan, you follow these guys in you -- and you want them to be right, remember, you're the mark here. There was no plan. They had no plan. They threw McCarthy overboard without any plan whatsoever of what to do next. And so, when you think about what this means for the conservative cause, how are you going to beat Joe Biden without a plan? How are you going to advance our principles without a plan?

Maybe he needs to go to a second round. I don't understand his reason for going to a third or fourth especially if he's going to lose more people. Except that, they're going to continue to try to bully folks. I think what you're -- what is a likely possible I guess, scenario here in this goat rodeo to continue Scott Jennings' analogies is that they give -- they give Patrick McHenry temporary powers until January 2. And then Jim Jordan or somebody just like him continues to pressure those 20 or 30 until that January 2 date. Until it gets to the point where everybody's been worn down and broken down. I mean, this thing started, Dana, with 50 people saying they would never vote for Jim Jordan. And 30 of them -- I was very impressed we got to 20 yesterday, but 30 of them collapsed in a point of about 12 hours because, you know, Sean Hannity's booker reached out to them and asked them if they were planning to vote against Jim Jordan. That was the amount of pressure they could take. So, they're going to be ticked off because even though they collapsed in a heap of fear, they're not happy they had to collapse in that heap.
