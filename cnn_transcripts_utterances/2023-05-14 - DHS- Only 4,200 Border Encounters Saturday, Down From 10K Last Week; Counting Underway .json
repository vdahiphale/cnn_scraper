Thank you so much for joining us on this Mother's Day and Happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there.We do begin this hour at the US-Mexico border where the number of migrant crossing has dwindled significantly in the three days since Title 42 expired, that COVID-era immigration policy had allowed for near instant deportations and in the days prior to its expiration, the US had seen record migrants trying to enter the United States. But today, Department of Homeland Security officials say they've seen a 50 percent drop in the number of migrant crossings in the last three days.

Now he did acknowledge that it is too early to say whether that surge has reached its peak. But if you take a look at the numbers, there has been a significant decrease in the number of encounters since Title 42 lifted. Just yesterday, there were 4,200 encounters; the day before 6,300. If you compare that to before when Title 42 was in place, 9,600; over 10,000 on Wednesday and higher than that on Tuesday. So we will see how those encounters continue to play out over the course of the next few days. But the White House and the Biden administration has been quite forceful in defending their positions and in the policy that they've put in place. In the meantime, they've been facing criticism from both sides of the aisle. People -- Democrats and Republicans saying that they've been insufficiently prepared for this moment and some within their own party also questioning the tightening of asylum rules. The ACLU has filed a lawsuit against the administration challenging their rule that would prevent migrants who are transiting through other countries from seeking asylum in the US. The Biden administration says that they need to seek asylum in those countries before trying to come here. Additionally, there are a host of other legal challenges that the administration is facing at this moment. Chief among those is a ruling down in Florida by a federal judge who has blocked the Biden administration's plan to release migrants from CBP custody without set court dates. That's something that previous administrations have used in the past to try to ease capacity concerns. But now that program, that plan is on hold for roughly two weeks. Now, the Justice Department has appealed that. They have asked for a stay and if they don't get that stay by tomorrow afternoon, they are going to go to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to ask for an emergency request. That is just one of the tools that the administration is trying to use at this moment as they're grappling with the lifting of Title 42 and the impact it will have on the border.",

Many of the asylum seekers who I have had an opportunity to speak to in some of the area shelters here in El Paso, they have been apprehended, processed, and then released by federal authorities.So now, they are waiting in some of these shelters, waiting to find out exactly what comes next. And for many of these, it's not necessarily the when, but if they will be able to secure the resources to get either on a bus or an airplane as they can legally do, and then travel to any of the cities that we've seen those upticks in arrivals of asylum seekers. When speaking to some of the asylum seekers, they tell us a Denver is one city; Chicago, DC, but certainly New York City continues to be sort of the north star for so many of these individuals. So those numbers in terms of the folks who are arriving in those American cities, those numbers are going to continue to rise. In some, it'll be a few dozen a day, but New York City, it'll be perhaps a couple of hundred a day, which is what I've heard from sources in New York City. But in terms of that 50 percent decrease that Arlette just went over, here is what that means for folks here on the border, on the frontlines of the nation, that lack of a spike in illegal crossings, that will likely mean an opportunity for DHS officials to pretty much catch up with processing the tens of thousands of asylum seekers that turn themselves in the moments leading up to the expiration of Title 42. But as we saw in some recently filed federal court documents, CBP senior official believes that there is potential for those apprehensions to go from perhaps the 4,000 that we saw yesterday per day to make it well over 10,000. Now, whether or not we see that play out, that is something that we might potentially have to monitor, obviously, for the next couple of days. But it just speaks to the situation on the ground, the lack of a spike in crossings, it gives opportunity, basically to reset the system, not just DHS officials, but also for those that are running the shelters to make sure that those folks that they have in their facilities can secure passage north -- Alex.",

CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it is not the first one happening this month in this country, but we're learning that in this case, officers are still trying to piece together exactly what happened. They say they don't have a suspect. They essentially don't have a motive here either as they try to investigate and figure out exactly what happened. What they're saying is that just before 11:00 PM in Yuma, Arizona, they received a call about a shooting, and when they arrived, people had already been shot, specifically a 19-year-old had already been taken to the hospital. Unfortunately, he was pronounced dead at the hospital. There was a 20-year-old that was also taken to the hospital and he later died as well. And then a 16-year-old who was critically injured and had to be flown from Yuma to Phoenix, Arizona, we still don't know exactly what his condition is at the moment. And then the rest of those injured according to police were ages 15, 19, 18, and 16. So these were, you know, teenagers, young people that were at this party and authorities again, saying they're trying to figure out exactly what happened. Here is Yuma Police. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SGT.

Now, it is the defeat of Russia that Zelenskyy has made absolutely clear is the agenda for Ukraine, defeat of Russia that is inside his own borders. He is not getting involved in any discussion about the future of Russia, but he does want them out of his territory. And in the past, he's resisted any kind of attempts to try to mitigate or dilute his agenda and I think he's going to be steadying the allies ahead of this offensive, making sure that the supply lines for resupply, if they get bogged down, are going to be there so that the Ukrainians don't squander the remaining human lives that they're going to be prepared to throw at this problem -- Alex.",

We've heard it from Rome, we've heard it from Berlin, we're about to hear it from Paris.Again, the two men are going to be discussing much less extra weaponry that in Berlin Zelenskyy received that nearly $3 billion extra aid military package with those 30 Leopard tanks. Remember that they were for a long time, the idea of sending the tanks resisted by Germany. In fact, they've now become a huge supplier of them. In this leg of his whistlestop tour, we don't expect necessarily further weapons commitments, but a discussion about how France can continue playing its part, they are also going to be discussing that 10-point plan of Zelenskyy. But of course, it is the objects that are so important here. The support that Europe continues to give and what we've just heard from President Zelenskyy who should be arriving any second now from his car, going on his Telegram channel saying, with every one of these meetings with all the time that passes, Europe and Ukraine grow closer, Russia becomes even more under pressure as a result of that proximity. So about showing once again, shoulder-to-shoulder the European support for President Zelenskyy. Of course, as Sam was just saying ahead of this counteroffensive, we have also been hearing a little bit more about that, while he was -- Zelenskyy was in Rome, saying that it could -- it should be starting imminently. They have been preparing, we'd heard early last week from the Ukrainian president, they needed a little more time to get these western weapons in place. What he said in Rome was that it should be starting the first steps of it, should be starting anytime soon. So meeting just getting underway, it is President Zelenskyy's car that's arriving here, Alex for that meeting. He is due to spend the night in Paris and leave tomorrow morning, this hot off the heels of course of his trip to Rome and Berlin. It isn't the first time he's been to Paris , he was here only back in February.

      "sentences": "I mean, streaming is the big music tech story of the 2010s.You have to remember that prior to that, 20th century music was a physicalized thing, it was something you can hold in your hand, you would buy vinyl or you'd buy cassette or on eight-track or a CD, then the late 1990s, music becomes de-physicalized with the rise of Napster and peer-to-peer sharing networks, all of a sudden music is something that is a digital file that you can pass around and share around with friends that leads to the piracy that we just heard about, which has other kinds of consequences for the business of recorded music. But then in the 2010s, you have the rise of these music streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple, and Tidal, and they have both pluses and minuses for the industry. I think the big plus would be that suddenly fans are more empowered than they've ever been. They can create playlists, they can share music in a way that they couldn't before and they have more power to actually determine the kinds of hits that are made in the music industry. It's no longer just programmed from the top down. And also, music is more on demand. You can suddenly click a button and just listen to anything that you want to hear in a way that makes it highly accessible. But on the flip side, some artists are really feeling disempowered, streaming services in terms of the economics of recorded music, they don't pay out to artists the same way that they used to in the past, and so that's difficult for most artists who are trying to earn a steady living, or livable wage in terms of just their recorded music. So there's a double-edged sword to music and tech in the 2010s.",
