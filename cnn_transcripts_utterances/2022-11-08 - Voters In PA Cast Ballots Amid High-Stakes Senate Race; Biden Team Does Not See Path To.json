She's our CNN special correspondent, Audie Cornish, CNN anchor and correspondent and Mark Preston, a CNN senior political analyst. Mark, I know you've been talking to some of the Fetterman campaign, folks today, what are they -- how are they feeling right now?MARK PRESTON, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think they feel cautiously optimistic. But really, the phrase that they're saying is buckle up. Now we've heard John talk about this. And we'll be talking about this throughout the day. Jason in Philadelphia, of course, Brian in Pittsburgh right now, there's a very good chance we're not going to find out who the winner is tonight. I mean, I think there's a better, you know, better than 50-50 chance, we don't know who's there. So the Fetterman campaign are telling their people to just be calm, you know, get out to vote, of course, the Oz people saying the same thing. But what was interesting is the inflection points that the Fetterman campaign said that will look back upon, the first inflection point happens in August, late August, when, you know, we see the GOP has decided to come home to us. You know, we see Mitch McConnell has gone in. He's put his Senate Republican leadership fund, political action committee in to use, $31 million since Labor Day, in fact ads on John Fetterman. Second inflection point is the Oprah announcement. Now normally, I would say, oh, that's just a gimmick. You're saying it. But this is why it's important in Philadelphia. That was the only news that really broke through in the past month. The reason being Philadelphia is a sports town. You have the Eagles right now who are eight and zero, you have the Phillies, who were on this World Series run. The crime, the crime ads if you were trying to beat John Fetterman up with will find out whether or not they actually got through in Philadelphia because they, you know, according to Fetterman campaign, they don't think it was breaking through, because there was such good news. But we'll be interesting to see if it doesn't break through there where there wasn't good news perhaps maybe in Georgia or in Nevada, some of these other states, will those crime ads really take down the --",

A lot of their candidates in these tight races, they weren't so sure about, Oz was one of them. But they say exactly what Mark just said and what that voter just said to Brian Todd, its pocketbook issues, its food prices, its gas prices, its inflation.So should we all quote for the millionth time, James Carville, it's the economy stupid. That's what the Republicans feel it's coming down to. Just to echo something Mark said and John King said, I think the word we're hearing on both sides of the aisle is patience. And I think it was very reassuring actually, to hear that voters say he had faith in the system, because this is going to take a while. He may want those absentee ballots counted more quote quickly. It's just going to take the time, it takes both.",

His political team is monitoring the events from the Eisenhower Office Building, which is obviously near the West Wing. Privately when you talk to them, Biden's advisors acknowledged little chance of holding the House. They do though say publicly and privately that they may hold the Senate.I'm joined now by the Democratic former senator from Minnesota, Al Franken and the Republican governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, so thanks very much to both of you. So, Senator, let's just start with the White House's view, right, that they're acknowledging privately. I know publicly, not so much, but privately that they have little chance of holding the House. But they do you believe that that they can hold the Senate maybe even make gains? Is that realistic? AL FRANKEN (D-MN), FORMER U.S. SENATOR: Yes, those races that we're talking about, and Georgia and Pennsylvania and Nevada and Arizona and North Carolina and Ohio and Wisconsin, are all pretty close.

ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): Well, whenever you look at the Senate, I agree it's going to be close. Everybody has to get out and vote and participate this election cycle because the importance of it, I look at momentum, the polls are close. And so who in the last days has momentum, I think that is a defining difference. And I like where the GOP is. I think our candidates have gained momentum. They've talked about issues that resonate with voters. They've listened to them. And for that reason, I'm optimistic about where we come out this night.",

But tell you one thing it's going to do is going to cap how much seniors are going to spend on pharmaceuticals. Republicans want to get rid of that.Republicans want to cut Medicare and Social Security. They've said that. Rick Scott ran on that. He headed up the Senate, Republican Senate Campaign Committee.

They wanted to tell them that abortion was the key issue. And in fact, the voters were saying, no, the biggest issue is, is the fact that we have inflation and energy crisis, border security, violence. And the candidates listen to the voters on the Republican side.And whenever you look at the inflation issue itself, it's Biden's inflation. And so you absolutely, it's controlling spinning. I'm a governor, I've seen how much money has come out of Washington, and that is what has spiked the inflation as well as the energy crunch, which again, is Biden's responsibility. And so the message that we have is really coming from the grassroots of the voters, and that's why they have momentum.",

At issue here are the mail-in ballots that were sent in with either the wrong date or no date at all. Here's an example of an actual ballot this election cycle that was cured or corrected in time. You can see this voter was able to fix the date just yesterday. Some may not be impacted or won't be fixed in time.And so Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman has now joined a lawsuit asking a federal court to supersede a previous decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and allow those misstated or undated votes to count arguing the date on the mail-in ballot envelope has no bearing on a voter's qualifications and serves no purpose. He says other than to erect barriers to qualified voters exercising their fundamental constitutional right to vote. So how many votes are we talking? At last check, 3,600 or so in Philadelphia County that's here in the south west corner or southeast corner, I should say. We also know some of those have been cured. At least 1,000 in Allegheny County, that's the Pittsburgh area. And a couple 100 in Monroe County. Now all three of these counties voted for Biden in 2020.
