And that is especially true because there were these massive meltdowns over the summer, and so there's a lot of concern that there's going to be another wave of meltdowns are more people take to the air to fly. So airlines are trying to avoid this. They are in the midst of a huge hiring spree. CNN's Pete Muntean has more on all that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION AND TRANSPORTATION CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  Airlines have been preparing for the rush at airports with a rush all their own, hiring thousands of new workers from the front desk to the flight deck.

And then you have Konstantin Kosachev who is a very senior senator here in Russia -- very well-known in this country -- who said he believed that was actually the opposite of trying to seek peace in Ukraine. Obviously, all of this comes as the Russians have just recently said that they've actually mobilized another 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. And Vladimir Putin says it's even more than that because there's also some people who are voluntarily signing up. Also, of course, the Russians pouring military gear into Ukraine. So, it certainly seems to be an interesting message there coming from that Russian politician. And also, if you look at what's going on overnight, the Ukrainians are saying that there were several Ukrainian towns that were shelled by the Russians. We can see the map here -- especially in the south around that town Kryvyi Rih. There's a place called Nikopol that was shelled by the Russians. That's very close to a very key nuclear power plant. So certainly, it seems as though the Russians, on the one hand, are keeping the war going on in full force, shelling a lot of places across that entire front line while, at the same time, blaming the West for allegedly fueling the conflict, Whitney.",

And there's a little bit of good luck, Whitney, with this as well because it's always good to get a win in the NFL, but it is great to get a win in Mexico City. Four of the last six teams to play a regular season game at that stadium there have reached the playoffs, and the two most recent winners both earned trips to the Super Bowl in those seasons. So maybe some good luck. The 49ers looked like a team on a mission -- that's for sure. Backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo leading the way. He put on a show in primetime throwing four touchdown passes, including two each to Brandon Aiyuk and George Kittle. And it was arguably San Francisco's best offensive performance of the season. The Niners win their third game in a row -- 38-10 the final there. The Brown University baseball team is making history long before the first pitch of the season will be thrown. Eighteen-year-old freshman Olivia Pichardo was added to the team yesterday. She is the first woman in history to be on an active division one college baseball roster. The Queens, New York native began playing in kindergarten at age five. She went on to play for her high school before trying out as a walk-on at Brown. So a big congratulations to her. And a halftime show fail, Whitney, but this was the sweetest one that we have ever seen. The Pacers hosting the Magic on Monday. Pacers cheerleaders trying in earnest to get a puppy race going -- that's what this was billed as -- but the competitors missed the memo about the racing part. Instead, they just looked adorable in their jerseys -- doggone adorable. And one of our studio crew made mention of the fact that they were wearing diapers.
