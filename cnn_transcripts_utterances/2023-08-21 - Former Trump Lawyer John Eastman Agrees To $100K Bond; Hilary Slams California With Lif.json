They're believed to be meeting with the district attorney trying to hash out terms of the former president's bond.This comes as we're learning in a new court filing that Trump's former attorney, John Eastman, who is facing multiple criminal charges in the Georgia case has agreed to a $100,000 bond. Joining us now to discuss, we have CNN political commentators, Bakari Sellers and Jonah Goldberg with us as well. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being with us. Bacari to you first. This, or Jonah, too you first. This is what he's dealing with -- the former president. And yet you look at the polls, you see Trump maintaining a commanding lead in the latest polling, even as he's pulled out of Wednesday's debate. Do you think that the other candidates will still be talking about this on the debate stage?",

Because we're seeing Republicans, how they're responding, those who will be on the debate stage and then others. Bill Cassidy, John Sununu, what they are saying taking on former President Trump. How do you think Democrats, including President Biden, are responding here?GOLDBERG Well, I think they're basically trying to stay out of it. You know, when your opponent is destroying itself, don't get in the way, is the old maxim. I think there are real problems for Democrats though. I think the Hunter Biden or Biden family investigation has more legs than a lot of people think it does. That doesn't mean that they're going to prove every allegation against Joe Biden. But it could get to the point where there is enough smoke that Joe Biden's own ethical problems real or alleged create -- make him less of a good candidate to run against someone so corrupted as Donald Trump. It kind of -- you know, it allows for all both sidesers to find safe harbor. And I think that the Democrats are just -- they're in this weird Catch-22 where they obviously despise Donald Trump -- and I understand why. But at the same time, I think they think he's the most beatable candidate. And so, they kind of want to see him as the nominee. And I think both things happen to be true in a sense, that I think Joe Biden would lose against a number of the other Republican candidates. At the same time, you know, if you force the choice on the electorate, I think the people who say they don't like both candidates will break heavily toward Joe Biden because they'll be voting against Donald Trump rather than for Joe Biden.",

We believe that he's probably the most beatable candidate of them all. But this is also Donald Trump's party so it looks like you're preparing for a battle against him anyway and this will be over on king day, which is the day of the Iowa caucuses. So that's kind of first.The second thing is, you know, there is a whole lot of what about-ism when it comes to Hunter Biden. But there is a great deal of difference between the multiple felony counts the president of the United States is looking at versus some activities or actions by this president's son. And I think that has to be stated clearly. Republicans are going to try to Benghazi this to all hell. They're going to have hearings. They're going to say that there is smoke. They are going to say that we're going to have all of this responsibility placed on simply to distract the American people away from this election and drive up Joe Biden's negatives. That is all they want to do is drive up Joe Biden's negatives. And I don't think that's going to work in this case. And the main reason I don't think it's going to work, is one, Democrats are saying, if Hunter Biden committed a crime, hold him accountable. But two, addiction touches every single family in this country. Or the overwhelming majority there of. And this is a very interesting needle that Republicans are trying to thread by persecuting someone with an addiction. If while having this addiction he committed crimes, then punish him. But there's literally no evidence that this ties back to the president of the United States. And I think that what-about-ism is going to fall flat as we had into this selection.",

At the same time, I don't think that is true that there's no evidence trying everything to Joe Biden. His story about his relationship with Hunter's business has changed. And all I'm saying is that it generates enough opportunities to throw mud that these things can cancel each other out in a way that may be wrong on the merits -- I'm totally open to that. But sort of like, you know, the age issue can cancel each other out on the merits as a political matter because they're both really old people and they're both very unpopular.

Because they do still appear to be here on the grounds of the government center around the courthouse for Fulton County, Georgia.We're watching very closely Trump's lawyers today. Because today is the day that they come in and they make some sort of agreement with prosecutors from the district attorney's office about the terms that Donald Trump must abide by if he's going to not be in jail as he awaits trial here in Georgia for that indictment. I believe it's 13 counts that he faces for what he was trying to do to hold on to the presidency after the election and specifically the steps he took in Georgia. He is accused of racketeering and several other conspiracy and additional offenses, making some false statements as well. But what we're watching as we wait to see exactly what the terms are that his team comes -- gets together with the prosecutors, we're seeing others in his case. Some of the 18 other defendants. There are lawyers arriving or departing. And we are also seeing some of these, what's called a consent bond. So an agreement between the prosecutor's office and the defense attorney signed off by a judge so that the arrest can go smoothly and the person can be released from jail. We just saw some of the court documents for two different defendants who have not yet entered their pleadings here. One is John Eastman, that very prominent attorney who was working for Donald Trump after the election. His bond is $100,000.

Because it's still a mess. We do know that some of the roads in and out of Palm Springs are open. However, several of the major roads remain closed at this time. 911 communications are back up. But the reason why is because this is one way to get to the interstate here and it remains closed here as you can see perhaps in the distance. There are some cars, some semitrucks that are still blocking the road. But there's some construction, movement of large vehicles that are trying to clear the road. Trying to get this mud out of the way here. But this is why schools were closed today and why many businesses remain closed today as well.

As far as these other conditions, well some of them are pretty standard and it is standard to include things like refraining from intimidating witnesses in conditions of release.What's really remarkable here is, as Katelyn laid out, the specificity of what is included here in terms of what Trump cannot do. So he cannot directly or indirectly intimidate witnesses through social media posts. That certainly I think is a direct reaction to the some of the inflammatory rhetoric that Trump has been using on his social media posts in terms of what he's been saying about Fani Willis. What he has been saying about grand jurors.

And she made him when he didn't speak, she repeated it and made him say, yes, I understand. And so, that judge handled it that way.
