I think the goal here is to question those around him first and follow those answers and facts to where they lead. If it leads to Dr. Fauci he should be coming forward before the committee as should Peter Daszak of Eco Health Alliance which is where the money was funneled from NIH to Eco Health, then to the Wuhan lab.But Dr. Fauci did deny that NIH funding went. But in an e-mail we were able to produce through foil request we were able to show the connection here that he was informed, quite frankly, of that funding, that NIH money through NIH went to the Wuhan lab. And then I think he's later backtracked on that. And by the way we have the proof to show it. So, there's no doubt that money did make its way to the Wuhan lab, and that is something where we should be not be seeing that money ever going to a communist country's lab that developed this gain of function research that may have then produced this virus.",

He thinks Ukraine will eventually win because of the determination of the Ukrainian people. But if it were, it wouldn't just be a loss for Ukraine, it would be a loss for the whole West, a loss for the whole world. Because it would simply encourage countries like Russia to go ahead and take advantage and try to achieve more through aggression and invasion and stuff like that.So, he thinks that the stakes are enormous, and he was very forceful and deeply appreciative of what the United States and other Western countries have done. But he says if the Ukrainians are going to win the U.S. has to start providing F-16 fighter jets, other advanced weapons to Ukraine. They need it, they need it to win. Longer range ground to ground missiles, for example. He says there's no great interest in Ukraine attacking targets inside Russia. He says that's not going to happen. But to stop the Russians -- because the Russians are willing to throw thousands of troops in there, he said the Russians don't care how many people they lose, how many men and women die in the course of this. The only thing they want to do is destroy Ukraine. But the Ukrainians -- he says we know every name of every Ukrainian soldier who's killed, and it's so painful to us.
