What Ukraine says it must have to push back Moscow's forces as the war grinds into its second year. And in East Palestine, Ohio, officials are going door-to-door to check on the health of residents after the toxic train wreck. We'll discuss the risks they could be facing. And a rare winter storm is bringing historic snow, dangerous flooding and blizzard conditions to California. The latest weather report, ahead. Just days after observing the one-year mark of the Russian invasion, Ukrainians are noting another grim anniversary, the loss of Crimea to Moscow in 2014. It's been a thorn in Ukraine's side ever since and every year is remembered on this date with a day of resistance. Meanwhile, the latest package of E.U. sanctions against Russia is getting high marks in Kyiv. Here's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Although billions of dollars in aid have been pledged, have been sent to Ukraine over the course of this one-year conflict, the United States alone, $113 billion pledged to Ukraine, $2 billion of that on Friday, marking the one-year anniversary of the war.President Zelenskyy is pleading for more. And he's not going to stop asking, Laila, because you have to accept the reality here on the ground, that before this conflict, Ukraine was facing a much greater military force from Russia, one that had more manpower, more funding, more weapons. And what Ukraine is trying to do here through its partners, through its allies, is have a qualitative advantage. Face off a soviet-era military with more advanced weapons systems from NATO and other partners. And that seems, of course, to be happening, but there is, of course, always a lag time, Laila, between when something is promised, like Leopard tanks, and when Ukrainian soldiers are actually trained and able to use them on the ground to make a difference on the battlefield. And we're already seeing, according to Ukrainian forces, that they are struggling in some places along that eastern front. The city of Bakhmut, a major flashpoint there, where Ukrainian commanders say they don't have the means to fight back Russian forces.

Some of these weapons we are discussing that the west might be considering sending to Ukraine, it was unfathomable a year ago that President Zelenskyy would receive these. Even long-range artillery at the beginning of the conflict was considered something that could aggravate tensions with Moscow.

He's an associate professor of political science at Tufts University. He's also the co-author of Danger Zone, The Coming Conflict with China. A very good day, sir, so good to have you with us. The U.S. mow says it has intelligence that the Chinese government is considering providing Russia with drones and ammunition for use in the war in Ukraine. E.U.'s top diplomat Josep Borrell also expresses concerns about China's possible role in the conflict. From an American perspective, what is the threat posed by China getting involved in Russia's war? MICHAEL BECKLEY, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, TUFTS UNIVERSITY: I think most immediately, it could shift the balance of power within Ukraine itself. One reason Ukraine has been doing so well is because it's received so much aid. But if Russia starts receiving more ammunition from China, it will be able to fight much longer. But I think more broadly, it's just the idea that we really would be back to a cold war situation. Effectively, the war in Ukraine would be very much a proxy war between the west, the United States and its allies, and now a Russia-China alliance with an assist from other countries like Iran, Belarus and North Korea.

And China also has to worry that if the war goes on, China is a major commodities importer, commodity prices are very much at risk in such a major war and just the tide of global instability could hurt China.

And they don't like the fact that those countries also tend to violate the sovereignty of other nations in doing so. And so, they're trying to create an alternative vision of world order that's built around a hierarchal, well-ordered system based on state sovereignty. And so they stick together, they band together.
