Their growth this year is not what they expected. They had a quick surge after they opened up the country after COVID and now they've dropped as well. The unemployment rate of their -- of Chinese youth is I think about 20 percent. So they have a good number of economic problems that they are facing. So they cannot afford economic tensions and standoffs with the United States or the world for that matter, which is one reason why, of course, I suspect they will be reluctant to cross the line when it comes to providing lethal aid to the Russians because that would, of course -- could result in financial and economic sanctions against Beijing.",
