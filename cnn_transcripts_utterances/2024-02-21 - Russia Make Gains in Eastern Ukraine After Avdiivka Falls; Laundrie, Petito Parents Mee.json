Ukraine thus far has denied losing more territory.Nevertheless, fierce battles are unfolding in the east and southern part of the country as Russia is appearing to grow bolder and more aggressive in its attacks. CNN Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour joins us now live from the capital of Ukraine in Kyiv. Christiane, how significant are these Russian gains?",

And the conditions on the front line are such that they really can't afford to wait that long if Ukraine is to keep defending itself.You know, the counteroffensive over the summer did not go as hoped. That's true. And yet they were able to maintain a stalemate in the words of the Ukrainian commander at that time. That meant that they were holding the line and not one side was making significant gains. But now even that stalemate is at threat while the Russians are making gains. So it's absolutely urgent for them, in their words and what they tell us, to get this as soon as possible. It absolutely is showing up. The delay is showing up on the front lines. And, of course, you know, we've seen what Ukraine has been able to do with the nearly two years of NATO support. It's been able to keep them at bay. And it's been able to really sort of really try to hold the line here. But now the situation is getting very, very desperate.",

It's just such a difficult thing for people here to accept. Clearly, they, you know, it's not just that he seems hesitant, former President Trump. As you know, he has torpedoed the delivery of aid by telling his MAGA wing of the Republican Party in Congress not to do it. I mean, that's the bottom line. That's what we heard in Munich from many of the Republican senators who were there.It was actually quite a small Republican delegation this time. But nonetheless, they stuck to the MAGA party line. To be fair, one of the Republican senators who I spoke to on a panel, he said we will do the right thing. He said democracy is messy. It's difficult in the United States. We have this very, you know, he kept returning to the border issue and wouldn't be budged from that issue. But he kept saying we will do the right thing. The question is when. And here they say to us that we have always looked to America as the nation that fundamentally upholds and supports and promotes democracy and freedom around the world. And they say we, Ukraine, are the buffer between the autocratic world and the democratic world. And so they really know, and they're right in it here, trying to hold that line between democracy and autocracy in Europe. And they know -- they know Putin very well because this is actually the 12th year of Putin's, or the 10th year, I'm sorry, of Putin's invasion. He started back in 2014. And they've been holding that line for a long, long time. So it's a fundamental battle for democracy. They are, you know, fighting it. And what they want is just the ammunition and the weapons to fight it.",

It's a civil case all about money damages.And what we do know is that a professional mediator, he's an attorney, but he is designated by the State Bar of Florida to mediate situations like this, is meeting, significant that they will all be together. And you can have your attorney represent you when you're not there. But I learned that all the families, the two families, will be together there. And they're trying to go through this to see if there is a monetary settlement that can be worked out so they don't have to go to trial. And it is, just as you said, it is confidential. So we may never know exactly what was said, exactly what was arrived at will have to go into the record in court. But we won't know how they got there. But the emotions have to be so high because this is a case where the parents of Gabby Petito, when they were looking for her, had no idea what had happened to her. They were reaching out to the Laundries every day, trying to text them, email them, phone them. And they were blocked continually. And now through deposition, we do know that Brian Laundrie called his parents, finally told his father, Gabby's gone, I need an attorney, and I'm coming home. And he drove home in her van. And they never told the Petitos any of that. Now they say, the Laundries say, we have no legal duty to tell you that. Our attorney told us not to talk to you. And furthermore, we don't have to talk to you if that is our choice. We were concerned for our son and what was happening. So the emotions have to be high, but it's significant because if they don't reach a settlement today, this case is going to trial.",

The talk show host responded last night after learning Santos wants to take him to court over a series of videos Santos claims he was duped into recording.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: I am currently embroiled in what may be the most preposterous lawsuit of all time. George Santos, a man Republicans kicked out of Congress for being a fraud, is suing me for fraud. After he was removed from the House, George signed on with Cameo to make some money. You know, the website where you can get a celebrity to make a video. So we wrote some absolutely ridiculous messages for him to read. We gave them a credit card number. And sure enough, he recorded the messages and sent them back to us. And now he's suing. He says we deceived him. If there's one thing George Santos will not stand for, it's using a fake name under false pretenses. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's the first response we've seen from the late- night comedian since Santos filed this lawsuit over the weekend.You know, it's really a remarkable lawsuit for the reasons that Jimmy Kimmel himself is laying out. You know, Santos was ejected from Congress last year over these fraud allegations, and now he's making those same allegations against Jimmy Kimmel. So it's quite ironic, and that's something that Kimmel, you know, pointed out in his response there. But I'll leave the actual terms and conditions and legal stuff up to the lawyers, guys.",
