After six weeks, the outcome in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial is now in the hands of the jury. The seven men and five women that make up that jury in the first-ever criminal trial of a former president have now been deliberating for just over three hours. This morning, the judge overseeing the trial, Juan Merchan, issued their final jury instructions, explaining how to handle witnesses they might not trust, also telling them they should not hold it against Trump that he refused to testify in his own defense. The former president is charged with 34 counts, felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments made to the adult-film star Stormy Daniels, just days before the 2016 presidential election. Now we wait for an historic verdict. CNN's Jessica Schneider joins me now. Jessica, I hear you just got a notice from the courtroom?",

So if the jurors find that there's something he may have lied about, not spoken the truth about, they can say, look, we just don't believe Michael Cohen.

They may want read back as it relates to Cohen, read back as it relates to Stormy Daniels, read back as it relates to David Pecker, read back as it relates to whatever, right? Or they may just have a generic question. And so I would be very surprised if this had anything to do with a verdict, and I would think I -- again, just my guess were reading believed that there may be many nodes that are passed out so they can parse out the specifics of the law with the law means in addition to specific facts and what they need clarification on.",

And second, that he did so with the state of mind required with the commission of the offense, the extent or degree of defendant's participation in the crime does not matter. Can you explain, Janet, what is the significance of that saying, find beyond a reasonable doubt, in effect, that he was involved, but degree of involvement is not a barrier to a -- to a conviction in a fact? What's the significance and is that standard?",

If anyone did it, it's Michael Cohen.The example I always use is Charles Mason, you know, he didn't kill anybody, right? Charles Manson rather, he said do something witchy, and the followers went out and committed all these atrocious crimes. It's enough to cause it to happen. He doesn't have to have done all of the steps where it happened. So the judge is just basically doesn't want the jury to be confused and because he didn't personally give the checks to Stormy Daniels or he's not accused of even necessarily brokering this deal, it is enough that Michael Cohen did these things on his behalf and add his direction, and that Trump had some involvement. But he doesn't have to have completed the act. And I think that, you know, that's a bad instruction for the defense, but it is a standard instruction.",

There are several options that I understand it.He also said jurors do not need to be unanimous on quote, whether the defendant committed the crime personally or acted in concert with another or both. Explain that because I -- you know, my layman's impression was that the jury has to be 100 percent unanimous on everything. Is this standard instruction and what's a significance of those -- significance of those specific instructions?",

      "speaker": "JACKSON",
      "sentences": "Yes. So that's problematic for a couple of reasons. First, let's talk about reasonable doubt and unanimous juries, right? They're certainly instructed as to reasonable doubt and what that means, it doesn't mean doubt as to a mathematical certainty. It means a doubt which could be reasonable, prudent based upon the facts given.It -- and then you pivot to the issue of unanimous. That means that any event one or more jurors hold out. You're not unanimous. It's a mistrial, meaning you have to do it all over again. The thing that concerns me and I think will be an appealable issue relates to the other crime, right? Now, you can find all of you collectively that Mr. Trump was involved in the fraud of the ledgers of the invoices of the checks and that would be a misdemeanor falsifying business records. It elevates the felony, Jim, because you find that it was in right? It was in a conspiracy or not conspiracy, but you were concealing some other crime. And the fact that you don't have to be unanimous on what that other crime is I think troubles me a lot. And I think what also troubles me also, an appealable issue for sure, we're going to see, is this other crime. It was sort of a mystery throughout the trial, is it a tax crime? Is that a campaign finance crime? Is it an election crime? And so, as a defense attorney, you just want to know, notice due process, notes and opportunity to be heard. And so that is a little troubling to the extent that everything you should be unanimous on, but to be able to say, well, some of us think it was a tax crime. Okay, he's guilty. Some of us think it was a campaign violation, okay, he's guilty. Some of us think maybe it's an election interference, that's troubling and will be for sure brought to an appellate court should there be a conviction.",

I mean, that is a fact that it was going to be problematic and maybe it is, but I think obviously he's been to prison for lying and the state made the point. He doesn't want to go back there and his motivation patient back then was to lie for Trump. He doesn't have a motivation now to lie against Trump.And juries have that certain instruction all the time. You can believe all part or none of any witnesses testimony, and I just think that a jury isn't going to think, well, you know, he lied about things back in front of Congress about Russia, well, I think he's lying about this recorded conversation, or I think he's lying about the conversation that he had with Trump, but that was during an event that was 90 seconds long. They are going to parse apart what they do and don't believe and we have two lawyers on the jury. And they know that.

The note contains four requests. The first one is they request David Peckers testimony regarding the phone conversation with Donald Trump while Pecker was in the investor meeting. And so, there are four requests. The first one being they want to read back of testimony from David Pecker relating to this specific conversation he had with Donald Trump. Apparently, there are also three more requests which were waiting for from the courtroom, from our reporters inside. And interestingly, Jim, I mean, this process takes a long time.

Well, when did that take place? It took place early on. Well, what was that early on? It was with David Pecker. Who's David Pecker? He's the \"National Enquirer\" guy. When did the meeting take place? Who was at the meeting? So these are all things that go to the core issue, which is the conspiracy, and I'd be concerned, but again, it could be one juror that has a concern, doesn't necessarily mean many share that concern.

Most of them, women and children.Today, Israel's head of national security said to expect going forward another seven months of fighting. For more on what this all means, I want to bring in former Middle East negotiator for the State Department, Aaron David Miller. Good to have you, Aaron. I mean, listen, I -- I imagine Israel is going to say, you said don't use big weapons there, and that is something. President Biden said these 2,000-pound bombs that have caused so much collateral damage, that is civilians. So they use smaller diameter weapons here, but you still have civilian casualties. On the flip side, I imagine Israel's critics would say, well, that shows the issue with attacking Rafah. It's so concentrated with civilians, it's hard not to fire into there without having significant civilian life. I mean, what's your best read of this particular situation. AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: I mean, all of this is true, Jim. If you -- if you look at the exact words that the president use this network on May 8 and this isn't surprising. Sometimes the president isn't -- isn't that specific or his language is vague. It could mean anything. Don't go into Rafah. I'm not going to supply you the weapons that you historically use in these cities, which suggests 2,000-pound, 500- pound bombs, which Israelis have used in northern and central Gaza and I think -- that I think misses the point. I think in the end, nine months into this war, and next week, it'll be nine months. I think it should be clear to anyone, but the consistently that this president is not looking for a major confrontation with the Israeli government (ph). He doesn't want it because it's awkward and politically costly. He doesn't want it because he's emotionally tethered to Israel's prosecution of this war against Hamas, a terror organization which holds hostages, including Americans and abuses them. He doesn't want it because its bad politics on the Republican side. But the -- it's the last reason that I'm questioning. He doesn't want it because internally, the administration believes that the only way to de-escalate disorder are have a chance to do is an Israeli-Hamas deal.",

One, the Black vote was absolutely critical in states like Pennsylvania where the margins were so slim back in 2020, and two, that those voters aren't necessarily going to vote for him assuredly this time around. And that's why you hear them saying that they're not going to take any vote for granted, that they are going to come to states like this. And we are at a majority black prep school where the president spoke earlier. And his message I think broke down into two areas.
