Lawmakers in Seoul are debating whether to impeach Yoon Suk Yeol with a vote expected in the next few days.Now, members of his People Power Party say they will oppose the motion, although AFP is reporting that Yoon has been asked to actually leave his party. Lawmakers and protesters descended on Parliament late Tuesday after Yoon's declaration only to be met by hundreds of soldiers. The president rescinded his martial law decree a few hours later amid fierce opposition. South Korea's Defense Minister is the latest political casualty from this debacle. President Yoon accepted his resignation early Thursday. CNN's Anna Coren has been following the latest developments for us, and she joins us now from Hong Kong. I mean, Anna, look, the country, there's no question, is still reeling from all of these developments. Do we expect to hear from President Yoon today? I mean, we've not heard from him since all of this went down. And what are the expectations about his impeachment?",

But what we are learning from local media is that impeachment vote will take place Saturday 7 p.m. These are local media reports. And the reason they're delaying it by a day is to give the opposition Democratic Party, which holds majority in parliament, time to win over votes from the minority-ruling People's Power Party. The PPP have come out. They've rejected the impeachment bill against President Yoon.But, you know, President Yoon, he is refusing to resign, and his party cannot force him out. The opposition, Paula, they need to win over eight votes to get a two-thirds majority to pass that impeachment bill. It's a big call, but it's not out of the question, especially if the public protests, which we have seen, continue. And there are expectations that they are only going to ramp up as the weekend approaches. Now, before we recap on the political upheaval, which has been labeled by some as a coup attempt by the president, right now, as you mentioned, a plenary session is happening in parliament. We heard from the martial law commander, who said he did not give orders to enforce martial law. We also heard from the Vice Defense Minister, who said that he learned about martial law through media reports. As you mentioned, the defense minister, who resigned a few hours ago, it appears that he recommended martial law to President Yoon, who then made that declaration. But let's have a listen to an opposition lawmaker who spoke earlier today.

Lee is an Adjunct Fellow at the East-West Center and former Pyongyang Bureau Chief for the Associated Press. And she joins me now from Honolulu, Hawaii. I mean, look, still incredible events that we watch unfold hour by hour there in South Korea. The anatomy of this political crisis yet to be revealed to people, really. And that seems even to the majority of South Koreans that it is mystifying, not to mention the lawmakers themselves. What is your take, your sober second thought on what happened here and what led to it? JEAN H. LEE, ADJUNCT FELLOW, EAST-WEST CENTER: Yeah, I should point out that I was also the Bureau Chief in Seoul. So I spent many years in South Korea and spent, of course, all my life going back and forth. And I will say that I was woken up here in Honolulu at 4:00 in the morning with this news alert the other night. And when you see the words martial law, it just strikes fear. You think, has North Korea invaded? Is there a war? It's a reminder that this region is a tinderbox. When I did watch the events unfold, it was shocking. This is something that older South Koreans may remember. And it's a reminder that democracy is really only a generation old, that it's a young democracy. But I would say that the way that it wrapped up so quickly, six hours of martial law before it was turned over, also shows that it's a resilient democracy. Now, I think the South Koreans are tough. They're resilient. They are also people who want to hold their leaders accountable. So I know that they will take to the streets. We've seen it before. It is freezing cold in South Korea right now. But they have a history of standing up to authoritarianism. And I'm sure we will see that again.",
