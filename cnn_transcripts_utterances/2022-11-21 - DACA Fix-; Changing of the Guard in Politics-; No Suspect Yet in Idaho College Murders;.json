Makeshift memorials are growing today outside Club Q, where two people managed to overpower and disarm a gunman who opened fire on members of the LGBTQ+ community. This attack left at least five people dead and at least 25 injured. Among the victims, 28-year-old Daniel Aston. His parents tell \"The Denver Post\" that their son was bartending when he was killed. Police say the 22-year-old suspect is in the hospital, and they hope to learn more once he is released. This rampage lasted only minutes, but to those trapped inside, the horror felt like an eternity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So bear with me a little bit as I read these to you, because, according to these court documents, the suspect would be facing multiple murder and hate crime charges. Now, we understand that he's still hospitalized. This is according to the police chief, and that he hasn't been booked. So, it appears that he, at this point, is being held pending these charges. Let me keep reading, because this is important. According to these documents, he would be facing five counts of first- degree murder and five counts of bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury. Now, that's interesting, because Colorado enacted its bias- motivated crime law in 2021. And I want to read this to you because this is very telling. It explains in essence, why this is one of the charges. The bill says that -- quote -- \"A person commits a bias motivated crime if -- with the intent to intimidate or harass another person, in whole or in part, because of that person's actual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability or sexual orientation.\" Again, Ana, that's important, because we have been discussing the why. That is the question that everybody in this community has. And, of course, we knew from the district attorney that they were investigating through the lens of a hate crime. Well, now we know, according to these court documents, that this suspect, who is in the hospital, hasn't even been booked yet, is most likely being held on these five counts of first-degree murder, five counts of bias- motivated crime, causing bodily injury. Of course, we know that five individuals are dead, dozens are injured, and some of them are still in the hospital, some of them still fighting for their lives in the hospital. So, if any of those individuals were to parish, these charges, of course, could be upgraded and more charges could be added. To the latest regarding the information we know from the police chief here, according to the police chief, the suspect has not made any statements. His mom is not cooperating and that the suspect was carrying an AR-style rifle and a handgun. Again, a lot of developments here in Colorado, Ana, but the latest, that these court documents show that, most likely, this suspect is being held on five counts of first-degree murder and five counts of bias-motivated crime causing bodily injury -- Ana.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and it's so interesting that Rosa said the mother, according to police, is not cooperating.This is the incident from 2021, a Ring doorbell image of it. This suspect, the incident with his mother where he was in the home, she called police, and, according to the records, basically said he's threatening me with bombs and with ammunition and with weapons. They actually had to evacuate neighboring homes, because, for hours, they could not get him to come out or talk to them in a way that they could feel that people were safe. He finally did come out. Why this didn't trigger something, we don't really know, because, in 2019, that's when the legislature passed this law that would allow family members, a roommate or law enforcement to petition a judge to temporarily take someone's firearms if they are deemed a danger to themselves or others. Maybe one of the issues here is the response to that, which was that this law would allow a judge to simply take the weapons right away when there's a threat out there. Within 14 days, they have to hold a hearing with the person there who had the guns taken, where they can argue as to why they shouldn't have had them taken. But if the judge thinks, no, you're really a threat, we should have done this, they can allow them to be seized for as long as a year. The response to that around the state, though, 37 counties out of 64 then passed their own local rules saying, we're Second Amendment sanctuaries. You can't do this here. And in the most extreme cases, the sheriff said they would not enforce that law, even if they were told someone was a threat because they thought it was a Second Amendment infringement, Ana.",

Also in the first year, 85 percent of these orders were requested by law enforcement, in many cases, in the very counties where they said we don't want this law, we're against the law, we're standing up for it and putting it -- well, then law enforcement turned right around and said they wanted to have this kind of protection. And if you look at the extreme risk protection order, as of June 2022, now this is up until now -- that -- those two were in the first year -- or were in the first year -- sanctuary counties had received petition for protection orders; 20 of the 37 counties that said we're sanctuary cities, we don't -- or counties -- we don't believe in the state law, 20 of them had used this law to try to protect their citizens. So, Ana, why it did not kick in with this suspect, we do not know at this point. What we do know is that El Paso had taken -- that El Paso County had taken a stance that said, we're against this law, at least publicly. Yet we also know many counties around the state did that publicly, but, in a practical sense, said, yes, this is a tool to protect people, in many cases to protect law enforcement.",

Remember, there were two people who lived in the same house who survived. We also learned multiple people talk to the 911 dispatcher at that time.

Help us understand, what led to this 911 call? SALLY KRUTZIG, \"THE IDAHO STATESMAN\":  So, the 911 call, we recently learned, was made by a friend on the roommates -- one of the surviving roommates' cell phones. There are two surviving roommates who were at home at the time of the attack. At noon the next day, a phone call was made from one of those surviving roommates' cell phones.

When you're -- when you're killing four people with the knife, the level of passion, the personal engagement, watching someone die, the level of passion is extremely high. That's a personal murder.

Only 37 percent of Americans were enthusiastic or comfortable; 62 percent had reservations or a very uncomfortable. Note, of course, though, that Joe Biden went on to win not only the Democratic nomination, but became president himself. So I think they may think, theoretically, we don't necessarily like someone over the age of 75. But, in reality, when it comes down to the candidates and they are actually faced with those choices, they are willing to go with someone over the age of 75. And here's the other thing I will just note, right? Look at the voters. They're getting older too. The percentage of voters over the age of 70, it was just 9 percent in 1980. Look at that.
