I want to show you live pictures from Hanoi, Vietnam right now were Air Force One carrying U.S. President Joe Biden has just landed moments ago.President's arrival in Hanoi marks a major turning point in diplomatic relations between the two former adversaries. We're going to have much more ahead on the significance of this visit and how it came about. But first, we just want to see if we can catch the president as he actually de-planes Air Force One here. All right, he's in Asia, of course, in Vietnam specifically to promote his relations and diplomatic relations in those countries in the context of the tensions with China. He's going to go to a welcome ceremony and make some remarks later on. We're going to be following this in Vietnam with a live reporter coming up later. All right, now to Morocco, where a nation is in shock and grief after being ravaged by its deadliest earthquake in decades. More than 2,000 people have died since the disaster struck Friday night and many of the victims are already being laid to rest. There are also fears that the death toll will continue to rise as emergency crews dig through the rubble of collapsed buildings. But many are still holding out hope that they'll find people alive under all that debris. Those who survived are now coping with trauma. Many are sleeping outdoors after losing their houses, others who still have a place to live or hasn't to return to their homes worried that they could also collapse. Morocco's king is instructed officials to set up an interministerial commission to provide much needed relief for the victims. CNN's Sam Kiley has more from the city of Marrakesh, a world heritage site where historic buildings have been badly damaged. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And this very often is what they're greeted by, a building that has collapsed into the street.So far more than 2,000 Moroccans have been killed in this earthquake and the figures could rise very rapidly. Here in Marrakesh the numbers about 13, possibly more. And there are about 1,500 or so people who have been very seriously injured. But the government is saying that the problems are really focused to the southeast of Marrakesh, up in the Atlas Mountains where there are many, many villages, perhaps dozens, perhaps even more that have been completely flattened, flattened down into rubble just like this. But in those cases they're very, very, very difficult to get to. Many of the roads have been destroyed by landfalls. It is the military really, the only route to safety for these people who are stuck there. Many, many thousands of people have been spending their second night out in the open if they survived at all. All they are desperately needing, all kinds of humanitarian help and particularly help from the military who are able to reach them in some cases by air. But already there have been some dramatic rescues with people being pulled out of the rubble after at least 12 hours pressed down with mud and concrete weighing heavily on top of them. And of course they have also already begun the funerals in many other villages, Berber villages predominantly in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains. Very significant numbers of people are already being buried. And at the moment the government is saying they are mobilizing all of the possible national resources to this and they have called for a three- day period of national mourning.

He is just disembarked from Air Force One and has got into a car and he's heading to the presidential palace where he will meet with General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong in the coming hour.They will hold a bilateral meeting and then the president will address the press a little bit later this evening. But Kim, this is a very significant trip. You know, some analysts are saying that this is the most important trip by a U.S. president since Bill Clinton came here in 2000 to re-establish diplomatic ties with Vietnam. We are getting an upgrade from both sides, from the Vietnamese and also from the Americans. The Vietnamese will be upgrading their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership. While the Americans have said, just on Air Force One, that they will be upgrading their relationship with Vietnam to a top level and that will have a security component embedded in it. But look, let's walk through what this really means. It's symbolic but also highly substantive. For the Americans, it's about countering China's influence and assertiveness in the region. They are trying to shore up friends and allies in the Indo-Pacific region. They also want to diversify their supply chains away from China. And Vietnam is a key component in all of that. For the Vietnamese, this is about economic development as well as security. You know, this is a country of 100 million people over the last 20 years since relations have been normalized, 20-plus years. We have seen incredible growth. 20 years ago, Vietnam was making, you know, T-shirts and running shoes. Now they've invested in the semiconductor industry. And this is something that the Vietnamese will be speaking to the Americans about. You can certainly expect some lucrative business deals happening in the coming day. There is a large contingent of American businessmen traveling with President Biden. But the biggest concern you would have to say for the Vietnamese is their maritime security. The South China Sea is a place that, you know, China is encroaching on. They've claimed the Spratly, the Paracel Islands. Vietnam says that is part of their territory. So the Vietnamese are looking also for security agreements. And that is something we are expecting to hear, Kim.",

So there is a very deep history there. And we know that Vietnam has certainly got its weapons from Russia.

That is something that they are working to do. Whether there is an arms deal that will be announced on this visit, that is yet to be known.

They share an 800-mile-long land border. And obviously China is going to be watching Biden's visit very, very closely. Hanoi is not in a position to upset Beijing. It cannot afford to upset its largest trading partner. So it knows that it is walking a very delicate tightrope. But obviously the Americans are coming to Vietnam. Relations are being upgraded from the Vietnamese side as well as the American side. And this is not just symbolic, it is highly substantive economically but is also when it comes to security.

The Russian Defense Ministry says eight drones were shot down near the peninsula this morning, but further north the tables were turned. Have a look at this. That's one of the drones Ukraine says it shot down over Kyiv. Military officials say more than two dozen drones were knocked out of the sky. Most of them targeting the capital. Debris ended up crashing all over Kyiv and causing damage on the ground. So for more on this, Fred Pleitgen joins us from London. So Fred, I mean, the battle of the drones here, what's the latest on all these attacks?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, the battle of the drones, and it's certainly something that has been escalating, especially if you look at the Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian territory, that's pretty much become a common place for people in Russian cities.And it's not only Russian cities now that are close to the Ukrainian border, but in many cases, of course, we've also seen them fly to places like Moscow, but also even to the border between Lithuania, between Latvia, and Russia as well. So certainly from the Ukrainian side, there has been an escalation that has happened in that. They've certainly had their drone capabilities upgraded considerably over the past couple of months and certainly a year and a half since this war has been going on. And I know that it is a priority for the Ukrainian government to upgrade their drone capabilities to not only help their troops on the battlefield, but to be able to strike in Russia as well. And then we did just see those dramatic pictures over Kyiv tonight. And that's also something that still remains commonplace. And one of the things that we see especially around the Ukrainian capital is that it gets targeted by an array of ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and also those drones as well. And this past night happened to be one with a wave of drone attacks. It was quite interesting because we were looking at some of the details that we were getting from the Ukrainian government, from Ukrainian authorities, and they said around the Kyiv areas, that it was really not one large drone attack, but waves of drone attacks with these drones coming from different directions. Kyiv has an elaborate air defense system. Still, these drones, while they move very slowly, the fact that they come in swarms does make it difficult. And also the other things for the Ukrainians as well, when they take down these drones, they fire at them mostly using cannons, using rifles or cannons. They don't usually use missiles to take them down, which might be one of the reasons why some of those drones did make it through. Again though, for the Ukrainian capital, for many people, they're obviously a sleepless night, but once again, that elaborate air defense system in Kyiv seems to have worked despite the fact that we did see that through fire debris coming down over the Ukrainian capital, Kim.",

You're looking at live pictures where U.S. President Joe Biden has arrived at the presidential palace and he will be greeted by Vietnam's leader, General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong.Now, this visit has been in the works for a while now and it marks a major shift in how these two governments will conduct their relations going forward. You'll see if we can see the president getting out of the car. I can't quite see him there but -- oh, there we go. We see the President and there's the band as they strike up. He's shaking hands with Vietnamese dignitaries. He, of course, just finished the G20 summit in New Delhi and now he'll be spending some time in Vietnam where he's hoping to increase the American diplomatic presence as he is trying to counter the effects of the influence of China. So we're going to have much more on the significance of this visit in the coming hours here. Please do stay with CNN.

Hundreds of millions of dollars, epidemiologists, biomechanical engineers, researching, developing technology and new equipment, testing shoulder pads, cleats, new helmets.Helmets are evolving at nine times the rate they used to, and the helmet that I wore in my playing days, Kim, is now banned. So it is what the NFL is doing to make the game safer is vital because it will have a trickle-down effect on the high school and youth levels, hopefully making the game safer for everyone. I can't wait for people to check out all that's going on behind the scenes.",
