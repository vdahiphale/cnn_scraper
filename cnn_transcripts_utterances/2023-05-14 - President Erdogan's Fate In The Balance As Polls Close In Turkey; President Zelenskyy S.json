And all of you out there, be sure to tune in to an all-new episode of the CNN Original Series, \"THE 2010s.\" That airs tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, only on CNN. Hello, and Happy Mother's Day to all of the moms out there. Thank you so much for joining us today. I'm Alex Marquardt in today for Fredricka Whitfield. We do begin this hour with the fate of Turkey's longtime president hanging in the balance. The polls have closed in the very high stakes president election. The votes are now being counted by the millions in this pivotal race that could create global shockwaves. The incumbent president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is facing the greatest challenge yet to his 20-year rule. And at the moment, with 60 million plus votes still being counted, analysts are saying that the election is still too early to call and they're predicting what could be a very close race right to the end. Both Erdogan and the main opposition candidate, they both claim to be leading. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul for us. Jomana, what's the latest this evening? JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alex, as you mentioned right now, it is too close to call. Votes, ballots are still being counted, and you've got both sides giving their own set of data. You've got the Turkish state news agency that is putting President Erdogan in the lead and you've also got the opposition saying that they are the ones in the lead and that the state news agency should not be trusted. Both sides are calling on their supporters, on election monitors from their party, from their side, to stay by the ballot boxes until the last moment, until this is finalized. They expect a long night here. This was always expected to be a very tight race in this divided and polarized country. We are outside the headquarters of President Erdogan's AK Party, and hundreds of his supporters have converged on this building. Tonight they say they are here to show their support for the Turkish president. People out here say that there is only one man they can see leading Turkey and that is Recep Tayyip Erdogan. They list his achievements for them over the past two decades of leading their country and they fear what may happen to them. A lot of the women here say they fear what might happen to them because they say that he has allowed them to express their religious beliefs freely, to wear their head scarves, and they just fear that they might use those freedoms that they had gotten under President Erdogan, despite the fact that the opposition says that no one is under threat, that everyone will be included in this new Turkey, this change that they are promising to bring to Turkey. This is a very divided country. You've got President Erdogan who has been promising people to continue on this same path that he has put his country on, which many here would tell you is this great Turkey, making it a great global power. You've got the opposition that is promising to reverse years of one-man rule that they blame for the state of affairs in this country whether it is the economy or freedom or the threat to democracy. They say this is a very, very tight race and for everyone in this country, for them, the future of this nation right now hangs in the balance -- Alex.",

The sanctions would be better enforced. Ukrainian grain would be able to leave port more easily. All the things that Erdogan has been playing a little bit -- you know, he's been playing both sides would be less true.Remember, there's the other huge issue on which Erdogan has played extraordinary politics, which is the refugees. Erdogan has kept threatening Europe with sending a stream of refugees from the Middle East essentially mostly fleeing the Syrian civil war. And in return for that, it's essentially blackmail. In return for him not doing that, the Europeans keep sending him money. So there are so many areas where Erdogan has put his personal stamp on policies that are quite unusual, and a departure for Turkey. The Ukraine war, you're absolutely right, is the most urgent and most critical one where an Erdogan loss could mean a big shift in policy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The tenuous truce coming after five days of heavy and deadly rocket fire from both sides.CNN senior correspondent Ben Wedeman has seen that fighting up close and has the latest from Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): The cease-fire in Gaza appears to be holding. We're in a building in the northern end of the Gaza Strip that was struck by an Israeli airstrike at 5:00 p.m. Saturday, just five hours before that cease-fire was supposed to go into effect. Now this building was four stories high, 40 to 45 people were living inside, including several handicapped individuals. Now what happened was typical of how these things play out. Somebody in the building received a phone call from the Israeli military saying get out immediately, we're going to bomb this building. The problem was with the handicapped people, it was very difficult to get them out very quickly. Some of them can barely walk. So it took some time but as you can see, buildings utterly destroyed, their money, all of their possessions is here under the rubble. Now their immediate concern is how are they going to live without a place to stay? And what they told us is they're just sleeping outside in the open essentially. Fortunately it's not raining these days but sleeping outside. They're wondering how they're going to get by given the difficult economic situation here in Gaza. There isn't a lot of money. The government, led by Hamas, doesn't have the resources to really take care of these people, let alone rebuild this structure. And of course when we speak to people, we really get a sense of exhaustion. This is the third time in the last three years there's been major hostilities between Israel and Islamic militants in Gaza. And the expected is that yes, there is a cease-fire now but how long is it going to last? It could be just a few months, maybe just a year before it all happens again. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from the northern Gaza Strip. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

CNN's Polo Sandoval is at the border in El Paso, Texas, where he has been following the difficult journey that many migrants have had to make just to get there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Step inside this shelter in the heart of El Paso, Texas, and you'll find people waiting in limbo. They're migrant families. Some single mothers who told us they were recently processed and released by border authorities. While some children visibly exhausted nap inside, others play in the courtyard. Their young minds spared the anguish of moms and dads trying to figure out when or even if they can continue the rest of the journey in what can easily become a hopeless space. It seems the migrant mothers keep hope alive here. Conny Barahona keeps it together for Daniella, her 9-year-old. She says two of her older daughters ages 18 and 20 remain in federal detention. It will be a sad Mother's Day, she tells me. My daughters won't be by my side. In the last three days Barahona turned down coveted opportunities to travel to Houston, refusing to go anywhere without all her daughters. We left Honduras together and that's how we must remain until God allows, the single mother says. She forged a friendship with fellow migrant mom, Yesika Gonzalez (PH), who've left South America three months ago with her partner and their son Jason. We found another motherly bond in this corner of the shelter where (INAUDIBLE) Falcon receives help when caring for baby Yeremy just 2 weeks old. This mom tells me she carried him from Venezuela to Texas where she went into labor immediately after stepping on to U.S. soil. All of the migrant mothers we spoke to say maternal instinct to provide for their children is what drove them to make the perilous journey in the first place. A parent will do anything to see their children safe, says Barahona. A hug from Daniella seems to help ease any of mom's sorrows. We asked her what she wants to be when she grows up. A seamstress like mom. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You wrote an op-ed on cnn.com, that was on Friday, about what you say is really causing the crisis at the border, and I want to read a bit of what you wrote, which is, though our political conversation around immigration often focuses on how to stop the root causes of migration or the economic strain of newcomers, it rarely questions what could be done to ensure that these newcomers could settle and contribute as quickly and as painlessly as possible. Now, of course there are many groups, particularly in the cities where these migrants end up coming off of busses who do what they can to help migrants get what they need in the immediate term and to settle, but why do you believe that that isn't more of a priority?",

There are routes that exist but they're getting smaller and smaller and smaller, and you feel the doors closing more and more and more, and the walls are going up. Whether those are physical walls or those are sort of the metaphorical walls, but still quite present barriers of making these processes last longer and longer, sort of keeping people detained for months and sometimes years on end, which completely affects their lives, completely throws them off of having a normal life and separates families at the end of the day.",

And so there was legislation that was passed for what's known as safe injection sites statewide, that were going to be state-funded. But the governor, Governor Newsom, decided to veto that, worrying that this would be unlimited and they would be in a lot of different places, which would upset some of the residents.San Francisco then took matters into its own hand and the Board of Supervisors there approved these safe injection sites. They are set so that people can go in, do drugs, and not overdose. So, they are trying to bring down that high number of overdose. And you said, it was about 40 to 41 percent more people overdosing than in times past. And so they are looking at it saying, okay, what do we do to try to deal with this problem, but the difference is in San Francisco is that it would have to be privately funded, not publicly funded, so NGOs would fund it. They are looking for solutions. No matter what anybody says about the city and the government, and they can blame a lot of different things for what has happened there, including COVID and the high cost of living, the city is trying to do something about it. They truly are. And we were with some members of the city as they were trying to deal with both the homelessness problem and the drug problem and watched some of the things that they are doing now. But it's extremely expensive in a city that is extremely expensive, one of the top ten most expensive cities in the world.",

That's something that's one of the most visible things, when you visit San Francisco. You, for this special, spoke with both residents, residents who were both housed and unhoused. So, to what extent did you find that the homelessness problem has worsened in recent years?",

That was so far, I think, the numbers show from the city and county statistics in 2019, actually. But it is the highest number in 2022, the highest number that people have counted the number of homeless at more than 7,000. It is the highest in 17 years. So, there's definitely an increase, and that something the city is looking at, how do you deal with it.I just want to give you a crazy statistic. According to federal data, the housing in San Francisco is 113 percent more than the national average. That's where we are at, Alex.",

Those are the words of Denny Kellington, the Buffalo Bills' assistant athletic trainer who helped save the life of the Bills' Safety Damar Hamlin, earlier this year. You'll remember, 25-year-old Damar Hamlin's heart stopped after he took a shot to the head and chest while making a tackle during a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. That was back in January.Kellington is credited with restoring Hamlin's heartbeat by performing CPR. But in his commencement speech yesterday to his own alma mater, Oklahoma State, he said it wasn't anything special and that a good education should prepare you for any crisis you may face.
