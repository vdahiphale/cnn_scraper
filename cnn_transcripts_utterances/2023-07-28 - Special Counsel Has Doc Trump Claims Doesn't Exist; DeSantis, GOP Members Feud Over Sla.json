Also, more than a dozen Republican presidential hopefuls are in one room, in Iowa, right now. One was just booed on stage, for explicitly criticizing Trump.

So far tonight, only one other candidate, at that dinner has been willing to go on stage, and explicitly criticize the former President.

That one tied to his handling of classified documents. Two of those charges stem from allegations that he tried to destroy surveillance footage, at Mar-a-Lago.

That indicates that the Justice Department would plan to actually present that document, in evidence, at the case, if this were actually to end up going to trial. And I think there's a couple of reasons that maybe there was the delay, from including in the first one, to this one. One might be that in the intervening month or so that they were able to get witnesses, who actually testified further to the grand jury, indicating \"Yes,\" and testifying under oath, \"Yes, he actually did show us the document, and this is what it was.\" The other possibility is that the Intelligence Community finally agreed to be able to let the Justice Department have the authorization to use it.",

So, this Iran war document is something that he returned, to the Department of Justice.

And that he had suffered cardiac arrest, on the basketball court, what went through your mind?O'NEAL: It kind of brought me back to what I went through, when I was 18-years-old, my first year college basketball. And I was at the rival school, UCLA. We didn't have too much, the similar situations. But it both had to do with the heart. And it just kind of brought me back to those days. Those were pretty sad days for me. And I just wanted to kind of -- I spent so long, not thinking about it. And when something like that happens, it kind of just brings me back. So, when I heard, I was devastated. I was just hoping everything was OK. But I got word pretty quickly that he was -- that he was getting taken care of.",

Obviously, you both have dads, who are superstars. You're both each talented, really talented yourself.I mean, what would -- what's something that you wish you knew, when you were going through that, that he should know now? O'NEAL: That, it's, the doctors are professionals. Kind of how NBA players are professionals, the doctors are kind of like the NBA players of the medical side. So, what I wish I would have known is, trusting them more, because I was so scared the whole time. Everything they're telling me, I just kind of went in one ear, went out the other, because I was just so scared, for my life. But, I wish I would have had a better sense of listening, trusting them to kind of protect my own spirit and my own emotion.",

I mean, it's a terrifying experience.And I know, you said while you were lying in bed, after you had open- heart surgery, to fix an artery that was essentially growing in the wrong place, you're watching a game, with your dad. And you said, he turned to you, and he gave you the best advice that he's ever given you? What was that advice? O'NEAL: I mean, he told me two things. They're both pretty simple. But it just means a lot to me coming from him. The first one is, he knew that people were saying negative stuff about it, like I'll never be able to do this, never be able to do that. And he just simply told me, \"Don't let anybody tell you that you can't do anything. Whatever you believe in, you can achieve this.\" So that stuck with me. And then, we were watching a UCLA game, I was supposed to be playing that season. And then, he just looked at me and said, \"If you make it out of this, and you return back on the court, you'll be the baddest man on the planet.\" So, that stuck with me, and that still sticks with me. Every time I go play, every time I wake up, I always think of that quote, he told me.",

What can you tell us about the work that you've done with them and what that's been like, learning from that experience that you had?O'NEAL: I didn't really know a lot about the heart, until I had to go through this. And American Heart Association has been doing a great job, of allowing me to connect with them, learn more about it, and spread heart awareness, because this is a problem. There's been a few incidents in these, I want to say, the past year or two, with two basketball, and one football. It's a big problem in sports. And a lot of programs don't -- I feel like they don't check their athletes' hearts. And luckily, the situations that happened, everybody's fine from it, the three that I'm thinking of right now. But I think it's really important that people know about this, get their hearts checked. And especially, in African American men, that are athletes, it happens a lot. And I wanted to start spreading awareness about it, so we can prevent this problem from happening, and kind of find out what's going on.",
