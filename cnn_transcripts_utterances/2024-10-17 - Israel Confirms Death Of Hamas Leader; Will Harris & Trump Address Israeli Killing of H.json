      "sentences": "Well, we know that President Biden is expected to land here in Berlin in just a few hours. Reporters will have an opportunity to shout questions at him on the tarmac, unclear whether he will take them.We had expected to hear from National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan during a gaggle aboard Air Force One with Press Secretary Karine Jean- Pierre. That, so far, has not happened yet. Which is somewhat unusual considering that when these gaggles happen aboard the president's plan, they often happen at the outset of the flights that reporters then have the duration of the travel to work on their stories. But given the fact that this is a live and evolving situation that has evolved just as the president has been on board, it's understandable that -- that perhaps the administration wants to wait until it has all of the information possible that it can share before speaking directly to reporters. President Biden is with Secretary of State Tony Blinken and NSA Jake Sullivan onboard Air Force One. And here in Germany, when he touches down, tomorrow, he'll be having an expanded bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the president of Germany, as well as a summit with the closest European allies for the U.S. That's the U.K., France and Germany. During a meeting that was expected to focus on the Middle East and the desire among all of those nations for not only a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. I'm told by officials that now the news of Sinwar's death will overtake any prior agenda points that had been planned by officials. But these have been leaders that have for weeks been trying to urge Israel toward a cessation of hostilities. You may remember that at the United Nations in New York, just about three weeks ago, they we're working around the clock to try to get Israel to agree to a short-term ceasefire deal in Lebanon. And of course, that fell apart. Israel did not go forward with that deal. And the desire and the drumbeat of messaging among these allies has only gotten stronger in recent weeks, at least as far as European allies. The U.S. has been willing to allow Israel to proceed on the northern border of Israel, the southern part of Lebanon, with its campaign there, but has expressed some frustration about the bombing campaign in Beirut. And so we've seen that come to a pause. But now the question of what happens with Hamas, whether Israel sees its leadership as further decentralized and a greater opportunity to continue decimating that group, or whether Israel sees that as a new opening for a diplomatic off-ramp. That remains to be seen. And officials telling CNN that they, too, don't yet know how this situation will play out -- Boris, Brianna?",

I want to ask both of you about Harris on FOX, Trump on Univision. But first, obviously, with the news overseas, the way that these candidates talk about the Middle East is significant for specific constituencies. I'm thinking for Kamala Harris about Arab-American communities in Michigan, Chuck. How do you think the way that she discusses this and how Israel might move forward, perhaps getting closer to a peace deal, could impact the campaign.",

      "sentences": "I mean, there are so many facets of that -- that terrific question, Boris. And it reminds me of something that Netanyahu said last week when he basically called on the Lebanese people to cast off Hezbollah. And here he's asking the Palestinians of Gaza to cast out Hamas.There are a lot of Palestinians in Gaza who don't want to see Hamas in charge, who don't want to see Hamas running the Gaza Strip because of everything that they have been suffering through for the past year. But when you hear Netanyahu calling on them to do that, they don't want to team up with Netanyahu on that because Netanyahu has been the one that they believe has brought so much suffering there. So that is likely not to go down very well. It's not like the Palestinians in Gaza are going to heed this call from Prime Minister Netanyahu. But this -- there's no doubt that there's this power vacuum here. And they have always had this difficult balance of power between those who are outside, those who were inside. Those who are outside weren't aware of the October 7th attacks as they were -- as they were unfolding, or as they were about to unfold. And so major questions about whether the ultimate head of Hamas is going to remain in Gaza as it did with Yahya Sinwar. Or whether someone from the political echelon outside of Gaza will take over, in which case, they might be more in favor of coming to some kind of ceasefire agreement. But what I took away from that Netanyahu speech is that the fight, in his eyes, is not yet over.",

He did say the task is not complete.CMDR. KIRK LIPPOLD, U.S. NAVY, RETIRED: I think what where you have to look at is, from the U.S. perspective, we have always wanted to try and pressure Netanyahu to get to a point where we can stop the war, where we can get to a cease-fire agreement, where we can have the hostages released and begin to negotiate what is the new Gaza, a new version of Gaza going to look like? And how are they going to be able to sustain and, hopefully, even live in peace. That has not been the view. When you look at how Prime Minister Netanyahu has acted ever since October 7th and the war broke out, he has operated with a strategic vision and a moral clarity that has been somewhat frustrating for both the U.S., the E.U. and others. Because he has been single-minded, having lived with these threats for decades. I think Israel has finally reached a point where they've said enough and they're going to now begin to pursue these terrorists. They've clearly expanded at beyond and outside of Israel, taking out terrorists in Lebanon, in Iran itself. And that he is going to continue to pursue that fight until they're the ones that let's say they want peace, not have peace imposed on Israel.",
