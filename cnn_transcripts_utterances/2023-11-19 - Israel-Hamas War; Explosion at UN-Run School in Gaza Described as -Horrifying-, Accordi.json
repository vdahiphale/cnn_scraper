Wounded children can be seen lying on cardboard on the floors, but there's very little anyone can do for them. President Biden is standing by his decision not to call for a ceasefire. This time, writing an op ed in the \"Washington Post,\" the president said, \"As long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a ceasefire isn't peace to Hamas' members, every ceasefire is time they exploit to rebuild their stockpile of rockets, reposition fighters, and restart the killing by attacking innocents again.\" Meanwhile, the World Health Organization sent a team to Gaza's largest hospital on Saturday to get a firsthand look inside. CNN's Paula Hancocks was our Jerusalem correspondent for many years, and she joins us now from Seoul. So, Paula, the W.H.O reporting horrific conditions at Al-Shifa Hospital.

And when they spoke to them, they said they were, \"Terrified for their safety and health.\" And they were pleading for evacuation. The W.H.O. says that they're urgently developing plans to try and evacuate the final doctors, nurses and patients who are unable to evacuate on their own. Now, they say at this point there are 32 babies in extremely critical condition still inside Shifa Hospital. Also, two people in intensive care without ventilation and 22 dialysis patients whose access to lifesaving treatment has been severely compromised.

Al-Shifa Hospital previously was the largest and most important referral hospital in Gaza with, normally, was able to accommodate 750 patients. It was, what we would, call the tertiary referral hospital. It had all the main specialties and it's a very well-respected hospital across the region.Because of the extra burden of the conflict, it was actually accommodating close to the 1,300, 1,400 patients at the peak of the current crisis. But essentially over the last few weeks, the supply lines have been choked off, minimal medicines getting in, limited access to fuel, clean water and so on. So, the functioning of the hospital has rapidly declined. Many patients have sought care elsewhere. We've had minimal communications with the hospital over the few days preceding the mission. And when the team arrived, essentially our worst fears were confirmed. Many patients and -- many of the internally displaced persons who've been seeking refuge in the hospital over recent weeks had left the hospital in the morning yesterday. And they tell us under instructions from the IDF. So, when -- by the time our team arrived as your reporter had indicated, around 291 patients were at a 25 staff.

It's happening more and more. For example, our team was in Nasr Hospital, one of the two hospitals I mentioned earlier, just a few days ago. They described a scene as a completely overwhelmed hospital. All the corridors with mattresses on the floor with patients on the floor being treated. And while they were there, the hospital received 30 new patients following an airstrike with very complex injuries.So, it's -- in that overwhelmed situation, if you're a doctor in the emergency department or a nurse in the emergency department, you've got 30 new patients coming in with life-threatening injuries, there is nothing more difficult in medicine than that kind of setting. And the other issue that you have to remember is, in these instances, many times the doctors and nurses, they're wondering if could the next patient be a loved one? Could the next patient be a family member, a friend? Incredibly stressful. Incredibly stressful. But I guess the positive note is that our team observed that the doctors and nurses there would do it. Were very well organized, providing very good quality of care. They said it was beyond heroic, almost saintly, the way that they were operating in this stressful situation.",

You know, we've got 1.6 million people displaced, and a large proportion of them now are housed in schools, incredible overcrowding. You know, these schools have been designed to accept displaced persons, but where, you know, four to six over the level that have been planned for.And there again, lack of clean water, overcrowding, poor sanitation, toilets overflowing. We are increasingly hearing about people having to defecate in the open, and that, of course, brings with it the risk of the spread of disease. So, we are tracking disease trends. We're seeing increased rates of chest infections, respiratory infections, diarrhea, scabies, now jaundice gives us a concern of hepatitis. So, disease outbreaks are a huge, huge risk. It's very, very difficult to put in effective disease control measures in that context, but that's a big priority for us right now as well, of course. BRUNHUBER:  Now, there may be help on the way. Israel says, it will allow a certain amount of fuel into Gaza. I think it's two tankers a day.

And even though he's polling ahead of his Republican contenders in the state, he warned voters not to get complacent and to ensure that they come out for him in a big way when the Iowa caucuses roll around. He also used some of the most explicit language yet that we've heard when talking about his need to win this state in order to knock his primary contenders out of the race. Now, Donald Trump also spent much of the speech on Saturday attacking Joe Biden, and specifically his record on foreign policy, as well as, his approach to China. China and potentially undermining U.S. agriculture is something that is very important to Iowa voters. He also, at one point, Donald Trump, attacked Joe Biden's mental fitness and called him a \"Stupid person\" and suggested he may be on medication. Let's take a listen.DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Our leader is a stupid person. Our leader can't get off this stage. You see this stage?

Remember, last week in New Hampshire, Donald Trump received a wave of black -- of backlash for calling the political left being like vermin, and saying he wanted to root them out.Now, one more just really interesting thing I want to put your attention to, is what Donald Trump did after his remarks. He got off the stage and went into the crowd. He signed hats and shook their hands. And that is very rare for the former president. He, typically, will immediately exit the stage and start getting into his motorcade after he wraps up these speeches. And so, a big moment for those in the room, and I think it really underscores the aggressive attitude that Donald Trump and his campaign are taking to Iowa in this final stretch.
