People say is the Bakhmut's success is part of that? At the moment they're saying no, look, we're going to evaluate each step as we go.But they are concerned also about getting this extra push -- the counteroffensive just right, and they'll be concerned about it in Bakhmut today. This is what one officer who is involved in that fight told us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) OLEKSANDR, UKRAINIAN ARMED FORCES OFFICER (through translator):  It is hard to say whether five, 10, or 50 kilometers will be liberated. This is why I understand that on one hand, the international community is watching us and trying to help us, but we have to understand that this is not a game. This is war and you have to understand that first of all, there are human casualties. For us, the victory is when a soldier returns from the battle and not when he dies. There's a proverb that you should not for Ukraine but you should fight for Ukraine. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Pakistan's government -- federal government, as well as various provincial governments, have asked the military to come in to provide extra security to military and institutional installments across the country. So in Islamabad, which is the capital, there is a sense of calm. Those protests have calmed down. Pakistan's military put out a very strongly-worded statement last night that there will be zero tolerance for any sort of violence by Khan's supporters. They also accused Khan's supporters of trying to incite a civil war. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also addressed the Pakistani people yesterday and in that address he said -- he called Imran Khan's supporters terrorists. Imran Khan is an incredibly popular politician in this country. But there have been various other arrests overnight of senior party leaders of Imran Khan's party, the PTI. So at the moment, it appears to be that a lot of the senior party leadership has been decapitated by these arrests. We're just going to have to wait to see how this plays out -- Christine.",

Moody's Analytics says Michigan's unemployment rate would spike to 10.8 percent if there's a prolonged debt limit breach. Today, it's just 4.1 percent. The U.S. could run out of cash to pay its bills by June first. Looking at markets around the world, Asian markets finished mixed. Consumer prices in China slowed at the slowest rate in two years. European markets are higher. Investors waiting for an interest rate decision by the Bank of England. On Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour are leaning a little bit higher here. The Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 rose yesterday. Inflation cooling to the slowest pace in two years. On inflation watch, gas prices rose a penny overnight to $3.54 a gallon.

Rana, so nice to see you this morning. You heard that Romans' Numeral of 10.8 percent unemployment in Michigan. You can repeat that in a lot of different states if there were to be a prolonged debt limit breach. We know how dangerous it is. What is the risk here to the U.S. economy and the global economy that they don't get this right in Washington? RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST, COLUMNIST AND ASSOCIATE EDITOR, FINANCIAL TIMES (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, I think that as Sec. Yellen said, it's a catastrophe. Christine, I feel like you and I have been here every few years for the last decade or so walking right up to the edge. This time around it really does feel more urgent. I mean, Sec. Yellen and other administration officials are actually reaching out to Republicans in the business community -- to more moderate Republicans -- saying you've got to help us. You've got to put pressure on the party. We really cannot get up to the limit. And to me, what's really different this time is that the last two or three years we've seen an erosion of faith not only in the U.S. government but in the dollar. I mean, the dollar was weaponized in the work against Ukraine, which I think was totally appropriate. But as we know, that created a sense amongst many nations do we want to hold the dollar? Do we want to hold dollar-based assets? So there is already a little bit of a tailwind towards saying we might want to move away from the U.S. dollar-based financial system.
