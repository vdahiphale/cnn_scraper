Ahead right here on \"CNN Newsroom,\" U.S. President Joe Biden heads to Poland to marks the one-year anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine. What his visit signals to Russia and China.And in this hour, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to meet with Turkey's officials as the country recovers from that devastating earthquake. Plus, North Korea carries out another missile test, this time launching two ballistic missiles into the sea. We are live in Seoul. And we are nearing the one-year mark in Russia's invasion of Ukraine and U.S. President Joe Biden plans to mark that grim anniversary in Poland. Now, Mr. Biden is set to travel to the Polish capital in the day ahead where he will meet with his Polish counterpart and speak Tuesday at the Royal Castle of Warsaw. The president is expected to express continued U.S. support for Ukraine as fierce fighting continues to rage on the front lines. And of course, right now, there seems to be no end in sight. The president's visit comes on the heels of the Munich Security Conference where Vice President Kamala Harris said the U.S. has determined that Russia has, in fact, committed war crimes against humanity in Ukraine. The Polish prime minister explained what he is expecting from Mr. Biden's visit. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Paula, they may be responding very soon given the foreign ministries daily press briefing is ongoing right now. But they have offered some clue in the readout on that Blinken-Wang Yi meeting in Munich over the weekend, basically saying they do not accept the U.S., quote/unquote \"finger-pointing and coercion\" on the (inaudible) issue because their relations with Russia are bilateral sovereign matters.Now, this kind of language may not be strange, but the timing of this revelation from the U.S., of course, is very interesting because Wang Yi it's actually going to Moscow after Munich to meet with senior Russian officials and likely Putin himself on the eve of the anniversary of the war. And according to Russian media, paving the way for Xi Jinping to go to Moscow later this year. So, that's why it's clear the U.S. is increasingly frustrated with China's role in this conflict and they're trying to turn up the heat on Beijing because despite Beijing's public pledge of quote/unquote \"neutrality,\" what's been happening in the past year of course is China and Russia are growing closer, both politically, but especially economically with bilateral trade, for example soaring to a new height. And that's part of the reason why Blinken mentioned from day one that U.S. had been concerned about China helping Russia dodge severe western sanctions. And now, of course, this new assessment which also comes on the heels of that spy balloon saga and that fallout, obviously, is going to make things even more difficult for China to be willing to work with the U.S. on the Ukraine issue. But interestingly, Wang Yi also met with his Ukrainian counterpart in Munich and at least publicly saying China still respects Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. But the reality of course is Chinese state media still refuses to call this Russian military campaign an invasion, not to mention Xi and Putin have talked on the phone and in-person multiple times in the past two years, whereas Xi has yet to talk to Zelenskyy even once. So, all of that is (inaudible) despite all the public posturing, it's clear Beijing is sticking to Russia despite the growing isolation of Moscow on the global stage. And that's why all the assertions that Beijing made about them being the only peacemaker, just rings very hollow to many people. Paula?",

You can enter hospice for any other number of reasons, cancer, dementia, heart failure, or many, many other diagnoses. And what it means when you enter a hospice is that you're going to be focusing on managing your symptoms, pain, shortness of breath, other physical symptoms, but also focusing on managing your emotional and spiritual needs.What folks find when they enter hospice is that they do have a health care provider who is dedicated to managing medications. They also might have access to physical therapy, or occupational therapy, to home health aides, people who are dedicated to making sure that they get to spend the last weeks, or months of their life the way that they want. One additional detail about hospice that most people don't know, is that it's not necessarily permanent. If you decide that you do want to go back and try to get curative treatment, if they are no treatments available, or something changes in your personal or family situation, you are not stuck with it forever. But for those who do enter hospice, they find that it makes those final weeks or months so much more pleasant. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The woman seen running into this New Jersey service station in early February is escaping her suspected captor who is close behind, a man later identified as James Parrillo, Jr. The year-long ordeal started in New Mexico where the couple first met last February. The woman says she agreed to give Parrillo a ride to Arizona. They eventually made their way to California where she says the relationship took a violent turn. That's where police say Parrillo physically assaulted the woman taking away her phone and debit cards.

And as you mentioned then, the question of this building codes, whether they were properly implemented, whether they were followed.And the Turkish government has said it is carrying out investigations into this.

So far, at least 400 people within the construction industry identified as potential suspects in relation to allegations of construction, negligence. At least 120 people, according to state media have been arrested thus far. And this is going to take weeks, if not months for the process to be followed through. But of course, this is something that the Turkish government is really pushing for. They said this investigation is part of that process of seeking accountability following the outbreak.

But it's something that we were working on. And we've made very clear to Congress our strong support for the F-16 modernization. We have long- standing defense and security ties.

And we are aware of certain letters that have been written by some circles and some senators. On one hand, we are working on this in terms of delegations, technical delegations. And if the U.S. administration has firm stance, and if we work together, we believe that we can overcome this resistance that might exist.These are two independent issues especially pertaining to states becoming full member to NATO. It will be the precondition of the purchase of F-16. These are not related issues that they are different negotiations for both two sides and reason MOU that has been signed, trilateral MOU. So, it will not be corrected to put this as a precondition. Or of course, it will not be possible for us to purchase F-16 with certain conditions, our hands should not be tight. So, we should have a common stance as the administration of Turkiye and administration of U.S., this is critical. On the issue of the F- 35, we were a partner to the F-35. And because of the hot sanctions, Turkiye was taken out of this partnership, this was a unilateral decision. It wasn't our decision. There is a payment that we have made $1.4 billion. And if Turkiye is not in the program, of course, expecting that this money is to be paid back to us is only natural and negotiations are continuing on. This on 18th of January, when we met with my counterpart in Washington, D.C.

Minister, the relations between Turkey and US have been continuing in a negative way that there are differences of opinions. The (INAUDIBLE) F-16s, Sweden and Finland are also on the issue of earthquake. You have indicated that there is strong solidarity. Do you believe that that this tragedy that we experienced will be an occasion for a new page in the relations between two countries? NATO countries and the U.S. is -- are expecting Turkey to ratify the membership application of both Sweden and Finland before the new summit, will Turkey be able to meet this requirement? Ties between your two countries have been in a bad place. You yourself describe Turkey in your confirmation hearing two years ago at the so- called ally but I wonder if the experience of the earthquake has created an opportunity for a reset between the two countries. [02:50:08] And the follow up to my colleague's question on the F-16. You just said you can't assess the timeline for the formal notification. What exactly is the United States waiting for?

We might have differences of opinions with the United States of America. And these issues are clear, but the positive agenda and focusing on the positive agenda and there is also will to develop our relations further. Therefore, during the meeting in Rome, President Biden and President Erdogan discussed the establishment of the strategic mechanism. The aim behind this, as I have mentioned that the philosophy behind this is to focus on the positive agenda and develop relations on a bilateral basis and different platforms. Increase cooperation in regional and global issues. The second aim is actually to discuss the existing problems and discuss how these problems could be resolved and take steps accordingly. In this direction, both at expert level and at the ministerial level, we met twice. And I do believe that such meetings have been very beneficial. When Foreign Minister of Greece visited our country as I said, during the press meeting, for developing relations or for resolving existing problems, we should not wait for disasters take place and we should take sincere and concrete steps in this direction. The membership of Sweden and Finland, if you follow for the declarations on our side, and I do know that U.S. following this closely, we have a trilateral memorandum of understanding between these three countries. And it's very clear as to what steps needed to be taken by which side. Relatively our problems with Finland are less. So, the calendar that you have shared with respect to the NATO summit in the news, these are tied in relation to the steps that are to be taken by Sweden. There have been some positive messages, there have been legislative amendments and constitutional amendments undertaken by the Swedish side. But unfortunately, the PKK supporters and also in relation to financing of terrorism, the records for terrorism, as well as the terrorist propaganda, all activities are continuing. And these are taking place in the center of Stockholm, in front of the city building. And they are trying to eliminate Sweden's membership to NATO. But of course, it's up to Sweden to take relevant measures to eliminate such activities. We saw the sincere efforts of the prime minister. And he also had an opportunity to see the stance of all political parties in our parliament. This is just a matter of the government's position. So, the pastor and the better, the Swedish side takes the steps, it would -- they take steps that will convince our parliament and our people, then we will take the relevant steps as well. Of course, on the issue of Finland we have indicated that there should be a different methodology followed. This was the message that our president shared with the Secretary General of NATO last week. Here we are -- especially waiting for the Swedish society to take concrete steps and everybody should support Sweden to take these concrete steps. Thank you.",
