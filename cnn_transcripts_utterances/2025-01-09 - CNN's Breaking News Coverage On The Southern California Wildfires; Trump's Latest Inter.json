Steve Whitkoff, president-elect Trump's incoming special envoy for the region, arriving in Doha, Qatar on Wednesday to join Biden administration officials in kind of presenting a united front in these negotiations. And it's clear that both the Biden and the Trump officials are indeed rowing in the same direction, saying that they are aiming to get a hostage and ceasefire deal in place before Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20th. Whitkoff said that he's seen some great progress towards that direction, sounding some optimism that he believes that deal can be reached before January 20th. Biden administration officials and Israeli officials sounding a little bit less optimistic, making clear that there are still some very difficult issues that need to be resolved. Israeli officials telling me that they are still waiting for a list of the living hostages to be provided by Hamas, a critical demand that they have been making, of course, at this point for months now.
