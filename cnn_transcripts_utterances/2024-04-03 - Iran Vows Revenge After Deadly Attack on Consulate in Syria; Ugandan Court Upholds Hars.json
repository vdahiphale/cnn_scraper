      "sentences": "Fallout from the Israel-Hamas war is spilling out across the region and raising fears of a broader conflict. Iran is now vowing to respond after accusing Israel of bombing its consulate in Syria on Monday. At least a dozen people were killed there.On Tuesday, the Pentagon said the U.S. assessment was that Israel carried out that airstrike. The White House is warning Iran, though, against any retaliatory strikes against American forces in the region, because Tehran says that it holds the U.S., quote, answerable for this attack because of its support for Israel. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us now with the latest from Beirut. Ben, what is going on with Iran and this retaliatory promise? What's the latest there?",

      "sentences": "Well, so far, the Iranians have only spoken and not acted. But certainly tensions are rising despite the focus on the situation in Gaza. Today, for instance, we heard reports that the spokesman for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ramazan Sharif, said that soon we will deal deadlier blows to the Zionist regime.Now, we have also heard from other senior Iranian officials that revenge is coming. They're not talking about time, place, method or target. But certainly it does appear that the Israelis are taking measures in the event that something does happen today. It was announced by the Israeli military that they are calling up reserves for their air defenses. It's believed in response to fears about Iranian retaliation. And we heard Yoav Galant, the Israeli defense minister today, who was in Haifa, in northern Israel, inspecting a home front command drill. And he said that we are expanding our operations against Hezbollah and are prepared for any scenario. And, of course, Hezbollah is closely connected to Iran. So it does appear that there is rising tension about the situation on the border between Israel and Lebanon. Keep in mind that since the beginning of the war in Gaza, about 90,000 Lebanese have fled the south of the country as a result of the fire between Israel and Hezbollah. And a similar number on the Israeli side have also fled their homes and taken refuge in safer areas. So there are concerns that if there is a flare up, that flare up indirectly between Iran and Israel could happen on the border between Israel and Lebanon -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, we know that millions of Americans have major depressive disorder, and many don't get enough benefit from antidepressant medications. So this is a prescription app that has been cleared through the FDA's sort of medical device pathway. And what it does is it's a six-week program that offers cognitive behavioral training and sort of emotional exercises to try to improve how people are doing as they're additionally taking antidepressant medications. Now, it's being offered by a pharmaceutical company called Otsuka, which itself sells antidepressant medications. It is not yet available, and we don't yet know what the price is going to be or if it'll be covered by insurance. And that's a major question for this app and other digital sort of medical tools.We have seen that insurance coverage hasn't necessarily always been great because people in the field, doctors often have questions about how great the benefits will be. And that's what we're hearing about this as well. The company says that in a clinical trial, it did improve symptoms of major depressive disorder over time. But there are questions about just the magnitude of that benefit. So this is expected to be available toward the end of this year, and it'll be interesting to see what the uptake is going to be and how much it can help -- guys.",

We know that that can cause health problems and disrupted sleep.But this study actually looked at the effects of that over a long period of time, between people's ages of 22 and then up to 50. And they looked at health outcomes at age 50, and they found that people who had sort of volatile or variable work schedules were more likely at the age of 50 to report less sleep, a lower quality of sleep, lower physical and mental function, and a higher likelihood of reporting poor health or depressive symptoms. And they saw differences in the data based on demographics, like women were more likely to have these experiences, people who are Black and people with lower education levels. And so they're saying as our work schedules are shifting, unfortunately, ever more in some cases to be sort of more fragmented in terms of how much sleep we can get. This is something we need to be paying attention to in terms of our health.",
