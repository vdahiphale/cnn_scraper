Both campaigns, the Harris and the Trump campaign, appear to be at an impasse, this time over whether or not the mics will be muted while the other candidate is speaking at that September 10th ABC debate. Now, originally, Donald Trump and President Joe Biden had agreed to terms that were similar to that of the CNN debate, that first debate, in which the mics would be muted as we saw at the CNN debate while the other candidate was talking. Now, the Harris campaign is saying that they want those mics unmuted. Now, Trump's team says that's not what we agreed to. But a lot of this here is just posturing as each side tries to figure out what's best for their candidate. However, Donald Trump himself talked about this while he was in Virginia, commemorating the third anniversary of the Afghanistan withdrawal. And he seemed to essentially undercut his own campaign. Take a listen. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: So we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it. They also want to change the rules.

He can put up his air defense capabilities. And I do have the numbers here. There was 127 missiles and 109 drones fired at Ukraine. Ukraine was able to shoot down 102 of those missiles and 99 drones. So they're taking out a huge number of them. Still, enough are getting through to create so much damage, to cause people to be killed, to send families into bomb shelters. So President Zelenskyy is saying to the West, to his allies, to NATO, I need permission for two things to fight back. The first is I need to be able to use my long-range missiles to strike at the source inside Russian territory to these drones and missiles. And secondly, I would like to use these air defense capabilities that you have given me right up, if not on, Russian airspace.

An ice cave in the Breioamerkurjokull glacier collapsed on Sunday, killing one American, injuring another. The couple was touring the glacier in southern Iceland when disaster happened. The collapse prompted a major search for two additional tourists believed trapped under the ice. SVEINN KRISTJAN RUNARSSON, CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT, SOUTH ICELAND POLICE (through translator): It's difficult to get equipment to the area. The rescue missions are therefore mainly done by hand, digging and breaking the ice. So, yes, these are very challenging circumstances. VAUSE (voice-over): But no one was found and police have since confirmed there have been only 23 people on the tour, not 25. The collapse, though, is now raising questions about the potential role of human-caused climate change. Iceland is warming roughly three times faster than the rest of the planet because of the burning of fossil fuels and carbon emissions. And the renowned Breioamerkurjokull glacier has been melting since 1930, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Tourism brings in billions of dollars to Iceland's economy, and tourism officials there are now said to be drafting a new report on glacier tours in the wake of the collapse, as questions linger about their safety, especially with global temperatures on the rise.

Seven people, including British tech titan Mike Lynch and his 18-year-old daughter, died when the ship sank. Fifteen people, including nine crew members, survived. The investigation will now look at whether the yacht was secured for the storm, which had been predicted in weather advisories to mariners the night before, and whether the crew adequately warned the passengers of their imminent danger. The cost to raise the ship, which will then be examined by investigators, falls on the ship's owner, which is a company belonging to Lynch's wife.
