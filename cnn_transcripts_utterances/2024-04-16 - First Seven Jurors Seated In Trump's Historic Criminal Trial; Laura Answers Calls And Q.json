Prosecutors argued against the dismissal and the judge frankly agree with the prosecutors. But then there was a moment of fireworks. After that juror apparently left the courtroom, Judge Merchan reprimanded Trump for his behavior, apparently speaking and gesturing in some way in the direction of the juror, telling Trump's attorney, \"Your client was audibly uttering. I will not have any jurors intimidated in the courtroom.\" Now, Trump's team got a win when the judge agreed to dismiss another potential juror whose Facebook post celebrated Trump losing a court battle over his travel ban and said, referring to Trump -- quote -- \"get him out and lock him up.\" Hmm, lock him up.

There's no -- you know, even the folks who said positive things about him said it in sort of a lighthearted but a little worrisome way. They said, you know, he says what he thinks. My mother taught me to say nice things, and so I don't do that. I think this jury is -- this jury, as it's coming together, is really wrestling with, how do you judge a president?

And neither of those settings are great for a jury.And I think what you saw at that moment was a little bit of the anger coming out because he clearly believes his lawyer's argument that this person has no business being, you know, judging him. But I think the difficulty for his legal team is Trump presents often in court as either one of those two things, and those are not particularly sympathetic things for the jury to look at. I think that is going to be a continuing difficulty or challenge for his legal team to try to -- he's in physical space with them.

Now, none of that was true. But according to investigators, Brock, actually, while he was talking to this scammer, he actually was hesitant, he was resistant at times, and it was then where Brock says the scammer starts to threaten his life and also threaten his nephew's life. Now, meanwhile, at the same time, police say the same scammer or an accomplice of that scammer contacted Loletha Hall, like you said, through Uber, and said, go over to Brock's house and pick up a package. Well, that's when the shooting started. Brock told police that he thought Loletha was coming there to harm him and to take that money. But Laura, I mean, take a listen to the 9-1-1 call that Brock placed right after he ultimately shot and killed Loletha. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): Why did you do that?

We have professional police officers. If you think you're getting scammed, you call the police, you take those steps. If you look at the body cam, Laura, I don't see the threat that was posed. As Danny noted, there was no threat, much less an immediate threat, which is what you need for self-defense. And so, stand-your-ground in the event that he was in an imminent fear of a threat or attack would be viable. He would not have to retreat. But there's no stand-your-ground when, in fact, you're the first aggressor. And so, I don't think that's going to apply. I think the charges are appropriate. I think the scammers, if found, will be brought to justice as well under a felony murder rule, as you know, the commission of another felony, the scamming, or under some other involuntary manslaughter rule.
