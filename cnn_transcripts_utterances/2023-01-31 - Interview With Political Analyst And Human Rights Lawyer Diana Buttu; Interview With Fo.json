I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. America's top diplomat is leaving the Middle East after spending two days in the region as violence between Israelis and Palestinians flares up once again. Antony Blinken urged calm on both sides. It's a familiar line from a U.S. Secretary of State. But this is the first major test of Benjamin Netanyahu's latest and very hardline government which took power last month. It is widely considered the most far-right religious Israeli coalition in the state's history. After meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday, Blinken went to the occupied West Bank to meet with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, becoming the latest American Secretary of State to try navigating a way out of this cycle of despair, while also clinging to the hope and the vision of a two-state solution. Diana Buttu is a Palestinian lawyer who advised the negotiating team, and she is joining me now from Ramallah. Welcome back to the program, Diana. Can I start by asking you what you made of the statement by Antony Blinken, sitting, I believe, there with President Mahmoud Abbas, talking about Palestinians shrinking horizons for hope. I've actually never heard that before in public. What did you make of that?",

We've seen more and more settlements expand, we've seen more Palestinian homes be demolished by Israel, more Palestinians killed. And the idea of a two-state solution is now laughable. So, this is the first dose of honesty that we've heard from a secretary of state. The question is, what is he going to do to stop it and to pretend that somehow the U.S. is either an honest broker (ph) or that it doesn't play a role in this is also laughable. The United States has been fueling the Israeli government. Instead of boycotting this extremist fascist government, they've embraced it.

I know you, yourself, and you said it to us many times, do not believe there's any more hope for the two-state solution. The Americans clearly believe there is. But how about this survey? I don't know whether, you know, what you took form this, but Horwitz (ph), the new survey says that, yes, support for two-state solution is sinking very, very rapidly.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: These efforts are not a substitute for progress between Israelis and Palestinians. But as we advance Israel's integration, we can do so in ways that improve the daily lives of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. And that's crucial to moving toward our enduring goal of Palestinians and Israelis enjoying equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, justice, and dignity.

At every single junction, this isn't just a question of them funding the occupation, but giving endless political support. And once again, if they do believe in a two-state solution, it is easy to implement, it just requires Israel to reverse its settlement enterprise. But instead of reversing it, we have seen that the settlement enterprise has deepened. Just with this new government, the first announcement that they made was that they were going to build and expand even more settlements. And yet, there isn't a peep, nobody is pushing Israel and stopping Israel, and saying to Israel, enough. If they believe in the two-state solution, they need to back the two-state solution.

By the way, that is one of the reasons that President Biden, when he congratulated, not yet, Prime Minister Netanyahu. But after his election victory, he clearly raised in the phone call concerns about the people involved, including people like Ben-Gvir and Smotrich in the government. And the prime minister to be, Prime Minister Netanyahu, assured him that this would be his government. He would be the one controlling it. Making clear that he would make the decisions. And they would not. So, one of the reasons for the timing of the Tony Blinken visit, following visits by Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, was precisely not to rush to meetings with the prime minister, not to have him come immediately to Washington, but to see overtime, could we prepare the visit, number one? And number two, would what the prime minister was saying, would it be demonstrated in terms of Israel's behavior. He said, he would be the one with his hands on the wheel. He would be the pilot. He would not be a co-pilot in any fashion. So, I think your -- that was the context in terms of the Blinken visit. Now, the Blinken visit has obviously also been affected by what's happened in the last week. And obviously, you had the Israelis go into Jenin. They - - we are facing a very different situation. Guns are far more plentiful now in the West Bank than before. When these kinds of rage, which in a sense if you watch the show \"Fauda\", then what you're seeing is that pretty much characterizes the kinds of rage see in Jenin, into the refugee camps and the like. And in the past, when you have those kinds of rage, the Israelis would go in and they would arrest those who they saw as preparing attacks. In this case, what we're seeing, not just in Jenin, but elsewhere is these people have guns and there are firefights, there are very few arrests. You end up with a big firefight. Inevitably the people they go in to arrest end up being killed, but so did bystanders. So, you saw that last week. You saw -- I think, nine people were killed, at least one bystander. And then you had a terror on Friday night where people being gunned down as they came out of a synagogue. And so, that was the backdrop to the visit. So, it's not a surprise that you have a secretary of state who goes there, maybe with one initial objective in mind. But now he comes and his main objective is to try to de-escalate the situation so that this doesn't spin out of control. So, it doesn't take on a life of its own.

And as I got older and got to Hollywood, I would befriend these really funny comedians and, you know, and comedic actors, and see them show up in movies where they weren't allowed to be funny in a way that their male counterparts were allowed to be funny. And it really bothered me because all the women I knew who were so talented, were being treated just as a foils, or as the mean wife, or the perfect girlfriend. And I just said, I just want to make three dimensional characters in movies and tell their stories because I just relate to those more. I mean, there's plenty of stories about men out there and those are, you know, those are fine.

He loved his students, he loved his colleagues, had a good marriage, grandchildren who he taught to sale, all of that. John, on the other hand, was quite high achieving. But fairly withdrawn and had the sense that he didn't really want to spend much time with people. He had two unhappy marriages. He ended life very lonely and unhappy himself.",

But you can reverse andsay, if you're the type of person who's happy, you'll be engaged with people. Which one causes which? DR. WALDINGER: That's exactly right. Your point, it's by directional that they work together. And so, we know that when we are less happy, we're less likely to engage with people. When we're physically ill, we're less likely to be able to engage with people. And so, what we're talking about is a kind of platform of well-being. What we encourage people to do is to pay attention to their connections with other people. Pay attention to their relationships because it supports us, particularly when hard times come, when depression comes, when physical illness comes, when pandemics come.",

That lockdowns really isolated us from the people we rely on for that sense of well-being and that sense of belongings. But that said, people found ways through social media, for example, to connect with each other. I have a friend who found his elementary school friends on Facebook, and now they have coffee online every morning -- every Sunday morning. And they're --",

That the -- adolescence is a time of identity formation. And so, we're trying to figure out who we are in the world. And when we look at other people's lives that are not the whole story of anybody's life on social media, we can end up feeling like we are wrong. We don't fit in. That's the problem.

That was on the rise long before COVID. That the path of least resistance, unfortunately, is to become less connected to each other overtime. And so, part of what we are advocating based on our research and what we write about in our book is the idea that we have to be proactive in maintaining these connections because otherwise our path leads us towards isolation more and more.",

That these wonderful screens that we're so addicted to, that are designed to capture and hold our attention, take us away from each other. And there is good research on this that we invest less and less in our social lives as technology captures our interest and our attention from the advent of television in the 1950s in the United States to all the screens that began to dominate our lives in the early 2000s.",

That community involvement makes us happier. It makes us feel more like we belong and that our community investment has gone down. Volunteering for community organizations, going to houses of worship, joining clubs, all of that has gone down.

WALDINGER: Well, when we follow these thousands of lives, we see that life doesn't just proceed in one direction towards happiness or towards unhappiness, there are ups and downs because challenges are always coming our way. And what we find is that relationships form a kind of safety net for us. That when we asked people who went through the Great Depression and went through World War II, when we asked them what got you through these terrible times? To a person, they mentioned the relationships. It was the people writing letters back home. It was my fellow soldiers. It was the neighbors who helped our family through the depression. And so, what we find is that that safety net of relationships is what helps us all get through the inevitable challenges of a normal life.",

WALDINGER: What's driving the number, you know, we think is in part the digital revolution. But also, the breakdown of traditional structures, because we see this around the world that in India, in China. As people seek opportunity, economic opportunity by moving away from family settlements and villages into big cities, life becomes more anonymous. Families stop having their usual roles. Grandchildren are not there for grandparents to take care of. And parents don't have grandparents around to help them out. So, all of this breaks down those structures that embed us in webs of relationships. And the question is, is there a way we can recreate those, rebuild those in our more modern society? And that's a big question we're all wrestling with.",

I mean, think of the voices we hear that divide us from each other, that make us afraid of each other. Those voices are not our friends.
