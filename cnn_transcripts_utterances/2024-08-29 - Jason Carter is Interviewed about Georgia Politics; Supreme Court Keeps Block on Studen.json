The vice president and Governor Tim Walz, they are in Georgia right now on a bus tour. That's a state that Joe Biden won by less than 12,000 votes last time. And the Harris-Walz team is focused on the southeastern part of the state, right here specifically. They were in Liberty County yesterday at a high school. That is a county that Joe Biden won you can see by 6,000 votes in 2016. Hillary Clinton, only won it by 3,000 votes. So clearly that is something they want to extend. They're also in Chatham County. That is where Savannah is. That is a county that Joe Biden won by 25,000 votes. Hillary Clinton, for her part, only won it by about 17,000.So again, you can see where they would want to expand the lead from last time. With us now to talk about Georgia, someone who certainly knows it, Jason Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter. Jason, thank you so much for being with us. I know you can't see the map, you have no return video, which means you can't see my beautiful face or the map here, but talk to us about the importance of southeastern Georgia here.

This really marks the latest chapter in the ongoing legal challenges against President Biden's efforts to offer some student debt relief. You'll remember that the Supreme Court had struck down President Biden's sweeping plan that would have offered about $400 billion in student debt relief in 2023. After that plan was struck down, the administration had put this SAVE plan in place. This student loan repayment plan basically structures the payments based on individual's incomes and their household sizes.Now, this plan has been on hold since earlier in the summer after a lower court had blocked it following a challenge led by - by Republican-led states. The Biden administration then went to the Supreme Court asking them to put this program back into play. The Supreme Court says that they will not step in, but they do expect the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is weighing this challenge, to act swiftly on this case. Now, as they've been preparing for these legal challenges, the Department of Education had actually put those who are currently enrolled in that program, about 8 million borrowers, into an interest- free forbearance. So they're not going to make payments on their monthly loans during this time as these legal challenges play out. But this is all part of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' efforts to try to alleviate some of the financial burdens that Americans are facing relating to their students debts. Biden's team had long viewed this as a key issue, not just for young voters, but also for family - young families trying - who are struggling to make some of these payments. They believe that this would be a key issue in the campaign. Vice President Harris herself actually, just last night, weighed in on this, saying that she and the president will continue to try to defend this type of program going forward. So, for the time being, they're still waiting for all of this to play out - play out the course in the courts as they are hoping that ultimately this program, it would be put back in place and offer some relief to those facing those high student loans.",

Some of the recalled products have sell-by dates into October of this year. Symptoms of listeria include a stiff neck, fever, fatigue.Visitors heading to the Grand Canyon this weekend may want to pack extra water after the park's main pipeline broke down.

This is the eighth manned commercial spaceflight for the company founded by Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos. It is unclear how much each of the five ticketed customers paid, but a ticket for the company's first flight auctioned off at $28 million. So, it's probably not cheap.

MEGAN RANNEY, EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN AND DEAN, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: You know, as a parent myself, honestly, I cheered this.

And we spent a lot of time talking about the mental health crisis among kids. And I will say, as a parent, as - and as an emergency physician, that I know that we can't help our kids get better if we're not better ourselves. So, as a parent, try to find help. Try to find time to take care of yourself. And advocate for policies in your community, at your workplace, in your state or city that help other parents, right? We need paid leave, especially during those early childbearing years. We need access to good childcare, not just in the toddler an infant years, but also throughout.

Let's decrease the risk of gun violence in our schools. Let's provide safe places for our kids to play after school.

Luckily, relatively rare. But when it does develop into this encephalitis or brain-swelling, it's quite, quite dangerous. About 30 percent of people who end up with encephalitis from the Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus end up dying.Now, there's two things to know. One is that it is borne by mosquitoes. So, the best thing to do is to prevent mosquito bites. So, try to stay indoors after dusk. Make sure you're wearing DEET or Picaridin, some sort of a real honesty (ph) chemical bug spray and try to not spend a lot of time around swamps or standing water, where there are lots of mosquitoes. That's one thing. The other thing to know is that EEE is actually much less common than things like West Nile Virus, which, of course, Dr. Fauci recently had. So, I would say to protect yourself, not just because of the risk of EEE, but also because of the risk of all of these other mosquito-borne viruses that are out there. Getting bitten by a mosquito is never a good thing, especially not right now when we are seeing this surge in mosquito-borne illness.",
