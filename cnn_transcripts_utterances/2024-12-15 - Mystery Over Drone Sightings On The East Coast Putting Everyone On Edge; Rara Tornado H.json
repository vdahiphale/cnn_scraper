      "sentences": "A lot more questions than answers, Jessica, but this arrest out of Boston is actually really interesting. And the reason I say that is because of what the Boston Police Department has told us helped them make the arrest. In fact, we learned that on Saturday an officer first spotted this drone activity dangerously close to Logan International Airport.So that officer deployed some drone detection technology that enabled him to pinpoint the location of where the drones were and where they were being operated from. They were coming out of Boston Harbor Island. That's an uninhabited place not far from the city of Boston. And once police arrived there, they were able to capture two people who initially tried to flee on foot. One of them had a drone in their backpack. A third person is believed to have fled on a small vessel. Now, we don't know yet just how much more we're going to learn as a result of these arrests or what these people could tell us about what they were doing. But the piece about the technology is interesting because so many lawmakers, state and federal officials, have been calling for more resources. Here in New York, we heard from Senator Chuck Schumer calling on the Biden administration, as well as the federal government, to increase resources to different localities, and specifically calling on them to use a type of radar technology that would help local police departments detect and prevent some of this drone activity. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): If the technology exists for a drone to make it up into the sky, there certainly is the technology that can track the craft with precision and determine what the heck is going on. And that's what the Robin does. Today we're asking the DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, to deploy special detection systems like the Robin, which use not a linear line of sight, but 360 degree technology that has a much better chance of detecting these drones.

She issued a statement saying that federal officials have responded to her request and that our federal partners are deploying a state-of-the-art drone detection system to New York State. She says this system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigation.The question here is, is New York about to get a version of this Robin type radar system that Senator Schumer was describing that remains unclear? I have asked for details. I've been told that as a matter of national security, they cannot tell us exactly what this technology is or where it will be deployed, but we will be looking to learn more and seeing whether or not these reported sightings continue in the coming days.

I also want to ask you, we just heard in that clip that Gloria was reporting on, the current Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer talk -- asking the government to deploy what he was calling the Robin. Would something like that make a difference?D'AMICO: Okay, the Robin Radar, so when we incorporate a radar system to our counter drone system, you have to really fine tune it. We were discovering like AC units on top of buildings. because the radar was picking up the spinning of the fans as propellers. So again, one system alone, one sensor alone does not work. Radar, RF, visual, and you can have some other ones in there that as technology gets more advanced, you plug it in and they all need to work cooperatively to look at all the pictures. So if it picks up radar, the video camera gets slewed to it and you can confirm it by visual if it's a drone or RF is picking up the controller and the drone. Again, the video would slew to it, the radar would slew to it. So it's a multi-sensor approach that gets very complex. It needs -- you need a lot of training for it, but it is out there, but it's just not one thing at all that's gonna fix this. And we talked about the radio frequency gaps. We had our own FCC saying that we couldn't even look at some radio frequencies that maybe foreign assets use for their drones.",

And I think that's where people are getting so frustrated is it seems like we should know more and we really don't. We don't know where these are coming from.D'AMICO: That is a problem. But it's also hard to prove a negative because I still think the majority are false spotting. Everything that they've been looking at is when they line it up with the flight plans, we used to use an app, Flight Radar 24, and it shows all the planes over your area, including government and commercial and small planes. And it's amazing that how many airplanes can be over one single area. They might be set off by altitude, but from the ground, they all look the same. Or if they're all coming in, I saw one video where they're saying that drones were lined up. Well, that's planes in an approach pattern. They're miles apart, but when you look at them from a certain angle, they look all on top of each other. So again, it's tough and it is a technology. I had the best guys out there that were working because that's all they worked was counter drones. That training can go to state and locals, but it's gonna take some time and funding. And I think Congress really has to get ahold of in order to go in the future with what drones are gonna be used by. They talk about drones being able like taxis to go pick someone up. You're going to have to figure all this out and what that airspace looks like to deconflict.",

Straight line winds of 80 miles per hour came through there, not a tornado. We've got this storm that's continuing to move on shore.

There certainly is a rising tide against corporate America, especially the health insurance industry.The health insurance industry is one of the only industries I know of that makes it its business policy to not deliver the product that it told the customers it was going to deliver. And I think Americans are frustrated by that. But the Affordable Care Act by Barack Obama helped set this up. They sort of blessed this oligopoly that we have with health insurance companies.

When you see somebody like Elon Musk, who has no experience in government, is effectively in charge of cutting potential benefits, like Social Security and other things, for people who rely on it to get through the day and to get through their lives, I think that anger is only going to grow.And I think we are only -- this is the tip of the iceberg as to what we're about to see. Ultimately, I think that hopefully there are people out there who understand what we're on the precipice of. Because as I said, I don't think this is a party issue. I don't think this is a partisan issue. You have a tremendous amount of anger from the middle class and the working class. You saw that in the last election. You saw that when Democrats in my party were telling people the economy was doing well. They weren't believing their lying eyes. And we saw the consequences of that. And that's only going to get worse if Trump does not address this immediately. And I don't see that the steps that he's taking and who he's surrounding himself with will address those issues.

All of these companies from Meta to Amazon to, you know, Jeff Bezos and so on, donating to his inauguration, to try to curry favor with him. These are not small businesses, Brad.

And they, ultimately, are the ones who are bending the knee to Donald Trump. Now, is he going to support them or is he going to support the little guy that can't settle with him for $15 million-- settle with him for $15 million or is he going to support the farmers out there? Or is he going to support the Elon Musk's of the world who wants to cut these subsidies to the farmers who put Donald Trump in office? So, we'll see what's going to happen.

And so, they have a huge incentive to reach out to the international community and have that international community help shape what this looks like in the future without trying to be doing nation-building. You know, we don't want more forever war kind of things.But, you know, this group right now is opening up, and I think it's very important for the international community to try to work with them to encourage the best that can come out of this.",

And it's like a proxy war on steroids with so many different groups. Well, now, Israel is one of these places that has bomb Syria hundreds of times in the past week to try to destroy arms caches that could then be used either by Iran, Hezbollah, fall into the wrong hands and attack Israel.So, Israel has this buffer zone, right? It has this shared border. And the part of the border that they have moved into are the heights. They're the part that overlook all of that part of Syria and where all these different groups that were arming Hezbollah and others were moving through. And so, Syria has this big strategic interest there. But, you know, I think the problem with Syria and with Israel sometimes is that they have these tactical things that they do but strategically, it's not good. Like in Lebanon, have they turned a lot of people against Israel by doing bombing in a very wide way? And so, I hope Israel kind of calms down now and works in this area. But look, the Golan Heights is not recognized as Israeli territory by the international community, but it is by the United States under the Trump administration. We said, yep, this territory you annexed in the 80s is yours. No one else actually agrees with that. And so, it is kind of a disputed area. And this is going to be, I think, a point of friction when the Israelis say they want put more Israeli settlers in this place that's also occupied by Druze, some of whom feel like they're Syrians. So again, very, very complicated, but it's going to be a point of contention, but one that Israel has to like defend against as well. They have legitimate reasons.",
