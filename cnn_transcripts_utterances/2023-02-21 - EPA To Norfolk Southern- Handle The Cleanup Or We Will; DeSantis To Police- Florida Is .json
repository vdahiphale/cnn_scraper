This happened, what, two weeks ago or so? He is saying at this point, he'll go when the time is right. he time was probably right maybe a week or two ago. Listen, I think the folks in this community look like the folks in too many communities that are left behind, right? They're white and they're working class folks, right? And we saw this in different communities throughout the last many years, whether it was in Jackson, whether it was in Flint. And so if you're the Biden administration and you're supposed to be the administration that not only is competent, but also compassionate and reaching out to folks who are in need and the folks who are, again, too often left behind, I think it probably does make sense to have a sort of higher profile, more consistent presence there. So we'll see when Pete Buttigieg gets there, and we'll see if the President also goes. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Pete Buttigieg's argument part of it is that right now, the National Safety Transportation Board is still conducting its investigation, which they haven't finished on what exactly caused the derailment, but we are seeing he move a bit faster this week. I mean, after saying that the administration was constrained because of regulation -- safety regulations that were repealed under the Trump administration, Buttigieg now this week, is starting to say that he wants Congress to pass stronger regulations. Trying to speed up what companies are doing to make their braking method safer and other measures that they think that they should be able to do in recent years rather than wait, you know, five or six years down the road.",

It's also about the fact that he is likely to jump into the Republican presidential primary. What I find interesting about what he said there, you know, Republicans have now used the term woke as this ambiguous catchall for things that they are fighting against when we're talking about essentially the rights of others. LGBTQ people, learning about black history, learning about any type of ethnic studies, history, book banning is what is happening in his state. And we saw that the governors and the officials in the states that he visited specifically pushed back on him on that, saying that we're not going to ban LGBTQ rights, we're not going to ban books just based on the ability to learn about race and gender. And we're seeing also that in polling, those aren't necessarily popular policies across the country when you get into swing state.",

But Donald Trump just moments ago did endorse one of Nikki Haley's big announcement planks.She said she believes any candidate for president, especially if you're over 75, should have to take a mental acuity test of some kind. Trump just posted, anybody running for the Office of President of United States should agree to take a full and complete mental competency test simultaneously or before their announcement that he or she is running.

I think some people could obviously make that argument about any number of people. But listen, I think the key for Nikki Haley is what is really her lane.

I'm a smaller government, less regulation, get the government out of the way of individuals conservative.The New York Times has a profile of him right now. He says he's the normal lane. That's what he wants to be. Mr. Sununu, a Seinfeld quoting, COVID booster-boosting son of a governor who supported Mr. Trump's first two campaigns, is offering himself as a walking referendum on the direction of the party, road testing a message of de-MAGA-fied conservatism.\" The question is, is that a big enough lane? Are there enough people? BARRON-LOPEZ: He also said in there that he's not an extremist, which we've seen President Biden try to use that language when he's attacking Trump, as well as a number of the Republicans that ran for office in 2022 in the Senate in the House. And so, I mean, right now there is no indication, especially when we look at the midterms, that normal as Sununu calls himself, or just conservative who does not subscribe to the abortion or COVID policies that a lot of the other Republicans are has a lane right here because they lost in the primaries in 2022. And right now, other than Sununu, we aren't really seeing that many Republicans that are potentially going to run, that are distancing themselves from Trump, especially on policy.",
