Iran claims two Revolutionary Guard Commanders were killed in a strike on its consulate in Syria, while Israel says the building was a military facility. A group of hackers telling CNN they've stolen hundreds of their information on thousands of Russian prisoners in response to the death of Alexei Navalny. The truth can hurt. Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social tumbling after disclosing steep losses. And a swift swap. We speak to the firm hoping their battery switching technology will tackle charging, anxiety and electrify EV sales. That conversation and more coming up. But first, an alarming new escalation in the Middle East. The Iranian ambassador to Syria is vowing to respond as he blames Israel for a deadly air strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. Iranian authorities say at least seven members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in the strike, including two senior commanders. CNN cannot independently verify the details, though IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari told my colleague Jim Sciutto that Israel believes the building was in fact an Iranian military facility. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, SPOKESPERSON, IDF: To make sure that according to our intelligence, this is no consulate and this is no embassy. I repeat, this is no consulate and this is no embassy. This is a military building of Quds Forces disguised as a civilian building in Damascus. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And when you look at this particular case that you're talking about now, there is a similar feeling within the military that they have to go into Rafah, because that's where the leaders of Hamas are. And I think this is why, when we heard from the White House today, they said they didn't expect the White House engagement with Israeli officials over the type of military operation that Israel will undertake in Rafah. They didn't expect it to reach any quick conclusions. And there's a sense that the Hawks really just sort of want to run down the clock, either on the Biden administration or the effectiveness of the Biden administration. So, there's a -- there is, you know, a feeling that those military elements that want to push for essentially a military escalation are not fully engaging in the process of trying to reach an accommodation of the type the United States wants around Rafah, and I think that speaks to the concerns of the White House has at the moment that where they say they don't really have any new details about how Israel is going to conduct the Rafah operation and keep the civilians safe. The IDF has not been able to do that so far. That's why the casualty toll has been so high across Gaza because they cannot get civilians safely out of the way. And we don't know how it's going to be different if and when they go into Rafah.",

I think some people who saw the film said that this was a conversation starter to discuss nuclear deterrence, like you said. Of course, Japan doesn't have any nuclear weapons and relies on the United States in terms of protection, in terms of the -- you know, the global stage. And, you know, in terms of omitting those key images that show the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, you know, I think that was really a key point of contention for many Japanese viewers.

You said, charge anxiety, because a lot of people talk about range anxiety. When you think about a gas car, nobody even knows exactly what the range is because you know when you run out of range, you can go in and fill up very quickly. The problem you have with charging is when you run out of it, it could be very painful. And so, people have exactly that, it's charging anxiety. How much time am I going to spend? Is the charger going to be working? Is there going to be a queue? This could turn into a two-hour event. And so, we've gone right after that and said the beauty of gas cars is that you can get your gas in it very quickly. And when we can do the same thing for electric, people will be happy to switch. So, we allow them to come into our station, spend five minutes, swap the batteries for brand-new batteries and leave it at full charge. It's a very similar experience to what they use right now.",

If you're just driving in the city, you may want less battery. It makes the car lighter and more efficient, as well as cost you less. So, you don't always need to carry a 1,000-pound battery if you don't want to. In addition, from a price perspective, when you buy it, you buy it less the cost of the battery. So, you could be saving, as you mentioned, you know, somewhere between $6,000 and $20,000 on it, you pay a small monthly subscription on it. So, financially, it makes -- it's a lot easier for you to go through. You also more -- you end up with a more efficient car because you don't need to carry a heavy battery. And the last thing you're talking about in terms of the footprint, it does take only a couple parking spaces, and you can stack them up just like gas stations. So, if you're in an area where you have a lot of people coming in, you can actually go through and put four or five of them just like you have multiple gas stations that are placed so you can deal with the volume coming in. People come and go in five minutes, so it's easy to make sure you don't have a queue coming in.",

And that includesthe cost of the station and not digging into ground. As soon as you do civil works and then it gets very expensive. We don't require that. And so, we build the ground up in-house. So, we can keep the cost of the station low. How long it takes you to deploy it? It costs money. It takes us three days. So, we're in and out very quickly. And then, operation, you don't want to have people at the stations. These are fully autonomous stations that we do have remote monitoring, but that keeps the opaques (ph) down. So, in order to get a break even is you want to keep the cost down and the cost of building it and the cost of operations. And we focus very heavily on that piece. If you can't get it to be profitable just without subsidies, you run it. We're happy to get the subsidies. It helps to speed up, but we don't want to rely on them to be profitable.",

What we want, is we wantedto get something that would allow us to get -- literally get to over 100,000 cars in three or four years. So, the two parts of being able to scale it very quickly, one is the battery factory, and that's where we built a fully automated battery factory where the boxes come in, modules come out, and you can scale it very quickly. The second part of it is going through introducing the stations. Now, the good thing is every station supports a large number of cars. You need a lot fewer stations, but we're in the process of going and building a large factory to be able to produce those. So, those are the two components with this. The last is we work directly with the OEMs, and we've announced our partnerships with Daimler Trucks, Mitsubishi Fuso, as well as with Stellantis, is to work with them. The OEMs can produce the cars, and so we work with them to get the cars directly in the hands of the customers. So, the combination of those is what allows us to scale and get this in the hands of a lot of people.",

In less than 30 minutes,the University of Iowa and its superstar, Caitlin Clark, will face Louisiana State University. The winner will earn a spot in the final four, the semi-finals of the college basketball tournament. And the two teams met in final last year. Brynn Gingras joins us now. Brynn, it wasn't good for Iowa last year. You know, I love Caitlin Collins. I also love watching her parents. Her dad is not afraid of telling her to be quiet when she challenges decisions. It's quite funny. Explain for those that don't live in the U.S. that might not understand the importance of this, what's got everyone so excited? BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's the fact that these players are just standout players. We're not just talking about Caitlyn Clark on Iowa, but also Angel Reese on LSU as well, and other players in UConn, Paige Bueckers. These women are huge, huge performers and standouts and really bringing so much attention to women's basketball. The fans are going crazy for them. Julia, I can tell you that you could see there's people coming into this game. It's about to tip off in about 15, 20 minutes or so. But they have been out on that court for hours just watching these women, you know, warm up, little girls, little boys with Caitlin Clark jerseys. That's not something that we have even seen within the last couple of years. But of course, it has been exploding watching these two teams in particular. Now, as you mentioned, LSU and Iowa, they played last year in the national championship and it was a heated game. These two players, they like to trash talk each other. They are extremely competitive, would play with a ton of passion. And that's what these fans love to watch. So, there's a lot at stake. Everyone kind of thought that these teams would be the ones facing off again in national championships, but that is not the case. How the brackets all sort of started out this year. Now, it's to get to the final four. So, it is an exciting game. It is a rematch. Last year, 9.9 million viewers watched that game. Tonight, we will see if it breaks records. But I got to tell you, if you are not even the slightest bit of a basketball fan, you will probably still be tuning in to watch this game.",
