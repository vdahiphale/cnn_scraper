We could learn shortly and as we wait for him to speak, we have, as only CNN can, a team of correspondents, legal and political analysts to help make sense of what happened today and what happens next.

We saw it with his 2024 election or excuse me, campaign announcement. You have a seated event, lots of members.This has much more of a rally feel. We just had some entrants, I guess you could call it by Don, Jr. and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz where they were escorted down the middle row. You have a lot of people standing. We've seen Roger Stone, Mike Lindell, a lot of cheering. At one point, the crowd broke out cheering \"Kari Won\" when they saw Kari Lake. So it has become quite a who's who of Trump world that is here, but the big question is, as you said, what Trump are we going to get? I spoke to someone who is very close to the former president who said they were concerned about him, that after seeing him in that courthouse, that was not the Trump that they expected. However, I also talked to another source who believes that Trump's messaging is going to remain political and that he is going to continue to beat down what we have heard time and time again since 2015 from Donald Trump, which is they are not coming for me, they are coming for you and I am just standing in the way.

And in order to charge these as a felony in New York State, you have to prove that these records were falsified in furtherance of another crime, and it is not clear exactly what that larger crime is, because it's not charged here.Now, if prosecutors want to argue that these documents were falsified, and we're talking specifically, about the way Michael Cohen was reimbursed for the hush money that he paid to Stormy Daniels, if they want to argue that those documents were falsified in furtherance of something that is a Federal election law violation, that is shaky legal ground. I mean, that is an untested legal theory. It's not clear that that would ultimately be successful. At a press conference, the District Attorney suggested that this might be a violation of State election law, but that's not in the indictment or the statement of facts. So at this point, look, this is one of the most historic cases, arguably, the most significant case right now in an American court system. It appears to be built on a pretty shaky foundation because it is not clear what the larger crime is. And look, I've passed two Bar exams. I'm having a little trouble following Alvin Bragg's argument here. So, it's unclear if the average Manhattan juror will be able to follow it as well. And even if they can, even if they get a conviction, it still has to survive appeals, which is going to be difficult for cases built on novel legal theories.",

Now, that we've seen the facts, and it's, again unclear exactly what the larger crime is, we can expect that they're going to file a lot of motions likely also including a motion to change venue that they say they are not considering that at this point.

I think he's a lot angrier than that when you talk to people who speak more candidly about how he is viewing this. Obviously, he was charged today, he became a criminal defendant in a Court today, and that is obviously not something that we wanted to happen.

It's absurd, it's an airing of grievances, almost the greatest hits of Donald Trump. But today he solidifies his place as the consummate leader of the Republican Party.He's been beating the number two Ron DeSantis by near double digits in a number of polls. And now he's in a place where the party is consolidating around him, and he is running on a message that is, you cannot trust your institutions. He's going through everything from the Jack Smith investigation, the Mar-a-Lago investigation. I'll be curious to see if he brings up January 6. He is playing to the base of the base. Now, as a Republican, I'm stunned by the idea that we think this is a smart general election candidate, somebody who lost in 2020, who lost his seats in 2022 and in 2018.
