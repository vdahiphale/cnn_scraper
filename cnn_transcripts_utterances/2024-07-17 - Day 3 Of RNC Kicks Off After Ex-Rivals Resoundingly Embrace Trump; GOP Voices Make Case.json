      "sentences": "Good morning from day three of the Republican National Convention. I'm Kate Baldwin. We are here in Milwaukee where tonight is \"Veep Night\". In the coming hours Donald Trump's Vice Presidential Candidate, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, he takes center stage to deliver the biggest speech of his political career. Let's be -- let's be frank.We've just learned introducing him tonight will be his wife Usha. It's been just over 50 hours since both of them first stepped into the convention hall as Donald Trump announced him as running mate. And what Vance says tonight in his first remarks with that new title will be closely watched, of course, by Republicans but also by Democrats. CNN's Alayna Treene leads us off this hour. Alayna, you have new reporting about what Vance will be saying from that stage tonight. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "That's right, Kate. So I have spoken with someone who has helped work on J.D. Vance's prepared remarks for this evening. And they tell me that it's mainly going to focus on his life story, his biography.And I think you know Vance has a pretty incredible journey. He grew up in a poor Ohio, Rust Belt town, he struggled. He had a struggling childhood, a pretty -- you know tough childhood. He had a family who struggled with opioid addiction, but he went on to become a Marine. And then he went to Yale Law School. He was a Venture Capitalists. He was a best-selling author, and then he's only been in the Senate now for a year and a half, when Donald Trump chose him as his running mate. And so all of that by the time that he's at the age of 39, something I know Donald Trump has told him personally he finds very impressive. I do want to review just a quote I have from a source familiar with how the Trump team is looking at this. I think it sums it up perfectly. They wrote quote, If you want to crack suburban women, get them to watch the screen adaptation of Vance's memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy\", his life story is so powerful expect a lot of focus on his bio and life story, the source added. And so that's really what we're going to hear from him tonight. And remember, Trump's campaign really does believe that Vance can help them appeal to those crucial voters in the Rust Belt. Those working class voters they see as being necessary to help them win in the fall. So I expect him to touch on that today. And I do think you mentioned this Kate, but I think it's very notable as well that his wife, Usha Vance is going to be introducing him. She's someone that he had met at Yale Law School. They have been married for several years, but she's never really been in the political spotlight. So this is really going to be the first time we're seeing the family on a stage quite like this for such a big political moment. And for what is, as you said, a career defining moment for Ohio Senator J.D. Vance.",

So that's the view further from the Republican -- elected Republicans right now.Last night, former rivals onstage, embracing Donald Trump endorsing Donald Trump.

And you heard that from people like Senator Marco Rubio, Former North Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis, Tim, or excuse me, Ted Cruz, someone who got on this exact same stage back in 2016, and told voters to vote their conscience.And so remarkable shows of force from all of these different candidates who we know have criticized Donald Trump in the past but I think it's so important to keep in mind, Kate, that a lot of this as well as about political survivability -- you know they have to bend the knee and kiss the ring, because right now, it is clear that the Republican Party is Donald Trump's party. And so as we're seeing them line up behind them, it's not just as you mentioned earlier, their goodwill that has put them on this stage, but it's also about their own political viability Kate.",

Gaetz basically helped lead the charge that ran McCarthy out. Now Kevin McCarthy's from California, I'm from Boston. Matt Gaetz did that to me. And I'm Kevin McCarthy, and then I probably would have knocked him out on the floor. And I'm kind of surprised that Kevin McCarthy didn't give him credit for that. But it just shows you for all the talk about the healing and coming together in the Republican Party. There are riffs all throughout the floor, just like they're on the Democratic Party.
