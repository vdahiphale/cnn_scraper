Meanwhile, China's got bigger issues growing property sector woes triggering fresh losses on the major Asian markets.

And reports a China's bank regulators have now set up a task force to examine weakness at one of the nation's largest private wealth managers that have also missed payments too. Now in the meantime, a better turn elsewhere on global markets. The major U.S. averages set to bounce after last week's losses. Well, we're a little tilted to the downside at this moment, but its volatile, Europe providing a mixed picture there's XETRA DAX there over in Germany, the out performer. Plenty more to come on markets and more lately in the program, but first, Ukraine is strongly condemning what it calls Russia's provocative actions in the Black Sea. Moscow says one of its warships fired warning shots at a cargo ship on Sunday, soldiers then boarded the ship. The Russians claiming it was headed to Ukraine. Hours later, Kyiv accused Moscow of launching a barrage of missiles and drones at Odessa. The port city has been repeatedly targeted by Russian pauses throughout the war and Nick Paton Walsh is in Dnipro now for us. Nick, it's not just about Odessa of course many of the ports that are crucial to grain exports have been targeted in recent weeks and months. But now a cargo ship itself has been challenged too.

But they've rebounded as the Central Bank bought in all these emergency measures. And of course, as we saw huge revenues coming from oil and gas as those prices came up. Obviously now some of that trend is in reverse, oil and gas prices have fallen. Some of this year, Russian revenues from oil and gas are down some 40 percent in the first part of the year, first half of the year. And that is contributing to a situation where really the trade balance has been turned upside down to some degree. The current account surplus is down some 85 percent in the first half of the year. And this is what the Central Bank is really attributing to the fall. And the currency imports have surged as demand has returned and exports have come down. Of course, with oil and gas being the biggest contributor, it could still continue. The Central Bank is saying today that they may step in and raise rates again at their next meeting. They just did so by a full percentage point in July for the first time in more than a year. Or remember, they've been bringing rates down. Really since sort of the late spring of last year after they had to raise them as an emergency measure at the beginning of the war, they may have to now keep raising them. So that's one thing. But I think this is all as well, something to bear in mind. I was just talking to an economist who reminded me that for the Russian people, this exchange rate is very psychological. Russia is a country which has sort of money change shops, pretty much on every corner. They will walk past and see these triple digit numbers and say the government is out today, trying to reassure the people and advise the Kremlin saying the Central bank has all the tools it needs to fix this, Julia.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Julia that exceeds even some of the fastest highway speeds here in the United States. So that's really sayingsomething in -- , you cannot outrun something like that. But the reason for the strong winds is really and the wildfire is a compounding list of factors, right? You mentioned this rapid onset of drought conditions that really materialized within the past couple of months. But it's also a factor of what was a passing hurricane that stoked the winds across the Hawaiian Islands, particularly into Maui, this pressure gradient with a high to the north and the hurricane, which is a low pressure system. We see winds move from high to low or air moves. And just because of that gradient, there, we saw the strong winds gusting in excess of 100 kilometers per hour in some instances. Now get this 80 percent of the state of Hawaii under abnormally dry conditions. But when we focus in on Maui County, particularly the westward side, we call that the leeward side of the island, the severity of the drought has increased the severe index, I should say, increased over 10 percent from this time last week. So a vast marked difference in the drought conditions to continue to build there. Now this is very interesting, if you go back since 2006, there have been no real rainy seasons with above average precipitation and there's been 10 seasons with below average precipitation. So this is also one of those compounding factors that we add on top of that. So Lahaina really sits in a very precarious position because the majority of the trade winds out of this area come from the northeast, so it comes up and over the mountain ranges. So it brings the rainfall to the Windward sides but the leeward side unfortunately, the exact opposite process takes place certainly dries out the air. We see the winds pick up and the temperatures can increase as well. So when we get these large wildfires that perhaps start on the upper sides of the mountain slopes in the upcountry, we call that in the Maui County region, we get the strong gusty winds coming up and over the mountain ranges we get spot fires that take those little embers. They can travel so quickly start additional fires down the slopes, down the terrain. And that is why we saw this fire spread so quickly. Now the forecast trade winds through this week are expected to pick up to moderate strength through the next couple of days as yet another tropical system passes well south of Hawaii. But nonetheless, we're going to be monitoring this very closely to see how this impacts things, Julia.",

And the generative AI can also work in ourfront and by the way, which we've seen too, in, in companies like Checkpoint, that they if before, we had to develop a super intelligent system to identify malicious content, and so on. And it took months and years today with AI; we can develop these kinds of systems in a matter of days by training them on large sets of data, which is one of the benefits that we have with data that we collected every day in billions of transactions. And, and on the same end, so just to give you an example, in Checkpoint, we have over 70 kind of threat intelligence. We call it threat cloud technologies that are identified and stop attack, over 40 of these technologies are already AI based, not necessarily generative AI, but over 40 are AI based. And that's very, very helpful also, on the defense side.",

And while therehave been benefits occurring to some of the clients that you have, and the larger tech companies, and particularly those that are playing in the AI space. For other companies, it's hard to raise money. They have to make tough decisions, as any company over how you spend money, and perhaps that's limiting the budget amount that they would provide to addressing cybersecurity threats. Are you seeing that from clients because I know your business that looked at your earnings has been pretty resilient, but tough choices are being made?",

And ofcourse, it's not a great thing for the economy. And again, I'm trying to stay away from getting into politics. So I'm not going to say any opinion about what's going on in politics. But demonstration in the street does have an effect on everybody's mood, and that has the effect on the economy. For a company like Checkpoint, it hasn't affected our business much. But for small startups and big part of the Israeli industry is made of startups, it's becoming tougher and tougher to raise money and to be in business. So that has a toll on the economy. But on the same time, I just don't want to be too pessimistic. I think Israel is a very good country. We like our country. I think there's plenty of top talent here in high tech. The people are super committed to their work to their mission in technology, whether it's in cyber or in ASIC design or in gaming or in web systems. We have amazing industry here and amazing people that work hard. So I definitely hope and I'm optimistic.

It's a challenge mainly, by the way to Israel as a country less to the industry less to our customers, becauselet's remember all the Israeli companies we operate in the global market, our target market is outside Israel. It's mainly the U.S., but it's all over the world. So even for a company that's large like Checkpoint, 98 percent of our business is outside Israel. And vendors -- the question, do you want to be registered and listed as an Israeli company or as an American company? Regardless of the question, if you're using Israeli talent, as your backbone of development. Now, for the customer, it has less effect. For Israel, it has a big effect, because if the company is registered in Israel, it will pay taxes in Israel, it will do more supporting functions in Israel. And not just the developers will be here, but also the lawyers, and the accountant and more sales and marketing functions will be in Israel. So for the Israeli economy, it is important that we will be Israeli companies more and more Israelis, we've worked for many years to change that perception and to make it for investors. And remember also where investments are coming mainly from overseas. So investors felt pretty well in the last decade or a decade and a half to start companies in Israel. And we hope it doesn't change because you know, for the investor, it's easier to say just list the company in Delaware like I'm used to and then we'll have some longer term.",
