Plus, he helped Trump win Pennsylvania and got the Amish to vote. But few people know who Scott Presler is, and he's fascinating. Why he's the secret weapon that many Republicans are choosing to keep at arms length. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news under attack. Killer drones. As we speak, striking Ukraine's capital of Kyiv at this hour. The mayor of Kyiv says Iranian made drones used by Russia are swarming the city from all directions. And that situation right now is quickly escalating. A top NATO military official tonight warning companies across the U.S. and Europe that they need to prepare for a quote wartime scenario. And \"Reuters\" tonight is reporting that the German government is now expanding a list of bunkers that can be used as emergency shelters. The German government, Germany, talking about emergency bomb shelters. They have plans, they say, to convert basements underground garages and subway stations into possible shelters. I remember days before the bombs and missiles started landing in Ukraine, walking around looking at places and thinking, this is stuff from World War Two. Is this really serious? And then we all heard when those missiles started landing that night, and the world has changed. Now, you're hearing that from Germany tonight. Ukraine also upping the ante after nearly three years of fighting again striking deep inside Russia overnight. These images shared by the Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels allegedly what you're seeing on your screen showing a strike near a Russian airfield. Now, CNN has not been able to independently verify this video. This is all very new, as we are speaking Russia tonight, also on its side, taking precautions. Putin has been making it very clear what you're looking at here, that he's going to mass produce these nuclear resistant bomb shelters. And they've been putting these images out for everyone to see. In fact, Moscow is now producing four times as many weapons as the European union. That's according to the German defense minister. It's not a Russian propaganda estimate. It's the German defense minister, four times more for Russia versus the E.U. in entirety. And on Russia's state television tonight, they're bragging. Putin's allies are touting Russia's new hypersonic missiles actually showing simulations of the missiles hitting European capitals. Ukraine's former top general reportedly warning that World War Three has already begun. Oren Lieberman begins our coverage tonight OUTFRONT live at the Pentagon and Oren, the U.S. watching what's happening on the ground at this very hour in Ukraine extremely closely these masses of drones that they say are descending from all directions upon Kyiv.

It's not just a drone attack on Kyiv and other places tonight. We saw very similar large scale drone attack last night with the devastating Iranian Shahed drones.Ukraine said yesterday they intercepted 50 out of 73. That's an impressive number, but we have seen repeatedly how much damage devastation and frankly death, 23 drones, drones that get through Ukrainians -- Ukraine's defenses can cause. Now, Russia has kept this barrage up, partially because it's gotten help from Iran and North Korea in supplying its own military, and that has allowed them, as they push on the ground, to also attack in the air. Now, Ukraine certainly is not defenseless. And for the first time, John Kirby of the national security council acknowledged publicly that Ukraine has been able to use U.S. long range missiles ATACMS to attack deeper inside Russia. He also acknowledged these have been used in the Kursk region. We saw the first of those attacks with eight missiles of these ATACMS variety, according to U.S. officials used to attack ammunition depots and storage facilities inside of Kursk. The video you showed a moment ago that may be another use of the ATACMS missiles. We don't know that for sure yet, but Ukraine clearly focusing on that. [19:05:01] And because of the limited supply of these missiles, every use of them even in small quantities is absolutely worth noticing. It is this use of ATACMS missiles that Russia has used as an excuse to update its nuclear doctrine. Of course, the U.S. and the Pentagon are watching that closely, although they largely view that as more nuclear saber rattling. Still, it is a very dangerous moment, Erin. And that is what we and, of course, the Pentagon are tracking.",

The words peace or peace plan come from Trump supporters and those nominated for future positions in the upcoming administration, the Kremlin spokesman said today. The Russians, irate after the Biden administration allowed Ukraine to use longer distance U.S. and UK supplied missiles to strike deeper inside Russia.

And, of course, you know, the former president has enjoyed the help of the Supreme Court right, which took months to render a decision on immunity. And it eventually did give him broad immunity. You had Aileen Cannon, the judge in southern Florida who had this case, the classified documents case and eventually tossed it. And so, what today we saw from Jack Smith was essentially a surrender to the inevitable, right? One of the things that you read in his filing, I'll read just a part of it. It says the department's position is that the constitution requires that this case be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated. This outcome is not based on the merits or the strength of the case against the defendant. And what they're referring to here, Erin, is the fact that the Justice Department has a long standing rule that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted and it turns out that also applied to a president-elect. Now, if you read the filing, you'll also see that they say that they're asking for the judge, for the judges. In these two cases to dismiss without prejudice. Now, that raises the possibility that these cases could be revived when Trump is no longer president. Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled on at least that part of the case. I'll read you just a part of what she says, she says. Dismissal without prejudice is also consistent with the governments understanding that the immunity afforded to a sitting president is temporary, expiring when they leave office. So, Erin, you can bet the question will arise, you know, when Donald Trump becomes president, does his Justice Department just simply go back to the courts and say this time we mean it with prejudice and that means these cases are done and dead forever.",

MONDAIRE JONES (D), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE:  Look, I think that Donald Trump has been very clear that he's got a list of enemies and that Jack Smith, Dr. Fauci and many others are on that list. And it remains to be seen how serious he is about going after them. I think someone like a Matt Gaetz would have really pursued that at the Department of Justice. Let's see what Pam Bondi does if and when she's confirmed to lead the department. There are also obvious political ramifications for what happened today with these voluntary dismissals of these cases. First of all, it cements Merrick Garland's legacy as being the most ineffective attorney general of the United States in modern history because he waited so long to open these investigations such that we find ourselves at this point. But also, Donald Trump unfortunately, is speaking to folks who are not hearing the truth about these investigations. And so, this is going to strengthen his argument unfortunately, in their minds that these cases were the result of politics rather than the merits. And I do believe he would have been convicted in both of these matters the way he was convicted earlier this year in a separate matter. But this is -- this is a real problem, and it strengthens his hand when he says he wants to purge the Department of Justice of the deep state for example, which is something we know is a falsehood.
