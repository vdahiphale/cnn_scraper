And ifIsrael talks about that and moves toward endorsing that and embracing that, then they're willing to meet with the mediators afterwards. This sort of separate and sequential meetings is normal. But this is an indication that if Israel does what they would like it to do, then they're willing to engage; if not, the implication is they won't. And what they're looking for is that Israel is not going to put on the table demands that they can continue to control the border with Egypt. The Philadelphi corridor, which they control right now, that Israel will not demand that it will control the Rafah crossing. That's the principal border crossing into Egypt from Gaza, that there will be a right, a free, right of return for displaced people in Gaza, even to the north. Carrying with them whatever they want to carry, even if -- and this is what got was a sticking point last time -- its weapons. And they also want -- they also want to have a sort of full humanitarian rebuilding. If those points aren't met and additionally, the issue of Palestinian prisoner release, they don't want Israel to have a veto over who gets released. If those issues come up, this is what we understand, if those issues come up, then, for them, that's going to -- that's going to imply that Netanyahu isn't really about engaging and is just, what, in their words, essentially, talking, is essentially playing for time.",

They really do believe this is the linchpin to lowering tensions not only in Gaza but across the entire region. And of course, President Biden has made this sort of a central facet of his remaining months in office. Now that he's not running for president, his focus is very much in Gaza. It could unlock this broader normalization agreement that he's trying to pursue between Israel and Saudi Arabia. It's part of the reason that he has dispatched these very senior officials, Amos Hochstein, who you heard from in the lead-in there but also Brett McGurk to the region to try and come up with what they're calling a bridging proposal to help these two sides come to some kind of agreement and put aside their differences on Thursday in Doha.",

Look after the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, Iran vowing that it would respond and a senior Hezbollah commander killedthe day before in Beirut and Hezbollah vowing to respond and strike Israel. There was a real flurry of intense diplomatic activity to try to talk and get both Hezbollah and particularly Iran away from those kind of actions. There was put into play this diplomatic play to try to say to Iran, look, we'll get something positive out of ceasefire talks over Gaza. That will give you an opportunity to sort of save face and walk away, saying you're putting the Palestinians' welfare and well-being ahead of your own desire and as they say, right to respond to Israel. So that was out there. But I think as we got closer and closer to talks, the reality has been that the talks don't appear to be any different, so far, at least, than anything we've seen so far. And for that reason, the expectation behind the scenes is that this won't stop Iran striking back in Israel. What it may do is minimize the type of strikes, something that will be within the bounds of international sort of military conflict; i.e., not striking a civilian location and then incurring a massive response from Israel. But even though that's not clear. As far back as 24 hours ago now, diplomatic sources in the region were saying that there was a possibility that Iran could still take a maximalist position.",

But the other thing is really how much momentum there still really is. And you're absolutely right, there's a bunch of events that have happened today that really are remarkable, considering we are now on day eight of this incursion that is taking place. The Ukrainians, once again today saying that they are continuing to take territory and they are continuing to take Russian prisoners of war. Of course, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, he has said that the Ukrainians want to exchange those prisoners for Ukrainians who are being held in captivity by the Russians. The Ukrainians for their part are not showing any signs of wanting to slow down. They do say they are seeing resistance from the Russians, that the Russians are trying to push them back. But they also say that their forces are still advancing. I want to listen in to a little segment of a video call that happened between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his top general earlier today, let's have a look. It looks like we don't -- we don't have that sound bite there. But I'll paraphrase it for you. Essentially, what Oleksandr Syrskyi told the Ukrainian president is, he said that the Ukrainians had advanced about one to two kilometers just on this day alone. That's starting on Wednesday. And that they taken at least 100 Russians as prisoner just in the early hours of today. So the Ukrainians definitely still moving forward. The Russians saying they're repelling all that. One of the things that were seeing, Becky, again today is the Russians putting out video of their air force bombing Ukrainian positions. They showed a bombed out Ukrainian vehicle as well. But at the same time more evacuations on Russian territory and the Ukrainians saying they're moving forward. And also trying to help that move forward, also, with those attacks on those Russian airfields that you were talking about as well, Becky.",

And with less than three months to go until the presidential election, these numbers are surely going to be scrutinized by the candidates. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are both set to make economic pitches to voters this week. Trump gives a speech later today in North Carolina where he is expected to focus on economic achievements during his own presidency. Harris set to lay out her economic policies on Friday. So let's talk more about these numbers and the political impact. Julia Chatterley joins us, anchor of \"FIRST MOVE\" for her here on CNN, and Eva McKend covering the Harris campaign. I think, Julia, let me start with you, because we need to do a bit of a deep dive on what we've learned today from this data, because I want to talk about how these presidential candidates are likely to work with it this week.

And what we expect her to do is talk about eliminating taxes on tips for hospitality workers. That of course, getting a lot of attention and because that's something that president Trump also supports. She'll talk about her legacy of taking on price gouging. She was attorney general in California prior to becoming vice president, a senator as well. And that was a real area of focus for her. She'll talk about banning hidden fees and surprise late charges. And then maybe most consequentially, Becky, she'll talk about taking on corporate landlords by capping unfair rent increases. One of the consistent and persistent issues we hear from American voters is the high cost of living, the cost to buy a house but also the cost of rent. And so she has a plan that she's previewed. She talks about it on the campaign trail, to really aggressively go after these corporate landlords, buying up all of these properties and making it so difficult for Americans to buy and to rent.",
