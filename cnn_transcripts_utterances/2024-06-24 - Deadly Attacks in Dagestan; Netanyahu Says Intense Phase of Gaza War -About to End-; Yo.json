We're just three days away from CNN's U.S. Presidential Debate, the first major showdown between President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, this election cycle. And flash floods and mudslides forced tens of thousands of people in Southern China to leave their homes. We begin this hour with a series of shocking attacks on churches and synagogues in Southwestern Russia. Authorities in Dagestan province say at least 15 police officers and a priest were killed on Sunday in what appears to be coordinated attacks in two cities. But the total number of victims remains unclear. This video shows heavily armed law enforcement officers taking on gunmen at a Russian Orthodox church, Makhachkala. And this is the aftermath of an attack on a police traffic post in the same city, a synagogue there was also attacked. There were similar scenes in the city of Derbent. Authorities say a 66-year-old priest was killed during the assault on a church in the city. And Molotov cocktails were used in an attack on a synagogue there. No claim of responsibility so far, but officials told Russian News that the perpetrators were \"adherents of an international terrorist organization.\" Well, Dagestan is a predominantly Muslim province on the Caspian Sea. Three days of mourning have been declared. Well, our Senior International Correspondent Ivan Watson is here in Hong Kong with more. Ivan, this is a terrorism investigation that is now underway. What are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, the active part of the counterterror operation, according to authorities there in Dagestan, is over. And now, the officials say, they are conducting searches and investigations and looking for what they've described as possible sleeper cells.But, regardless, it was a bloody and, I think, very frightening evening and night in these two cities on the Caspian Sea, in the Russian Republic of Dagestan, with the authorities describing what appeared to have been a coordinated attack in two separate cities on places of worship, on Russian Orthodox churches, on synagogues, and on police posts with a pretty serious death toll among the Russian security forces and law enforcement of at least 15 police officers killed, including a senior police commander, it appears. The -- authorities say that at least six militants have been killed as well. There has been no claim of responsibility thus far. Among the things that took place during this frightening evening was that at least 19 churchgoers boarded themselves up in a church in Makhachkala, that's the capital of Dagestan. And they were eventually -- they eventually made it to safety. The officials there in Dagestan say that a 66-year-old Russian Orthodox priest in the City of Derbent was killed. His throat slit. And that priest described as somebody who was ill to begin with. So, now, we'll be learning, trying to find out what the results of this could be. There's already been a local lawmaker who has blamed the attack on Ukraine and on NATO. And what's fascinating is we've had the response coming from a Russian senator saying this is completely counterproductive if we blame every terror attack in Russia on the west. We have to acknowledge that this could be an internal matter. And of course, Russia does have a long and bloody history of acts of political violence and terrorism. Anna.",

      "sentences": "Sure. Dagestan is in the caucuses. It has historically been a pretty turbulent area. It has a Muslim majority, though there are small minorities of Christians and Jews there who appear to have been targeted in these attacks.Going back to the 1990s, you know, Chechnya, which neighbors Dagestan, was the place of a separatist uprising and just absolutely brutal conflicts between the Russian State and Chechen separatists. And that spilled over at times into Dagestan. So, there have been moments of tumult and violence there. I think most recently, if you go back to November, I believe it is, that's when a mob overran the airport in Makhachkala, claiming that a flight had come in from Tel Aviv, and that was in the early weeks of the war in Gaza and the Israeli-Palestinian -- the deadly violence there with sympathizers waving Palestinian flags and people were injured in that incident. If we go more recently, and we don't know whether or not there's any link to this, there was the terrible terror attack at a concert hall outside of Moscow, that's back in March, with more than 140 people killed and the concert hall burned. ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS, claimed responsibility for that. And ultimately, the Russian authorities detained, arrested a number of suspects that were all from Tajikistan in that case. We don't know if there's any link between that incident in March outside of Moscow and what's taken place here in Dagestan. It just goes to show that there is a long and deadly history of violence and terror that has taken place inside the Russian Federation, even as the Kremlin is waging this brutal war and occupation and invasion of neighboring Ukraine.

And remember, it's a Muslim area. It's very ethnically diverse. So, you do have a very old Jewish community there. You have Christians. But essentially, it's a Muslim area. There have been a lot of tensions, and those tensions have been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. We can get into that if you want. So, when the -- Russians right now are investigating this as a terrorist operation, and you know, that could turn out to be the case, but I would say, still, it's very complex and actually quite brutal.

It was a disinformation campaign locally, and there was a very big riot at the airport. So, you have that, you have -- previously, you have attacks on churches.

So, the -- whatever was going on, you know, you have -- you'd have to say, interreligious violence. And that is one thing I can tell you, that Vladimir Putin has been very, very worried about.Remember, during some of the -- back in the Syrian War, et cetera, some people from that region went to fight with ISIS and other organizations like that in Syria and in the Middle East, and then they came home.

I think there's a member of the Duma, essentially like a congressman from that region, who has blamed Ukraine and NATO.But then, there was another official, Dmitry Rogozin, who is quite well known. He's a senator, and he said, look, you know, if we blame everything on NATO and Ukraine, we're going to be in a fog and this will be very bad.

Russia says the Ukrainian fired missiles were supplied by the United States and blamed Washington for the attack. Witnesses say air raid sirens did not sound to warn of the attack. CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian military for comment. Meanwhile, Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine's second largest city has left another person dead and 10 others wounded.

The Saudi Arabian government says that more than 1,300 people died at this year's pilgrimage, at least in part due to the extreme heat.It says that almost half a million people received some form of medical attention, some are still hospitalized. It also says that all of the families of the 1,301 victims have been notified despite serious challenges in identifying all of the bodies. On Monday, the mercury hit almost 52 degrees Celsius, 125 degrees Fahrenheit. And what you have to remember is that almost everything at the Hajj is outdoors and it involves some physicality, walking some distances between or to some of the various sites. And pilgrims that we spoke to describe releasing two categories of pilgrims, one, the official kind, the kind that came with a Hajj visa that had proper transportation options and air-conditioned accommodations. And then you had this unregistered kind of pilgrim that maybe came on a tourist visa or a business visa to Saudi Arabia, didn't have proper transportation and didn't have access to proper accommodation. In fact, some people were setting up these makeshift tent encampments to try to get under any shade that they possibly could. And the Saudis say that some 83 percent of all of the pilgrims who died were in that latter category. Now, countries like Egypt are cracking down on tour companies that may have helped facilitate these unofficial travel routes. We have also heard from the daughter of an American couple who paid more than $20,000 to a travel company to attend this year's Hajj, only to find out that that company could not provide proper transportation. And she says that on the day that her parents died, they reported waiting several hours for transportation that never came. So, they ended up walking a long distance to one of the sites, they went missing, and were later confirmed dead. And then, to add insult to injury, she says that she had asked the Saudi government to hold the bodies for identification, but turns out they had already been buried. And now, her and her family are not sure where they were buried. Scott McLean, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I think the debates have been more consequential for the verdicts voters take from them about the personal capacity and character of the candidates, and I suspect that will be the key impact here again, with so many questions swirling in the electorate about the character of Trump and the capacity and capability of Biden.",

I think Biden will have a better chance of delivering a coherent argument to voters if he is not constantly interrupted by Trump the way he was in that first debate in 2020. But the fact that voters -- you know, that -- at least as I understand the way the technology is going to work, you know, whatever Trump does, voters are not going to hear and see him constantly trying to interrupt. Biden may also make it easier for Trump to have, you know, deliver a better impression. Because certainly that -- you know, that 2020 kind of performance did not really endear himself to anyone except his hardcore supporters. You know, there's one other interesting contrast, I think. In many ways, Trump wants to look back and Biden wants to look forward. Trump clearly wants to frame this campaign and certainly this debate as were you better off in my four years or his four years? You know, was life more affordable? Did the border seem more secure? Biden, I think, you know, has a hard time winning that argument, whether deservedly or not, most Americans will say they were better off when Trump was president. But that doesn't mean that most Americans are necessarily on board with the agenda that Trump has laid out for a second term, including ideas like mass deportation and tariffs that could make inflation worse. And so, Biden, in many ways, wants to get voters to focus on what Trump would do if returned to power. I think Trump wants to basically kind of imprint the argument that things were better than not when I was president. And if you re-elect me, they're going to be better again.",
