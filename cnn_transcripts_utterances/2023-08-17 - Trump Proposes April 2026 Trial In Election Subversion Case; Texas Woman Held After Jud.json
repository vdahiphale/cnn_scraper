The growing concerns about what might happen next.Also, he promised a big press conference just two days ago claiming he'd finally blow the lid off 2020 election fraud. More signs tonight he was, no surprise, just blowing smoke. And Hawaii with a thousand people still unaccounted for, a CNN investigation into why Maui's emergency sirens stayed deadly silent. Good evening. Thanks so much for joining us. We begin tonight with breaking news. The former president's attorneys have weighed in with what they want the trial date to be in the federal election subversion case, and it is a long way off. The Justice Department had proposed January of 2024. The former president's attorneys now say the trial should not start until April 2026, that's more than two-and-a-half years from now. And if Mr. Trump is elected president again, it's effectively never. The lawyers in their filings saying the Justice Department's proposed date denies them the ability to prepare for trial. Joining us now, CNN legal analyst and former Manhattan chief assistant district attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo. So Karen, what do you make of this proposed start date by the former president's attorneys?",

That's his number one pick and judges have gotten wind of that, and he did write a lot in this motion that, I think, 16-page motion that his lawyers submitted, where they talked about how much discovery, which is the documents that the government has to hand over, that there are so many and they even had a drawing in there, where they stack them up and showed if you were to stack them all, it's much higher than the Statue of Liberty and the Empire State Building, you know, trying to show it so much, we can't possibly be ready.But you know, at the same time, he also puts in there that we have so many other court cases, so I have to deal with those cases, so I can't do this one. But he's saying and all his court cases, I can't be ready on this one because I have the other one. And so he really doesn't want any of them to go and the judges will see that. And, you know, when you cry wolf, at a certain point, you know, because this is what he does in all his cases, I don't know that the judges are going to let them get away with it. And in the Mar-a-Lago case, he also indicated that there was so much, the discovery was so much that we can't possibly be ready, but then the government said yes, there's a large number, but so much of it are things like e-mail headers or things that are irrelevant, that really aren't the meat and potatoes and the government is handing over a roadmap to the discovery saying this is what's important, this is where you find it. So there's really no reason why one defendant four-count indictment can't be ready in January, when Jack Smith asked for January 2nd. This is not a two-and-a-half year case.",

So you can give them protection, for how long? How long can you dothat? The resources, the manpower that entails. Do they have the ability to do this? And then when the trial is over, then what happens? This stuff doesn't go away. And it's not just the physical security you're concerned with. It's the harassment, it is the cyberattacks. There are all of these other things that come into it, as well as their extended family and their lives.

It's why there are court officers and US Marshals.A juror, a grand juror, that does not come with the territory. They are citizens, independent citizens doing their civic duty, which is why under Title 16, I think it's Chapter 20 in the Georgia state law, you know, they have a very strong statute that says if you threaten or try and impede or try and intimidate a juror or a grand juror on account of a verdict or an indictment, that's a 20-year count with a $5,000.00 fine.

Before that, he served as the State Inspector General, and both a state and federal prosecutor after graduating from the University of Georgia law school in 2013. Classmates and professional acquaintances say he is politically conservative. Notably, McAfee was a state prosecutor in the complex trial division in Fulton County, which was led at the time by the woman who is now the Fulton County DA, Fani Willis. Esther Panitch is a democratic Georgia State Representative and defense lawyers handled two cases where McAfee was the prosecutor. ESTHER PANITCH (D), GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  In the cases I had with him, he made reasonable decisions related to pleas or discovery requests and he was fair. Politics never came into it. TUCHMAN (voice over):  University of Georgia record show he was the treasurer of the Law Republicans, a group that serves libertarian members of the law school community and provide support for Republican political candidates. He was also treasurer of the law school's Federalist Society, an influential conservative and libertarian organization in the US. Just a few months ago, he presided over a case involving L.
