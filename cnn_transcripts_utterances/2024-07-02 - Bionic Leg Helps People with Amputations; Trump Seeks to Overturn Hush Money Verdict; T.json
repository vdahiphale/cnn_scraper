And signals from the nervous system direct the leg's movements and the leg is able to sense its own positioning and send signals back to the persons nervous system. And in one study, John, people with amputated legs, who were equipped with this bionic leg, they underwent a specific type of surgery. Researchers found that the bionic leg was able to help increase their maximum walking speed by 41 percent. So, this helped people with amputated legs to walk more smoothly and more quickly using the bionic leg.And one woman in the study told CNN that she felt like she had no amputation at all. As soon as she was equipped with the bionic leg, she said she wanted to take off running. And that's the kind of impact this has on people, John. We know about 2 million people in the United States live with limb loss. So, even though this is just experimental now, it could have potential impact for millions of people out there.",

It delivered a significant legal win for Donald Trump. How far does that reach? Other very real questions this morning, how much power does a president really have? And what is and is not an official act?The answers there matter in many ways. In the most immediate, to the criminal charges that Donald Trump is facing. It also matters when it comes to the now core reelection message that President Biden is trying to capitalize on as his campaign remains in full on post-debate crisis mode. CNN's Paula Reid has the very latest. Let's start there. Paula, we have not yet really heard from the special counsel since the ruling. Do we know what his next steps are?",

The Supreme Court has deferred to her to suss out which actions alleged in Smith's indictment constitute official actions that are part of the core constitutional responsibilities of the president. Those would enjoy absolute immunity, likely not be able to be brought as part of this case. Then you have other actions that are official acts, but not necessarily something that's part of your core constitutional duty. So, those have a presumption of immunity, but that would likely have to be litigated. And then there's going to be other acts alleged in the indictment that fall outside of that, things that were not official acts.Then she's going to have to look at what is left of that indictment. And then we know from my sources on the Trump legal team that the Trump legal team is also going to try to get certain pieces of evidence tossed out. And they argue that what remains of that indictment will need to be supported by pieces of evidence that are also blocked by this opinion because the justices ruled that even evidence of official acts. So, official acts cannot be used as evidence to support charges. So, they believe that they can pretty much undermine this entire case, but that will take time. Now, they're also going to use yesterday's opinion to attack some of the other cases that Trump is facing down in Mar-a-Lago, the documents case. They're going to use this in part to argue that Trump had this classified documents as part of his official duties. They can use it to attack that case. Of course, down in Georgia, that's the most similar case to the January 6th case. Clearly, they're going to use it there. But as we broke this story yesterday morning, they're also going to use it in the next few months to attack the New York conviction. Specifically, they are going to try to get tossed out Hope Hicks' testimony, portions of that, as well as specific tweets that were used in evidence. Now, late last night they sort of sent out a long-shot bid to try to delay his sentencing based on this. Unclear if that's going to be successful. But as we've been reporting, they are going to use this opinion to try to get that conviction overturned on appeal. That is also a process, though, Kate, that takes a long time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He has been calling for retribution for several months now and really made it a big part of his campaign. However, in light of the Supreme Court's decision, especially saying that, you know, presidents have absolute immunity for official acts, it has called into question whether or not if Donald Trump were to seek retribution as a president, what that would mean and if he could face any blowback for it. Now, we did here Donald Trump yesterday speaking to a local radio station in Virginia criticizing Steve Bannon, his former aide, for going to federal prison for contempt of Congress. And he said Biden is going to pay a big price for it. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What they've done in this century is unthinkable.

Re-Truth if you want military tribunals.\"Now, we did hear from Cheney herself, the former congresswoman. She wrote that, \"this is the type of thing that demonstrates yet again that you are not a stable adult and are not fit for office.\" We also saw Donald Trump share a different post calling for the jailing of President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, his former vice president, Mike Pence. Again, all very troubling posts that I think it's hard with Donald Trump. We know that a lot of people kind of take this as just kind of language he uses, rhetoric he uses. However, many of his strongest and fiercest supporters do read these posts and take them in some ways as marching orders. Now, we also heard from President Joe Biden at the White House yesterday denouncing this type of language, as well as criticizing the Supreme Court's decision on immunity. And he's also made this central to his campaign. But again, I really do think that all of this is getting heightened attention after that decision, particularly with many critics, worried about whether or not Donald Trump is emboldened by this decision and may further seek retribution if he is elected.

That eye still so clear, so organized, so symmetrical.We need to see, though, if it can get racked a little bit to bring down this intensity. The reason why it got so intense in the first place, rapidly intensifying more than once, is because these ocean temperatures are in the middle and upper 80s. This is more typical for late August or early September, which is the peak of hurricane season. That's why we have never really had a storm this strong, this early. As it continues its trek east, it will run into some dust and some wind shear, which could level off some of that intensity, but it still heads towards Jamaica as maybe a category three or a category four hurricane. Hurricane force wind - hurricane-force winds expected with hurricane warnings in effect for Jamaica, a watch for the Cayman Islands.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Well, the defense attorney, the lead attorney, Alan Jackson, said yesterday they will not quit. They will never quit, the defense. And the fact is that the lead investigator for this case, Massachusetts State Police, Michael Proctor, has been under internal investigation for quite a while now in regard to a personal texts chain that he had with some old high school friends on his personal phone during the investigation where he said vile things about the defendant, Karen Read.We also know that the U.S. attorney's office for the District of Massachusetts is in the middle of an investigation of the arrest of Karen Read and also the investigation. But nonetheless, the prosecution for weeks put on direct evidence. And here are some examples. The first responders that went to the scene when the body of John O'Keefe was found, it was covered with snow. There had been a blizzard that night in January of 2022. Karen Read was there at the scene. And the invest - and the first responders testified that she kept saying, I hit him, I hit him, I hit him. A few hours after that, investigators came to the front lawn of that home where there had been a party in that night with police officers and their wives, and they started finding pieces of taillight, red pieces, clear pieces, close to a shoe, which was John O'Keefe's shoe that was flush with the curb out near the street. Now, the prosecution is saying that she hit him. And the forensics showed that she put the car in reverse after letting him off for this after-party at this house, and that she was going, forensics experts said, 24 miles an hour and she drove backwards for 62.5 feet. Prosecutors say she hit him. He went down. And that's how he lay in the snow as the blizzard began and died. But the defense is saying, no, not at all. He went into that house. And a fight began with his friends, off duty police officers, but he was hit. He was mauled by a German shepherd. And people in that house threw his body out in the snow. And it lay there as that blizzard kept accumulating through the night. But there will be another trial. Prosecutors have vowed. I think we've got some footage though because this was amazing. The support for Karen Read during this two month trial was amazing. Listen to their reaction when there was announced a mistrial. (VIDEO CLIP)",
