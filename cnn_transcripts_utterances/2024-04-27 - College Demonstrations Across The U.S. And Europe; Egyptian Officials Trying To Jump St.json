The University of Illinois is warning of consequences if demonstrators don't leave an encampment there. Well, that follows a day of mostly peaceful protests across the country.But about 40 people were arrested in Denver after they tried to set up an encampment at the joint campus of three universities. In the U.K., students gathered outside University College London to protest the school's ties to Israeli academic institutions. Another group of students staged a pro-Palestinian protest in Warwick in central England. Well, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the protests anti-Semitic and said they should be stopped. In an interview with CNN, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken was asked if he agreed. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Protests in and of themselves are not anti-Semitic. There are protesters and there are also activists who may have other agendas, who clearly are engaged in rhetoric. That is. But what we're also seeing is people, young people, people from different walks of life, who do feel very passionately, who've had very strong emotions about this anger. And I understand. I understand that. But we've certainly seen instances where that has clearly veered from a totally legitimate expression of views and beliefs to, in some instances, yes, clear expressions of anti-Semitism. When you hear some people chanting and supporting Hamas, what, what in the world does that mean? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They also tried to show how Pecker had other reasons beyond just helping Trump win the White House for running negative stories about Trump's opponents. Pecker testified that his magazine ran stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton prior to the 2015 Trump Tower meeting, where an agreement to help Trump was allegedly breached. Running those stories was beneficial to AMI, Pecker testified. After his testimony wrapped up, prosecutors used the last few hours of the day to call two additional witnesses.
