We are just hours away from an unprecedented moment in American history, the first ever criminal trial of a former president.Tomorrow, opening statements in Donald Trump's New York hush money case are set to begin after an appeals court judge denied Trump's latest motion to delay the proceedings. And now the jury is ready to decide Trump's fate. There are 12 jurors and six alternates. They were sworn in following a dramatic day of jury selection. Let's get straight to CNN's Marshall Cohen who joins me here on set. So, Marshall, this is a big day for the country, a big day in history. A lot of it, this will all be happening behind closed doors with no cameras in the courtroom. But what can we expect? MARSHALL COHEN, CNN Reporter:  We won't see anything. We won't hear anything. We'll be totally reliant on our colleagues in the room. They can provide real time updates in writing and sketches, of course. Look, it's been a long time coming. Here we are. Donald Trump faces 34 felony counts. These are state charges. He can't pardon himself if he is ultimately convicted. And the theory of the case is falsification of business records. It's all about that hush money payment to Stormy Daniels, how they use the ledger of the Trump organization to funnel that money to Michael Cohen after the fact. And the prosecutors say that it was essentially a cover up cooking the books.",

See you in just a little bit.Let's talk more about this unprecedented moment with CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen and Michael Moore, a former U.S. attorney. Thank you both for joining us on the eve of this incredible moment. Norm, I want to start with you. You've been up against Donald Trump before.

You know, this opening statement is really a time to connect with the jury. And what you don't want to do as a lawyer is over promise or oversell your case, because at the end of the day, that gives the other side the chance to say, well, Mr. Smith told you he could prove this, but he's not done that. So, I really think they'll be trying to bait the trap a little bit to keep the jurors interested. I think they'll try to give a roadmap for what their evidence will be. And they may talk some about some expected defenses that they may hear or are expected to hear, at least from witnesses for the defense, if in fact they put on witnesses. So, it's not going to be -- it's not evidence. Juries are told this is not evidence, but they do listen to it to try to have some relationship, I think, with the lawyers. And it's a good tool for a lawyer to try to develop that relationship early on so that as things happen in the trial, that jury looks to that lawyer because they trust him or her moving forward.",

There has been public reporting that it will be David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer. That's who I would call when I was preparing last week.That's the first witness I would call. Because coming out of those opening statements where you say what you will prove, you've got to grab that jury by the lapels. The way they are going to prove this case is to say there was an agreement to make these payments to influence the election. How do we know that? Because starting in Trump Tower in 2015, Michael Cohen, Donald Trump and David Pecker at the National Enquirer agreed to a catch and kill scheme. And when the Stormy -- to influence the election, to avoid bad stories. And when the Stormy Daniels thing came along in October 2016, it was just another step in that the unfolding of that agreement.

This is what they do every day. Lawyers forget that we may be comfortable in a courtroom that jurors are not. And certainly, when they're under this type of pressure in this type of case. I mean, you'd have to do much to realize the import of the case that they were going to be hearing, especially when they're talking about weeks of trial going forward. So, if somebody starts putting out, you know, addresses, if they start revealing identities, if there are things that they can point to in social media, those are the kind of things that I think the judge may, in fact, say, look, you know, just to keep the trial clean, we're going to sequester the jury. He has seemed to be averse to doing that. And I think that's smart, frankly, in this kind of case thus far. But if things get too out of hand, he certainly has that option. [17:09:59]",

He's standing there coming out of court every day saying the most outrageous, inaccurate and false things just a few feet away from where we reporters and analysts are sitting and watching.So, I think it's extremely perilous that Donald Trump makes his own case worse, compromises himself in front of the jury. That's in the liability phase. That's in terms of held guilty or not. But then there's a sentencing that will come after that if he is held guilty. And the one thing judges hate more than anything else is when a defendant gets on the stand and lies to them and their juries. So, it considerably worsens his peril at sentencing, which I think is already significant. I have a piece in \"The New York Times\" today saying he could face a risk of getting a jail sentence here.

Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. How are you now feeling after voting on these foreign aid packages yesterday? You voted in favor of funding for Ukraine in the Indo-Pacific, but against the Israel funding. REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D-CA):  Well, I am very, very pleased about the Ukraine funding. This is a long, long time coming. The president six months ago asked that that money be made available for Ukraine, and the dithering that went on with Speaker Johnson and the Republicans was almost tragic for the success of the Ukraine. Now, going forward, as you just heard, it's not only the munitions, but it is the psychological support that comes from this particular funding source. Now, the package had four different elements. Three of those four elements, Ukraine, Taiwan, the Pacific, as well as dealing with Russian assets and TikTok, I voted for those. I did not vote for the assistance for Israel because of the way in which Israel has been conducting the war in Gaza. I fully support Israel; I think they have a right to defend themselves. But we've had 34,000 people killed -- Palestinians killed in Gaza, half of which are children. And there's no indication that Netanyahu will change his tactics. So going forward, I am very, very happy that the Senate will take up this bill on Tuesday and hopefully the president will sign it immediately thereafter.

And he also said that it is his goal to reestablish the power of the Soviet Union. In other words, the Warsaw Pact. Well, thank you, Speaker Johnson, that finally you understood what is happening.

So, I want to go by the FBI numbers because various groups sometimes lumped in a lot of other behavior. But the FBI numbers show us that and how we -- the United States government defines antisemitic hate crimes three times greater, as you said.

I mean, that this is -- you have a group of students and within that group, a percentage is discussing it is hostile, has hatred. No one is defending that. The university needs all of you. I want to step to take a step back here because we're entering graduation season. All universities need proper engagement with student organizations about what is considered safe and unsafe protests. They need to get stronger on access controls to these colleges and universities and set the rules of appropriate conduct where there are legitimate disagreements about a very difficult issue in the Middle East. And that -- that's not rock science. We can do this now. But the idea that -- that -- that we're just going to throw up our hands and say all Jewish kids leave Columbia, it was -- it's not fair.

She's taking on issues the Democrats believe will play front and center with voters when they head to the polls in November.We're joined now by CNN senior reporter Isaac Dovere to discuss Harris's rough start earlier on at the White House, but now kind of hitting her stride on the campaign trail. You've been out there on the campaign trail. You have new reporting. What have you -- what have you been hearing and seeing? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Well, look, I was in Arizona and California and Nevada with her in the last couple of days, and what you see out of Harris is a much looser, more directed, more energized in the way of going about things. She is very clearly relishing, going like the old prosecutor taking on Donald Trump, making the case directly against him. For example, it was her idea to start talking about how Trump was directly responsible for the Arizona abortion ban being upheld, that that's the law there, her putting the blame directly on him, calling that and other Trump abortion bans. You see this very different mode out of her. And when I asked her about it, we were sitting down in Las Vegas on Monday, she said, indeed, that being out on the campaign trail, she finds it very liberating. That's how she feels about it, that it's getting out there and talking to people, but just being out in the mix in a way that is really different from what her first couple of years on the job have been.",

She says now, you know, I like facts, I was a prosecutor, I want to -- let's talk about the facts, let's talk about the logic of how these things happen here. That's what she said to me in the interview.But the other thing here that is going on is that she feels like there is this goal now that she has and it makes it easier to think about things. Remember, the vice presidency has been a tough fit for her in some ways because it is this amorphous role. What is the vice president? The job doesn't really require anything other than waking up every morning and making sure that the president is still able to do his job. Well, she has done that. But fitting in the other ways, it has been a little bit tougher.
