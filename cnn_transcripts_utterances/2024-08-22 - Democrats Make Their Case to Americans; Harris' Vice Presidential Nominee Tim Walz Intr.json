Certainly there were discussions and remarks about national security interspersed throughout the other things the former president talked about, but he made abundantly clear that he is frustrated by the internal conversations his advisers are trying to stress to him not to make it personal. Not to attack Kamala Harris by name, trying to basically keep him in control, as one advisor was telling me earlier this week.He will be able to test that out again on Thursday and Friday, going to Arizona and Nevada, obviously two other critical swing states. What the campaign is also working towards, though, right now, a potential endorsement from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's currently under discussion. It's potentially happening on Friday in Arizona. Both candidates will be there then. That would be a very consequential moment for the campaign and for the former president, perhaps more so than anything he does in any of these swing states over the course of the coming days. Phil Mattingly, CNN, Asheboro, North Carolina. (END VIDEOTAPE) MACFARLANE: Well, Richard Johnson is a lecturer in U.S. politics at Queen Mary University of London. He joins me live from Oxford, England. Thank you so much for your time. Let's talk about Wednesday night because it felt like a lot of the focus really was on Tim Walz. And this was his -- this was his moment to shine. This was who we really found out, you know, who he was. And it was in many respects his pep talk to America. I think what we learned is that he is this kind of every man, you know, a former high school teacher, a former football coach. But what did you make of his performance and what did it say about his capacity for serious politics? RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON: Well, Tim Walz was not a well-known figure before Kamala Harris chose him as her VP nominee. And that's in contrast to even say when Kamala Harris was chosen by Joe Biden, because Harris had ran for the Democratic nomination in 2019, which really elevated her national profile. And, of course, Joe Biden himself, when Barack Obama chose him, was a very well-known figure himself, having run for president two times by that point before, and a senator for many years. Walz, of course, was a congressman and a governor, but was not someone who really broke through in the national consciousness. So this was his opportunity to explain who he was, to explain his values. And as you said, really to emphasize that he's coming from the Great Plains, the upper Midwest, that he has this kind of blue collar appeal, that he was a high school social studies teacher, a coach. And, you know, the reason why or one of the reasons why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz was because this was meant to be the appeal from Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance. But Vance, a senator from Ohio, has a more complicated story. Yes, he grew up in poverty, but then he went to Yale Law School, worked in finance with some very, very wealthy people. And his kind of trajectory in life doesn't -- isn't as familiar. And Vance has also said certain things that sort of don't chime very well with those kind of family values that Walz is really seizing. And I thought the images of his wife and his two children last night were very touching, where they were really visibly moved by seeing their father on the stage. So I think she's done a wonderful job in choosing him to put that contrast against J.D. Vance and to go squarely for those Midwestern voters who prove so pivotal in the election.",

We've been told it's very, very difficult.Of course, you've got to remember this is a 56-meter luxury yacht. It's got little rooms. It's got sleeping suites. And it's a debris field. You know, we were told after the first time they went down on Monday, this is the fourth day they've been searching, that they were met with just a sort of swarm of electrical cables and things that were just loose in the ship. So, of course, that's going to be difficult. Yesterday, they were able to find two people at a time and another two people at a time. They had identified where this fifth body was, and this morning they weren't even out there an hour before they brought it back in. Now they're out there again searching for the sixth and final missing person. All the while this is going on, of course, there is a criminal investigation into the circumstances around why this luxury yacht went down in this sudden storm. There were other boats out there at the same time that seemed to be just fine. So they're looking at that. We know that they interviewed the captain for about two hours yesterday. They've talked to almost all of the survivors. Of course, the one-year-old baby girl, who was a survivor as well, wouldn't count in that. But her mother, who, you know, miraculously was able to save her from the waves. All of those survivors are staying at a hotel that's looking out at the area here where they're searching for the sixth and final victim. After that, they'll have to bring this luxury yacht to shore, and the investigation will continue on.",

The Defense Secretary ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln and it's assigned destroyer ships to move there earlier this month.Iran has vowed to retaliate for the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility, but Israel's U.N. mission says the response must be carefully calibrated to avoid derailing the Gaza ceasefire talks. Mediators are still trying to push for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with more talks expected in Cairo this weekend. The White House says President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke in a phone conversation Wednesday on the ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region. Vice President Kamala Harris also joined the call. A key sticking point in the negotiations is the Philadelphi corridor along the Egypt-Gaza border, which Israel forces seized in May. And an overnight Israeli strike on a house in northern Gaza killed 12 people, including six children, among them 16-month-old twins. That's according to the director of a local hospital. The Israeli military says they're looking into the incident. Meantime, Gaza officials say two people were killed and 15 wounded, ten of them children, in an Israeli airstrike on a school in central Gaza on Wednesday. The IDF claims Hamas was using the school as a command center, but did not provide any evidence.

Everyone's waiting, at least the U.S. side, the Israeli side, is waiting for Hamas to make a commitment to the U.S. bridging proposals. But it doesn't seem that that's coming.Everything that they've said so far indicates that they object to it. We haven't heard officially from them yet that they've outrightly objected to it, but that appears to be the expectation at the moment. And part of the thrust that we heard of the conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that took place last night really appears to indicate the president is really pressuring the Israeli prime minister with the importance of getting these negotiations done. And in that conversation we're told they talked about, you know, an expected peace talks over this weekend. Again, the indications in this region are that those expected peace talks over this weekend may not happen. And in a sign of how much Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sort of digging in on his position on the Philadelphi corridor, that border between Gaza and Egypt, that Egypt -- that rather Israel took control of in May. The prime minister is insisting, despite rumors -- or despite reports in some Israeli media, and specifically because of those reports, saying that those reports are not true, Israel does not plan to pull out of that corridor at all. So again, this is a very contentious issue. It seems to be at a variance with what U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken thought the prime minister had agreed to. And as you were just mentioning, in Gaza yesterday, strikes on a U.N. school where people thought they had safe haven, they were killed there, 15 people killed. And overnight in the north of Gaza, there was another strike, 12 people killed in Beit Lahiya, that's right in the very north of Gaza. Six of those 12 were children, two of them 16-month-old twins, and the hospital they were taken to there. The doctors said they're really running out of equipment, that they need to treat casualties there. So the situation in Gaza, as desperate as ever. And on Israel's northern border, the concerns mount because Israel has been having some strikes deeper into Lebanon, hitting Hezbollah ammunition dumps, which are obviously high-value targets for Hezbollah. And some distance from the border, Hezbollah yesterday striking Katzrin, which is quite some way deep into northern Israel in the Golan, destroying houses there. So it seems on that northern border, the tempo is picking up again. It may not mean that it's going to explode into a massive escalation, but of course, with the ceasefire talks not going anywhere, it just adds to the growing tension.",
