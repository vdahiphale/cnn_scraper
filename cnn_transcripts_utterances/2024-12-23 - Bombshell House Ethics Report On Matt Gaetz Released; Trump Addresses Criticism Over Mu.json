The report that former U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz never wanted to see the light of day is finally released to the public and includes just alarming findings about the man president elect Donald Trump initially chose to head the Justice Department. The 37-page report from the House Ethics Committee, which is a bipartisan committee, by the way, says it has found, quote, substantial evidence that Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape and illicit drug use. One of the most damaging findings, evidence that Gaetz paid a 17 year old girl for sex in 2017. Gaetz, who resigned from Congress and withdrew his nomination for attorney general last month, is fighting back against the charges via social media. He had made a last ditch effort in federal court Monday to block the release of the report. Katelyn Polantz joins me now from Washington. And, Katelyn, one of the most things from this report are the text messages from the women involved, detailing Gaetz's behavior.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Jim. There are text messages that the committee obtained and that they document in this report that show that Representative Gaetz was asking for women to bring drugs to him. And in all, the committee says that they found at least 20 times between the years of 2017 and 2020, all years when Matt Gaetz was a member of congress, where he was meeting with women who were being paid either with the expectation that he would be having sex with them or for drugs, all of that put together in this House ethics report, where the House says they believe that Matt Gaetz engaged in commercial sex, meaning paying for sex with women, statutory rape that is specifically related to the incident in 2017 at a party that summer where he had sex twice, allegedly with a woman who at the time was an underage girl, 17 years old, heading into her senior year of high school.The House believes that may be a violation of Florida law, though Gaetz has not been charged with any crime. The Justice Department looked at some charges on the federal side, declined to bring any case against him. The House also say that they also say in this report they believe Matt Gaetz was using illicit drugs. And so they have compiled this all, not just in a narrative of what they found, documenting the evidence, the text messages, the payments that the House has been able to trace, but also testimony they received from more than a half dozen people, and that woman who was an underage girl, having sex with him when she was 17. They have all of that together. They also have put out the evidence in the report released today that Matt Gaetz has been unable to stop. He wanted to stop the release of that report. It did not happen.",

When the House looked at it, they found that the federal sex trafficking code, it's about having -- moving people across borders who would be underage.And in the instance where Matt Gaetz was traveling with women who were receiving some sort of reimbursement and having sex with him repeatedly, that was a trip he was taking to the Bahamas with women who were of age adults. And so that's why they found there was not a violation of federal sex trafficking charges. The Justice Department did not provide much information at all to the House committee, and it comes out in the report how frustrated the House committee was with the Justice Department not being able to get their evidence, having to recreate it on their own. And so, all we know is that the Justice Department is not charging. Gaetz did not find enough there to bring any charges in court, and, of course, would be very unlikely to pick it up again with Donald Trump coming into the presidency, given that he was being investigated at the end of the previous Trump presidency and then into the Biden administration.",

If you put them all together, basically, the party would have to simply disintegrate and reform as something else, which is ridiculous because it was extremely close in the House. The Democrats actually did better than most observers expected in the senate, because there were nearly three other seats lost. And given the margin that Trump had in some of the swing states, it's a surprise that Republicans didn't get a bigger margin.And even for president, I agree with you completely. He -- Trump swept the swing states and carried the popular vote, which few really expected, even some in his own camp. However, it's still a very close margin. And Joe Biden refused to step aside for so long and should never have run for reelection in his physical condition. We all see that now. And Kamala Harris had 107 days, and we can go all through it. The one thing I'd cite, though, Jim, if they focus on nothing else, they need to focus on the working class, on what we used to call blue collar workers or union workers, because they were the heart of the Democratic Party. When I was growing up for decades and now pretty overwhelmingly, at least for the whites in those categories, they've been voting for Donald Trump.

And, you know, the counter to that is, is that going to affect his ability to get a fair trial?I think when you then balance that against the fact that, a picture of her client allegedly holding a silencer at the end of a pistol and shooting a man who is the father of two in the back, coupled with a picture of his smiling face at a youth hostel where he's checking in, could be determined to be far more prejudicial than a shot of him walking in the custody of law enforcement.

Lively has filed a civil complaint against Justin Baldoni, who also directed the movie. It ends with us. In the film, they play a couple haunted by the cycle of domestic abuse.Lively's complaint says Baldoni, created a hostile workplace on the set. She also then accuses him of trying to destroy her reputation. He denies those allegations. Elizabeth Wagmeister is here with more. And, Elizabeth, when you go into the details of what Lively describes here, she describes sexual harassment, violating her physical boundaries, and then after the fact, reputational retaliation -- I just wonder what the details are of that, if you could explain them and how Baldoni explains all this.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. So this is a lengthy and incredibly detailed complaint, Jim. So, as you said, there are different allegations. First, there are the allegations of sexual harassment and a hostile, unsafe working environment that Blake Lively alleges that she was subjected to. She says that Justin Baldoni not just as her costar, but as the director of the film, and it was his production company that was behind this film and acquired the rights to the book to make this film.She says that he made numerous inappropriate sexual comments to her, and that he and another male producer who are named in this complaint, entered her trailer uninvited many times, sometimes while she was undressed and another time while she was breastfeeding her newborn child. So that's the piece of the allegations of sexual harassment. Then the other big piece here is, she says, because she raised these issues and these concerns in an effort to achieve a safer work environment for herself and her employees, that then she was retaliated against. And you ask about the details and the proof. Well, in this lawsuit, there are hundreds of screenshots of text messages between Justin Baldoni's team, which Blake Lively's team says proves that they had a sophisticated and coordinated campaign to essentially take her down behind the scenes. Now, Baldoni's team is fiercely denying this. They are saying that it is completely normal for publicists to have private communications behind the scenes, and they say the reason why they even hired a crisis management firm is because they allege that Blake Lively's team was planting negative stories about him. So his team has denied this. And one last point. I do want to make, Jim. Over the weekend, I confirmed with the source that Baldoni has now been dropped by his talent agency, WME, which is one of the biggest agencies in the entertainment business and also represents Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds.",
