How does that even work in application? Imagine the hypothetical of a black student athlete, a black student child of a donor, or a black student legacy to a university puts in an essay, this is how my blackness has affected me. The university has that and might make a decision on that basis or might not, but are they now subject to being sued for consideration of that student's race? And so, certainly the court has ruled in a clear voice that racial preferences have to end.

The question is whether those efforts on the Republican side will prompt people in the middle, Independents and Democrats, to say, wait a second, this is going too far. That will be dependent on how much the Democratic Party wants to wrap their arms around this issue. We'll see whether they're able to do that.But I don't think it will be solely on the basis of affirmative action, but it'll be about what comes next, which is not just affirmative action, but all kinds of other forms of diversity in public life and how we address civil rights issues in 2023.",

But what's new tonight is evidence that this prominent Russian commander may be much closer to the Wagner mercenaries than previously known.(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) CHANCE (voice-over): This is the last time we saw General Surovikin on Saturday looking nervous, imploring Wagner mercenaries to end their brief rebellion. SERGEY SUROVIKIN, COMMANDER OF THE RUSSIAN AIR FORCE (through translator): We had victories together. We are the same. But you must do this before it's too late. CHANCE (voice-over): There was clearly pressure for his words to make a difference. It's well known that Surovikin, nicknamed General Armageddon for his ruthless tactics bombing cities in Syria, was very close to Wagner. But just how close is only now becoming clear. Documents shared exclusively with CNN suggest he was, since 2018, a secret VIP member of the group with a personal Wagner registration number. The documents obtained by the Russian investigative Dossier Center list Surovikin, along with at least 30 other senior Russian military and intelligence officials the Dossier Center says are also VIP Wagner members. Wagner hasn't answered CNN's request for a response. It's unclear what VIP membership entails, like, if there's any financial benefit, but it does imply an overly close relationship between the Russian military and the mercenaries, they failed to prevent from staging a military uprising at the weekend, even allowing Wagner fighters to take over an entire Russian city with virtually no resistance. It all raises suspicions in the Kremlin of divided loyalty. But General Surovikin, whose whereabouts remain unknown, he's one of Russia's most capable, highly decorated commanders.

GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Wolf, you know what that tells me is that there's this -- what we've suspected all along, this cancer of corruption within -- minimally within the ministry of defense, but clearly throughout all those elements of governance within the Russian Federation. I mean, how can a professional soldier, a professional soldier also have a relationship, obviously a fiduciary relationship with a paramilitary group? If nothing else, it talks about really lousy trade craft. I mean, if you're going to try to have a secretive relationship, don't sign up for a membership card, which is exactly what he did. It really speaks to the fragility, as Nick Paton Walsh just indicated, the real fragility within the ministry of defense in terms of what other heads are going to fall, who truly is in charge, and who's going to step up in order to advance what Russia sees as a legitimate effort on their part in Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "Well, that was ultimately, I think, what was in the background as we saw this sort of extraordinary lack of military and political opposition to Prigozhin as he marched on the weekend up towards Moscow. I think most people interpreted that as perhaps the Kremlin simply not being sure that if they really went for Prigozhin and his men that they had the strength to take them on, but also, too, that they might actually find that essentially improve their position because they would be asking the Russian military to turn on Wagner, who'd done so much of the fierce fighting on the Ukrainian front line, very brutal as they are over the past year or so. So, enormous question, frankly, as to what this residual support potentially for both men may be within the military. Surovikin was a man who was respected, I think it's fair to say, inside the military in many of Russia's key battlefields, including Syria over the past years. And Prigozhin, despite being, I think it's fair to say, pretty mouthy, pretty bombastic, certainly too led a group which held Bakhmut, fought for Bakhmut.And so I think ultimately, what Putin is left dealing with now is a military that's divided, a military that may be questioning quite what his motivations are, and a military, too, that may be looking at some of their top brass like Surovikin, people like Prigozhin and seeing them possibly being persecuted. Prigozhin almost certainly and wondering what that says about Putin's own motivation. Remember, he chose to fight this war, an invasion of choice. It's gone pretty catastrophically wrong and tens of thousands of Russians have lost their lives. That's going to be making a mark on the personal lives of many Russian families. And so, I think we're at an inflection point, certainly in the days ahead to see quite how this plays out. So Russian -- Putin's grip on the military, on the Kremlin, and that, of course, here in Ukraine is what they are relishing what they're waiting for, and may explain why we haven't seen a sudden surge in Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. They're just watching this play out because each day it seems that the military are turning on each other rather than fighting harder here. Wolf.",

And he said to CNN when we asked him about this quote, I've been informed that my security clearance is under review. I have not been provided any further information, but I expect the investigation to be resolved favorably and soon. In the meantime, I am on leave. And we also heard from State Department spokesperson Matt Miller saying that Rob Malley is on leave and Abram Paley is serving as acting Special Envoy for Iran and leading the department's work in this area. Now, Wolf, it's significant to note that this information was not widely shared within the department. When you talk to folks here, there weren't many who knew that Rob Malley's security clearance had been suspended. Folks thought that there had been personal reasons for him being on leave. But when it comes to U.S.-Iran relations, he was the lead official when it came to trying to put controls on the Iran nuclear program. That is now a portfolio that has been handed over to Brett McGurk, a senior official at the National Security Council, because, of course, that involves handling classified material. And then the other portfolio, of course, is trying to secure the release of Americans who are wrongfully detained in Iran. Our understanding is that, of course, Rob Malley had been the lead on that, but he is still somewhat involved in that portfolio. According to sources familiar with the matter, he has actually talked to some of the families of Americans who are wrongfully detained in Iran as recently as this week. Now, he has been placed on leave. We're told that just this afternoon he was placed on unpaid leave from the department. So we'll continue to track where this goes and which other officials, of course, step up to try and make sure that both of these portfolios are widely covered for those Americans who are wrongfully detained in Iran. And of course, when it comes to putting controls on Iran's nuclear program, Wolf?",

He had previously led Russian forces in Syria. For that campaign, he was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation.
