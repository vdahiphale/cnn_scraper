As of this hour, flags at the White House and across the state of Georgia are flying at half staff in honor of the peanut farmer who became a president and lived a life of great service and great love. Carter died peacefully at the age of 100 yesterday afternoon surrounded by his family at his home in Plains, Georgia, as mourners left tributes outside the Carter Center in Atlanta. World leaders and all five living U.S. presidents paid their respects to the man who once said, I have one life and one chance to make it count for something. My faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I can, whenever I can, for as long as I can. CNN's Ryan Young is live in Plains, Georgia, this morning. Good morning, Ryan. Where's the sense in Jimmy Carter's hometown there? RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this morning, Yes, Omar, you get a sense of love and appreciation for a man who fought so hard for so many. You've got to think about the state of Georgia. It's really tied to agriculture. So, to have a peanut farmer become the president of the United States still stands, it's something that a lot of people have a lot of pride in. And, of course, as we moved our way through the state last night just to be here for this live shot. A lot of the way people were talking about him out loud and talking about the things they remember. We talk about Habitat for Humanity, for instance, and all the people who have been served by that. Even in Atlanta, you saw people coming out to the Carter Center to show their respect for a man who grew larger than his town. When you come into this Plains, Georgia, you realized how just small this community is. And so many people have been touched by his life. Listen to the mayor talk about the love that he had for a man who stood as a giant in this country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. MAYOR BOZE GODWIN (R-PLAINS, GA):  I've known him since I was a child, he was not only my friend, though, he's a friend to everybody in town. And we've lost not just a president, but a friend, and a person that never forgot the people here, regardless of what position he held. And also he's going to be buried here, and it's very close. That's a deliberate move to keep people coming back to visit on his part. Even in death, he didn't forgot the town. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so far, the family has not released what the next steps are. We know there's going to be a long mourning period. There'll be remembrances in Atlanta and D.C.But right now, I think there's just a general shock. I mean, look, obviously, he was 100 years old. He's the longest living president, but there's this idea that he just survived over and over again. We know he's been in hospice care for quite some time. But this is a community in a state in an area that just loves Jimmy Carter. So, it'll be interesting to see as first light comes up in this small town, how people start to remember the former president.",

Now, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada says the plane skidded down the runway for a decent distance, as it was described, and passengers saw flames on the aircraft's left side. Now, the cause of the landing gear failure still unknown right now, but an investigation is underway to determine that cause. All right, health experts are issuing a warning over how the U.S. is tackling an outbreak of bird flu among cattle and wild birds, but why they're increasingly worried about human transmission.

There have been 66 confirmed human cases, but those cases have been tied to exposures to infected animals. About 40 of those cases have been tied to exposures to infected dairy cattle. About 23 have been tied to poultry farms. There's one case that has been tied to another type of animal, and there are two cases where the exposure is still unknown.But overall, the reason why there are concerns is if we continue to see more cases, if we continue to see certain mutations happen or a process called re-assortment, where someone may be infected with bird flu and infected with the seasonal flu at the same time, we could see this risk of human-to-human spread developing.

And the CDC also said it has partnerships with commercial labs and bird flu tests are available at doctor's offices.But, again, Omar, health experts say these steps that have been taken are good, but we need even more steps to really monitor this because there is this overall worry about the possible risk of seeing human- to-human spread develop.",
