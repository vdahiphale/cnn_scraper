I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. A stunning display of resistance in Israel may have stopped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to weaken the judiciary, at least for now. In the face of massive protests and strikes, Netanyahu's coalition partner says the proposal is tabled for the moment, but it will be brought up as soon as perhaps a month from now. Whether that will be enough to calm the outcry is yet to be seen critics, both inside Israel and abroad, say the Israeli leader is making a troublesome slide towards autocracy. So, let's go straight to head to Hadas Gold in Jerusalem, our correspondent on the ground there. Hadas, tell me about the actual state of play on the ground as you've been reporting all day.",

This is because Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fired his defense minister for daring to speak out against these reforms. He called for a halt -- the defense minister was fired on Sunday evening, that sparked new protests overnight, that I have to say, Christiane, we're angrier than the ones I've seen before. And then today, a historic moment. At the largest general strike in Israeli history, Christiane, everything from the airport, to the ports, nurses, shops, even McDonald's went on strike in Israel as a result of this judicial overhaul, as a result of protesting against the defense minister firing. That led to more protesters into the streets in Jerusalem. But what's also different today is that the right wingers, the people who are in favor of these reforms, people who are supporting Netanyahu are now coming out to the streets as well as a counter process. They're heeding the call of Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister himself, a far- right wing finger. They're coming out into the streets. And there is a lot of fear that there will be clashes between protesters. That this bloodshed that the Israeli president had warned about several weeks ago will come to pass as these protesters face off against one another in the streets in Jerusalem.",

So, let us turn now to the former foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, she's in Tel Aviv. She says, of course, like many of the critics that this is a struggle, really, for the soul of Israel.

It's a group ofdifferent legislations and bill taking care of him personally, his family, his political partners, exemption for the orthodox of serving in the army against equality. So, it's not just one bill, and there is a need to stop everything. Because apparently in the last 12 years, we discovered that these are not just judicial reforms. It's about what is the nature of Israel. Is Israel will remain the Jewish democratic state or non-democratic -- I don't know, whether dictatorship or more religious country. It's really about the soul and it's about it's about the nature and the identity of our country. And this is why it is so encouraging to see a new camp that was born believing in the declaration of independence. Fighting for it. Believing in democracy. It's good news.",

Netanyahu claimed that it was a small minority ready to tear the country apart. He went on to say that, you know, despite the fact that Israel has seen three months of protests, including the largest general strike in Israeli history, Mr. Netanyahu is adamant that he is going to push ahead with these reforms, although he is going to delay them. Now, I want to bring in our Hadas Gold who joins us now live on this story, as well as our Nic Robertson. Hadas, good to have you with us. So, obviously Mr. Netanyahu wants to, essentially, increase his power weaken the judiciary. And he has said today that he's not going to shelve this legislation, he's going to suspended it and wait for more debate. What stood out to you?",

And I just want to let our viewers to -- this vision coming into us live right now, onthe streets of Jerusalem, protesters, they're still out in force. They don't seem to be going anywhere right now. And I want to ask you more about that, Nic, because you flew in to Israel. Obviously, we have seen his major strikes, the biggest strikes in Israeli history, impacting transportation, universities, shops. We are expecting to see more protests tomorrow involving healthcare workers, including nurses. Do you think this momentum will continue despite the fact that the prime minister has said that he will delay this legislation and wait for debate? NIC ROBERTSON, CNN'S INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR:   The core issue hasn't gone away. It's been delayed. So, the debate has a little longer to play out. But I certainly feel that all the protesters who've been coming out that opposed the judicial reforms also feel, as Hadas laid out there, that if Itamar Ben-Gvir is forming a national guard of sorts under his command, that's going to stoke fears about what sort of deal the prime ministers had to make to get within his own hardline cabinet. To get the compromise to delay decisions on judicial reform. And we don't know the details of precisely what would be put before the Knesset in its next session. So, we don't know what will be voted on. So, we don't know and the protesters won't know what to expect. So, I think there's going to be that real concern that until those sorts of things become clear, that until those sorts of things become clear then those concerns are going to stay. And I think what we also heard from the prime minister was really speaking to the crowd here, as you can hear behind me, that for the first time government officials have called on pro-government supporters to come out on the streets. And those are the people that are gathered here. And what the prime minister said to them quite explicitly was, you're having your chance to be heard. This is what we're hearing right now. You're having your chance to be heard, you are not second-class citizens, he said to them. But he said also that he appealed for people not to turn to violence. To be responsible not to provoke. He said that was the right part. And this is something that we've heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu, urging people away from getting into -- from the potential of clashes. But that is also one of the big things about today. Pro-government supporters coming out on the streets because they want to be heard and they want to make sure that their views and these judicial changes happen and that is also obviously going to play in to the current situation. Both sides want to be heard. This is what the crowd saying here. They're saying they want reform now. These voices are not going away. The detail the government just hasn't laid out. It's just delayed discussion.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, recent polling done by the Israel Democracy Institute has found that a majority of people, not a slim majority, a helpingmajority of people do not want the reforms as they have been originally written. The idea that the parliament could overturn a Supreme Court decision with a simple majority, or the idea that the government could have as much of a say, as the government had proposed over the judges and how they are selected. And when you just look at the types of people who have come out against this reform, or at least have called for a halt to the reform, these are senior figures, not only former government officials but also former heads of the Israeli military, former heads of the Massad, the current governor of the Bank of Israel called for a pause. Senior members of the, normally, a political high-tech sector, that's usually the pride, especially on Benjamin Netanyahu often talks about the startup nation. They have come out against this. And seeing the labor union today called the most massive general strike that we have ever seen. Keep in mind that members of the labor unions board, they are part of Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud right wing party, and they agreed and called for the strict. I think when you look at those numbers, you can see that there is quite a significant group of people in Israeli society who are against these reforms. And then not to even mention the international pressure from the Americans, from the Germans, from others who have expressed concern about how these reforms are being pushed through that they want compromises to at least be reached. But we do -- you know, there is a call for reform. There is a sector of the Israeli society who, especially, just support much of what Benjamin Netanyahu does. But they do also want to reform. They feel as though the Supreme Court has been meddling in issues that they shouldn't be meddling in. And that the voice of the people who voted the politicians into power should have more of a say. Because keep in mind, Israel has no written constitution. So, there's -- it's not really sometimes clear, sort of, what the Supreme Court should get in on or what they shouldn't. But while there have been calls for reforms in the past, the way that this has been pushed through, that is what's really wrangling people. But I should note that the protests we're seeing from the right-wing tonight is one of the first times in the past 12 weeks at the right-wing has come out in force. The supporters of this reforms have finally come out to the streets to express their support for what they see are much-needed reforms to the judiciary.",

      "sentences": "It does, and that gets to the root of a lot of the protesters concerns, that their prime minister is consolidating, essentially, morepower because it's harder to remove him and it will be easier for him to resist and perhaps contain and limit some of the charges that he's facing in the courts here that are ongoing. So, for the prime minister, this is the sort of alleviation from pressure -- from the pressure of those charges that he wants. But it's precisely that alleviation that triggers people's fears. That the constant -- that the lack of constitution is being essentially tampered with to the advantage of this prime minister for gains that he wants that are not overall in the national interest. And that really is what is -- as Hadas is saying, what we've been hearing coming from the White House, coming from other friends and partners and allies of Israel across the world, that are saying that you need to keep in place those parts of your democracy and democratic values that allow you to have the adequate checks and balances that exists in a democracy. Failing that, then you enter a situation where you are judged as being less than democratic. So, these are the fears that play out. So, if the prime minister gets what he wants, an alleviation from the pressures of being removed from office that, many would argue, is against the interests of the country. Again, saying that, the protesters here at this location, outside the Supreme Court tonight, near the Knesset are saying they want their voices heard too. They want those changes that the prime minister is calling for.",
