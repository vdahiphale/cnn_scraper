      "sentences": "Well, good morning to you. And welcome to our continuing coverage of the truce between Israel and Hamas and the expected release of more hostages today. I'm Pamela Brown.My colleague Kaitlan Collins is live in Tel Aviv. We're going to have more from Kaitlan in just a moment. We're waiting and we're watching the tense situation in Gaza and Israel where a second group of hostages held by Hamas is expected to be released. It's day two of a fragile four-day pause in fighting. And we're now hearing the timing is delayed in part by the slowness of aid trucks entering Gaza. As families wait anxiously for word, sources tell CNN that today's list provided by Hamas has 13 names. CNN has learned that no Americans are expected to be released today. Under terms of the complicated deal Israel frees three Palestinians for every Israeli hostage. As buses wait outside a prison in the occupied West Bank one Palestinian official says Israel is not following the terms of the prisoner release deal. On Friday 13 Israelis, 10 Thai citizens and one Filipino captive were set free -- this video was released by Hamas and CNN, we should note had no control over its content. With the truce the first in seven weeks silencing the guns, more aid has begun to flow into Gaza. Dozens of trucks carrying food, fuel and water enter the besieged Palestinian today. CNN is covering all the developments. Jeremy Diamond is Kerem Shalom, White House correspondent Arlette Saenz is in Nantucket, Massachusetts, Clarissa Ward is at a children's hospital where we expect more of the child hostages will be taken. And Kaitlan Collins is in Tel Aviv and we go to her now. Kaitlan?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kaitlan, it was around this time yesterday that we heard those helicopters beginning to land near the Kerem Shalom crossing point between Israel and Gaza, and as of now things are relatively quiet.The Israeli military though, has blocked off this entire road, and this is where yesterday we saw that convoy of ambulances carrying those hostages, newly freed hostages, as they drove their first meters, effectively, into (AUDIO GAP) we heard they left Gaza through the Rafah Crossing initially and then they drove less than two miles to the Kerem Shalom Crossing where there is, indeed, a gate in order for -- under special circumstances to get people or goods in from Egypt into Israel. Kerem Shalom crossing is right on the corner between Israel, Egypt and Gaza. And so it was down this road that that convoy then drove on the way to the Hatzerim Airbase in Israel, where they then were able to make their first phone calls to their family members and then from there they were helicoptered over to hospitals across Israel. If this deal holds tonight, if it goes through, we expect that we may see that very same scene as we did yesterday with that convoy of ambulances or buses coming through this way. But the fact that there have been delays (AUDIO GAP) in the agreement between Israel and Hamas is, it's important to keep in mind that Israel (AUDIO GAP) directly together. They are speaking via the Qatari mediators. And so the expectation was that there would be bumps in the road. There would be problems that could arise. Israeli officials have been taken this day by day to see -- and as have the families of hostages -- as they wait for their loved ones to hopefully get out. They are obviously waiting very anxiously to see whether or not this group of 13 today is able to get out of Gaza, out of Egypt, and into Israel as smoothly as yesterday.",

Once again, no Americans are expected to be freed as part of this release today. No Americans were on that list yesterday. The White House, though, is still holding out hope that ultimately those three U.S. citizens, who had fit into this category of women and children will be in the groups in the coming days before this truce is up. Arlette Saenz is tracking all of this from Nantucket where President Biden is spending his Thanksgiving vacation. Arlette, what are White House officials telling you about whether or not they have any sense of which group that this -- these Americans could be in, because obviously, you know, this is a tenuous truce, questions over whether or not it will hold. So far it has but I don't think anyone has, you know, a ton of confidence in this, you know, going smoothly, the entire process.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kaitlan, President Biden and the White House have really refrained from putting in a specific date on the release of these expected three Americans, those two women and that young 4-year-old Abigail Edan. They simply have been saying that they're hopeful that they will be released as part of this larger negotiated deal to have 50 women and children released in the coming days.Now, I'm told President Biden this morning was briefed at least twice by the national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his national security team as the White House is closely watching this expected second wave of hostages that are expected to be released in the coming hours. But the president so far has really been unable to offer specific details on when he expects the dates that these hostages will be released, or how exactly that would happen. But one thing that he said yesterday, speaking to reporters, is that he plans on maintaining contact with his counterparts in the region to ensure that this deal remains on track. The implementation of this deal has really been a key focus for the White House as they want to make sure that all of the plans that have been agreed to will actually be carried out. And that is something that officials will be watching closely as this expected release is set to come today. Now, the White House has said that once Americans are set to be released, they would begin to notify families once they see their loved ones departing from Gaza but it does not appear like that will be happening today. But there is still hope that those -- that those three American citizens could be released in the coming days. The president also saying they will not stop working until they ensure that all Americans are back home with their families as well.",

That is something that's started to flow in yesterday. The president in his remarks also talking about the fact that they were sending in food, medical supplies and fuel as well. But right now, what the officials are very keyed in on is trying to ensure that the plans for these next four days are proceeding as they have outlined and the president has expressed some optimistic hope that there could be a possibility that this truce could be extended for longer, it's just unclear whether that's, in fact, happening.",

We are hearing from sources right now that this process has started. Of course, we saw yesterday it was an incredibly lengthy process, multi- step process that involved these hostages going from Gaza to the Rafah Crossing to Egypt to then being brought here to hospitals in Israel. That's where we find CNN's Clarissa Ward outside of a children's hospital where some of the hostages were taken after yesterday's release. And Clarissa, we're still waiting to see in earnest that this has gotten underway. We're hearing from resources the process has begun. We don't really have details what stage it's at right now. But we know children are expected to be on this group of 13 hostages released today. How are hospital officials bracing, basically, for more children who have undergone deep trauma to come into their care tonight?",

      "sentences": "Well, according to officials in this hospital they're very much ready. They have made extensive preparations as they did yesterday.And we've seen now some of the images that are starting to come out, obviously the hospital is very keen to protect the privacy, particularly, because you're talking about minors of these families, but some of them have been open to sharing images, videos of those reunions between fathers and children. And it's incredibly moving to see after seven long weeks, these families finally being reunited. It is also encouraging to see that physically, and this is what we've heard also from hospital officials, that most of the children and the mothers as well who are also at this hospital appear to be in good physical condition. Now that said, of course, the hospital is very much aware that the real challenge here is going to be the emotional challenge. It's going to be the psychological challenge. And so to that end they have gone above and beyond to try to ensure that they've created a very warm, intimate, not sterile, clinical atmosphere, that they have hand-picked the top psychiatrists with relevant experience in dealing with childhood trauma to be there round the clock. There are social workers here for every single family. And we know that the families even in the run-up to the hostages being released are basically being coached every step of the way. It's being explained to them by representatives from the government, from the IDF as well, how this whole release works. The anatomy, if you will, which as you just described, Kaitlan, is multi-pronged. It can take many hours. And so once again we're seeing a sense of trepidation in the air. Obviously, every precaution has been taken, every dot -- I has been dotted, every T has been crossed. And the hospital is very much ready in anticipation that they believe several children are believed to be on this list. And now just comes the hard part, Kaitlan, where they sit, they wait, and you can imagine for these family members, especially having seen how relatively smoothly things went last night, what an agonizing wait it is, that that mixture of excitement, but not wanting to get too far ahead of yourself as you wait to be reunited, Kaitlan.",

Says went into Gaza yesterday.The Egyptians are keen to put in as many trucks as possible. There's been trucks lined up for days trying to get that clearance to go across the Rafah Crossing into Gaza. The Egyptians have a check point on this side but when they go over into Gaza, the Israelis also check these trucks before the contents can be redistributed to aid agencies that operate in Gaza, especially across the southern Gaza strip. And so that appears to be the hold-up here. The Hamas wants more of these trucks coming in. The quota is 200 of these truck come in every day over this four-day truce. They're carrying water. They're carrying fuel. They're carrying food, medical supplies, other the essential humanitarian supplies. And there's just disappointment that more of them are not coming in on the Palestinian side and that may be the explanation for why this exchange was delayed as they try to get as many of these trucks as possible in there. 1.7 million people displaced according to the U.N. We've seen people lining up for hours trying to get just cooking gas so that they can have a way to prepare meals for their families. And whenever this aid is getting to the people on the other side, they're scrambling to get whatever little they can get their hands on. So that is the level of desperation here which is why this rampant (ph) -- in the amount of aid coming into Gaza is a key plan in the framework for the release of the hostages, as the Israelis described it, agreed with the United States and mediated by Qatar and Egypt, Kaitlan.",

That essentially Hamas is starting to hand over hostages to the Red Cross. It's been a little bit delayed today, compared to yesterday, and we're told through sources that is because there was a dispute about the amount of aid going in to Gaza. Hamas wanted to see more aid going in before handing over the hostages. An IDF spokesperson said it's a slow process and indeed it is a complicated, multi-pronged process for -- everything to come together for day two of this truce, to go into play. But we are told that the hostages are beginning to be turned over to the Red Cross. Our expectation is, it's going to be 13 hostages according to sources in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners.

All of this follows the initial release that we saw happen on Friday. 24 hostages in total, freed by Hamas, that was in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners then as the start of this four-day truce. Now that we are on day two let's check in with CNN's Oren Liebermann who joins us now from Hostage Square, what is informally known as that, given there are so many families here in Israel whose loved ones are still being held hostage. Oren, now that, you know, this is the first time we've been able to see this square as they've been able to absorb the fact that some of these hostages have made it home.

They also believe that their job isn't completed yet now that the first group is out. Because they see each other as one family, they see it as their job to lobby for the release of everybody. And that's what tonight is all about. They have dubbed it 50 for 50 -- 50,000 people they want to bring here to mark 50 days in captivity for the hostages who have not yet been brought out of Gaza. That is the clock ticking down here behind me, 49 hours -- I'm sorry, 49 days, 11 hours, 33 minutes and the seconds are ticking away, ticking down towards the 50-hour mark. That has been here for days and it will be here for many more days until more of the hostages are brought home, the news they're eagerly awaiting. Obviously, the TV crews, the news crews have been following all of the latest developments. And this is all about a rally to let the government know, the defense ministry, which is right across the street from us, that they're not going anywhere. They will keep rallying and keep demanding for the release of the hostages. For them, that's the number one priority. They have heard the government say that's unequal footing with the destruction of Hamas. That's not the message they want to hear. Certainly not here on Hostages Square where there are so many displays of the missing, all the kibbutzes, all the towns they're from. The priority for them is, has always been and will be to secure the release of all of the hostages. And that's the news they're waiting for here tonight again.",

No bombs raining down on them from the sky.Some children can even smile again, even if only for a brief while. But there's nothing to celebrate. Too many lives have been lost, so much gone, and they know there will be more. The Israeli military dropping leaflets on Friday, warning people that the war is not over. It will soon resume and telling them to stay away from northern Gaza and its troops. Many still tried to head back to the homes they fled with nothing more than the clothes on their backs to see what's left and grab what they can find, including their dead. \"We want to see what's happened to our loved ones, so many are under the rubble for 20 days,\" Abu Ahmed (ph) says. \"We need to get them out.\" \"Who else will bury them? Who will bury our 2-year-old and her father,\" say Uma Abdullah (ph) \"What did she do to them?\" It was a tense scene on Salah al-Din street, the highway linking north and south, people here saying Israeli forces opened fire on those trying to head back north. \"We want to get to our homes. They say this is a truce,\" Mahmoud says. These are civilians. They shot people. One was shot in the head, and the other in the mouth. Gunfire and the panic that ensued captured in this video geolocated by CNN. Asked about these shootings, the Israeli military says its troops are stationed on the, quote, \"operational lines of the pause\" in accordance with the framework of the agreement. But that didn't stop those determines to get back to what's left of their lives. Sisters Hanim (ph) and Sarda (ph) cradling their cats who have been through it all with them say they know the risks, but they just want to go back home. Gazans know all too well what happens after this brief calm. \"What's this truce for, to hand over the hostages? What happens after they hand them over? What happens to us,\" Uma Abdullah asked. \"We feel like we are dead,\" she says. They hope it doesn't all start again. All they can do now is prepare for a cruel winter ahead.

But if that is the final number for the second day of this truce, that is still fewer than the 137 trucks that went into Gaza yesterday. That was the highest, the largest amount of humanitarian convoy that we've seen come in since October 7th.And that's part of the unhappiness you see here, because this ramp up of the aid coming into Gaza was a key part of this framework to release the hostages, to swap them with prisoners. And so far, the fact that not many of them are coming in. There's a quota, 200 trucks are supposed to come in bringing essential food, fuel, water and medical supplies to maintain the humanitarian infrastructure especially in southern Gaza but also reach so many that need it. The U.N. says 1.7 million people are displaced and so far, we're a little behind schedule here compared to yesterday. By this time we'd already seen some movement and so far, that's not happened yet, Kaitlan.",
