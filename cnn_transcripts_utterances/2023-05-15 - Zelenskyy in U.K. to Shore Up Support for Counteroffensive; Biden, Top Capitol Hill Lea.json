Just moments ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in the United Kingdom, he's meeting with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak who plans to announce hundreds of air defense missiles for Ukraine as it prepares a counteroffensive against Russia.CNN's Clare Sebastian joins me this morning from London. Clare, Zelenskyy, essentially on a European tour, on his German leg of that tour, he said that he vowed to reclaim all of his country from the Russians. What more are we learning about the support he's getting?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Christine, it's been a really productive weekend for Ukraine. He got the biggest ever pledge to date in his war from Germany where $3 billion over the weekend, that included another 30 Leopard 2 tanks, which have been so crucial for Ukraine. France also pledging tens of armored vehicles including training just this morning.We're hearing as this meeting gets underway at the Prime Minister's country residence of Chequers just outside London. That the U.K. will be pledging more air defense missiles and attack drones with a range of 200 kilometers. This is something that Zelenskyy is at pains to point out it's an urgent visit, Ukraine has an urgent need now ahead of this upcoming counteroffensive for these weapons. That's why I think you see this have a more business-like air to it, compared to the pomp and circumstance we saw in his trip to the U.K. in February where he addressed a joint houses -- the joint houses of Congress. He had tea with the king. He did that great sort of rhetorical flourish where he presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a helmet of a fighter pilot, saying that Ukraine needed wings to protect its freedom. He still, by the way, does not have any western pledges for NATO standard fighter jets. So, this is something that we expect to hear more about today. But it is very important, not just for the weapons, but also for the optics of this. Ukraine wants to take its place amongst its European allies, amongst its NATO allies. This is a visual, sort of -- you know, a sort of carrot, I guess, to bring home to his war-weary people, as you can show they're at least achieving some of their goals here.",

Turkish election officials say that President Erdogan leads his opponent with just under 50 percent of the vote needed to win the race outright. Erdogan has been a thorn in the West's side for years with his moves to weaken democracy in Turkey.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is in Istanbul for us this morning.

And as you mentioned at this point, neither of those candidates have achieved that 50-plus-1 threshold that is needed to win the presidency. What you have right now is President Erdogan at 49.40 percent, the leader of the opposition and their candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu at 44.96 percent.What we heard last night from those candidates coming out, addressing their supporters, saying that they were ready for a second round if this is the will of the Turkish people, if this is where this is headed. But you know, Christine, this is really quite a blow for Turkey's opposition, who have been more united, more galvanized than ever. You have these diverse opposition groups all coming together, creating this coalition that they believe would be able to unseat President Erdogan and after 20 years of being -- of leading this country. And they really believe that they have the momentum, they have the support to do this. They were promising change, a change that so many in this country wanted, but it doesn't appear at this point that, that was enough. While President Erdogan hasn't won at this point, while this is still going towards a runoff in a couple of weeks' time on the 28th of May, it does appear that he has defied expectations. That he has emerged here pretty much unscathed after everything that he has faced. The criticism in -- over the past few months and over the past couple of years, whether it is his handling of the economic situation in this country.   His economic policies, his unorthodox economic policies that are blamed for the country's high inflation, the cost of living crisis, the currency crisis where the Turkish lira has lost much of its value over the past couple of years. And then you've got the handling of that devastating earthquake in February, that disastrous initial response by the government and the lack of preparedness, and so much criticism that President Erdogan and his government got despite that, he is still managing at this point to have the support of pretty much half the country in this very polarized nation, Christine.",

They're migrant families, some single mothers who told us they were recently processed and released by border authorities. Also children visibly exhausted nap inside, others play in the courtyard. The young minds spare the anguish of moms and dads trying to figure out when or even if they could continue the rest of the journey, you know, what can easily become a hopeless space, it seems the migrant mothers keep hope alive here. Conny Barahona keeps it together for Daniella(ph), her 9-year-old. She says two of her older daughters, ages 18 and 20 remain in federal detention. \"It will be a sad Mother's Day\", she tells me, \"my daughters won't be by my side.\" In the last three days, Barahona turned down coveted opportunities to travel to Houston, refusing to go anywhere without all her daughters. \"We left Honduras together, and that's how we must remain until God allows\", the single mother says. She forged a friendship with fellow migrant mom, Yesgadi Gonzalez(ph) who left South America three months ago with her partner and their son, Jason. We found another motherly bond in this corner of the shelter where Yonella Falcon (ph) receives help in caring for baby Yeremi (ph) just 2 weeks old. His mom tells me she carried him from Venezuela to Texas, where she went into labor immediately after stepping on to U.S. soil. All of the migrant mothers we spoke to say, maternal instinct to provide for the children is what drove them to make the perilous journey in the first place. \"A parent will do anything to see their children safe\", says Barahona, a hug from Daniella (ph) seems to help ease any of mom's sorrows.
