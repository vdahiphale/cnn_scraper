Officials say the commercial flight crash-landed in Lake Victoria on Sunday because of winds and heavy rain. CNN's Larry Madowo joining me live from Johannesburg, South Africa.

      "sentences": "Christine, the puzzle is whether the 19 people that were killed was as a result of the impact of the crash landing or they drowned because there is some inconsistency regarding the public statements, the eyewitness accounts -- survivors of this crash.The officials initially said Sunday that they had been in contact with the captain and the first officer after the aircraft was already in the water. But later on, when the names of the 19 who were killed were released, the pilots were among the dead. So one of the working theories here is that this could have been another example of the miracle on the Hudson. That this plane landed safely on the water, shallow enough to pull the plane out of it and rescue people. But because the emergency services -- the rescue didn't happen fast enough that many of these people could have possibly drowned, which is a tragic situation. We know this aircraft left Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania around 6:00 a.m. local. It was expected at around 8:30 in the northwest part of the country, but at 8:53 it had still not been -- it had not landed and that is when an alarm was raised. And shortly after that, that's when it ditched into the lake. This is a decent regional airline and has a great safety record. This is the worst accident in its history. This aircraft had only been in operation with the airline for 12 years. It's a French-manufactured aircraft and the ATR, the company that makes it, now says it's supporting the investigation in line with international protocol. But a true tragedy here. Nineteen people killed in an accident that some say could have been avoided if enough people got there with the right equipment and the right training to pull people out. Because what happened is local fishermen in villages came in and did their best and got some people to safety.",

It added tens of thousands of workers during the pandemic.And now a report in the Wall Street Journal says the social media giant plans large-scale layoffs expected to affect thousands of employees. The Journal reports Meta has already told employees to cancel nonessential travel beginning this week. The move would make the first major headcount reduction in the company's history. Looking at markets around the world, the possibility of China easing COVID-19 restrictions prompted a rally for Asian markets. European shares have opened mixed here. And on Wall Street, stock index futures are looking for a bounce back after a lower week for stocks. It's an election week with the economy issue number one. Inflation hurting family budgets. But the job market is resilient, just now beginning to show signs of slowing down after six months of rate increases. Two hundred sixty-one thousand jobs added back to the economy in October, the fewest since December 2020. A year ago, that same month, 677,000 jobs were created. You can see the slowdown in action there. We get a gut check this week with October's Consumer Price Index Thursday, consumer credit data. Weekly jobless claims also due out this week. Gas prices held steady overnight, now sitting at $3.80 a gallon. Our next guest says there will be several major stories developing immediately after the midterm elections.

Derrick Henry is a machine -- 115 yards, two touchdowns, breaking Earl Campbell's franchise rushing touchdown record with 74.But the night belonged to Magic Mahomes, the Chiefs' superstar quarterback throwing for 446 yards, then making Jeffery Simmons look like a baby draft on ice on his way to a touchdown. Sixty-three yards on the ground for him. The Chiefs were down by two, so they go for two. Again, it's Patrick Mahomes getting the block and getting in. So, in overtime, Mahomes fires to Noah Gray who makes a bobbling catch, putting the Chiefs in field goal range. They kick it, make it, take the lead. And then the defense who held Malik Willis to just five completions on the night, hang on to get the 20-17 overtime win. Now 6-2 and tied for first in the AFC. And that's because the Bills had their role slowed by the New York Jets and a broken SkyCam, Christine. The game delayed over 10 minutes in MetLife Stadium. Robert Sola's defense was the story, though, harassing MVP candidate Josh Allen all day -- picking him off twice. This one by Sauce Gardner. That set up the go-ahead score. And Zach Wilson swings it to James Robinson who just joined the team last week. He gets in for the score. The Jets win 20-17. They're 6-3 and just a half-game behind Buffalo in the AFC East. What is going on with Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers -- one of the biggest questions in the NFL. Rookie Aidan Hutchinson intercepts Rodgers early in the game. The 1-6 Lions came to play. Aaron Glenn's defense, stellar. Kerby Joseph had two interceptions off Rodgers. The Packers did have one shot left with 40 seconds to go but Rodgers pass lands in no man's land.
