Asa Hussington, the former governor of Arkansas, clearly Christie would be two who directly do that and others who do it in much more subtle ways. Obviously, Ron DeSantis finds his moments in which to hit Trump. But that is the early dynamic. And you saw a classic Mike Pence there in that moment.",

In 2020, there were 23 Democrats who ran for President, including, as we all know, a mayor of a town of 100,000 people in South Bend, Indiana, who later became a thing. Obviously now transportation secretary won the Iowa caucuses in Pete Buttigieg.But Chris Sununu has always been a different calculation. He's the governor of a small state. He's never raised a lot of money, and his path was to be the big kingmaker of 2024. Bigger than Jim Clyber, bigger than ever existed. He wanted to be the one who could pick the particular nominee for president. And by the way, ride those coattails with him to Washington, just like his father did, by the way, with a key endorsement in 1992 for George H. W. Bush. And then he, of course, he became the White House Chief of Staff. This is Chris Sununu's father Doug Bergam, of course, has a different path. No one really cares about the endorsement of the governor of North Dakota. However, he feels like he wants to increase his level in American politics. He's a very popular governor, not that anyone really knows his name. So this is a chance for him to elevate himself and see where this thing goes.",
