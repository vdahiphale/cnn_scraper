Kamala Harris spending the day in debate prep for tomorrow's matchup. We just saw that new ad against Trump. Talk to us a little bit about what she is focusing on. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Look, for her, this is a debate that is a debut in a lot of ways, on the national stage. Obviously, it had been a lot about her at the Democratic Convention, the interview that she did on CNN a couple weeks ago. But, this is her in an unscripted moment that goes on for 90 minutes, and that, as we saw in the debate between Biden and Trump, can lead to unexpected things. It's going to be a chance for a lot of people to take a measure of her and see whether they like what she has to say and how she goes at Donald Trump, at the same time, of course, as they'll be looking at Donald Trump. But, what we see from the polls is that many people have made up their minds on Donald Trump, for or against, wherever they are in him, not surprising after eight years, but Kamala Harris, who has only been in this race since the end of July as the presidential candidate, a lot of people still making up their minds what they think of her.",

She is also the founder of Bluestack Strategies, and Democratic Strategist Mark Longabaugh. He is a former Senior Strategist for Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign. Good to see you both. So, this is the first time they're debating. It's also the first time they're meeting at all, and the debate comes as this new polling, as we just showed, shows a razor thin race, but with Trump holding a one point lead.Maura, what's Trump's greatest advantage coming into this debate, and his greatest weakness? MAURA GILLESPIE, FMR. PRESS ADVISOR TO FMR. HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER: Well, it's interesting when you phrase it like that, because I think there is both strength and weakness to be able to hit on the Harris campaign about things that have happened in the Biden-Harris administration that have largely been viewed as a failure, in terms of talking about Afghanistan. That's a clear one. We were going to have this meeting here this week. This -- Speaker Johnson is bringing in the families of the 13 fallen during that Afghanistan withdrawal. And this report from Congressman McCaul came out. So, it's really a skating time for this instance. What I think then is a weakness for Trump is, on that same issue, Harris campaign could hit on the fact that Donald Trump invited the Taliban during his presidency to Camp David. He negotiated this terrible peace deal that really put a time cap on when the U.S. and allies would withdraw from Afghanistan. So, really telling our enemies our plans, which again -- so, I think there is a way there that the strengths that he thinks he has in his back pocket. The Harris administration or the Harris campaign would be smart to hit back on those things and pointing out what Trump did, because the American people have a very short-term memory in a lot of ways. And so, this is something to remind them of what actually happened during Trump administration.",

And I think the real goal, and I agree with Isaac Dovere in your previous segment here, I think the real objective for Harris is to talk to the American people about who she is and what she wants to do in her first term as an administration. I think she wants to talk about her economic -- her opportunity economy in terms of tax cuts for the middle class, not for billionaires, $6,000 tax credit for -- to cut child poverty, investments in our American economy like the CHIPS Act. So, I think she is going to talk to the American public about where she wants to go.

And so, for him to go after women's rights and to talk about women in disparaging ways, as he has done repeatedly, that is not going to help him appeal to an audience that he needs to win over. And especially on Tuesday night, this is a really big opportunity.You showed the polls earlier in the show. This is really important that people are paying attention and that the candidates themselves are speaking to the demographics that they need to win over, because they have their base, right? Trump has his MAGA base kind of locked in. They're not going to go for Harris. They're not going to go for anyone else but him. So, he needs to find a way to talk policy, to talk compassionately, which, again, is really hard for him, because he does go by a certain playbook that has won him the 2016 election.

And that's for both candidates, truly.But, I think when it comes to Trump, something that people are going to have to realize is that, if you thought it was better in 2016 and you thought that things were going well then, the people who were in charge at his -- in his administration have largely abandoned him and not wanted to be anywhere near him. And of those people who are no longer in his orbit, they're speaking out against why he shouldn't be in the White House ever again. And so, it comes to a question of, how do you plan on doing this, and who do you plan on putting around you to make this go forward? So, talking policy, getting into the nuts and bolts of it in this debate is going to be important, because not only does he need to explain how he plans to do things, he has also got to talk to women, talk about child care issues, and actually talk about issues that women care about, and not just attacking.

Remember, three Israelis were shot dead there as that Jordanian truck driver yesterday crossed over in his commercial vehicle, got out of the truck, walked over to Israeli civilian workers operating at the sort of cargo port area of the checkpoints, and opened fire, killing three of them. He was himself shot dead by an Israeli security guard.Jordanian authorities, in their preliminary investigation, confirmed it was a Jordanian truck driver. They confirmed his identity. They said they believe he acted alone. Jordanian authorities have also condemned the assault and the attack as well, but said that the underlying issues, the underlying reasons for it, the war in Gaza, Israeli action in the occupied West Bank should be addressed. Israel, for its part, has reacted obviously furiously.

Matthew, thank you.And there are dueling reports out on the chaotic 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. House Republicans and Democrats have both released reports about the exit from Kabul. 13 U.S. service members were killed as U.S. troops tried to leave the country. A Republican report from the House Foreign Affairs Committee blames the Biden White House for the chaotic evacuation. House Democrats called the timing of the report politically motivated. I want to bring in now CNN's Kylie Atwood, who joins us from Washington, D.C. So, Kylie, share more what we're learning about these new reports. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, this new report out from specifically the House Republicans is not revelatory. It does have some new details about the Biden administration's withdrawal from Afghanistan, which obviously took place more than three years ago at this point. But, one of the things that they focus in on are the public comments that spokespeople for the administration were making at the time, and juxtaposed that to some of the things that the committee has learned from officials from the Pentagon about the actual assessments with regard to what was happening on the ground at the time, making the case that the administration was misleading and lying to the public about what was actually going on. There is also some other details about the negotiations back and forth with the Taliban, the Afghan government that was led by Zalmay Khalilzad, who was the top negotiator for the United States with the Taliban at the time, though, that agreement actually never came into fruition because the Taliban, of course, overran Kabul. The Democrats, for their part, are saying that what the Republicans are doing here is purely political, and they are saying that it was actually Trump's fault for making that agreement with the Taliban before he left office that initiated the withdrawal and made it, in their words, irreversible. So, we've seen this back and forth between Democrats and Republicans for quite some time, Rahel, trying to cast blame on the other side for how the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan. It's coming back to the fore right now, as we are two months from the presidential election, of course, on the eve of the presidential debate, which will be tomorrow.",

We should note that there are some Democrats on the Hill who are attending this event, but it is clearly a politicized event. Some of these family members have already spoken out in opposition of the Biden administration. Some of them attended the RNC back earlier this summer. So, we'll be watching to see how that unfolds.But, we should also note, Rahel, that Kamala Harris' campaign isn't completely ignoring the issue of Afghanistan. We saw over the weekend, they actually put out a statement commemorating the fact, reflecting on the fact that this is the five-year anniversary this week of former President Trump inviting the Taliban to Camp David.

We certainly expect to see her on Remembrance Sunday in early November, but certainly, we will not be seeing her in any foreign trips. William will be doing his foreign trip alone, and big engagements, big receptions, probably unlikely to see her there. And it may be that by Christmas, she feels strong enough to embark ona full program of engagements next year. It may not.

We do know that for many patients, there can be short term and long-term side effects with chemotherapy. Short term are the ones that we often think about, like hair loss or nausea.But, long term, some patients can experience neuropathy. That's feeling a nerve tingling, nerve -- sometimes nerve damage. We know that some patients continue to feel some fatigue. We know that some patients can even sometimes experience changes in their weight. Sometimes they may experience heart problems or even mood changes. So, these are sometimes the long-term effects that we often don't see so frequently when we think about chemo treatment and some of the side effects patients may experience. Now, we still don't know much information as far as Kate Middleton's cancer type, but we still also don't know the stage, but we do know the news that she did share with us today about finishing her chemo treatment and then moving forward. What we can expect is, I'm sure her medical team will do some follow-up appointments with her, will continue to monitor over time.

It was -- we're expecting her to go through a few months of this chemotherapy, but it actually has gone on until around now. I don't know specifically where it is, but it is great news that she has completed that. It is shown under other treatments, that hasn't been confirmed. We also asked, does this mean she is cancer free? And the palace wouldn't be drawn on that because this is a question that we need to ask cancer experts. But -- so, I don't want to say she is cancer free, but certainly she has completed the course of chemotherapy, and it suggests that she is physically much better than she was.She does -- she is in good spirits, I'm told, but she doesn't feel she has fully recovered physically, I think emotionally as well. This has taken a huge toll on her and her family. So, they're going to return to light duties until the end of the year. She won't be going on big foreign trips. She was due to be going to South Africa in coming months. That won't be the case, but she will be going to remember the fallen soldiers at the Cenotaph ceremony, for example. But, there does come a caveat that this is going to be flexible. So, it depends how she feels. They may cancel things at the last minute. We shouldn't read too much into that. She just wants to focus on a full recovery, and she doesn't want to put any risk to that. She has a huge amount of gratitude for the support she has had from cancer survivors, from cancer sufferers, from the families around those. She has really connected with that journey. And obviously, this is a very positive journey, which is why she is sharing it right now. People who get this diagnosis, it can go either way, but there is hope as well that you can recover, at least to the extent that she has recovered up to this point. She talks about how having a relatively normal life, going to school with the kids, trying to look after the kids as much as possible, has been really important to her recovery, but also spending time in nature, connecting with nature. So, I don't know if you had a chance to show the video just yet, but it does show her in Norfolk. That was filmed last month near their family home, and I think that really reflects that, and she looks well in it. So, they've made a big decision to say she is going back to work, but we'll wait to see how much we actually see of her. I think there'll be glimpses, rather than the big formal engagements that we expected to see her last year, for example.",

Pennsylvania is also important in the Senate race, where a Republican challenger is threatening to flip the seat.

I'm curious what you've heard from voters there on the ground. JONATHAN SALANT, ASSISTANT MANAGING EDITOR, POLITICS, PITTSBURGH POST- GAZETTE: Well, it's excitement just nationally. Pennsylvania is not alone since Harris replaced Biden on the ticket. I wrote a story (inaudible) Biden said goodbye at the Democratic National Convention. It was all his enthusiasm.

He spoke to those people very eloquently in 2016. It was why he carried Pennsylvania and carried Michigan and carried Wisconsin, the blue wall states, states that usually vote Democratic in presidential elections, but in 2016 voted Republican for the first time in years.And Biden switched them. Biden comes from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Those are his people. Harris comes from California.

In 2000, he was the presidential nominee. If he had carried Tennessee, he'd be President -- he would have been President. The thing was Shapiro was the only candidate that people objected to. The head of the United Auto Workers went on Sunday morning talk show.
