      "sentences": "This morning, new fallout as Donald Trump faces a stunning legal filing with just a few weeks left in his presidential run. A judge has unsealed never-before-see evidence in special counsel Jack Smith's election subversion case, as federal prosecutors now try to prove Donald Trump should be prosecuted under the presidential immunity act. Basically that he was not the president in his capacity when he did some of these things. Smith writing, \"at its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one. He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate.\"Former Manhattan prosecutor Jeremy Saland and CNN senior legal analyst, Elie Honig, joining us now. First to you, Elie. We are seeing an incredible amount of information that we weren't - none of us, the public, the media, no one was privy to until Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed them. Why were they unsealed?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is all about immunity. So, if we remember, a year ago or so Jack Smith returned the indictment on Donald Trump relating to January 6th. It was a very broad indictment.Since then, though, this past summer, the U.S. Supreme Court said a lot of the stuff, some of the stuff in this indictment, is immune and has to come out. Some of it is in a sort of gray area and you, on the district court, have to figure it out. And some of it can probably stay in. So, this is Jack Smith saying, OK, Judge Chutkan, we've taken out the stuff that he's definitely immune for. And here's us defending the rest of it, arguing why he's not immune. And the sentence you just showed, Sara, uses the word \"private\" three times. That's the gist of Jack Smith's argument, that Donald Trump's conduct here was not being done as president, it was done in his private capacity. SIDNER: Yes, He may have been in office as the president, but he was doing this in his campaign or private capacity. That's a really good point, Elie. Jeremy, this is a - this is a lot to read through. It's a book. It's 165 some odd pages. What was your takeaway from - from sort of what you saw in this - in this indictment?",

He, you know, let them riot. I don't care. Some of the words that this president uttered and said are - are - really should shock your conscience, whether you're a Republican or Democrat.

I think the response that we're hearing from Trump's lawyers is, this is not a trial. This is Jack Smith unilaterally laying out his evidenced. It's not been subject to the rules of evidence. In fact, some of the stuff that Jack Smith puts in there, he says, I don't even believe this can come into the trial, but I'm telling you, Judge Chutkan. Now, that's fine to do, but it means the jury wouldn't see it. And, I would argue, this has not been subject to cross-examination. So, anytime a prosecutor has the floor to himself or herself, I've had it, you can make a quite compelling case.

And whatever Judge Chutkan decides to do here, whatever she leaves in or out of the case, that gets appealed back up to the U.S. Supreme Court.So, it's possible the Supreme Court says more of the case has to be removed.

I mean he had to respond to the Supreme Court saying that there is immunity for these official acts and then there's those that are within the duty of the president that are proceed and really are - are going to be subject to immunity. So, he had to do this. He had to put this forth for the court.And it was the court's decision, not Jack Smith's decision ultimately, to present this to the public and allow the public to see it subject to some redactions.
