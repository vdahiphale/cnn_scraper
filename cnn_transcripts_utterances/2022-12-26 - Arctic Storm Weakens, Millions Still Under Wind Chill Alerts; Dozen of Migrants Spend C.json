      "sentences": "A very warm good morning to you. Those joining in the United States and indeed wherever you are joining me from around the world. I'm Richard Quest, I'm in London and this is CNN NEWSROOM.The extreme winter weather threat is most certainly not over yet for millions of Americans. Relief is around the corner eventually. Vladimir Putin says he is ready to negotiate over Ukraine so long as Russia gets what it wants. You will hear Ukraine's response to that ultimatum. And China is downplaying the rapidly spreading COVID-19 outbreak. The country's overwhelmed health care system tells a very different story to the official numbers. It is Monday, it's December 26. If you are in a commonwealth country, then it's Boxing Day. A very happy Boxing Day to you. Don't worry if you don't understand Boxing Day. Most of us don't. It's 9:00 in the morning in London, 4:00 in the morning on the East Coast of the United States. By the end of the brutal temperatures is in sight. There is relief finally for millions of Americans after this historic winter storm that's left at least 37 people dead. Now, conditions did begin to improve on Sunday, and that meant emergency workers were able to get out, survey the extent of the damage and offer assistance. At least 17 deaths in New York alone where officials say many of those who died were either homeless or stranded in their cars in the below freezing temperatures. The state's governor is requesting an emergency disaster declaration from the federal government that will help it cover the costs of the storm. So, these were the scenes as officials were able to get out and start trying to put things right. You will notice many of the streets were blocked by snow and emergency vehicles which themselves became stranded. Near Hamburg -- that's the New York -- it gives you an idea of how cold it is across much of the northeastern United States. And a warning for residents from the governor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATHY HOCHUL, (D) NEW YORK GOVERNOR: You need to stay off the roads. We've been begging, we've been asking you, and the vast majority of you have. And I'm grateful for that. But those of you who violate the driving bans, you may think that you can go to the store for that six pack, but you are endangering over people and it's frustrating because our state and county plows have been out there nonstop giving up time and putting themselves in danger driving through blinding snowstorms to clear the roads, they clear them and now all of a sudden because someone wanted to go out to the store or just run and visit a friend or take pictures of the snow, they are now stranded and we have to expand our emergency operations a rescue to them as well.

Santa Claus came to this shelter where the migrants are sleeping and spending the night and many other locals bringing toys, bringing gifts for so many of the children that are here with their parents. I spoke to one mother who told me this present would have been completely impossible in my native Venezuela. And this is inexpensive gifts that are making these children and families really grateful on Christmas day.Look, a lot of the people here cannot go to the city-run shelters. The city of El Paso has opened the convention center, but only about 300 people are sleeping there. Because in order to go to that location, you need to have the proper documentation. So, the only option they have is a nonprofit shelter like this one run by Sacred Heart Church in El Paso. But they are completely at capacity. Their capacity is for about 130 people and they are sleeping about 200 of them every day when the temperature is about 20 degrees. But the problem is because they don't fit, a lot of these migrants have to sleep outside that's why you are seeing so many blankets. That's why you're seeing one next to each other because they're always trying to keep warm. So many of help telling me I don't necessarily want to be here, but it is the necessity from my country that have forced us to come here. I talked to one father who told me that he saw Santa Claus here and he took a picture with him, sent it to his 7-year-old son in Venezuela and told him, look, Santa is in the U.S., so the bike that you so desperately want is going to be delayed because Santa is still here in the U.S. He says that when he finds a job here in the U.S., he will be able to send his son that bike.

What is it exactly that President Putin is willing to discuss when it comes to getting the two parties to the negotiating table because of course it is not straightforward. We've seen attempts in the past may have failed in this is now 10 months on. President Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he's not going to negotiate with President Putin while Putin's troops are still on the ground in Ukrainian territory. And of course, that bombardment is still continuing. And of course, when it comes to the question of territory, how far is President Putin willing to compromise on that? We've seen the annexation of four key regions on the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine. President Zelenskyy will not accept that.",

Those four key regions which President Putin says were legitimately annexed. That it was the will of the Ukrainian people. That simply is unacceptable to President Zelenskyy and indeed much of the international community.And then there's the question of whether Putin's words can actually be trusted. We've heard repeatedly from Ukrainian officials and indeed U.S. officials saying that President Putin has up until this point shown no interest in bringing about any sort of mediated resolution, in taking part in any sort of diplomatic efforts to negotiate a resolution to this conflict. Can his word be trusted? That is the question particularly as we are still see the bombardment continue and concerns over intensification within the year.",

It is divided U.S. government that will arrive in January. And it means Democrats may find it harder to pass legislation. As we wait to see what happens, the House Democrat Jamie Raskin is speaking up saying the next step is to save our democracy by reforming the Electoral College. Americans don't select the U.S. president directly, is the strange construct called the Electoral College. They vote for their state electors who in turn are expected to carry out the will of the voters when they meet and vote for the president. Let's not get too detailed on the Electoral College. Most Americans have difficulty understanding the full ramifications anyway. Raskin says it is time to revamp the system.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): The Electoral College now, which has given us five popular vote losers as president in our history twice in this century alone, has become a danger not just to democracy, but to the American people. It was a danger on January 6, there are so many curving byways and nooks and crannies in the electoral college that there are opportunities for loot of strategic mischief. We should elect the president the way we elect governors, senators, mayors, representatives, everybody else. Whoever gets the most votes wins. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He joins me in London. Now this is really straightforward, isn't it? Let's deal with this call for the Electoral College -- as I'm sure as long as you can remember, people have been saying, well, popular vote versus electoral vote, doesn't really work, but nobody can find a way to change it. RICHARD JOHNSON, LECTURER IN U.S. POLITICS, QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON: That's right. The last time that the Constitution was amended to try to fix some elements of the Electoral College was in the early 19th century with the 12th amendment. We've heard, you know, talk about amending the Constitution which is what you would need to do to change the Electoral College after the 2000 election, after 2016 and nothing came of it. There is one way around it though, which is that the state legislatures could actually pass legislation that says that they will cast their Electoral College votes to the popular vote winner. And if you can get states to add up to 270 electoral votes which is the majority, you could actually kind of bypass the Electoral College. And there is some effort do that in the States. We are not at 270 yet. But that probably is the most likely way that you can get around the Electoral College.",

I think earlier in his presidency there was some doubt whether he'd face a significant challenge in a Democratic primary. I think that that is less likely now. I think that he's had a good year.

I would say that, you know, that's going to be something that will be a challenge against him. I think that he has not demonstrated any particular incident where he's been unable to fulfill the duties of the presidency because of his age, not at least not in any ways that we've seen.But yes, he does look old and he is old. And I think, you know, I think that's going to be something that he will probably have to carefully manage. He probably won't be campaigning quite in the same vigorous fashion as a younger candidate.

Vladimir Putin says he is ready to negotiate on Ukraine but will continue to fight until all of Russia's goals are accomplished. Several countries are condemning the Taliban's decision to ban female employees of aid organizations from working. Four major international aid agencies have announced that they are temporarily suspending operations in the country. They say that they cannot effectively reach women and other women in desperate need in Afghanistan without their female staff. The Red Cross and the EU says the move will severely restrict the aid and delivery of aid in the region. And the EU is urging the Taliban to reverse its decision. Qatar has expressed deep concern over the ban. However, in a tweet a Taliban spokesperson has lashed out at a U.S. official asking her not to interfere in Afghanistan's internal issues. David Wright is with me, chief operating officer for Save the Children International. The aid group has temporarily suspended its operations in Afghanistan.
