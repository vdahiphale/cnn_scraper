      "sentences": "President Biden is campaigning today in Wisconsin. It is his fourth visit to the badger state this year. He is there to highlight a new $3.3 billion dollar investment by Microsoft in a new artificial intelligence data center. It is one of the many such announcements he has made in key states in recent weeks, trying to turn around polls that show him trailing to Donald Trump in most national and battleground state polls.Joining me now for more on his campaign strategy is Michael Tyler. He is the Biden-Harris Campaign Communications Director. Thank you so much for being here. I appreciate it. Let's start with what the president is doing today shortly actually, while he has been generally crisscrossing the battleground states, as I said, all told, unveiling $866 billion in development. So the question is what I mentioned, which is the race still looks like a toss up to us today. Are there any signs that you are seeing that these efforts, like what he is going to do in Wisconsin, are moving the needle? MICHAEL TYLER, BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think there are a couple of things. First, thanks so much for having me. I think as it relates to what the president is doing today, he is of course there in his official capacity in Racine, announcing $3.3 billion in investment. I do think it stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump's fraudulent economic record of broken promises to American workers. He showed up in Racine when he was president, golden shovel in hand, promising the eighth wonder of the world and 13,000 jobs. That eighth wonder never showed up. He did the same thing in cities like Warren, Michigan and Lordstown, Ohio, where he promised auto workers that the factories wouldn't close. We saw six auto plants close under Donald Trump's presidency. So, you have one candidate who has a track record of breaking his promises to the American worker, and you have another in Joe Biden who is keeping his promises to American workers, and that's a choice that we think the American people are going to fundamentally understand as we move forward in this election. I think as it relates to the polls, to the second part of your question, first, there is as many polls at this stage in the race where were up is when they are down. But I think as it relates to polling right now, we are not going to put too much stock in any of those. We are going to focus on doing the things that we know we need to do as a campaign in order to win this election in November. That's why were out today with another $14 million in advertisements that are going to run across all eight battleground states. That's why were scaling up our physical infrastructure in the states. We've got 150 offices across all the battleground states. By the end of May, it will be up to 200. That's why we are deepening our organizing presence, working with small businesses so that they can be staging locations for a lot of our programmatic efforts on the ground, again, in all the battleground states. And you take that against what Donald Trump is doing, the lack of infrastructure, the fact that they are closing minority outreach centers, the fact that the president -- today's is Wednesday, he could be campaigning, Donald Trump could be, but he is down in Mar-a-Lago. No matter where he is --",

I hear what you are saying about polls, but it is hard to argue with the fact that on the question of the economy and who voters see as more successful, that they trust more on the economy, that Trump has an edge over Biden every step of the way. So, how are you going to convince voters of what you just said? That Trump -- that the economy wasn't great under Trump when that is not how a lot of them feel.",

Black America, for example, the thing that went up by the end of his presidency was the unemployment rate, as long -- as well as the uninsured rate. These are the facts and this is exactly why you run a relentless campaign from now until November to compare the records and compare the vision where we are going to take this country under another four years of either Joe Biden or Donald Trump. And we are confident that if we deliver that message day in and day out from now until November, the American people are going to know that there is one candidate who is fighting for them in Joe Biden and another candidate who simply fighting for himself no matter where he is in Donald Trump.",

And that is what the voters are telling us. And so, we are going to continue to talk about the contrast of visions for where we want to take this economy, whether we are going to want to continue to build it from the middle out and the bottom-up, as Joe Biden knows that we need to do, or are we going to return to the failed trickle-down approach that Donald Trump tried where it was nothing but handouts to the super-rich and corporations.We are going to talk about the issue of abortion, are we going to restore Roe as Joe Biden wants to do or are we going to continue to see the chaos play out in states across the country that Donald Trump has created? We are going to talk about our very democracy. We are going to continue to protect and defend our democracy or are we going to tear down the very fabric of it by having somebody who wants to rule as a dictator on day one, if they are able to return to power in Donald Trump?

She is the governor. She put in her book these details and then she gets upset when the press then proceeds to ask about these details, whether it is her anecdote about Kim Jong Un or her killing her dog Cricket. When it comes to the VP stakes for Donald Trump, I think, look, ultimately Donald Trump is going to make his decision based on who is the most loyal to him and he isn't someone who is necessarily fond of dogs himself.

CNN has reached out to the campaign about the story. Last week, the campaign was asked about RFK Jr.'s health issues impacting his run, a spokeswoman called it \"hilarious,\" and said that that was hilarious given his competition. We have now got CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta with us, who of course is a neurosurgeon. This really is a real thing? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, this is a real thing. It has a name, a neurocysticercosis . What that basically means is, typically, and again, were just hearing this from the deposition, so we don't have medical records, but what it very much sounds like is something that happens when people eat pork that has been undercooked and the larvae from the pork can actually, that is not been killed by my cooking enough, gets into the bloodstream and then can travel all over the body. That's what can happen. It can show up in different organs around the body, yes, including the brain. And let me show you, I think we have an image of what this might look like on a scan. You can see what happens is that these larvae will get into the brain. It is not eating the brain, first of all, it is just sort of finding a home in the brain. And then eventually, those purple dots that you may see on the image there, that is sort of these cysts that form around it. They sort of create these walls around the larvae in the brain. And that's what people will see on a scan. It can cause symptoms in people not typically memory loss or cognitive problems, but more headaches, sometimes people might have seizures, or many times they are just found incidentally. What I mean by that, Dana, is that he may have gotten scans because he was having some issues. They find these things, but it doesn't mean --",

Typically, again, it is from people who've eaten undercooked pork and we sort of put the story together, get the scan, and it all fits. By removing that, you can actually get a lot of relief of the symptoms. Again, most times people do not need surgery. And many times, it can be treated with medications alone.
