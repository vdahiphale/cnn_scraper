      "sentences": "Well, it certainly means that this right-wing Israeli government is sensing an opportunity with the incoming Donald Trump presidency.And, in fact, that's what Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, who also oversees two key departments within the Ministry of Defense, responsible for settlement activity, he tied his decision to lay the groundwork here for annexing these settlements, Israeli settlements in the West Bank directly to Donald Trump's election. Saying he sees it a, quote, \"important opportunity\" for the state of Israel. And he's saying that because he believes that President Trump, once he comes into office, would support annexing these Israeli settlements. Now, we haven't heard directly from Trump on this issue. Certainly, not since Smotrich made this announcement. But we do know is that, back in 2020, when Trump put out his peace plan at the time, it did, indeed, call for recognizing Israeli settlements inside the West Bank as part of a peace plan that would also see the establishment of a Palestinian state. And so certainly, Smotrich and other members of the Netanyahu government have reason for optimism that Trump will give the Israeli government much more leeway in the West Bank but also perhaps in Gaza and other areas related to the current war than the Biden administration has. We know that the Israeli prime minister himself has said that he has spoken with Donald Trump three times now in just the last week. And so that is certainly indicative of a very close relationship that they will have. Whether or not that includes accepting and recognizing the annexation of Israeli settlements is perhaps another question. And also, we note that the prime minister himself has yet to weigh in on this move by his finance minister -- Brianna, Boris?",

Merecedes, I want -- there was no murder weapon discovered, but there was this bullet that was found near the bodies of the girls. And -- it was unfired. But once you had bullets fired through the weapon, the six-hour of Richard Allen and compared markings on it, there was a match. Now there was a defense witness who said that that was nothing conclusive, because a bullet that is unfired versus a bullet that is fired, this is comparing apples to oranges. It seems the jury did not buy that. MERCEDES COLWIN, LEGAL ANALYST &amp; TRIAL ATTORNEY: You're exactly right, Brianna. And it really was a ballistics expert that made it clear that there's a strong possibility that that bullet was connected to Richard Allen. But really, what was the most damning -- and we know that the defense fought so hard to keep those jailhouse confessions out of courtroom -- were those recordings. You can't unhear what Richard Allen said repeatedly to them. You can't unhear what Richard Allen said repeatedly to his wife. \"I killed them, but will you still love me?\" Those were such -- and of course, the defense tried to distance Richard Allen from those confessions, saying we have an expert that says that it was -- that his conditions we're so deplorable in the prison, in solitary confinement, he started to lose reality and that's why he made those confessions. The jury didn't buy that either. But really, at the end of the day, it was the horrors of what happened to those two young girls and those jailhouse confessions that really brought it home for the families.",

And to your point, the deplorable conditions that the defense broughtup during the course of the proceedings, saying that those conditions were so terrible that he started to lose reality. He started to lose himself. He started to become crazy, quote/unquote, \"crazy\" in those circumstances. And frankly, at the end of the day, you have a constitutional right for a fair trial. If you can point out that any of these evidentiary rulings deprived him of due process and a fair trial, certainly, one will be those tapes. Secondly would be those conditions. If he can't -- if he, Richard Allen, cannot understand the proceedings -- and it wasn't questioned during that court, but we'll see what happens on appeal. They might bring that up and say that might be the basis for an appeal and try to look for a new trial, But it is very difficult, as you know, to overturn a jury verdict, especially one of this magnitude.",

He gave very specific details in some of those confessions as to what happened. That there was a white van and that scared him. And so, because of that, he didn't commit sexual assault as was his plan. Well, there was a white van that a resident had that lived a very close distance away from the crime scene. And so the defense argued -- he had his legal documents in the cell and he read them. But on the other hand, the specificity, I think, also is something the jury looked at.",
