That's the public health rule that the U.S. used nearly three million times to immediately expel undocumented people under pandemic restrictions.Communities along the border have been experiencing a surge in migrants ahead of that policy change. A source says the U.S. government is estimating more than 150,000 people are waiting to cross in northern Mexico alone. Let's take you now to the southern border and CNN is Nick Valencia who's live for us in Brownsville. And, Nick, a big question is about the misinformation that some of these migrants have been receiving. The folks that you're speaking to there on the ground, are they aware of Title 42 expiring at midnight tonight?",

Nick Valencia reporting from Brownsville, Texas, thank you so much. I want to pivot now to the White House and take you to CNN White House correspondent Jeremy Diamond who has been tracking the latest. Jeremy, DHS Secretary Mayorkas just gave a briefing from the podium. You asked him a very important question.The White House rolling out these new policies about asylum this week announcing these new processing centers. The question ultimately is why it took so long for them to roll these out if they knew Title 42 was set to expire. What was the answer Mayorkas gave you?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's exactly right, Boris. Listen, the secretary of Homeland Security came out here with two messages. One, he wanted to make clear that the U.S. border is not open and that anybody who comes to the border and crosses unlawfully will now be presumed ineligible for asylum automatically under these new immigration rules. The second thing that he wanted to make clear is that the administration has been preparing for today. Preparing with new asylum rules by surging resources to the border and several other measures.But as you just pointed out, the question that I asked the secretary is, look, we heard President Biden say just a couple of days ago that the situation at the southern border is going to be \"chaotic for a while\" as Title 42 expires. And so, I asked him, how can that be given the preparations that he is now talking about? And the secretary's answer was essentially to say, look, we have a broken immigration system. We do not have enough resources. And despite the preparations, we are still expecting to face a challenge. He said that he has been clear-eyed for weeks now about the challenge that law enforcement is going to face at the border. He has nonetheless expressed confidence in border security personnel despite those challenges. But it does raise the question. You look at those regional migration processing centers, they were on a screen in the White House briefing today as a deterrence measure. And yet none of those regional processing centers have actually opened up yet in countries like Guatemala or Colombia, where the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State said that they would open. Of the 1500 troops that have been deployed to the southern border, only about 550 are actually there. Now, there are a lot of other resources that have been surged there, including additional DHS personnel, for example. And these new asylum rules are now in place. But nonetheless, there is a fundamental irony here that despite these preparations, they are still expecting a chaotic and very challenging situation, something that we have heard, of course, the Republican lawmakers call out. And this is a test for the administration. A big political test and a big logistical test for this president.",
