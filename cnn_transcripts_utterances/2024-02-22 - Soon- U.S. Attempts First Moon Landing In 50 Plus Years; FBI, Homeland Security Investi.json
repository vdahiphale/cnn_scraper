NASA, when it retired (ph) the space shuttle, got into the commercial crew program, sending astronauts to the International Space Station with private vehicles operated by private companies. And now we're doing the same thing with exploring the moon. So it kind of is a great way, I think, to not only use the brainpower and the resources of NASA, of a great agency, but also of the entrepreneurial spirit and the businesses that we have that are interested in trying to explore for commercial reasons.",

And now they're in a position where they want to do a de-orbit burn and get close to the moon's surface.And as Kristin said earlier, this is a tough part of the moon to land on. When we sent the Apollo astronauts 50 years ago and we were sending spacecraft to the moon, they landed around the equator. It's a much easier place to get to. It's a much easier place to land, less rocks, less obstacles. But the south pole, where this spacecraft is going, is near a source of water, which is why we're very interested in that, because you need water to sustain life for long-term exploration of the moon, but it's a more difficult place to get to, and it's a more difficult place to land. When Neil Armstrong on Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he had to move the landing site manually. He saw he was coming down in a boulder field, was able to take over manually and fly the spacecraft to where it could land successfully. You don't have a person on board on this one. So in some ways, it makes it harder because you don't have that intervention, human intervention, to make those last-second adjustments. So it's going to be an automatic landing. The spacecraft is going to be on its own. And that's not going to be easy, especially those last few seconds of making sure that it can land a soft landing, which means not crashing into the moon, but landing softly and successfully.",

It's called Volt Typhoon. And the bulletin readsSo what you're seeing is the government telling us that critical infrastructure, things like the cellular phone carriers, are the target of these infiltration plans. Now, the Chinese one which is called Volt Typhoon, is one that they wanted to warn people about because it hides within the operating system and looks like the normal operations of your system. But the Russians, for years, ran something called Cozy Bear, which was part of the SolarWinds infiltration, where they basically took the system that people use to update their computers and install things and install patches and all that overnight and infiltrated that. So it's one of the go-to theories when there's no explanation. Now, let's be clear. The least likelihood here is probably a cyber attack. It's going to end up being more likely something technical. But right now, it's such a massive failure. And there's zero explanation for what caused it.
