General Assembly approved the resolution that backs giving Palestinians full membership. Then Israeli whistleblowers speak out about what they say is the systematic abuse of Palestinian prisoners in the shadowy detention center. We'll have exclusive CNN investigation. Plus, unprecedented flooding in Brazil. Dozens of people are missing with more rain unfortunately on the way. But first, we begin tonight -- but first, we begin tonight with a dire as well as the increasingly desperate situation in Gaza and in Rafah in particular. The U.N. today warning that the humanitarian plight there has reached quote, \"even more unprecedented levels of emergency\". Aid agencies said there are simply not enough supplies. Many hospitals we've been told will stop being able to provide services within the next day or so due to a lack of fuel, which is something we heard on the ground yesterday, if you remember, right here on the show. All this as tens of thousands of people leave Rafah, the southern city under threat of an Israeli invasion. A displaced Palestinian shares the hardship that he's facing. Have a listen to this.

You heardthe Palestinian representative there speak about the flag being flown above campuses, universities in the United States. And he was emotional about that. And I think that this is what we're witnessing. The vote required a two- thirds majority, it got actually close to three-quarters of all the votes, nine against, 25 abstentions, but 143 is a big figure, and there were strong language, obviously both from the Palestinian representative and from the Israeli representative who described that, this sort of vote would in effect allow a state. And this is why we're shredding the U.N. charter, because he was saying the U.N. charter was established after World War II, which was to block countries like Nazi, Germany from, you know -- from ever existing in the future. And he said that by accepting the Palestinian state in, you're accepting a terrorist state, a modern Nazi state is what he called it. It fell to the -- it fell to the Pakistani representative who took up the podium right after the Israeli representative to say that, that sort of language was an insult to the General Assembly. And really, the tone of the language really gives you that sense of how much the ground is shifting. Now, the Palestinian representatives at the U.N. will now be able to propose debates, to be able to talk about issues other than just sort of Palestinian Middle East issues and engage more fully. But it was the United States just a month ago that vetoed that the Security Council, which is where the final decision about accepting Palestine to be a member state of the United Nations. That decision will have to be taken and the United States has vetoed that just a month ago and indicating that they would -- they would do it again.",

And that's because not only are there 1.4 million people, many of them displaced living in that city. But also, because it has become a hub of aid work, of the ability to bring in that aid and quickly and effectively distribute it to the people who need it most. And so, now what we are witnessing beyond the mass displacement of people, 110,000 people or so already having been displaced from Rafah is a breakdown of certain key aspects of humanitarian support inside of Rafah. One of Rafah's three partially functioning hospitals out of commission as patients and staff were forced to evacuate. In addition to that, you're witnessing the Rafah Border Crossing, which has been closed throughout this entire week. And then the people who are being displaced from Rafah who were then moving north, they're heading to this Al-Mawasi humanitarian zone as it's being called by the Israeli military. And what they're finding there are -- is a sandy area that doesn't have sewage, doesn't in many cases have running water, electricity. People living in makeshift shelters and tents on the sides of roads, prompting the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, to warn that this will be a quote, \"epic humanitarian disaster if the Israeli military proceeds with an expanded and all-out ground offensive in Rafah.\"",

But speak to this moment right now, that for months, I've been hearing from guests on my show, calls from politicians and NGOs talking about what this would mean, right? Into -- going into Rafah. Now, this is looking like it will happen. Your reaction? HUSAM ZOMLOT, HEAD OF THE PALESTINIAN MISSION TO THE U.K.: Well, Netanyahu has learned over the last seven months, perhaps the last seven decades that he can cross every red line, the U.S. has told him that this is a red line. The U.K., Europe, the rest of the world, the U.N., the ICJ, ICC, the Security Council, name it. He doesn't care, simply because he will not get the serious consequences. He has many statements and sympathies and warnings, should he go to Rafah? It will be catastrophe beyond description. You're talking about 1.5 million people, 600,000 children are scattered in the streets of Rafah. Can you imagine what will happen with his tanks and the way he did it in the north and in the middle of Gaza, he simply has made up his mind, that is Netanyahu, the Israeli government, they have made up their mind.

But it's the witness now expected to testify on Monday that may very well make or break the prosecution's case. Prosecutors plan to call Michael Cohen to the stand. Trump's former attorney and fixer, who is now a bitter enemy of the former president. They'll try to show a link between Cohen's $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, of course, who we heard this week, and an alleged plot to Donald Trump to cover it up. Among those testifying today -- testifying today, former Trump White House aide Madeleine Westerhout, known as the eyes and ears of the western -- West Wing during the first two years of his administration. She told jurors Trump would often sign checks without reviewing them first. Let's get more on all these trends for you and what to expect on Monday. Criminal defense attorney Janet Johnson joins me now. Janet, great to see you. Let's push ahead to Monday because I think that's where everyone is looking forward to now. Prosecutions -- the prosecution's star witness, I should say, is expected to testify, Michael Cohen. What should defense attorneys be doing this weekend, you think to prepare here?",

He's not our lawyer. You know who is in bed with Michael Cohen for years? You know, whose lawyer Michael Cohen was, Donald Trump. So, if you think that Michael Cohen has credibility issues, if you think he's slimy, if you think he's sleazy, he was the fixer for Donald Trump. And you know, quite frankly, who has a fixer who didn't do anything wrong? I think they'll embrace that he has these foibles that he's not necessarily squeaky clean. He's been to jail, but he did all that at the service of Donald Trump. I think that gives him credibility.",

Those messages came from his AT&amp;T account. So, they had to jump through the hoops because the defense said, no, we're not agreeing. And that's not an outrageous thing, I've done that and drown myself. I don't necessarily want to make the job easier for the prosecution, but often times, just to move the trial along, both sides agree. So, they didn't do that. They went through all of those. It's important to authenticate that any information that Michael Cohen testifies to is corroborated that it came from his cell phone. There were calls that came from Donald Trump contemporaneous to some of these transactions that occurred. So, all of that was really important. And then they wrapped up with you know, essentially the secretary to Donald Trump, to Madeleine Westerhout, who was a pretty effective witness for the defense. And any time someone in the states' case gets in the stand and doesn't hurt the defense, the defense feels pretty good walking away. I mean, she's sort of humanize Trump. And here's a woman who said, you know, he had some fondness for his wife, contradicted a few of the things that Stormy Daniels said, not necessarily a homerun for the defense, but not as harmful as some of the other witnesses.",
