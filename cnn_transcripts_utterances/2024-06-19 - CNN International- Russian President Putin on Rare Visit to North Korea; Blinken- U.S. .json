      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Eleni Giokos. Here are some of today's top stories.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladimir Putin are sitting down for talks in Pyongyang. It's Putin's first visit to North Korea in 24 years. The Russian state news agency says Kim expressed his support and solidarity for Russia's military operation in Ukraine. Cyril Ramaphosa will be sworn in later today for a second term as President of South Africa. He will head a coalition government since his party, the African National Congress was unable to secure an outright win in last month's general election. NVIDIA is now the largest publicly traded company in the world, taking the title from Microsoft. Its computer chips are essential in producing processes that power artificial intelligence systems. NVIDIA's stock is up roughly 174 percent for the year. Well, Russian President Vladimir Putin is thanking North Korea for its, quote, consistent and unwavering support for Russian policy. Those comments coming during his visit to Pyongyang as he sat down for talks with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. According to TASS, that meeting including the signing of a new strategic partnership agreement and an invitation for Kim to visit Moscow. We've got CNN's Ivan Watson joining us from Hong Kong with more. Good to see you, Ivan. And this coming through just a short time ago, that Putin and Kim signing this new strategic partnership pact. And we've got to remember, these pacts have been signed before between the two countries, who basically replaced the previous ones. Why is this one strategic and specific? What do we know about how the relationship between Russia and North Korea has evolved through the years?",

      "sentences": "Well, we don't actually know how this is different. The Kremlin official who signaled that this would be signed, this new strategic partnership, he insisted that this is not confrontational and also indicated that it is kind of an evolution of a handful of previous treaties and bilateral declarations that the different governments in Moscow and Pyongyang have made in the past.But it does show, I think, also the fact that this is the second face- to-face meeting between Putin and Kim Jong-un in nine months. It does show a warming of ties between these two governments. And if you're wondering why they seem to be getting closer right now, take a listen to what Kim Jong-un had to say during their meeting earlier today in Pyongyang.

      "sentences": "It is Russia's war in Ukraine that I believe has pushed the Kremlin closer to the most isolated country in the world, North Korea. It is because Vladimir Putin is more isolated internationally now than he was even three years ago. And his statements have been full of condemnations of what he describes as imperialistic U.S. behavior in the world, a desire to redraw a world order to make it more multipolar and putting him in line with North Korea's regime. Which faces sanctions from the United Nations Security Council and which Russia has actually made moves to help protect North Korea from those types of sanctions in just the last couple of months.So that is something that is driving these two countries, these two strongmen closer together. Of course, the White House and the South Korean government have accused North Korea of supplying Russia with conventional weapons, like potentially thousands of containers worth of -- full of artillery rounds, something that North Korea has denied -- Eleni.",

Good to see you.Well, Israel is warning Hezbollah there could potentially be an all out war after the Iran backed militant group published a nine minute long video of military and civilian sites in Israel. Now the video appears to show sites in highly populated Israeli cities close to the Lebanese border, hinting that Hezbollah could strike major targets there. Meantime, America's top diplomat is confirming an ongoing pause of a heavy bomb shipment to Israel as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tries to ramp up pressure on the United States. Antony Blinken says the Biden administration is reviewing the 2,000?pound bomb shipment that was paused last month over concerns they may be used in densely populated areas in Gaza. [04:35:00] Now in a video message, Netanyahu says it's, quote: Inconceivable that the U.S. has been withholding weapons and ammunitions from Israel and added that Blinken has assured him the restrictions would be lifted. We've got CNN's Scott McLean with us from Istanbul, who will uncover all these top lines. I mean, firstly, I want to start off with Hezbollah and Israel and, you know, the concern about there being an escalation and just what we've been seeing on the rhetoric fronts. And even with this video that was released. What do we understand about the risks right now?",

      "sentences": "Sure. So, you have a senior U.S. official, Eleni, named Amos Hochstein, who has been doing some shuttle diplomacy over the last few days. And Monday, he was in Israel. Yesterday, he was in Lebanon meeting with a Hezbollah ally, among others. Trying to turn down the temperature on this whole thing and try to encourage a more diplomatic solution to the ramp up in hostilities that we have seen over the last few days and weeks.But, frankly, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was asked about whether that strategy is working. And he was pretty blunt in saying that, look, because of this back and forth that we have been seeing lately across the border, there is always, still remains the possibility of a miscalculation, which could lead to something wider. Already, you have 150,000 people across both sides of the border who have been displaced from southern Lebanon and from northern Israel as well. You have Hezbollah saying that they're not going to stop their attacks on Israel until it stops what it's doing in Gaza. And now Israel is saying that they are ready. The military has approved a plan for all-out war in Lebanon should it come to that. And the foreign minister yesterday made pretty clear that Israel is getting closer to that point where it may need to go to war. Now, Antony Blinken, Eleni, was also asked yesterday about this whole back and forth with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who put out this video specifically to foreign journalists to make two points. One, saying that the U.S. is holding up weapons and ammunition shipments, and two, that Blinken says that he's doing everything that he can to remove that bottleneck. He's referring to a closed-door meeting in person the last time Blinken was in Israel. The White House said, frankly, they genuinely did not know what the prime minister was referring to because they say that there has only been one weapon shipment that has been held up and is under review, 3,500 bombs, about half of them 500-pound bombs, the other half, 2,000-pound bombs. These are weapons that can do an enormous amount of damage, leave a huge crater, send shrapnel hundreds of feet in every single direction. And Blinken was asked about this yesterday, and specifically he said that, look, that shipment is under review. Everything else, is moving as normal. But he was also pressed on whether Netanyahu was telling the truth about his claim that Blinken says that he is trying to remove these so-called bottlenecks. Listen to the exchange.

It was here where they say he had slurred speech, unsteady footing, and he failed a field sobriety test.GINGRAS (voice-over): According to court documents, Timberlake's eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and there was a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emanating from his breath. He also refused a breathalyzer three times. The pop star allegedly telling police, I had one martini and I followed my friends home. Authorities report giving him water twice while they held him overnight ahead of arraignment. This happening in the downtown district of Sag Harbor, a Tony enclave of the Hamptons where celebrity run-ins are frequent. As for Timberlake, his locally based attorney and reps aren't commenting. Timberlake is currently on tour promoting his latest album. This is Timberlake's first arrest, but the latest headline in a string of scandals that have recently plagued the pop star. Some fans turned against the singer earlier this year when Timberlake appeared to brush off criticism after ex-girlfriend Britney Spears revealed in her 2023 memoir that Timberlake encouraged her to get an abortion. Timberlake also came under fire in 2021 following a documentary about Spears' career, as well as renewed questions in the wake of the Me Too movement about his role in the infamous Super Bowl incident with Janet Jackson. He did apologize then and admit that he benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.
