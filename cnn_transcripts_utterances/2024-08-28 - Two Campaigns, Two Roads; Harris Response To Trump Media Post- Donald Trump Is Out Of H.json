And this is exactly the kind of Trump behavior that his advisors have been trying in a lot of different ways to steer him away from to avoid. They almost got there because the race was heading in their direction. But now that this has become a real contest, Trump is taking the reins back and going to the things that he understands and knows the best, which is attack, attack, attack. But at this moment, I think the Harris campaign, I thought their response was really interesting because they didn't talk about the personal attacks. They talked about Project 2025 and what they're trying to argue is that Trump is just not all there and that regular people, when they look at these posts, should be concerned about them. This is exactly the kind of argument that hurt him in 2020 and will hurt him in this election as well.",

That's when Senator Warnock had success doing this in the December 2022 runoff, shaving off some of those votes for Republicans while also winning big in Atlanta. And the person that was leading that playbook, Quentin Fulks is now the deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign. And when I spoke to him, he told me that they think that they can pull off the same thing this time around and perhaps more given the anticipated higher turnout, given that it is a presidential election year, but it requires them to pay attention to South Georgia, just as much as they're paying attention to Atlanta. They've opened up offices in that part of the state. And as noted today, they made visits. The vice president and her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, using their first trip after the Democratic National Convention to visit high school students and a barbecue joint in South Georgia. Now, a strategists that I've talked to in the state also say that there could be a good opportunity here for Tim Walz. He has roots in rural America.

Trump had a comfortable lead there going into his own convention at the RNC. Now, for Harris to have made this a margin of error race means that it really is in contention. Democrats are also looking to see how they can increase the potential of their upside. So, in the urban areas, can they increase voter registration? Can they actually get out their voters? Some of these people who might have been thinking about sitting home when the top of the ticket had Joe Biden on it, who might be willing to come out for her. So, this is a real race in that state and its going to matter because now the Harris campaign actually has the ability to press Trump.

Congressman, it's interesting to hear Donald Trump talking about what happened three years ago on Monday, the horrible killing of these 13 service members. Certainly, the Biden Administration, it's understandable, the criticism of the chaotic withdrawal and that's for voters to decide. It was interesting.I talked to H. R. McMaster earlier this week whose book is just out. He is former national security adviser who was very critical of the former president's policy toward Afghanistan. It was the former president who actually made a deal directly with the Taliban, cutting out the Afghan government from any of those talks, and it was the foreign president who actually freed 5,000 members of the Taliban from prisons in Afghanistan and drew down U.S. troops even though the Taliban was continuing to who attack and welcome back terror groups. REP. SETH MOULTON, (D-MA): That's right. Trump made a deal with terrorists, something that we don't do in America. Trump wanted to pull out of Afghanistan sooner, which would have resulted in more chaos. So, it's only people who forget their history, who can think that Trump would have handled this better. Trump would have handled it absolutely worse. And by the way, anyone who knows Trump's views on immigration knows that he wouldn't have rescued a single one of our Afghan allies, something that veterans like myself worked tirelessly to do during that withdrawal.",

Thanks so much for being back with us. So, what made you decide to issue this advisory on parental stress? DR. VIVEK MURTHY, UNITED STATES SURGEON GENERAL: Well, Anderson, as I was working on the youth mental health crisis, one of the things that became quickly apparent to me was that it wasn't just kids that were struggling, it was parents too. And as I dug into the data around this, we've found that 48 percent, nearly half of parents are saying on most days, they are completely overwhelmed by their stress. That is an extraordinary number that should alarm all of us. I also found that parents are struggling with loneliness at levels that are higher than other adults. And but actually, when you look at single parents, more than 75 percent of them are saying they're struggling with loneliness. Now, stress and loneliness together form a tough combination that can take a real toll on the mental health and well-being appearance.",

      "sentences": "So that's a really important question and there are a few things that have contributed. There are some of the traditional stresses that parenting has always entailed, parents for generations have worried about kids' safety. They've worried about their education. They worried about a whole host of things related to children, including how to manage their difficult teenage years.But there are some new factors, Anderson, that parents are dealing with today that my parents, for example, and grandparents didn't have to contend with, like how to manage social media and technology and phones in your kid's life, how to contend with a loneliness epidemic and a youth mental health crisis that's taking a profound toll on millions of kids, and also how to deal with issues like by gun violence, which are really a source of so much fear for parents and kids. Keep in mind, more than half of kids are worried now about a shooting taking place in their school. You put all of this together with one another critical factor, Anderson, and that's this intensified culture of comparison that we are all living in, that's really potentiated and fed by social media and the online environment where parents are looking around them and comparing themselves to sometimes hundreds of other parents, some of whom they know, some of whom they don't know, but they often come away feeling worse about themselves and like they're falling short as parents. COOPER: I mean, it's so interesting, it's the same thing kids are going through on social media. In that regard, this comparison culture of everybody's life on social media seems so much better than your own life, kids feel that way and it's interesting to hear so many parents feel that way. I certainly do. I always see this stuff. I have a two and a four-year-old, and I'm already worried about the teenage years and how to deal with like social media and when they -- when, if ever, they should get a phone and I'm hoping by then like, no kid will be allowed to get a phone because I don't want to even deal with that. But, what do you -- what's the answer to this? Because in 'The Times' today, you wrote -- you said that -- you talked about in the past few years, how this has been sort of looked at saying that in the past few years, we've made progress expanding access to early childhood education, maternal health programs, mental health crisis hotline for kids and adults. We have much more to do to make parenting sustainable. We have only about 30 seconds left, but what do you recommend?",
