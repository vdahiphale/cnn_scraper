Plus, the Taliban intensifies itscrackdown on women's rights, ordering all women's beauty salons in Afghanistan to close within a month. And later, a sweltering new high. The planet marks its hottest day ever. Why scientists warn this record will be broken again and again with devastating consequences. Hello, I'm Paula Newton live in New York and this is ONE WORLD. Thousands of Palestinians who were forced to flee the violence during Israel's deadly military incursion in the occupied West Bank are now returning to scenes of destruction and, of course, desperation. Piles of rubble. You see it there, ripped up roads and no running water or electricity. The IDF announced the end of its two-day operation that it says targeted militant infrastructure inside the Jenin refugee camp. But the U.N. human rights groups are warning about the devastating impact on civilians. Now, earlier, thousands marched through the streets. You see them there for the funeral of 12 Palestinians killed. Israel says one of its soldiers was also killed. Meantime, the threat of further violence looms large. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims the Operation in Jenin won't, in his words, be a one off. And early Wednesday, the IDF says it carried out airstrikes in Gaza after shooting down five rockets fired toward Israeli territory. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz spoke to my colleague Eleni Gioukos earlier about just how widespread the destruction is inside the Jenin refugee camp, which was already one of the poorest in the region.

Norunning water, no internet, no electricity. So, my cameraman is perched up on a balcony while I bring you this ground level view of one of the main thoroughfares here in Jenin Camp. And as you can see, completely torn up, just piles of rubble everywhere. The streets turned to mud. And for many families, for many residents that you see walking around me, this is the first glimpse they're getting of their own homes, they're getting of their own neighborhoods because they were forced to flee in the fighting. They were forced to flee when this massive incursion began. And I want you to get a sense of the sheer force of that. Just take a look at this vehicle. Take a look at what's happened to this car. And you see those kinds of images, this kind of vehicles, these scenes just repeated all across this camp. We understand from the Palestinian Red Crescent that some 7000 to 8000 people have now been made homeless by this Israeli raid. But what's even more extraordinary, Eleni, and I know you have those pictures to show our viewers, is that people still feel this is a place of defiance, of resistance. These streets earlier today were filled by thousands of people attending a funeral, a burial for those killed in Israel's raid. Now, Israel says it was taking out a terror network, that it was dismantling weapon sites, that it was neutralizing terror sites, what they call a terror hub here in Jenin. But the Palestinian armed factions that you see again in that video, that you see marching through those funerals say they are resisting, they are fighting occupation and they will continue to do so even though Israel says it reserves the right to come back anytime.

      "sentences": "Well, the Ukrainians insist that the only threat to the nuclear power plant is from Russia. President Zelenskyy's newallegation is very specific, and he says that it is based on Ukrainian intelligence. He said, and I quote, Russian troops have placed objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units, perhaps to simulate an attack on the plant. Perhaps they have some other scenario. He did not, though, provide any evidence to support his claim. The Russians have denied that they are any threat at all. They have previously pointed out that there are experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency which are working on site, as we speak. They say that the real threat is from Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson said today that there is a great threat of sabotage by Kyiv. Now, the IAEA Director General, Rafael Grossi, also put out his own statement saying that his staff have been on site, they've been able to inspect large parts of the actual plant. But he said this, and I quote, the IAEA experts have requested additional access that is necessary to confirm the absence of mines or explosives at the site. In particular, access to the rooftops of reactor units three and four is essential, as well as access to parts of the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system at the plant. Now, last week, Ukraine said that it began doing drills with its emergency services in a handful of regions to try to prepare for any kind of Russian terror attack. In their words, Russians say that they have also taken measures for a potential disaster at the site, as well. The latest satellite images taken last week don't immediately show anything obvious or out of the ordinary on top of the roofs of any of the reactors. The reactors themselves are built inside of containment buildings, which are meant in theory to be able to withstand the force of an accidental plane crash. How well they would hold up against the weapons of war, though, is another question. There are, though, some reassuring signals coming out of nuclear authorities on both the Ukrainian side and the Russian occupied side, as well. Ukrainian authorities say that the situation is stable at the moment, at the plant. The Russian authorities say that the background radiation levels are normal. They call the claims coming out of Kyiv, quote, garbage. Scott McLean, CNN, London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But we don't see, usually, instances where four to five people are killed in one particular shooting. And that's what happened here on July 3rd, the day before the fourth of July. It was a chaotic scene in the southwest part of Philadelphia in one particular neighborhood. The suspect, Kimbrady Carriker, he actually just made his first court appearance this morning at a preliminary arraignment a few hours ago. That court appearance just took about 15 minutes, but it was a long process to read the litany of charges that this man is facing, including murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and of course the violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, basically, several charges of violating firearms policy here in Pennsylvania and in this local spot that we're in. I should say the judge decided to hold him without bail, saying specifically that this man is a public safety -- clearly an issue in this case, and that there's no set of conditions in which you, the defendant, would not be a flight risk. Now, the mayor of Philadelphia and I should say a number of elected leaders, they've been using this opportunity to speak about gun policy in Philadelphia and in the state.

Squeezing them out of sight, Taliban authorities ordered beauty parlors to be shut within the month, sending shockwaves for women already gripped in a chokehold. A salon owner who did not want to be identified for safety reasons told CNN the Taliban's order means her poverty-stricken family cannot afford the bare essentials. I don't understand why beauty salons should be banned, she says. My husband is jobless, and this beauty salon is the only means to feed my family. I have four kids. They need food and clothes. The Taliban seized back power in the summer of 2021. With thousands of terrified families flocking to Kabul Airport, desperate to escape the group's barbaric rule. While the Taliban vowed reform, promising to be more progressive than their previous rule, women were quickly erased from public life, banning teenage girls from secondary and higher education, and ordering non-profit organizations to stop their female employees from coming to work. The salon owner we spoke to says she doesn't know what more can be taken from them, before there's nothing left at all. No woman is showing off her face with makeup outside, and we're already wearing hijab in public, she says. This will further deprive women of their rights and freedom. As the Taliban slowly chips away at their rights, hope is slowly dwindling for some women. But others still haven't been deterred from raising their voices, even if it means risking their lives.

We have first, it was the public service and then the private sector, the name used in U.N. And now they're seeing and finding every space that women have that contribute to their economic, you know, prosperity or they can have an income be economically independent that they shut it for women because beauty salons are, you know, traditionally very feminine place for women. You don't see any men there even as employee working for their administration. All the -- it's usually small shops in Kabul that is run by women or they run it inside their houses. So, I think it's the continuation of atrocities against women in trying to dehumanize them in every possible way and confine them within their houses. So, now, they're like the bigger picture, for example, working for civil service or working for private sector, the U.N., they did it already, but now they are trying to move for the every others even smaller things includes all the prisons of women from all spheres of public life and also economic opportunities.",

It's not a Taliban soldier doing something or in a certain place, but it's a systematic segregation and discrimination against women where they want to dehumanize them that can serve their interest of male dominance over women. And that's why we are saying if it's their system of the Taliban's regime system of governance, so we should see it as what it is. Like what happened in South Africa. And now, world doesn't have any legal framework to approach Taliban or a lot of sanctions and many other things happening regarding Afghanistan or not all of them are on basis of gender, mainly maybe on basis of security. So, that's why what we are saying is it should become a law. Gender apartheid, unfortunately, is not an approved convention or law by the U.N.

We see what's happening with the economy. Yes, we are the worst women's rights crisis in the world, but we are one of the worst human rights crisis in the world, too. And Taliban and this international community are helping them with 40 to 80 million cash on weekly basis without using it as a leverage against the Taliban. And Taliban are collecting huge, taxes and they are spending it to strengthen their military capacity while the world is sending money to feed the people. So, there is more areas that we can use it as a leverage, but I think for me the important thing is using the internal legitimacy that they don't have it and backing people and the women and hearing their voices.

What are White House officials saying about what this substance now is, because we have confirmation, but also how it got inside the White House.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's really the question that officials are really trying to look at now. They have determinedthrough lab testing that it was cocaine because remember, they did a field test on this substance on Sunday night. It showed a preliminary result for cocaine. Now, they have confirmed that as in fact what it was and really the investigation now turns to who brought it into the White House. And as you mentioned we are learning more about where they found the substance. It is at an entrance to the West Wing, of course a very heavily trafficked area, not only by staff but also by these unique tours that staff are able to bring their guests through and they did find it on a Sunday. These tours do occur on Sundays, so it does lend some complexity in to the situation. But of course, the White House has cameras nearly everywhere. There are visitor logs. You know, everyone's name who comes into the White House is recorded. And so, the investigation now goes to who brought this in to the building. And of course, the other question that I think officials have is how long this substance was there where they found it because that will determine on how many people they want to look at as they try and probe who brought this in to the building. Now, it did cause a temporary shutdown of the complex on Sunday night. President Biden was not here. At the time, he was at Camp David. He is back here now. The White House itself is staying relatively silent on the matter, sort of pushing all questions to the Secret Service but certainly, officials at the Secret Service are trying to get to the bottom of how exactly this substance was brought in to the building. You know, Sundays typically are rather quiet days here at the White House but because this was a holiday weekend, you could imagine more people bringing guests to visit some of the rooms in the West Wing. President Biden was not here as I said so that sort of diminishes the number of staff who are here at the time. But certainly, a lot questions hanging over this incident. Paula.",
