Not only were cancellations low, but airlines carried 300,000 more people over the Memorial Day holiday than compared to 2019, back before the pandemic. The TSA just told us it screened 2.58 million people at airports nationwide yesterday. That was the second of two waves. People come home. The first wave, people leaving home, that was even bigger, 2.72 million people screened at airports nationwide on Friday. That's the highest number we have seen since 2019.Day after day, the numbers were bigger than pre-pandemic figures. A lot of huge superlatives there. Also the fact that cancellations were relatively low. Seven hundred in total between Thursday and Monday. When you take that five-day period and compare it to the same period last year, airlines canceled 2,700 flights, really kicked off these cascading meltdowns that lasted all summer long, 55,000 in total between Memorial Day and Labor Day. So, this past weekend was only about a quarter of what we saw last year. Spoke to Scott Keyes of Going and he said that this is really critical. It shows that the airlines did a pretty good job here, but they simply cannot let their guard down going through the summer. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT KEYES, FOUNDER AND CHIEF FLIGHT EXPERT, GOING.COM: I think we can say, without reservation, that airlines have passed the test.
