And from the evidence, it shows that Mr. Bagley fled to the back of the bedroom, grabbed an object off the nightstand in which officers were not aware of what that object was, jumped off the balcony and took off running. The testimony further showed that the officers gave chase, they lost sight of him.

Officer Tyler was placed in a situation where he had to make that call. So again, it's a tragic and unfortunate situation for all involved.
