COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Brianna, if Russia does capture Bakhmut, then, of course, there's certainly a moral factor involved in this. But what will probably happen is the Ukrainians will pull back to the villages and the towns to the west of Bakhmut. They will try to form a defensive line to prevent the Russians from really taking advantage of any type ground that they would have gained by capturing Bakhmut. So, to me, it will look like an empiric victory, I think, if the Russians do this. Of course, there are always chances that things could go wrong for the Ukrainian side as well. But the key thing to remember is that the Russians are really limited in the supplies that they have as well.

Exactly as the colonel said, they've got some real problems themselves. And Ukrainians are preparing for their offensive. Ukrainians know that they need to win soon. And so tying up all these Russian forces up around Bakhmut could be part of their strategy, could be part of their attempt to pull the Russians out of where the Ukrainian offensive can come.

AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY AND LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATORSo, Alex Murdaugh, very experienced attorney, he knew that he would be under really, really intense cross-examination on that issue of whether he was at the kennel just minutes before Maggie and Paul were killed. He took a calculated risk. I'm sure his attorney went over with him over and over and over again telling him about the risk. But being a skilled attorney, I think he thought he could outsmart the jurors. You heard one of the jurors who's given an interview say he thought he was a good liar but he wasn't good enough.

In order to establish motive, which prosecutors don't have to do but it helps them get closer to a conviction, to establish motive, like you said, they have to lay out these financial crimes. That is very, very risky legally because you start stepping up to the line of saying, because he committed crimes in the past and because he's lied in the past, therefore, it's more likely that he committed this crime. That's called prejudicial in the eyes of the law.So, you know, a court could find that that strategy probably tested the bounds or went too far, but at the end of the day, this was a conviction in which the evidence was relatively clear, and like what we were talking about a moment ago, lying about where you were at the moment a crime was committed is something that jurors don't look very kindly on.",

But one thing that is so different at this CPAC, and we've covered so many of them, is when there's a Democrat in the White House, this is the year, the year before the presidential election, it is supposed to be the testing ground, the proving ground for Republican candidates to talk about conservative policies, conservative ideas, much less talk about conservative policies, the debt and other things, then a cult of personality around the former president. That's why this event is so different. Certainly, it's not the harbinger of what's to come in the broader sense of the Republican primary. This is just one sort of stop along the way.

This is a debate Senate between the overwhelming majority of Democrats in Congress and the White House. There's a reason why the overwhelming majority that were in the House, for example, voted not to override the decision of a newly-and popularly elected city council.I don't think the White House is going to get the kind of benefit that it thinks from this. The president is still going to be attacked by people in bad faith, on the issue of crime. What's ironic about this, is that Joe Biden perhaps more than the vast majority of Democrats has really distinguished a shot of being tough on crime. I mean, the man literally author the '94 crime bill, every chance he gets he make sure to support law enforcement and several State of the Union against what he called on Congress to make sure to fund law enforcement. So, I don't think there's any risk by just respecting the will of the city council, in a municipality frankly that has said deserves statehood. And that does have merits, the population for example of being larger than the states of Wyoming, and Vermont. I don't think he's -- I think he's going to get attacked in bad faith regardless, so he should do the right thing, something that's not in conflict of what he said, which is that the city of D.C. deserve statehood, and should not have to suffer the indignity of having Congress substitute its own judgment, even if it disagrees with what the city council does.",
