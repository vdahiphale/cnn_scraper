Then New York braces for a possible indictment of Donald Trump, as the former president says he will be arrested on Tuesday. We'll explore whether that is likely. Plus, the climate time-bomb is ticking, and the world is running out of time to stop it. More on that dire warning from the U.N. But first, this evening, my dear friend. That is how Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted his Chinese counterpart, as Xi Jinping arrived at the Kremlin hours ago. The two leaders smiled as they warmly shook hands and exchanged greetings. China's posing Mr. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow not only as a chance really to forge closer relations, but also as a Ukraine peace initiative. President Putin said he looks forward to studying Mr. Xi Jinping's proposals. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator):  We studied closely your proposals on the settlement of the acute crisis in Ukraine. Of course, we will have an opportunity to discuss this issue. We know that you are based on the principles of justice and commitment to the fundamental points of international law, indivisible security for all parties. You are also aware that we are always open to the negotiation process. We will certainly discuss all of these issues including your initiative. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the West's view is that thereason why, you know, President Xi decided to prioritize meeting with Vladimir Putin shortly after receiving his unprecedented third presidential term, is because he needs to keep his allies, his authoritarian allies, government, and country strong to act as a counterbalance to the power of the United States. So despite western sanctions, despite condemnation, despite these ICC arrest warrants for Putin, and the possibility that he could eventually be tried for war crimes, alleged war crimes. The fact that President Xi is there, giving him legitimacy, and perhaps also talking about giving him support to be able to end the war eventually on terms favorable to Russia. This is all in benefit of President Xi and his goal, that he shares with Putin, of disrupting the U.S.-led world order. This is something that the two of them, you know, above any other relationship, the ideology that they share is what experts feel is most important to the Chinese president. And so, important in fact, he's willing to risk, you know, perhaps, even, you know, consequences that are calamitous in terms of economic -- the economic consequences with the United States by supporting Russia, and perhaps even crossing over that red line of the United States has laid out, and possibly supplying Russia with lethal weapons, ammunition, and the type of things that could give its troops a battlefield advantage. Because if Russia is able to gain more of an upper hand, then when they do eventually come to peace negotiations, and of course, China did put out that 12-point peace plan. They might be able to get what President Xi, and China believes that Putin will need in order to end the fighting, which is basically to be able to keep all of the land that they have seized so far. So, of course, this is very concerning to Ukraine. You know, the thought that China, well, claiming to be a neutral partner, refusing to speak with President Zelenskyy by phone, now meeting with Vladimir Putin, and potentially urging --",

The Russians and Vladimir Putin himself made that threat repeatedly as one of the biggest things that Russia has in its arsenal that it has not used aside from throwing pretty much everything else, but the kitchen sink at the Ukrainian people in the relentless bombing of civilian infrastructure. But in order for this peace plan to work for Russia, China knows that Kyiv will also have to withdraw its own troops. And this is something that President Xi likely will be pitching to Vladimir Putin in great detail, and then perhaps of course, this would also be passed along to the Ukrainians.

Now,Russia's president has now made his first trip to Ukraine since the start of the war. Over the weekend, if you remember, Russian state television showed Vladimir Putin touring Mariupol, the southeastern city that's been occupied since last May. Mr. Putin's visit took place in the dark of night, possibly so authorities could hide the damage from the months' long siege last year, the Kremlin doesn't say when he was there. But they released the footage   the day after the ICC issued his arrest warm. The visit is a clear provocation to Ukraine, as Mariupol is a symbol of course, of Ukrainian resistance, and suffered some of the most intense fighting that we've seen in this war. David McKenzie joins me now from Odessa. So, David, what has been the reaction from Ukraine and from President Zelenskyy to this visit by President Putin to Mariupol?",

Another official said that it's a deeply cynical move, given the amount of damage that this caused and lives lost, and thousands of people that fled that area into Ukraine after that area was taken over. But I think it's also worth pointing out, that this was clearly timed as well ahead of the Xi Jinping meeting. To show that those areas, at least, in terms of propaganda, are coming back to normal. Of course, they're nowhere near normal. It is also worth mentioning I think that, after this meeting with Xi Jinping and Putin, it would be interesting to see if then, the Chinese leader will talk to President Zelenskyy who is never going to talk to him beforehand because Russia and China are such closer, if not allies, they're closely linked at this point.

There were demonstrations, there have been demonstrations right across France, not always very big, but they are getting regularly more angry, perhaps not bigger, but they're certainly potentially getting more violent, the police are moving very far, outstanding, very substantial numbers here in Paris to try to snuff them out as they pop up in different locations.

So this would be the first time in our 230 plus year history, as a constitutional democracy,that any President or former president was charged with any type of criminal offense, if it, in fact, comes to pass. Now, this will be an extraordinarily sensitive moment legally and politically. Legally, the Manhattan D.A., which is a state level prosecutor here in New York, is going to have to prove its case related to the payment of hush money beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury unanimously of 12 people. That's never easy to do. And politically, there's some question about whether this will ultimately help Donald Trump by rallying support to his cause, or hurt him because it's hard to run for president while you're under indictment. I should say, though, that the fact of an indictment does not prevent anyone from running for or even becoming president. So, legally, it's not an obstacle.

It is not a crime to pay hush money.It is not a crime to know about hush money payments. Under New York law, there's sort of two steps of the crime here. First of all, it's a crime to falsify business records. And the allegation here, or the belief, is that these hush money payments were falsely booked within the Trump Organization as legal fees. But prosecutors have to prove that Donald Trump knew they were falsely logged that way. That's not necessarily going to be easy to do. If that's proved, that's a misdemeanor, which is our lower level of crimes. The maximum there's one year but realistically, it's virtually certain that you would not go to prison, nobody would go to prison on a nonviolent first- time misdemeanor. However, if prosecutors can prove that those records were falsified in furtherance of some other crime, and here, that would be a campaign finance violation if these payments were meant to pay off Stormy Daniels in order to protect Donald Trump's electoral prospects, then it gets bumped up to the lowest level felony. It's what we call a Class E felony. We have class A through E here in New York, A being most severe, E being least severe. The maximum penalty there is four years, but, again, there's a reasonable chance that somebody convicted of a first-time nonviolent Class E felony would also get no jail time. But, again, the key is proving that Donald Trump knew exactly how those business records were falsified, not entirely clear how prosecutors intend to establish that beyond a reasonable doubt.",

In fact, at the current rate of high emissions, we could hit 1.5, between 2018 and 2039.

Three and a half billion people are, right now, at risk of climate effects, from water scarcity, droughts, to floods, and low-lying island states, that have to think about ways to adapt and don't have the resources to do it. But on the plus side, by investing in these developing countries, helping them protect the forests they have left, that's a big piece of this, stopping deforestation, that could start to draw things down and change this trajectory. But, Isa, If you just look at the realities of what's going on today, this report is now calling for drastic 40 percent reductions in fossil fuels. Humanity has only gone up. It hasn't figured out a way to start going down at all.

One of them grabbed a Quran and threw it to the ground.\" The U.S. cobbled together a political order based on sectarian divisions, disbanded the Iraqi army and the ones ruling Ba'ath Party, throwing hundreds of thousands out of a job and was mired in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, where Iraqis were tortured, humiliated and photographed. 11 U.S. soldiers were convicted of crimes.

We had beenhearing from sources within the government that this could be happening, that essentially, they would negotiate within themselves instead of negotiating with the opposition, and make changes to the reforms. Why would -- they wouldn't do this from the beginning, who knows. But the stage that they made today is a small one. Essentially, they are -- and then instead of letting the government appointed members of the committee, that select judges, have a vast majority on the committee, they would now only have a one-seat majority. So still a majority, but not as big and that they would only be able to essentially appoint the first two High Court justices and the rest would be appointed by a supermajority of that committee. They also notably said that they wanted to, essentially, pause the rest of the legislation, because these reforms is a series of bills that make up this overall reform. They're going to pause that legislation until after the Passover recess, until the end of April, opening the door once again, they say, to negotiations. But quite quickly, the opposition rejected this. Yair Lapid, the former prime minister and opposition leader now, says this is not a compromise. It is a hostile political takeover of the judicial system. And leaders of the protest movement, these hundreds of thousands of Israelis who have been taking to the streets in Israel for more than two months now, they were even stronger in their language, saying this is not a softening. They said this is a declaration of war. So, clearly, this is not nearly enough, or it's even a starting point for the opposition. And interestingly, we're actually hearing from the White House, from John Kirby in the White House, in an interview with Israeli media that was published today, saying that one of the main reasons for that phone call between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was specifically about the judicial reforms, to discuss the judicial reforms, and concerns about the judicial reforms. So, you have to wonder whether this protest movement, whether the pressure from international allies, such as the Americans, is potentially having some sort of effect on Benjamin Netanyahu and his government, Isa.",
