And if Harris is to win this race, it will be, I think, with support from women in the swing states, in the inner suburbs of the large cities who have traditionally lead Republican as a as I said lean probably still are more likely to favor Republican approaches on things like the economy and immigration but are deeply concerned about the rollback of rights led by abortion under Trump and are even maybe more concerned about him personally.

You know, it is a, there is a dominant belief in both parties, certainly in the Trump era.The Democrats have to win the pop -- national popular vote by a lot in order to have a chance of getting the 270 electoral college votes because the swing states all lean slightly more Republican than the nation as a whole. That's not really happening this time. We are seeing a convergence between the race where Harris has a tiny lead in the national polls, and the swing states are essentially deadlocked as well. I do think there is a hierarchy in the swing states. I think the Sun Belt battlegrounds, which are Georgia and North Carolina and the southeast, Arizona and Nevada and the southwest, are a little harder for her, even though the CNN poll today had her basically dead even in Arizona, had them dead even in Arizona and Nevada. I think that she has a much more plausible pathway through the three states that Trump in 2016 knocked out of the blue wall: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And if I had to bet as I said before I think one of them is going to win Pennsylvania by about 50,000 votes, and the odds are pretty good that person is president at the end of the day. The advantage for Trump, he probably only has to win one of those three former blue wall states Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin in order to win. She in all likelihood, I think, will have to sweep them, but that is totally within her power to do. And when people say you have an election within the margin of error, it also means it is an election within the margin of effort. And what the campaigns are able to execute between now and the finish line will determine, I think, who ultimately wins the prize.",

We know that there's at least 90 who have been killed in this strike so far, but we also know from footage on the ground, from local journalists on the ground, that there are many more bodies that are still trapped beneath the rubble. This is an area where there is no heavy equipment, so you have fellow residents, you have rescuers trying to get to people with their bare hands.We also heard from the director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. This is the main hospital in the area where many of the injuries and the dead were coming to and he said that it is a desperate catastrophic situation that patients are lying on the ground. They have no medical staff to be able to help them to help them as well as many were arrested by Israel just recently. His quote says, \"those who can reach Kamal Adwan Hospital receive first aid, but those who cannot die in the streets, this is our reality, an utterly catastrophic situation in every sense of the world\". Now, the word, excuse me, Israel says that when they entered that hospital, they arrested 100 Hamas militants, the hospital though, saying that they desperately need medical staff to be able to treat those in the area. Now when it comes to what Israel says about this airstrike, there seems to be some surprise from the Israeli military that there were so many people in the neighborhood. The IDF, saying that they are, quote, \"trying to understand why so many people were in Beit Lahia at the time of the strike, saying that they had told residents to evacuate several weeks ago\". Now there is an investigation ongoing but obviously a clear intelligence failure to know that there were so many residents still in this particular area. As I say, it's been condemned by the U.N., the U.N. Human Rights Office saying it's one of the deadliest single attacks in Gaza in almost three months.

This comes after his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike last month.CNN's Salma Abdelaziz reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hezbollah has a new leader. Naim Qassem has been appointed the group's new secretary- general. A role he was already fulfilling, acting as the interim chief after his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated by Israel in late September. The killing of Nasrallah, a man seen to embody the Lebanese Shia movement, struck a huge blow and left a vacuum inside a group that had already lost much of its leadership as a result of months of Israeli assassinations. But soon after Nasrallah's death, Qassem issued a defiant statement urging Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire in Lebanon or face Hezbollah's wrath. NAIM QASSEM, HEZBOLLAH SECRETARY GENERAL (through translator): We are not speaking from a position of weakness. If the Israelis don't want a ceasefire, we will continue to fight. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Qassem was considered Hezbollah's number two, serving as deputy secretary general, meaning second in command of the organization since 1991. He is one of the group's founding members, helping to establish it in the early 1980s. Nasrallah's cousin, Hashim Saifuddin, was previously viewed as the favorite to take the helm of the Iran-linked Hezbollah, but he died in an Israeli strike on Beirut shortly after his relative. Since the killing of his predecessor, Qassem has made three televised speeches, speaking informal Arabic rather than the colloquial dialogue that gave his predecessor charisma. Israel says he won't last long and issued this apparent threat. His tenure in this position may be the shortest in the history of this terrorist organization if he follows the footsteps of his predecessors, Hassan Nasrallah and Hashim Saifuddin, the Israeli government's official Arabic account on X posted. His appointment to lead Hezbollah, now meant to demonstrate the group can reconstitute and recover even as it fights for its survival. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Everything has a certain factor. Is it a wind? Is it a surge? Is it a flood? We know the one that moved through Philippines didn't have much wind, but it certainly had flooding just last week. So this is what we're seeing here as the wind and the surge will probably be equal to or not even greater than the flooding potential here. An awful lot of wind damage here, many spots here, all the way even into China are going to see tropical cyclone winds, somewhere maybe even over 100 kilometers per hour and then on up toward Kyushu. Now Taiwan is no stranger to these big things. Since like 1950 there have been 30 Taiwan landfalls of what's an equivalent of a category 4 or 5 Atlantic hurricane. So yes, major damage can happen there in Taiwan and it does. But this year, we've already had two and really another. But Krathon and also Gaemi has already taken its toll there in damage across the eastern parts of Taiwan. There's going to be more. Obviously we could even still see this continue to increase, an intensity probably likely go down before landfall, but we're still going to watch this.

So, let's take you through what we know. We have two lawmakers briefed by South Korea's spy agency, the NIS. And the NIS says that North Korean families of these soldiers are being told the troops went to a, quote, \"military exercise, not to Russia, not to Ukraine\". The lawmakers add news of these troops going to Russia has spread within North Korea despite the regime's effort to contain the truth. And they say there is some, quote, \"unrest among North Korean residents and soldiers about why they're making this sacrifice for another country\". That certainly would be remarkable considering North Korea tolerates virtually no dissent against the regime of Kim Jong-un. We also heard from South Korea's president on this subject. Listen to what he said.
