The U.N. worked on that. That was painful. And there is really nothing in that that helps a ceasefire right now. President Erdogan had those phone calls yesterday with President Zelenskyy and President Putin. The Turkish side said that they urged President Putin to call a unilateral cease fire but also to go into essentially a more enlightened view of what a final outcome, piece outcome could look like. That is another thing. Putin came out and clarified, the Kremlin clarified and said, yes, a peace deal for us looks like Ukraine conceding all of the territory we have annexed, those four regions we've annexed. Ukraine has been categorical and its allies have been categorical. German yesterday is categorical as well. If Russia wants a ceasefire, it needs to pull its troops out of the country.

You know, I think that the men on the street interview conducted there in Ivan's report was just so powerful because you hear from a Chinese citizen or Chinese national questioning the transparency and the quality of the COVID-19 data coming from his own country.

In fact, earlier today reported only five new deaths caused by COVID-19 on January 5 compared that to its officially reported one new death caused by COVID-19 the previous day.And these remarkably low numbers simply do not match the video that we've been screening and collecting here at CNN showing absolutely crowded and overwhelmed funeral homes, crematoriums, and hospitals. We have a fresh video from Hangzhou of a crowded hospital there also overwhelmed by the runaway COVID-19 outbreak. And China continues to insist it is transparent, its open, has been so since the start of the pandemic. And also, this. Let's bring it up for you the latest response from the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This is deliberately, Thursday, Mao Ning is saying this. Facts have proven that China has always maintained close communication with the WHO and shared information and data on the epidemic in a timely, open, and transparent manner in accordance with the law. Mao Ning goes on to say China's COVID situation is under control. Now, the World Health Organization earlier this week, warned that China is under-representing the true scope and scale of its COVID-19 outbreak, under-representing just the number of ICU admissions, hospital admissions, and deaths. We've also heard from U.S. President Joe Biden as well as the health ministers of France, and Germany, all expressing concern about what really is the full picture of the COVID- 19 outbreak in China. And now, Germany is the latest government to be added to the list of governments imposing restrictions on travelers from China. We have an updated map for you.
