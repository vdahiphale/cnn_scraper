Something we heard Donald Trump reference, of course, repeatedly last night. But that's also what we saw throughout the week from many of the other speakers, including some of Donald Trump's political foes, like Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis. And part of that is because one of the big goals of this week I was told by the Trump campaign was to try and paint the state and the party around Donald Trump, the Republican Party, in stark contrast with the Democratic Party and all of the hand-wringing we're seeing around Joe Biden and questions and calls for him to step aside. Now, you are totally right, Kate, that last night it really was a tale of two speeches. We saw two entirely different Donald Trump's up on that stage. And that's because, you know, I had been hearing from Donald Trump's advisers, and his allies, in the days leading up to his remarks, that final day last night, that he was going to be throwing out and tearing up his original speech, which was really throwing raw meat to the base, and instead opt for a more softer version of Donald Trump, one where he recounted the harrowing experience that he went through during that failed assassination attempt. And we did hear, you know, the latter at the start of the evening. Donald Trump, in a remarkably, I'd argue, vulnerable moment for him. He walked through what happened to him in detail. I do want you to take a listen to some of what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear. I said to myself, wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet. And moved my right hand to my ear, brought it down. My hand was covered with blood.

He'll be joined by his running mate, JD Vance.

They have an opportunity to do with it what they please.But what I would say is, we aren't doing ourselves any favors by weakening our party as a whole. There will still be an election in November. And when Joe Biden is still our nominee, the question that I've asked repeatedly is, what's the plan to get our voters back to the polls, to get people to believe that defeating Donald Trump has to be our number one priority. And so I hope that we will trust the person that 14 million of us elected to be our nominee. That we will trust that he will lead us to victory in November. And, of course, you need resources and dollars to do that. People get to decide what they want to do with their money. But if we want to preserve our country and the success that we've had over the past several years under the Biden administration, we're going to need financial support to do that.",

And that's what we should expect.I had PTSD watching Donald Trump give that speech last night because I was mayor while Donald Trump was in the Oval Office, and it was a disaster trying to govern a city with the instability that was coming outside of the White House. So, I do believe that Donald Trump is beatable. I do believe that we can hold on to the Senate. I do believe that we can hold on to the House. There was this red wave that was expected during the midterms. It didn't happen. People thought that Joe Biden wouldn't be our nominee in 2020. It happened. So, I would just encourage people to keep our eye on - eyes on the prize. That is to defeat Donald Trump. And the Donald Trump that we will expect to see, if he, God forbid, is elected president again, is the one that we saw last night.",
