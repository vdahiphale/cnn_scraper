Meta is up some extraordinary amount. I'll tell you in a moment. It's up 20 percent. We'll get to all of those details, but it is a good day on market and the markets and the events of the day. US hiring surpasses expectations. Job creation has become a robust machine for the US economy. The first customers get their hands on Apple's Vision Pro Headset. Tim Cook was there. We will tell you whether it's worth it, well and how it all works. And an exclusive piece for CNN: Ukraine's army chief bemoans the weakness of economic sanctions against Russia. We'll put it in perspective. Live from New York, end of the week, it's Friday -- if I can speak properly, I would tell you it is Friday, February the 2nd, you can see how the hour is going to go. I'm Richard Quest, together we mean business. Good evening. The US economy has defied all predictions. Many more jobs, up to twice as many was expected, 350,000 were created in January, double on the line. The employment rate held steady, it's 3.7 percent and December's job gains revised sharply upwards as well. All in all, it shows a job creating machine. Initially, the markets fell because of course, they are concerned about this will mean the Fed won't cut rates since it bounced back. A few investors are now expecting rates to be cut in March that pretty much is off the table. Rana is with me. First of all, Rana thank you for your kind, good wishes in our 15th anniversary.

So it's still the case, as John McCain said that Russia is a country -- is a gas station masquerading as a country. I think that's a little of a misnomer, perhaps, but it's still a one business town. And so if we are able to sort of really crack down on the oil, I think that the ability for Russia to continue its operations will be difficult. And to be fair, even in the oil side, it's true that India, for example, is purchasing a lot of a Russian oil, however, they're purchasing it in rupees, and Foreign Minister Lavrov has complained that there's too many rupees that Russia has in Delhi and unable to spend it.

So, it's up 30 percent over the last two months, the consumer confidence measure also got a nice pop. Now, what's happening here is that the benefits of a very strong labor market, as we learned this morning, along with easing inflationary pressures are raising the pay, the real pay, the real buying power of working families, and they're starting to feel that that's beginning to show up in some of these indicators.",

So, look, I'm not going to declare whethera vibe session has begun or is over or is in the middle or what, that's all -- you know, that's -- I believe that phrase comes off of TikTok. What I'm telling you is that if you look at the very closely watched measures of consumer sentiment, we are starting to see the gap between the real indicators of the economy strength, whether it's job growth, easing, inflation, lower costs, and some key areas including gas, eggs, milk, T.V., air fares, and rising real pay, that gap is starting to close and somewhat reliably so, it's not just a week or two, it's a few months within that gap is coming -- is coming down some. And that's exactly what you would expect if these benefits, these gains are reaching American families.",

Weknow how economies have been just deeply damaged when that independence is compromised. What we have seen already is some key interest rates coming down a bit. Mortgage rates, of course, were peaked at around eight percent and were last seen a little bit below seven. My expectation is that that rate will continue to come down some this year. But what really matters to working households right now is are their incomes rising or their incomes or their wages, are they beating inflation? We learned this morning that wages were up strongly in January. We don't have inflation yet for January, but we know for the past nine or 10 months, wages incomes have been outpacing inflation, and that's giving family some much needed breathing room. Add that to the measures this president has taken to directly lower costs, health care, prescription drugs, the cost of health coverage, clean energy and you see some real breathing room for American households.",

So political economics is, of course, my purview. I think the way to think about this, Richard, is that we've been talking about what a strong economy this is, we've been talking about the importance on building the progress that we've made, progress in easing prices, we have a job market that is just as tight as strong as it's ever been. The last thing we'd want to do is to kick the ball in our own goal, to hurt the progress we're making with partisan squabbling. So, this president has long believed that we ought to be able to get together on a bipartisan basis and achieve many of the priorities you just took us through.",
