The market has come to a close after another anxious day, one might say, on Wall Street. Those are the markets. It is 10:00 PM in Tel Aviv, a very good evening, 10:00 PM. We're in a country that is at an inflection point with a crisis that seems to be worsening day by day. A Russian fighter jet has been forced down of a US drone. That's a developing story. Oren Liebermann is with us in a moment. The head of Israel's Central Bank says the proposed reforms could weaken judicial independence and hurt the economy. And fears about the future of Israel's tech sector. You're going to hear from the founder of the largest VC firm. Live from Tel Aviv on Tuesday, March the 14th. I'm Richard Quest and in Tel Aviv, I most certainly mean business. A very good evening to you from Israel's commercial capital of Tel Aviv, home of course, to the country's exceptionally important and growing tech sector that's made its name around the world. We are here because this is a moment of crisis, a turning point for Israel. New judicial reforms are working their way through the Israeli Parliament ad there has been enormous amounts of unrest, which is threatening foreign investment. We have an extremely busy hour together. We're going to hear from the central bankers past and present. We will hear from the chief executives of Wiz and Viola and hear the government's response from the member of Likud. All of that as the hour moves on. First, I need to bring you this developing story that is coming from the Black Sea. The United States says that a Russian fighter jet forced down an American drone, and it all got too close. The Russians struck the drones propellers. The drone was brought down into the Black Sea. Russia's response: No weapons were used. No contact was made. President Biden has been informed. It is the first direct military contact between Russia and the US since the Ukraine invasion began. Oren Liebermann is at The Pentagon. Oren is with me now. That's the significance here, isn't it? This is the first time Russia and the US, if you will, have crossed swords, literally, but the Russian say there was no contact.",

It has also been home to the growing and extremely important globally, tech sector. Many of the technologies that we use today came from Israel, which is why the latest protests in the street over the new judicial reforms is so serious. In many cases, people are saying that the very fabric of the country is at stake. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) QUEST (voice over): Two months of protests on the streets of Israel, with the demonstrators coming from all corners of Israeli society. Here, there is a growing fear, democratic values are under threat. An unprecedented overhaul of the Israeli legal system could dramatically shrink the powers of the Supreme Court, and a hand sweeping new authority to the Knesset, Israel's parliament. The new rules would prevent the Supreme Court Justices from striking down legislation passed by lawmakers. The rules would change the way Judges are selected, giving more power to politicians; and it would allow for a simple majority in the Knesset to overturn rulings from the Court. Behind the plan is a new ultra-right coalition government led by longstanding Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The Prime Minister has tried to frame this plan as mere constitutional housekeeping, making things better. (on camera): Israel's longstanding commitment to liberal values and the rule of law has helped the country attract many billions of dollars of investment from Western companies. The country's far-right Finance Minister says that judicial reforms will attract even more investment. However, one of Israel's former Central Bank governors strongly disagrees with that proposal.",

Core inflation coming in at five-and-a-half percent. Not all good news, though. It's more of a mixed bag here. Certainly better than some of those inflation figures we saw earlier this year when we saw 9.2 percent inflation, for example, in June of this year, in June of 2022, but on the SVB front, Richard, yesterday, some of these same regional stocks that had plummeted, certainly soared today, suddenly had soared today, and part of this is because maybe some investor confidence, perhaps. We did hear from one senior Treasury official who told our colleague, Richard, that deposit outflows at sort of the same regional banks appear to be easing. So, is it too soon to say that we are out of the woods? Is it too soon to say for sure that we're seeing some stabilization in the banking sector? It is too soon to say.
