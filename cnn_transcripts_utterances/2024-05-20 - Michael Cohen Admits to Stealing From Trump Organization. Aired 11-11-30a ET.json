They were paying Cohen back for this hush money payment and it was hidden. That's -- that's the crime, the alleged crime here.But the Weisselberg and McConney memos that are part of that case now have in them Cohen's larceny, his admitted larceny, which would seemingly be undermining of the documents, at least the idea that Mr. Trump knew what was in the bill.",

And, you know, as much cross is going on, it's hitting credibility. It's not really hitting the facts that underline the prosecution's theory of the case.

In this case, he testified before Congress last week because Costello insists that while he was talking to Cohen, Cohen repeatedly told him that he had no evidence of criminal misconduct by Trump at that time. And then, of course, his story changed. So Todd Blanche is likely building to highlight that and how Cohen's story eventually shifted. This is also why they'd want to put Costello on the stand. He has testified publicly again and before the grand jury, trying to undercut Cohen's credibility. It's unclear, though, after what Blanche has done here, that they'll really need Mr. Costello.

That's all that matters.So let me ask you, because it seems that Todd Blanche and the Trump defense team, it seems like they've landed some real punches today. They've been grilling Michael Cohen, and he basically admitted to stealing from the Trump organization, stealing $60,000. They've also underlined the point that he was handling a lot of stuff in October 2016, some sort of blackmail attempt on Tiffany Trump, trying to get an endorsement for Trump's campaign from one of the children of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., some many, many other deals having to do with his tax and medallion service, et cetera, et cetera. What do you make of it so far?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, I mean, so he went to jail for perjury. I guess I would ask everybody, is he telling the truth about all this stuff? And so since none of it reflects well on him, Jake, I think people believe him. I think they think he's telling the truth.And so remember, the judge has to go to the jury and say, here's the evidence. If you believe the evidence and the evidence tips you over beyond a reasonable doubt that some crime took place, then the person that we're prosecuting is guilty. And I think, weirdly, all of that stuff helps Mr. Trump in the media, and it gets everybody in the media talking about it. But I actually think all of that stuff has actually hurt him. And so your prior guest said they would have stopped talking about it an hour ago because you don't want to sell through the close. But ultimately, Michael telling the truth and it not reflecting well on him speaks to his veracity in terms of his testimony. And I think this stuff actually hurts Trump in this case, doesn't help him. Yes, I know people will say, well, you know, he's a criminal, so therefore he can't believe him. They believe Sammy Gravano, you know, and John Gotti went to jail as a result of that, even though Sammy Gravano was a known liar and a known criminal. [11:25:03] TAPPER: Yeah, a mass murderer. I think we get at least two or three \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano references every day. So for those of you at home playing the drinking game, there you go. I guess one of the issues here, Anthony, is not so much that Michael Cohen just admitted to larceny, because, as you say, that could, in a juror's mind, underscore that he's telling the truth, because why else would he admit to larceny? But that it wasn't brought out well enough, at least according to the attorneys on our panel here, by the prosecution to underscore the idea that the bill, or at least the notes taken by Weisselberg and his assistant McConney, had falsehoods within them, because the $50,000 to Red Finch was not actually paid to Red Finch, because he pocketed, by his own admission. Cohen pocketed $30,000 times two because of the tax payment in addition. And so it would seem to undermine the idea that Donald Trump knew every detail going into his payment of this $420,000, which was then divided by 12 and paid over the course of 2017. Because if he didn't know that he was paying $60,000 because Michael Cohen thought, hey, I deserve this, then how would he know that some of the other money was going to pay Cohen back for paying off Stormy Daniels? Now, I know you don't believe that, but couldn't a juror see that and think, that's reasonable doubt?",

      "sentences": "OK, so Jake, what you just described, and did obviously a brilliant job describing it, could be analysis that creates paralysis. And I hear what you're saying, but I think the facts of the case are pretty prima facie. Money got spent and money was misallocated. And was there fraud perpetrated to cover this up prior to the election?And so what you're saying, I get it. And they're trying to thread that and they're trying to weave that in there. But the jury also knows Mr. Trump, he's been a media personality for 50 years. And I don't think that that analysis that you just made, unless maybe one of the defense attorneys is going to do that in their closing argument, in the closing summary, is the winning argument. The winning argument here is, here are the facts of the case. Here are the receipts of the case. Do you think the defendant is guilty or innocent based on the facts? And is Mr. Cohen lying to you right now and right here? And I don't think there's one of those 12 jurors going to say he's lying, because remember, he's saying stuff that hurts him. Now, you may not like Mike Cohen, and I don't mean you, Jake Tapper. I mean the general person, you, in terms of the generic of the use of the word you. But you have to not like or dislike him. You're an arbitrator at a criminal proceeding. You have to look at the facts of the case. Are these facts true? And if they're true, does that give you beyond a reasonable doubt? Now, you're right. I do think it does. And people say, well, he thinks that because he doesn't like Trump. No, I don't think that because I don't like Trump. Because, like I said to you last time I was on the show, if it's clippety-clop and you hear a clippety-clop outside, it's not a zebra. Don't overthink the case. These guys were hiding something. They put Michael in jail for this. And now they have Mr. Trump on trial for this. They were hiding something. Is it a criminal act? I think it is. And the question is, well, will the 12 jurors think it is? And I think they've proved the case, that's what I think.",
