We're here in Washington in moments, in moments from now, Donald Trump will be back under oath after a truly historic and heated day in the New York civil fraud trial against him. After two impeachments and multiple lawsuits and depositions, the former president is defending himself on the stand for the first time. Within minutes, Trump was accused of making speeches and later he insulted the New York Attorney General and he publicly criticized the judge in this case. The judge has already found that Trump and his eldest sons committed what were described as quote persistent and repeated fraud by inflating certain property values to acquire loans and insurance benefits.",

      "sentences": "Now Judge Arthur Engoron is trying to figure out what damages the Trumps should pay. He spent much of the morning admonishing, admonishing Trump for quote long-winded answers and not answering the questions being asked to him. Even telling Trump's attorney at one point to quote, he said, quote, I beseech you to control him if you can. If you can't, I will. I will excuse him and draw every negative inference that I can. Do you understand that?CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Paula Reid are outside the courthouse. Caitlin, the judge seemed to take a new approach to the Trump testimony after making that threat, but it didn't change the tension in the courtroom, tension that Trump seems to be, it seems to be part of the Trump strategy. KAITLAN COLLINS. CNN ANCHOR: Yeah, it certainly does. I mean, I guess that's the question of it's a, if it's a strategy that works because we already know what the judge is determining here is how much, if anything, Trump is going to have to pay in penalties given he's already been found liable of the fraud that the attorney general's office accused him of. And I think what's important to remember here is that this is incredibly personal for Trump. I mean, this case has made him angrier than almost any other case that he has been facing because it goes to the heart of his entire identity, which is of course his real estate empire that he has built his name off of, which he used to get himself into office when he ran for president in 2016 and something he has continued to talk about. And now this case is threatening that. And so, what the judge was so frustrated by earlier were Trump's long meandering answers that the judge did not feel were sufficient yes or no answers to pretty a yes or no questions in the judge's mind. And that was frustrating because I'll remind people, this is the only day Trump is expected to be on the witness stand. He is, -- the court is closed tomorrow. It's election day. He's not expected to return. So, the big question, Paula Reed, of what this is going to look like in just a few minutes when Trump is back in the room, because he hasn't seemed to mind frustrating this judge, even though it's the judge who is ultimately the decision maker here.",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. This was our second break today. And what we saw after the first break in court today is that the judge changed up his strategy, but Trump kept right on with his. The judge initially was stopping Trump. Every time he felt like he went off script or he talked too long, he was interrupting him. That set off disputes with Trump's lawyers, discussions with the attorney general's office. It took up a lot of time. It made the whole situation quite chaotic between Trump's, what were described as speeches, the judge interrupting, the lawyers interjecting. It was a chaotic first hour there.We took a break and when we came back, it was notable that the judge stopped interrupting Trump and in fact, just let him talk instead deferring to the attorney general's office to decide how to police the questioning and stop if they didn't feel like they were getting the right answer. Now that everybody's had a lunch break, had a little food, stabilized their blood sugar, it'll be interesting to see if Trump changes his strategy. I wouldn't expect that. His lawyer Alina Habba came out here a short time ago. It appeared that they were quite pleased with how things were going, and she also seemed to indicate that they won't make any changes even though the judge has threatened Trump with kicking him out of court and making the most negative inference possible, which means concluding that this testimony went as bad as it could possibly go. So, we'll all watch, see how folks are doing. But the first break prompted some charges. Let's see the second one does too.",

The judge is somebody that's also in his virtual crosshairs here as somebody who's hoping to convince the public that he is biased against him.None of this changes the facts that have been presented at trial. There's been 23 witnesses who have testified to this effect that, and there's a summary judgment motion that says that fraudulent documents were already in place. He's already been found liable. All this now is how expensive is it going to be now for Donald Trump and company? He's in a real catch-22, though, Wolf. On the one hand, he wants to say, I'm in control, I am the head honcho, nobody makes decisions without me, Donald Trump. On the other hand, if he says that in the court of public opinion in a courtroom, it's suggesting that he actually should be liable to some of this as well. How does he get around it?",

He wants to fight them in the court of public opinion. And what we're actually seeing him do today is using that messaging. That messaging he puts out on social media, that messaging he says at the rallies in a courtroom. He's taken it a step further. We knew he'd probably do that in front of the cameras, which he has, but he's also doing it inside of the courtroom.

And this resulted in a gag order for Trump and thousands in fees for violating that gag order. Under oath today, Trump lodged more attacks.

And that is what the judge has already ruled on, that he is liable for fraud there. But the reason they're asking these questions from the attorney general's office is because they're trying to determine what the penalties here could be, what the damages could be that Trump has to actually pay here. And Paula, I think what's notable is as we've been talking about the heart of this questioning, there's still that tension in the courtroom that's happening. Trump's attorney, Chris Kise, has been trying to object to some of the questioning and the lines of it, saying that it was above the statute of limitations.
