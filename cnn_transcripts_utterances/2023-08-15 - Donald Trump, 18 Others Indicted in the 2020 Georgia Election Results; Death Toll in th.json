I'm Rosemary Church.A historic night in the U.S. state of Georgia where a grand jury has indicted Donald Trump for a fourth time for allegedly attempting to overturn the state's election results in 2020. The grand jury approved every indictment presented by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on Monday. The former U.S. president has been charged with 13 counts in the indictment, including a racketeering charge. 18 others have also been charged under the state's racketeering laws for allegedly joining, quote, \"a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome in favor of Donald Trump.\" Those names include several high-profile individuals from Trump's time in office including former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman and top Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, among others. And they have until noon on August 25th to voluntarily surrender. Here is the Fulton County District Attorney breaking down the charges. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis bringing charges against the former president here in Georgia. Donald Trump was one of 19 defendants who were charged as part of this case that was unsealed late Monday evening. Now Donald Trump is facing 13 charges and again he's one of 19 defendants who are facing a very serious racketeering charge in this state. Among the other defendants are very prominent names who are part of Donald Trump's inner circle, like his former attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Now, in a press conference, the Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, reiterated that all of these defendants are innocent until proven guilty. She also said she's going to ask a judge to try to push this case to go to trial within the next six months, and she intends to try all 19 of these defendants together, which, of course, could make her hopes of getting this to trial speedily. Somewhat of a pipe dream, but we'll see how that goes. In a statement, Trump's attorneys called the events that unfolded shocking and absurd. They went on to attack the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before the grand jury that handed up these indictments. And now we wait to see Donald Trump and his other co- defendants turn themselves in. The district attorney said they will have until August 25th to surrender voluntarily. Sara Murray, CNN, Atlanta.

Earlier, the former president told Fox News Digital, quote, \"this politically inspired indictment, which could have been brought close to three years ago, was tailored for placement right smack in the middle of my political campaign.\"And former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani put out this statement. This is an affront to American democracy and does permanent evocable harm to our justice system. It's just the next chapter in a book of lies with the purpose of framing President Donald Trump and anyone willing to take on the ruling regime. Ron Brownstein is a CNN senior political analyst and senior editor for \"The Atlantic.\" He joins me now from Des Moines in Iowa. Appreciate you joining us. So, quite a night and of course earlier this hour we did focus on Donald Trump's legal jeopardy with this historic fourth indictment where he and 18 others face 41 criminal counts in the state of Georgia for trying to overturn Trump's defeat. [03:05:12] But let's look now at the political ramifications of this and what stands out of course with these state charges is that if Trump is re- elected in 2024 he won't be able to pardon himself or his allies. Will that make this his most challenging indictment and how will he deal with this politically, do you think? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: That's such an important point. I think it does, on its face, make it his most challenging indictment, because even if he is elected as president again in 2024, he can't simply make it go away. Even the governor of Georgia can't make it go away. And as I understand, and I'm sure you've had experts on talking about it, the governor cannot unilaterally pardon him. So there is at least the potential that this is a case that could transcend even a successful re-election for Trump and put him in legal jeopardy as president if he was re-elected, you know, and create conditions and circumstances and legal questions we simply have not had to deal with as a country.",

In some ways, as we've talked about many times before, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.Because, one of the reasons, the base stays with Trump so unreservedly through all of these indictments is that they are not hearing from any voices they trust a counter argument except for figures on the periphery of the presidential race like Asa Hutchinson or Chris Christie so they are along for the ride I mean they have lashed themselves to his mast as they did throughout his presidency, you know, and there are a minority of Republicans who are very uneasy about that. But right now the dominant faction in the party is the Trump faction and he has sold to them, and I don't think it was a very hard sell, this argument that all of these indictments are really a way to silence them by going after him.",

You know that leak however it came about obviously gives them a weapon to do that. But if that didn't exist, they would be something else. I mean Donald Trump put out a press release tonight I mean not to but to find a point on what you know, he's trying to alleged here. You know, saying that the prosecutor is the daughter of a black panther. I mean, you know, so in essence, he is, you know, he's repeatedly accused her of being a racist Alvin Bragg, Leticia James in New York, two other African-American criminal justice officials of being racist. He is essentially trying to fold all of these indictments into the predominant belief among Republican voters that the real victims of discrimination in a diversifying society are basically them, whites, Christians, conservatives, and even men. And so, that messaging is well in place for Republican voters. It is a completely different question whether independent voters who will decide a general election are on board with his claim that he is a victim, simply, of a massive nationwide conspiracy of prosecutors.",

He didn't make an explicit ask. But the rest of the charges when you put those together with it, I think makes a very, very strong case because the indictment is very meticulous and it lays, it's what we call a speaking indictment, it lays out the story of what happened. And when you look at all these different pieces going on between the false electroslates, the pressuring, as well as the fact that he is going to be shown to have known at that time that there are no further legal recourse at that time. So everyone knew that they were really trying to just overturn what courts had already said. This is fine. There's no problem.

At the very least, he might retreat to something we call jury nullification, which is to say that you just need to appeal to one person in jury who feels that whatever the evidence says, I just don't think it's right that a former president is being charged this way. There are all these other people involved, for example, and he could basically try to point the finger.It was these folks who masterminded this. It wasn't my idea, I was just taking the advice of these folks, some of them lawyers like Giuliani, some of them not lawyers. That's really what his legal defense is. But at this point, Rosemary, his legal defense is really intertwined with the idea that he's running for president. That's really his, they're one and the same right now, funding included in that. And that really goes to a nullification issue here for the jury, because since he can't pardon himself, he would really need to convince the jury that, for example, if you win, he wins or he's the nominee when he's being tried, that it takes on more of a political persecution notion because after all, I did serve the country, I'm trying to serve it again.

Despite promises to be lenient, Taliban leaders are steadily cracking down on human rights, and no one is paying a higher price than women and girls.Our Anna Coren joins us now live from Hong Kong.

The Taliban swept to power after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan following its 20-year war, handing back control to the same group of Islamic extremists who ruled in the 1990s. While the Taliban promised to be more moderate and honor women's rights within Islamic law, the past two years have brought only a hard-line stance towards women. The closure of secondary school for girls, the forced implementation of the burka, the restriction on travel without a male chaperone, the banning of women from universities and working at NGOs including the United Nations. And just last month the Taliban closed all beauty salons that employed roughly 60,000 women, many of them the sole breadwinners of their homes.

When we asked him about girls' education, he was very evasive, refusing to say when girls will be allowed to go back to school or university. All he said was that conditions need to be favorable.
