At least, that's the new plan for the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas after a one-day delay. The pause will be followed by the first group of hostages released by Hamas. This morning, the Qatari government, which has been mediating this deal, laid out an updated framework. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN:  The beginning of the pause will be 7:00 a.m. Friday, the 24th of November. And it will last, of course, as agreed, for four days. And the first batch of civilians to be released from Gaza will be around 4:00 p.m. of the same day. There will be 13 in number, all women and children. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And even though we now have a time that the guns, as it were, will go silent and a loose time for the release of these hostages, anything can happen, of course. We asked a number of questions, as you rightly point out, not least for some specific detail on how those 13 hostages who have now been identified by Hamas to the Qataris and subsequently to the Israelis, how they will be handed over to the Red Crescent and make their way out of Gaza into ultimately the safety of the Israelis. And this is what Majed Al-Ansari told me: (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AL-ANSARI:  Can't disclose information for security reasons. And as I -- we have always said, our main objective here is the safety of the hostages. So we can't disclose a lot of information regarding the routes they will be going through, but we will be focusing on making sure that they get there safely through making sure that, through our operations room, that will work with both the Red Cross and the parties of the conflict, that all information is in real time and everybody is getting the information the right way, so we can move them safely.

      "sentences": "Correct.We have learned how the process will work for transferring the 13 hostages, the first group that will come out from Hamas to Israel. First, Hamas will hand those hostages over to the Red Cross in Gaza. The Red Cross will then move them to certain border crossings, either Rafah on the Egyptian border, if that's the easiest one to go through, or perhaps, if they're closer to the border crossings with Israel, for example, Erez or Be'eri, they might come out that way. They will be transferred to IDF soldiers who'll be waiting to take them. It's worth noting that those soldiers have been given specific instructions on how to receive those women and children into their care. And that includes what they can say, what they can't say, letting them know they're now in a safe place. That certainly would be a major question, after nearly 50 days of captivity in Gaza. And then, from there, they will be taken almost straight to hospitals. For the hostages under 12 years old, their families will meet them pretty much as soon as they can. For the hostages who are more than 12 years old, the hostages -- the families will meet the hostages at the hospitals. At that point, they will be in Israel. The focus would then shift from the first group to the second group and making sure the process still plays out.",

And, frankly, they're one of the only organizations that really can operate in Gaza, go in, transfer the hostages and bring them out. And that's why they're so crucial here. Now, there is a question about the other roles they play. In addition to transferring the hostages out of Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said that, under the agreement signed with Hamas, they would be able to visit the other hostages who remain in captivity. The only problem there is, we spoke with the Red Cross, and they say they're not aware of that part of the agreement. So that is a very major question hanging over all of this.",

They will need to know if Hamas, for example, has set up certain ambushes or if they have moved many of their fighters into some of the tunnels or moved them somewhere else. Those are the kinds of things they will need to know. They have to expect that Hamas is going to regroup or is trying to regroup. And what they will then do is, when hostilities recommence, should they recommence, they will then target those areas where they believe the Hamas fighters have moved to. So that's, in essence, how this is going to work. But it is going to require a lot of work on the part of the reconnaissance forces of the IDF, as well as their intelligence services.",

But the possibility exists that they will use this time to do what they think they need to do against or in conjunction with Hamas or against the Israeli forces. So that's one thing. But the other thing that Hezbollah can do is basically support the efforts of Hamas. So, if Hamas is getting ready to mount, let's say, a rocket strike against Israeli cities, Hezbollah could do the same thing in the north. So, it could occupy the Israelis in the south, the center, and the north because of the ranges of the different rockets and missiles, in the case of Hezbollah. So those are the things that could happen. Hezbollah will probably try to lay a bit low at this particular point in time. But there's always the possibility that they may seek to exploit any type of movement that Hamas is making or they may seek to take advantage of a lull in fighting in this particular situation.",

They will be handed over to the International Red Cross. But this deal is likely of small comfort to those families whose loved ones thus far are not part of the agreement. Joining us now is Jonathan Dekel-Chen, a history professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. His 35-year-old son, Sagui, was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7. Professor, thank you so much for joining us. How are you and your family, first of all, holding up with this news? And how are your daughter-in-law and your grandchildren holding up? JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE:  Well, we're all doing the best we can under the circumstances. And we are all from kibbutz Nir Oz, so we have a multilevel of crisis and trauma. Not just was Sagui kidnapped, but another 75 -- or actually 80 members of our kibbutz were kidnapped on October 7, another 20 murdered, and our entire community destroyed. So, this news -- and, honestly, I -- for me, it's a -- for all of us, it's a mixed bag, because Sagui will, in all likelihood, not be released in this round. However, we -- I expect that we know very well and are friends with many of those who will be released in this first batch. [13:20:05] And so we couldn't be happier for those families that will be reunited over the course of the next few days with their little children and moms, all of whom are like extended families for us.",

Since the morning of October 7, we and many other of the hostage families have heard absolutely nothing about or from our loved ones. I truly hope -- I mean, it's kind of outrageous that the Red Cross wasn't able to visit with them until now, but it will be really important for all of us to know, all of the 240 or the 190 that will remain after this first stage, to get proof of life, to know if our loved ones are healthy. So that is an important step, but only one step, of course, towards what is the goal for all of us, which is the release of all of the hostages.",

And I -- frustration, I'm not sure that that's the correct word, because we understand this is about Hamas. This isn't about the efforts that the Israeli or the American government, for that matter, are making to ascertain the health, the whereabouts of all of the hostages. I think this is just yet another example of the savagery that we now know, we knew beforehand, but certainly have demonstrated to us during the attack on October 7 by Hamas.

From two days following the attack itself, the Biden administration has been very active in being in contact with me and the other nine families of U.S. dual citizen hostages in Israel. And since that point, the administration officials, national security advisers, State Department, FBI, Senate Foreign Relations Committee have been very transparent with us. And we feel as if there's a partnership being built. And so I really, at this point, cannot say that there's anything specific that I will want to see from the U.S. administration, but for all of us not to be satisfied at this moment by this first wave, which we really hope will come fast over the next few days, but not to be satisfied with that.
