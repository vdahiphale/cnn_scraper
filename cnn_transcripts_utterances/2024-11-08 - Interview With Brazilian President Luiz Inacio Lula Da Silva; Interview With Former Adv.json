Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. The reality of a second more emboldened term for President-Elect Donald Trump is sinking in. Leaders from across the globe flooding him with congratulations and trying to get his ear on issues from the Middle East to Ukraine to wide-ranging tariffs. And of course, there's the climate. Ahead of the COP Summit, which kicks off next week. Trump's re-election has been seen as a major blow to efforts to overcome the existential climate crisis. Now, all these topics that will be on the docket up at the G20 Summit in Brazil later this month, where host Brazilian President Luiz Inacio will no doubt be seeing parallels between Trump's return and his own country's history with Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician known as the Trump of the tropics, whose supporters stormed government buildings after he lost out on a second term. In an exclusive interview, Christiane spoke with President Lula da Silva about all of these issues. Here's their conversation. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But I want to ask you then, do you think that Donald Trump asthe next U.S. president will do what you say, to talk about taxation, to make it more fair for people, to make it more fair for women? I just want to note that the world's 10 richest people became $64 billion richer from Trump's re-election. That's what Bloomberg is saying. What would you tell Donald Trump about your views on how to make a more equal world? DA SILVA (through translator): Well, first of all, I'm on board that we have to say to President Trump is the following. First, I think that we, too, as head of states and government of two important countries in the Americas, we have to have a very civilized relationship, a democratic relationship, because Brazil has a privileged relationship with the U.S. We are trade partners for many decades and many years, and I believe the stock of investment of the U.S. in Brazil is tremendous. And so, I believe the two heads of state when they meet, we have to talk about the interests of the U.S. and the Brazil interest and what is important for the relationship of two heads of state. And I have a past track, because I had a very good, excellent relationship with George W. Bush when I took over in 2003. They said to me, it's going to be difficult with Bush. But it was an extraordinary relationship with Bush. I also had a very good relationship with Obama. And I have a very good relationship with President Biden. And this relationship should continue because two heads of state, although they could have divergence, political ideological divergence, when they meet, what prevails is the interest of the state, not personal interest. And so, what I want to discuss with the U.S. is the interest, the 200-year- old relationship of Brazil and the U.S., what both countries have to do so that we can improve the quality of life of the people that we represent.",

In fact, Bolsonaro was called the Trump of the tropics. And Bolsonaro wants to come back to be president. He wants to run against you. His own party chairman said that he was rooting for Trump because that would help put things in order here, consolidating the right in the largest western democracy. So, do you think Trump is going to be good for you and your vision of the people, or will it help bring Bolsonaro back? Lay the groundwork for that. DA SILVA (through translator): Well, Bolsonaro was president, and I defeated him. If he was supporting Trump, there was no votes -- he has no votes in the U.S., and he couldn't win the elections through that. Sincerely, Amanpour, I have the following news to the world. I've been following the discussions in the U.S., I've been following the debates on television, and I believe that each candidate establishes a strategy to win the elections. And I want to say very clearly to the American people that I will have, with President Trump, a respectful relationship as the head of state of Brazil, and I hope that he will have the same respect relationship as the head of the state of the U.S. So, if we manage to establish this line of behavior of civility, of respect, the rest becomes easier. And when I took over, Amanpour, I visit Bush in 2002, I haven't been inaugurated yet. You know, and on that occasion, Bush invited me to participate in the Iraq war. And I told the President Bush, I cannot participate in the Iraq war because there's no chemical weapons there, because I don't know Saddam Hussein and thirdly, because Iraq is 14,000 kilometers from Brazil, and then I have a war to wage in Brazil is to fight against hunger and poverty. And we managed to end with hunger in Brazil. And in the previous administration, the government -- hunger went back. When I took office, now, 33 million people were starving and we already lifted 22 and a half million people from hunger and will lift all the other 10 million left to the end of my term in 2026.",

DA SILVA (through translator): Well, I believe that President Trump, he has to think as an inhabitant of the planet Earth. And if he thinks as the ruler of the most important, richest country in the world, most important, that has the high -- more technology that is better prepared from the arms viewpoint, he has to have the notion that the U.S. is in the same planet that I am, and that in an island of 300,000 inhabitants it is. And so, all of us, we have to take responsibility for the maintenance of this planet, of the Earth. We need to guarantee that the planet should not be -- suffer a warming of more -- above than 1.6 degrees. We need to guarantee that the rivers should continue healthy with clean waters. And so, we need to guarantee that the biomes of all the countries should be preserved. And so, this is a commitment that I have not only as the president of Brazil, as a human being that lives in the planet called Earth and that there's no other place to live and only Earth.",

Are you going to run for re-election and why? What about a younger generation? DA SILVA (through translator): Well, first of all, let me say to you with very great caress and great respect. First, I have 79 years of age and I'm asking for God to live until 120, if God will allow me to. I take care of my health. I wake up very early, 5:30 in the morning to have two hours of workout in a gym. I take care of my body and my health. I'm not a candidate for 2026. What I said is that in 2026 I have the commitment to deliver to this country an economy growing, creating jobs with less people with illiteracy. This is what I want to deliver in this country. Everybody having three meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. People that have access to expert health care. This is what I want for my country. And this is what I'm going to do. Now, 2026, I'm going to think about 2026 in 2026. If there are many parties that support me, I'm going to discuss this with great tranquility because to govern, it's not like playing soccer, to govern, is not to exercise or practice sports, it's not the youth that's going to solve the world governance problems. What's going to solve the world governance problem is the competence of the ruler, the mindset of the ruler, the health of those -- and the commitments that the ruler has. Now, when it comes to time that the parties understand that there's no other candidate to confront someone that comes from the far-right that is denialist, that doesn't believe in medicine, that doesn't believe in science, obviously, I will be willing to run again. But I hope it won't be necessary. And I hope that we'll have other candidates and so that we can have great political renovation in the country and in the world.",

Sources tell CNN the groundwork is already being laid for such action. It's just one policy that an unrestricted Trump administration could enact that would dramatically shift America and its national security policies. So, let's get some insight now. Olivia Troye worked in the first Trump White House, focusing in particular on Homeland Security and was an adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence. During the presidential race, she forcefully spoke out against Trump and campaigned for Kamala Harris. And she joins me now. Olivia, welcome to the program. Good to see you. So, this time around, Trump's victory looks a bit different. He won a clear national mandate. It looks all but certain that he's won over the Senate. And while we still are counting the votes in terms of the House, it looks positive for Republicans as well. Given that, what do you expect him to do with that mandate?",

And so, I think given that this is a situation and he will have unchecked power if they do indeed take the House as well, I think we're looking at some pretty extreme measures here.",

As someone who lived the Trump administration firsthand for all four years, whether I was in the Department of Homeland Security, which obviously carried a lot of the executive orders that had to deal with immigration, whether it was the travel ban or other border security measures, and then working it inside the White House, this is someone who does not believe in basic rule of law, and he doesn't believe in our legal measures or rules and institutions. This is someone who undermines our government institutions, and he did undermine them during his first presidency. And so, I think when you have unchecked power there is not going to be congressional pushback when he tries to do things where they're not congressionally mandated, or what if he's trying to transfer funds to actually carry out these mass raids and deportations. It can manifest itself in different ways. And while I understand that people will say, well, the courts will hold, we can litigate this, the lawsuits, well, what happens when he has full control over the legislative and the like judicial process as well?

But I would say that Susie is falling into the classic mentality of like, I will have control and I will be able to manage this situation when it comes to Donald Trump. But the reality is that no one can. And I don't know how many examples people have to have before they realize that no one is different than anyone else. At some point, you will either get thrown under the bus or you will have to abide by his bidding, and you will have to bend to what he wants you to do. And look, I lived -- you know, I was there for John Kelly as a chief of staff. I was there for Mick Mulvaney as a chief of staff. I was there when I saw him take a stand against Trump at times, especially during the COVID pandemic. And then he got removed from his role after some pretty strong pushback. And then it was Mark Meadows. And then I lived the Mark Meadows era. So -- and everybody goes in saying, I'm not going to let the clown car. I think that's how she referred to it. I'm not going to have a clown car. I'm not going to have the charlatans come into the White House. But the reality is that all of these circles are intertwined and Donald Trump listens to them. So, they're going to have a direct link to the Oval Office and an ear (ph) there, no matter what. And she may try to put measures, but from what I saw firsthand, those measures only last for a short while and just -- if there's any more visible case, it was also for my former boss, Mike Pence, who did try to manage the situation. He was sometimes the voice of reason, but it didn't matter because what Donald Trump is going to do what Donald Trump is going to do.",

And he represented the return of traditional alliance building. After all, President Biden was, in many ways, the sort of last warrior of the old Cold War. He had come to age in the United States Senate during that time. He ran the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he had, of course, been vice president during one of the most critical periods of the post-Cold War era. Now, with President Trump's re-election, the real question is, was Biden the blip? Could President Biden be viewed by history later on as sort of the last gasp of that old order? One marked, as you noted, by building alliances, relying on NATO, building up alliances in the Pacific, which was really a hallmark of Biden's four years in office, free trade, or at least freer trade, the concept of 100 percent, 200 percent, 400 percent tariffs, as now President-Elect Trump talked about during the campaign, you wouldn't have heard that come very easily out of Joe Biden's lips.",

That was over cyber-attacks that emanated from Russia and hit the American oil and gas pipelines. It was not largely about Ukraine. They barely communicated since, never met in person during that time. I am quite certain that President-Elect Trump believes that what works in diplomacy is in what he would call great man diplomacy, that he can talk to Vladimir Putin, that he can talk to Xi Jinping, that they're scared of him, that Xi would not dare to take Taiwan because he thinks that Trump is blanking crazy, that's what he told The Wall Street Journal, right? So, he is very much of the belief that the personal diplomacy is the key to all of this. I think that can be a bit of a trap because the Chinese learned how to play President-Elect Trump by dangling trade deals. Putin seemed to develop a relationship with him that put very few limits on the Russians. But I'm sure that Trump believes that he can bring about peace in Ukraine and the end to the new Cold Wars through the strength of his personal diplomas.",

He'd get these letters from Secretary of State Blinken or Secretary of Defense Austin saying there are legal restrictions on the way that you can use American provided weaponry. And if you don't allow aid into Gaza or you're using those weapons against civilians, there will be restrictions. And he basically tossed them aside and said, let's wait for the election, because he knows that the Trump view -- in fact, we believe President Trump said this to him in a conference to Netanyahu, in a conversation a few weeks ago, is do what you need to do. And so, the era of restrictions is going to be over. And, you know, that was the message that Harris was trying to send out in Michigan, to the Arab populace and others who were very unhappy with the way she dealt with the war against Hamas in Gaza. And her answer was, at least we're pushing Netanyahu a bit, Trump wouldn't push him at all.",

I think the place where the rubberwill hit the road on this, Walter, will be on Iran itself. You'll remember that during the first term, President Trump talked a very tough line against Iran, but he pulled back once or twice when there were opportunities to get into a deeper conflict with them. He did order the killing of General Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force, one of the most elite military commanders in Iran, but he pulled back from opening up a broader war with them. We don't know what his view is now. But the Iranians have, of course, we believe, sent out, or at least tried to order up, hit teams against Trump when he was candidate. They've denounced him. Their cyber operations in the United States were anti-Trump, even while the Russians were pro-Trump. So, my guess is that Trump comes into office with a much hardened view about Iran and may well not stand in the way of Netanyahu if he decides to go after Iranian nuclear facilities, for example, and so forth. I don't know that Netanyahu is going to do that. He's hesitated himself a few times. But certainly, that was a big concern of the Biden administration just in the last few months.",

And of course, they were trying to reconstruct the Saudi Arabia deal in the days before the October 7, 2023 attacks. They hope that might come back this year. It did not. I think it's very possible that Trump may push in that direction. And if he did, I think that could actually change the diplomatic complexion of the Middle East.",
