In Gaza alone, the IDF said it hit 320 -- quote -- \"terror targets\" overnight, including tunnels and dozens of Hamas and Islamic Jihad command centers. A spokesperson from the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says hundreds were killed. A warning now that the video you're about to see is graphic. You see there one of the smallest victims, a toddler pulled from the rubble in Rafah in Southern Gaza. We do not know the condition of that little boy.

      "sentences": "Well, Jake, driving along the -- Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, it is clear that this is a massive force that is waiting, that is preparing to go into Gaza.In just one area of about a square mile, we saw not just dozens, but hundreds of tanks, armored personnel carriers and these D9 bulldozers, which are used to tear up any potential IEDs and any other obstacles before a ground force moves in that. We saw this force on Saturday, and we saw them today. There has certainly been some movement in the forces. But, beyond that, they appear to be just waiting for that command to finally come in order to move forward. And what we are also seeing is, the IDF is certainly preparing the ground in Gaza for those forces to move in. They said yesterday that they were going to be intensifying airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. And, today, we saw evidence of that with the IDF confirming that they hit 320 targets overnight, including Hamas tunnels and operational centers, as well as mortar and missile positions of Hamas militants inside the Gaza Strip. The death toll, of course, of those strikes has also come in. At least 436 people were killed overnight from those strikes, including 182 children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. All of this, Jake, is coming as we are learning that the United States has asked Israel to delay its invasion of the Gaza Strip in order to allow for more time for these Qatar-led mediation efforts to try and get some of those hostages through. Now, it appears that Israel is perhaps willing to delay that for a few days, but certainly not inevitably. When you listen to Israeli officials, it is clear that they intend to move into the Gaza Strip with a significant ground force. The question at this point, Jake, is when.",

President Biden has brought it up in virtually every conversation hehas had with Prime Minister Netanyahu, as well as other world leaders. Last weekend, he held a number of calls with world leaders where these hostages, of course, were discussed, as well as the process of getting humanitarian aid into Gaza. But, look, it appears, according to our reporting from our colleague Alex Marquardt, that the U.S. has been urging Israel to delay this ground invasion in order to see how these hostage negotiations continue to play out. Qatar has been leading those negotiations with Hamas. And the U.S. believes that, following Hamas' decision to release two American hostages last week, there might be some forward momentum in getting the additional hostages released, clearly a priority for the White House because there are several Americans that are believed right now to be inside Gaza being held hostage by Hamas. Now, pressed on this directly, the National Security Council spokesperson, John Kirby, he would not confirm that the U.S. is putting active pressure on Israel to engage in any kind of military strategy one way or another. And we should note that the Israelis have also denied that they are feeling any pressure by the Biden administration to delay their incursion. But Kirby did say that the U.S. is in constant contact with the Israelis about their -- quote -- \"plans, intentions, and strategy.\" Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this is part of a really broader escalation that the U.S. has seen from these groups, believed to be Iranian proxy groups in the region, targeting U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. Now, according to the Pentagon, no U.S. troops were injured in these drone attacks either this week or last week. We saw a number, as many as four, separate drone attacks on bases, coalition bases, where U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq and Syria. But the U.S. is really concerned about this, and that is why we saw Secretary of Defense Austin order additional air defense capabilities to the region over the weekend to try to protect these troops from these aerial bombardments that appear to be increasing in their frequency against U.S. troops in the region, amid this larger backlash to the U.S.' support for Israel.",

You have already seen indicators that that's going to happen. You just mentioned the drone attacks on any deterrent forces in both Iraq and Syria that the U.S. has there. There's already been attempts at strikes from Yemen, which were intercepted by the deterrent force of the U.S. Navy. So what you see is the potential for other nations or other terrorist groups to become involved. And this plays into something I have been saying for a long time. A doctrine of Hamas is the victims doctrine. They will try and use any kind of public action by Israel to blame Israel for deaths and destructions. And, of course, Israel is contributing to that. And that's what the administration, the U.S. administration, is concerned about. But with each death, with each airstrike, there are more and more Palestinians and Arab states throughout the area that are saying Israel doesn't have to do that, when, in fact, they are attempting, just like the Ukrainians, by the way, to defend their territory, to defend their people. And it results in horrific civilian casualties. But this has been the nature of any war between Hamas and Israel over the last two decades.",

There's no way to climb back up. And so you can only go forward and down. There's no up and back. There is real turning either. You have to just sort of commit to a point and go for it.
