Also, a victory lap before Election Day. In a CNN exclusive, Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has big plans as he banks on his party winning control of the House.

I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Jake Tapper. And we are officially in the home stretch. Here in a little more than 12 hours, the midterm campaign ends and Election Day voting begins. More than 41 million voters have already cast a ballot, eclipsing early voting numbers from 2018. Today, candidates are racing around. They're trying to get FaceTime with the people that they hope will be become their constituents. President Biden and former President Trump are both on the campaign trail today. Biden heading to Maryland tonight, while Trump will stump in Ohio. Hoping to energize their respective bases and sway any last- minute swing voters. But, ultimately, you, the voters, will decide who controls the House, the Senate, your state's elections and laws, and who will be governor in 36 states. Let's bring in CNN political director David Chalian here to help us prioritize what to watch for up and down the ballot. So, David, let's start with some of these key East Coast house races to watch earlier in the evening in places like Virginia, Connecticut, and Rhode island.",

But Republican Allen Fung, Seth Magaziner, the Democrat, they are in a very close election there. So, watch that. In Connecticut, next door in the fifth congressional district out here. You have the Democratic incumbent Jahana Hayes against George Logan. Democrats are so worried about this district in blue Connecticut that Vice President Harris was there campaigning. Joe Biden won this by more than ten percentage points. And then down in Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, she was one of the majority makers in 2018, in the seventh congressional district. This district was redrawn, Brianna, to become a little more Democratic. Actually, it should benefit her. Joe Biden won it by more than six percentage points.

And the closing message that we're going to hear from him during this election eve rally is largely the same court message that he delivered 75 days ago in about 20 miles from here and another part of the state. And that is that these midterm elections, according to the president, are a choice rather than a referendum. But we have seen some changes, particularly in the final weeks of thiscampaign, as voters have signaled that the economy and inflation are their top concern, and polls have shown that the issues are driving voters towards Republicans. We've seen the president put a bigger emphasis on those economic issues, particularly at the top of his speech, whereas before, it was further down. At the top, before, you might have heard about abortion and democracy. Now you're hearing the president drive home this economic message. He's also driving home that contrast, sharpening the contrast with Republicans. And Biden advisers tell me, that's largely thanks to Republicans, laying out in clear terms what they would do if they take back the Republican majority. And that is, according to Biden advisor, the biggest thing that has changed in the presidents speech overtime. Now, Maryland was selected in part because it is where the president delivered his opening campaign message. But also because Democrats are expecting that Maryland will be a bright spot in a night that could otherwise turn very dark for Democrats as it relates to Congress. That's because Democrats here expect to flip the governor's race with the Democrat expected to win -- Brianna.",

Just moments, ago I talked to two people who are incredibly close to Trump who say they have are not aware that any firm decision has been made. Now, as we reported four weeks, Trump is eager to announce a third presidential run. The timing was the big question here. What we are looking at, the potential of him getting up here in announcing that run while he is sitting here with his handpicked candidate. Now, he had tried to announce, or wanted to announce before the midterms, but was convinced by people close to him, that was a mistake. If Republicans didn't do, well he would be blamed. But sources tell my colleague that, Gabby Orr, he believes he could announce tonight, and not be blamed, because the advertising window is closed. Meaning, they could actually put up any ads linking him to these candidates. I will note one thing. Ohio was always a place that we're looking at for this third presidential announcement.

I believe we are in a double negative election, where you have a majority of voters who believe that Biden has not performed adequately on crime, immigration, and inflation. But you have pretty close to a majority that is an easy about what the Trump era Republican Party means for their rights, their values, and democracy itself.So, on balance, the verdict on Biden is probably going to weigh more than the verdict on Trump and the Trump era Republican Party.

This has spread almost completely across the 23 states where Republicans had unified control. With much less attention, there has been Republicans in the house and Senate who have introduced bills to nationalize each of these initiatives, and in effect, to impose the red state regime on to blue states. I think what you're going to see and the next two years, Biden is still president, is the off Broadway stage of this, where Republicans are going to test out what they can build support for in their coalition, in their caucus, and work toward it the next time they have unified control.
