And with theflattish type sales, that kind of fits in with the narrative that we`re hearing. Now the consumer has been resilient. The consumer is focused on newness and innovation. And when there`s some differentiation with the product, they`re spending. Target saw all of that. And you could argue that are some consumers trading down a little bit to Walmart or is Walmart just doing a better job reaching up and capturing customers? That`s part of it too.",

I think there was a lot of concern prior to the election that we`d be worried about, you know, litigation and potential violence on the streets. We don`t have that. The consumer can settle down and really now focus on the holiday season and focus on getting goods and gifts for their family. And I think that we will see a relatively decent holiday season. It seems like there will be winners and losers. Walmart will be among the winners, we believe. But we think spending will happen for this holiday season. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Answer is whale sharks, which grow up to 60 feet long with mouths that can stretch to nearly five feet. But did you know their throats are only about the size of a quarter? So they can only eat things like tiny shrimp, fish and plankton. Whale sharks are hunted for their fins, meat and oils. The world`s tallest animal may soon be added to the endangered and threatened species list. Giraffe populations are in fast decline according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. How did this happen? Well, U.S. wildlife officials say it could be because of habitat loss, urbanization, increasing droughts, as well as poaching, hunters killing them for their body parts. Since 1985, the populations of three subspecies of northern giraffes have decreased from almost 26,000 to just under 6,000 today. That`s a 77% decline in the last 39 years. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing many giraffe species as endangered or threatened, which would help put additional protections in place for them under the Endangered Species Act. If the proposal is approved, it would be the first time ever that giraffes would receive those types of federal protections.

The stadium will seat more than 90,000 people and is designed to host matches for the 2034 World Cup. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a bid for 2034.
