And it was very touching to me, and I think to a lot of people that the King in particular honored his grandfather and grandmother. His grandfather by wearing a number of the vestments that he had worn.And I think it is a moment, not only to honor the traditions of the monarchy which go back a thousand years, but in an imaginative way, King Charles also brought some innovations. He has been, for his whole life, a believer in bringing faiths together. So on the one hand, he is the defender of the faith and he is required by law to be the defender of the faith. He also did, in a number of ways today, honor the other faiths in this -- in this nation, then vowed to protect them. And that he expressed both in the beginning of the service and at the end of the service. So I think he -- you know, it was -- it was as profoundly a Church of England set of rituals and ceremonies as we can see. But on the other hand, it was also an affirmation of his belief that it was equally his job to protect faiths and even nature. There was a real strong theme of his reverence for nature, even in the -- in the shield behind which he was anointed. There are all sorts of -- there are embroidered all sorts of themes of nature. And I was glad that he chose to be anointed in privacy. I thought that -- you know, that was a very sacred moment. It was one that his own mother insisted on keeping away from the television cameras.

That is all Senate Republicans except for six of them standing behind the position of the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy that he will not support a clean debt ceiling. That he wants to see spending cuts and budget reforms.These 43 Senate Republicans writing in a letter to the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that they will not allow a vote on raising the debt ceiling without, quote, \"substantive spending and budget reforms. And so, the White House is now firing back in a very fiery statement from the White House's Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates saying, quote, \"Every one of these senators just announced to the country and their constituents that they are holding millions of Americans jobs, businesses and retirement accounts hostage. At a moment when the country just posted historic job gains, this is no time for these senators to reverse their support for avoiding default without conditions during the Trump presidency. They need to honor their constitutional obligation to pay our bills and not unilaterally inflict a recession on the country.\" Now this is significant. I mean, we have already seen the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He has already suggested that look, the White House has to negotiate with the Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. But this increasingly makes it clear that Senate Republicans are not going to be the off ramp that perhaps the White House at one point hoped that they might be, to allow for some kind of a clean debt ceiling increase. Instead, what is happening just days before President Biden sits down with the Speaker of the House and the other congressional leaders is that Senate Republicans, the majority of them, the overwhelming majority of them standing in lock step with the Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, and House Republicans who just passed that bill that said we will raise the debt ceiling if you agree to nearly cutting the federal budget by nearly 14 percent. So all of this coming to a head on Tuesday. Folks here at the White House are hoping that they can get these things on two separate tracks. President Biden has said repeatedly raising the debt ceiling is Congress' constitutional obligation. But he has said he is willing to have a conversation about spending but without that threat of the debt ceiling looming over them, Paula.",

Now you get shows for series that have fewer episodes, anywhere from eight to 10 instead of, you know, premium cable.When I was on \"Six Feet Under,\" we did 12 episodes a year. Network TV does 22. But now you can get your same fee, but if you are only doing eight or 10 episodes, that shortens the amount of money you are getting. But also production lengths have grown over time. So you can -- those 10 episodes take anywhere from 10 months to over a year to produce. And if you are in a writers' room for only 20 weeks, which is the typical contract, and you're off work, all the scripts are banked before, you know, production starts., that means, even if the show wants you to come back for another season, you will be off work from anywhere from 30 to more than 50 weeks.",

He's made it more likely that there will be more capital punishment in Florida because he is lowering the number of jurors you need to get capital punishment enacted in a case that. Now it's unanimous. You have to have all 12 jurors. He's lowering it to eight. There are other subjects he would be better off never mentioning again, including his very strict, very conservative six-week ban on abortion, which is not going to sell nationally. It will sell to the right wing of the Republican Party, but that's it.

And I think he recognizes that. Some people say it is because of Vice President Kamala Harris. I think it is much more than that. It just contradicts common wisdom that someone who is going to be 82 in an election year, potentially 86 at the end of a second term, is not going to be able to deal with the issues in the same complicated way that maybe someone who is much younger could. But it is always about the opposition. You know, Donald Trump is only four years younger. If he's the Republican nominee, it is almost impossible to see Republicans using that issue effectively. Now, if the Republicans pick Ron DeSantis or Nikki Haley or Tim Scott or one of the younger candidates, I could see that becoming a major issue. Though, not necessarily the determining one.

Some not so accurate. But if it is anywhere near as many shots as they're saying they heard, then certainly, you're looking at the possibility of having casualties. Having, unfortunately, a relatively high number of casualties, if, in fact, you had 60 shots go off. But again, this is early. Very early. There will be a lot of information coming in. We don't know what happened. We don't know if there were shots fired. We don't know if there was anyone injured. People are leaving in a very orderly fashion. The police don't seem to be rushing too much. I don't know what they have inside the mall right now that they're trying to contain. You can imagine, with an outlet mall, how many entrances there are. And you try to cover them so there's some order to the way in which you get people out. If there is, in fact, a shooter there, obviously, he will want to be able to get out himself.
