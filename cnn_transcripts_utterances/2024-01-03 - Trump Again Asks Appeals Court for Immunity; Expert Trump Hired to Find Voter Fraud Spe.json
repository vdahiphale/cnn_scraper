It's been two weeks since the Colorado Supreme Court removed him from the ballot.We've seen him file a challenge in Maine to the state court, but really we need the Supreme Court to weigh in here and offer clarity to the states and the candidates about this question of ballot eligibility under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. Now the Republican party in Colorado has already filed its appeal. So the impact of that was twofold. One, it put that decision to remove Trump from the ballot on hold. So he is expected, unless the Supreme Court acts in the next few days, to appear on the primary ballot. And it also means the Supreme Court could take up that appeal if Trump doesn't ultimately end up filing his own. But I'm told by multiple sources, he does expect to file an appeal. And look, time is of the essence here. They really need to clarify this question ahead of the general election.",

And we saw last night, once again, the Trump team filing a brief reiterating a lot of the arguments they've made. Insisting that he should not be criminally charged for any actions that he took while in office. They pointed to the quote, 234 years of unbroken tradition of not prosecuting presidents for official acts. But of course, a lower court found that what he did related to January 6th, it's not part of his official duties. It's not protected.And of course, the special counsel has said, look, if we allow president's absolute immunity for anything they do in office, they're going to start committing crimes to stay in office. We can't have that. So look, even sources close to the Trump legal team say they don't expect that he's actually going to win on this issue of immunity. But the long-term goal is to delay this case, right? That's the strategy. That same source puts it at about 50-50, whether this case goes this year. Because remember, the whole thing is on pause until this immunity question is resolved, something that could ultimately go to the Supreme Court or not. But with all of these issues, fascinating constitutional questions, but time is really the big issue here.",

Voting data analyst Ken Block joins us now. He owns Simpatico Software Systems and he wrote the new book, \"Disproven.\" He also recently wrote an opinion piece for USA Today titled, \"Trump paid me to find voter fraud. He then lied after I found the 2020 election wasn't stolen.\" Ken, thank you so much for being with us. First, I want to start with why you think the Trump campaign hired you and whether you ever got the sense that they wanted you to bring them findings that went beyond the truth.",

I don't believe that -- actually, I know for a fact that there were no expectations placed upon me in terms of you must deliver us fraud no matter what.As we negotiated my contract to do this work, I was very clear with them that the data would take me wherever it led and that that would have to be acceptable to the campaign. And the campaign was very gracious about that and said, no, we totally understand that. We want -- this is surprising to a lot of people -- but the Trump campaign attorneys that I reported to wanted an honest assessment of voter fraud so that they didn't file erroneous lawsuits. There were a couple of different camps of lawyers involved in the litigating the election. I worked for the more careful. SANCHEZ: I see you do write that your team communicated directly with the White House chief of staff at the time, Mark Meadows, that you found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. I'm curious if you've got a sense of his reaction and whether you know how and when that message was communicated to President Trump.",

What worries me greatly is I have a lot of friends and acquaintances who only hear about the claims of fraud and they believe firmly that voter fraud must be everywhere because those are the -- that's the only that's the only news they received. It's the only messaging that they're hearing from their politicians.And what's frustrating for me is the fact that I was the guy. I looked for it. It wasn't there. And that information has not been covered by one conservative media outlet anywhere in the country. And it's really problematic for everybody that we're not getting balanced information about what actually happened in the 2020 election. And that's how I find myself in front of you today.",

You added that none of the allegations you saw about 2020 provides those three things.Help us understand what that means. Is it possible that your analysis somehow missed something?",

You have to understand that in the starting the day after the election, there's roughly a 30-day period in which you can contest an election result before most states certify the results. And once the results are certified, there really isn't much you can do from a legal perspective. So inside that 30 days, we covered a lot of ground in a hurry. We didas much as was humanly possible with the size of the staff and the budget that we had. I would never claim that it was completely exhaustive. On the other hand, what I would tell you, though, is if there was fraud and if it was provable and verifiable and everything else, somebody would have brought it forward by now. So the fact that that hasn't happened makes me very confident that we didn't miss anything in the work that was done in November of 2020.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, I mean, antibiotic resistance is a huge problem. The researchers here actually refer to it as a silent pandemic. There are almost 3 million infections every year in the United States with microbes, either bacteria or other bugs that are resistant to drugs to treat them, causing more than 35,000 deaths. And worldwide, the numbers are even bigger, an estimated 5 million deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance, and that's expected to double by 2050.And so there are desperate needs for new medicines to treat these drug-resistant microbes. Now, this one particular bacteria is especially problematic. It's known as Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Baumannii. There is an acronym for that, and it's CRAB. This is one that can affect patients in the hospital, causing an estimated 8,500 cases per year in the U.S. and 700 deaths. And it is on the top of the list from the WHO and the CDC of priorities to try to find better drugs to treat it. Because, as you can see there in the name, it's resistant to an important class of medicines. Now, in this very early research just published in the journal Nature, these researchers from both the drug company Roche and Harvard have shown that they have come up with a potential new class of antibiotics that essentially gums up the mechanisms of how this bacteria works so that it causes the cell death, essentially, and so it can overcome the problems with resistance in this bacteria. So this is really early- stage research. It still needs to be borne out through many more years of clinical trials, but so far promising news, and we really need a lot more of it for this antibiotic resistance problem -- Boris.",
