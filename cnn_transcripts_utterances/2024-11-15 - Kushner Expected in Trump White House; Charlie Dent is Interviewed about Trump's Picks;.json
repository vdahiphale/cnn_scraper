And the main reason for that is when you talk to diplomats from the region, when you talk to people in Trump's foreign policy circles, they point to the deep relationships that Kushner developed with Arab leaders while he was in the White House during the first Trump administration, and the fact that he has maintained those relationships.One diplomat from the region I spoke to said that all of the incoming members of Trump's team don't have what Kushner has in terms of the trust from the leaders in the region. He worked on those relationships. He maintained those relationships. Another source said that relationships in the region are really fundamental to getting anything done. Now, he's not expected to join the team, as I said, as a formal player. But from the outside, even this go round, it's going to be a little bit different. There will be complications. There will be tension because one of the things that Jared Kushner did over the last few years was develop an investment fund. He has a $2 billion investment from Saudi Arabia in that fund. So, there are some current diplomats who are concerned about the role that he will likely play from the outside because they're concerned about prioritization of the U.S./Saudi relationship in some ways that could financially benefit Kushner. But when you look at the members of the team that Trump has already pulled in over the last few days, a key question is how they're going to interact with Jared Kushner, right? And so I've talked to sources who say that they are developing those relationships. A source familiar with the matter says that Kushner's able to advise and brief them from the outside as much as they want. And a lot of these nominees have already read Jared Kushner's book, or are reading it, an indication that he is already involved in these relationship. We'll have to see how they play out. John.",

They were probably going to recommend some kind of a sanction on Matt Gaetz, reprimand, censure, who knows, maybe expulsion, which would be moot at this point. They could recommend all those things, but it - but now that the investigation is complete, the committee will be under tremendous pressure to release it. I think they can. You may remember Senator John Ensign was, I believe he resigned from the Senate, and a report was released after his resignation, as I recall. So, it's happened. And also, as part of the vetting process for Matt Gaetz for - for attorney general position, since he is a nominee, both Senators Durbin and Cornyn, I think, would like to see this report. They would like this report to be part of their record as they consider him as a - consider Gaetz as the next attorney general nominee. So, I think that this is a - I think there will be tremendous pressure to release it. The fact that the committee canceled its meeting today does not mean they won't meet next week or the following week. They still have time to deal with this.
