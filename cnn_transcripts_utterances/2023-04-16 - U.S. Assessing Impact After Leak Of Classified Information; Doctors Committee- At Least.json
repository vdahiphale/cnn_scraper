After a huge leak of U.S. intelligence information, U.S. officials are engaging in damage control and grappling with fallout both at home and abroad. 21-year-old Jack Teixeira, a member of the Massachusetts National Guardsmen is in custody ahead of a hearing next week. He's charged under the Espionage Act.Now according to court documents, Teixeira worked as an I.T. for an intelligence unit and needed top secret clearance to work on the systems involved. Prosecutors say he began posting classified materials online in December. Inquiries are underway at the Pentagon and the Justice Department. CNN White House Correspondent Jeremy Diamond has more.

That's because we're talking about dozens of highly classified documents that were leaked online allegedly by this 21-year-old airman Jack Teixeira.This intelligence spans the gamut really, we're talking about looks into how deep the U.S. has been able to get into the Russian Ministry of Defense as well as the Russian mercenary group, the Wagner group, we're also talking about what the U.S. does in terms of intelligence gathering with key U.S. allies eavesdropping on allies like South Korea, Israel, and Ukraine and also now some new information about Taiwan and their vulnerability to a potential Chinese air attack. So now the Pentagon in partnership with these intelligence agencies is working to assess what the potential damage could be to U.S. national security and also to those U.S. allies. We did get a statement from President Biden yesterday about what he would like to see and he says in the statement, quote, that he commends the rapid action taken by law enforcement to investigate and respond to the recent dissemination of classified U.S. government documents. While we are still determining the validity of those documents. I've directed our military and intelligence community to take steps to further secure and limit distribution of sensitive information. And our national security team is closely coordinating with our partners and allies. Now, we do know that the Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has already been working to assess the potential access and security of classified information going forward, reviewing some of the protocols about who has access to this information, as one of the central questions here is really why Jack Teixeira had access to this information and whether other people like him should potentially not have access to it going forward. Now, in terms of this damage assessment that the Pentagon is conducting. That is separate from the investigation being led by the Justice Department that led to these charges in the arrest of Jack Teixeira on Thursday. But that damage assessment could ultimately be used as evidence in a potential eventual trial. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We've just been reporting on, for instance, in the eastern city of Port Sudan. There is some intense fighting there, that is the main seaport for the country, a lot of international trade passes through Port Sudan, and that is currently being battled for.There are reports all across the nation of especially around military bases that are either shared -- either owned by the rapid support forces or the Sudanese military because it speaks to how militarized the entire society and politics of Sudan is that there's so many military bases across the country, and strategic installations that are now being fought between those who are on the team of General al- Burhan, who leads the country and his deputy, General Hemeti. Right now, I want to show you two videos that speaks to how far this has gone. The first is members of the rapid support forces using anti- aircraft artillery to try and take down the air power that the army is using against them. They are outnumbered and out powered in the air. And that's one of the ways they're trying to attack that. The second is from last night. This is -- this was posed to the Sudanese armed forces who claimed to have taken back control of the state television and radio authority. This one is an important one strategically, because whoever has control over the state broadcaster can talk to the nation. It's a dangerous escalation in tensions that I've been building over the past couple of weeks and especially this week, and this is how we got here. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Civilians have been told to take cover was two of the country's main military factions the army and a powerful paramilitary group called the rapid support forces or RSF fight for supremacy. Fighter jets launched by the army led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan fly low over the Sudanese capital, with fighting reported in key sites like the presidential palace and Khartoum International Airport.This video shows the chaos inside a terminal with some people fearing for their lives as the battles fled outside. The gunshots in some parts of Khartoum so loud, they could be heard during the live television broadcast. Clashes also erupting in other parts of the country, with RSF fighters in the northern city of Merowe claiming to control a military airbase there. It's unclear which side started the fighting. General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo better known as Hemeti heads the RSF, which analysts say is 100,000 strong and grew out of the country's bloody conflict and therefore. Hemeti says the army instigated the battle, calling al-Burhan, a criminal. The army accused the RSF of traitorous plotting and says there will be no dialogue until the group is dissolved. Tensions between the two factions have been festering since negotiation restarted to return Sudan's civilian rule. Part of the deal requires the RSF to merge with the army. But there were strong disagreements over how long they should take and who would ultimately have more power. Both al-Burhan and Hemeti have worked together in the past when their interests aligned. The army and the RSF taking part in a coup four years ago to overthrow a longtime Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir. And both were involved in another coup two years later, when the military seizes control over transitional power sharing government, which is meant to lead to civilian rule. The country's former Prime Minister now appealing for both sides to stop the fighting.

That of course raising significant concerns. The official line from the Russian Defense Ministry they're pretty vague at the moment say they'll discuss the state and outlook for bilateral cooperation in the defense sector and current questions of global and regional security.

On Thursday, an El Nino watch was issued by the Climate Prediction Center. And that's likely to have some big implications on the upcoming tropical season. Here's why. Traditionally speaking when you have El Nino that Jetstream begins to shift farther south in doing so it can kind of increases the wind shear across this particular region, effectively inhibiting tropical storm development in that same region. [05But also at the same time, we tend to have fewer storms forming just off the coast of Africa. So overall, you tend to have a slightly below normal season. And that is exactly what Colorado State University, the first entity to make their predictions for the tropical upcoming season has decided to go with. They are forecasting 13 total named storms, six of which are expected to become hurricanes, two of them major hurricanes, which is essentially category three, four or five. Now for some perspective, an average season has 14 total names, seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes. But to also put this in perspective, take a look at last year, for example, we were relatively average in terms of the overall season. With that said, we still ended up with two storms that ended up becoming retired, Hurricane Fiona and Hurricane Ian. So at the end of the day, whether it's a below average season or not, it only takes one storm to be impactful. Now, as well as El Nino there is also another component going into the upcoming season, and that's warm ocean temperatures, because already so far, we're seeing sea surface temperatures across the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea and even the Atlantic Ocean above average already even in April. Now, the question becomes how does that correlate into the upcoming summer regardless of what happens this upcoming season. Here is the list of names that will likely be used and fingers crossed, we don't have any of these names to get retired at the end of the season. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So he allowed other security forces and the biggest being this rapid support forces, this paramilitary to grow quite large, partly so that no one could really challenge him for rule. And basically, what we've seen since he was overthrown without this military rule by committee could never really get on the same page, there have been dangerous tensions both want to be the top dog.
