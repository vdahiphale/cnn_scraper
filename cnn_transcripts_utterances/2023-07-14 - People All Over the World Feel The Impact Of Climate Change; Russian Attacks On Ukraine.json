Today, in many parts of the world, people are actually feeling the impact of climate change in terrifying ways. You've got a brush fire scorching a village in Croatia. Meantime in Athens, Greek officials have closed down the ancient Acropolis, which, by the way, sits on a hill, so therefore it doesn't offer much in the way of shade. Italy has issued extreme heat warnings in 15 cities. And the record for Europe's hottest temperature could fall in Sicily or Sardinia in the U.S. There is talk all the time that the planetary heat record could be breached in the scalding California desert known as Death Valley.

Actors union claims the studios want to pay an actor for one day of work and then be entitled to use an AI image of that actor pretty much forever. The studios claim that their proposals protect actors' digital rights. The strike doesn't just shut down production, it prevents actors from promoting already completed projects. The entire cast of the movie, \"Oppenheimer\" actually walked out of its London premiere on Thursday, moments before the screening -- screening, excuse me, began. CNN U.S. National Correspondent Natasha Chen is outside of Netflix's headquarters in Los Angeles. Natasha, you've been speaking to those who are on strike. What are they saying? NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's the first day here that the actors are fully in full force outside of the studios on the picket lines where writers have been for more than 70 days now. So, there's quite a bit of energy behind us. We actually heard a lot of conversations of people who had seen each other in the last couple of months when actors have supported writers on this line and now they are formally meeting each other. The two groups merge and of course, this is historic. It hasn't happened in Hollywood having a double strike. since the 1960s. And so, there is a lot of energy here. As you heard from Fran Drescher, the President of SAG- AFTRA, there were some disappointing results from the negotiations in the last few days. And she talked a lot about just the incremental changes that she feels the studios are offering. In fact, during a press conference yesterday, referred to that as if you're moving furniture on the Titanic. Here's what she said to us in a one-on-one interview about that. (BEGIN VIDEOAPE)",

When I asked the actors' guild what happens next, they told me that the studios do not wish to talk while there is a strike going on, but the actors say that they welcome the conversation to restart at any time.

Of course, A-list actors, the very wealthy actors are also going to be fine. It's the actors who are just starting out, who are perhaps not as fortunate, who are really going to be squeezed during this period of time.

First of all, if you go to the picket lines, you will find the mostenergized people there are the lower-level writers and actors, the people whose careers are just starting out, because they are the ones who have not been able to make a living under the current regime. The middle class of actors, when you turn on your TV, all those people whose names you don't know, who are the guest stars, the cameos, the background actors, all the writers who wrote those scenes, they are not able to pay their rent and their mortgages. And they know that if we do not go on strike, if we do not get a strong deal, they will never be able to have a career. And so, they are willing to take on the temporary strain of a strike that may go for a number of months in order to secure a future career. So, and you said, you know, the problem for actors is this. I think it's very important that we not say what we think the problem is for actors or writers, but we listen to the members of these unions who are telling us what is important to them. And what the lower-level actors and writers are telling us is that this is a vital fight and if we do not take it now, they will have no careers. And by the way, the studios are not going to be able to make money because every single product that they make begins with writing and it ends with an actor being filmed in front of a camera. And unless we are doing that work, they have no way to make money. They can sell library content, sure. People can watch old episodes of \"Friends\", but people unsubscribe from Netflix and Max and all these other services at a blistering rate now. People subscribe for a month at a time and then cancel their subscription once they're done watching the new \"Stranger Things\". So, they need a constant supply of new shows in order to get their subscriber numbers up and guess what, they're not going to get any until they come back to the table and make a fair deal and until they do, we're gonna be on those picket lines.",

All of that seems fair on paper. I think what the studio is saying is, look, this business environment is not what it used to be. This is not the same game that it was 10, 20 years ago.

What's actually happening is the people at the top of these companies have figured out how to take money out of the pockets of everyone who actually does the work, the writers, the actors, the directors, the crew members. They're taking money out of our pockets and they're putting it into theirs so they can fuel their private jets off to their billionaire compounds where they can you know hang out and make out edge at each other with their rich guy parties. Okay, that's fine if they want to do that but we are not going to sit stand idly by. We are gonna hit the picket lines and tell them we've had enough. We deserve our fair share.

So, our unions have strike funds that we use in order to help members pay their expenses when they're on hard times. But we're also raising money for funds that help all entertainment workers. There's a fund called the Entertainment Community Fund. We have raised over $2 million for them. They've given grants to any film and television worker who has fallen on hard times. And by the way, a lot of the other people that you mentioned are fellow union members who work for IATSE or the Teamsters and guess what, they are with us. They have been respecting our picket lines on a massive scale and refusing to work out of solidarity with us because they are gonna have their own fight in the coming years, and they know that we are gonna have their back.

Worse yet, that discovery comes amid a larger escalation in violence over the last few months. It is not the first time we have reached a point like this, of course, in Sudan. The echoes of genocide in Darfur announced 20 years ago continue today and leave the world with a fear that hasn't left since over the fate of Sudan itself. The ICC says the through line is clear, that it is obvious it accuses Sudan of failing to account for the crimes of decades past and failing to uphold its obligations under international law back then, as well as right now. Sudan's Ambassador to the United Nations in response says fully cooperating with the ICC would require ratifying the Rome Statute, the treaty that created the court, something Sudan's government has not yet done. Time now for The Exchange. Joining me live now is Karim Khan, Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court. Mr. Khan, thank you so much for being with us. Let's talk about what is happening on the ground right now in Sudan. You've talked about this idea that there is a human catastrophe in the making. This conflict has killed more than 3000 people. Three million people, at least, at least, have been forced to flee their home. Just walk us through what accountability looks like here.",

What we need to show right now, Zain, is not promises, not words, but delivery. People have their homes burnt. There's many reports of people who have been killed, crimes of sexual violence, and we need to show that the various parts of the international architecture, whether the United Nations or the International Criminal Courts, whether it's the African Union or any other organization, we are capable of providing shelter to the very most vulnerable parts of society, and we need to do better and we need to act.",

Over the last three months, I've also sent messages to theleadership of the two parties, the RSF and the SAF to cooperate and to remember that it is an active investigation. Of course, there's been almost 20 years of investigation and these suspects have not been delivered. We have one trial that's underway. We've closed the prosecution case in relation to Abdurrahman Ali Kusheib at the ICC, very good trial management by the judges, and the defense case is scheduled to start in October. So, we've been effective in relation to one case. But there's a whole host of other criminality, including the warrants that you've mentioned, that have to be executed. So, I can't give promises. All I can promise is we're going to try to use our scanty resources as effectively as possible to vindicate the rights of as many Darfuris as possible, and try to compensate for the lack of cooperation that we've seen by the government of Sudan that I reported last year. It's not simply because there's a conflict. In fact, the conflict is because in part of the lack of cooperation, the lack of willingness to deal with historical injustice, the failure to uphold the agreements of the Juba peace agreements or the memorandum of understanding that I signed in August 2021. But all we'll need to do is build partnerships with neighboring states, with other member states of the United Nations and with the African Union to do better. And I think, there's always, where there's a will, there's a way. The question is, is there really a collective will? I noted, day before yesterday, the United Kingdom has sanctioned six companies, three allegedly affiliated with the Sudanese armed forces, three allegedly linked to the RSF, but it needs collaboration across all sectors, the European Union, the African Union, and all states because this is really a battle for the promise of the Charter in the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that we are serious about the worth of every human being. And there's work to do there.",

As we talk about accountability, as we talk about an investigation, talk to us a bit more about the process of gathering evidence, especially because, you know, you're not going to receive that much cooperation -- cooperation that you would like from Sudanese authority.

That's after Microsoft announced China's -- China-based hackers breached email accounts at two dozen organizations, including some U.S. government agencies. CNN's Kylie Atwood explains what China may have gained from that attack. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The Biden administration believes that China's hack of U.S. government agencies provided the Chinese government with insights into the Biden administration's thinking ahead of the planned visit to China by the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. That's according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter. And we should note that Microsoft said that they learned about this hack on June 16th from their customers, and that's when they began investigating it. That is the same day that the Secretary of State left Washington and headed to Beijing for those meetings. Now, we should also note that this hack only was able to gain access to the unclassified side of U.S. systems. And so therefore, when you talk to U.S. officials, the amount that the Chinese officials were able to glean was quite limited. But it did provide them with some insights leading into the Secretary of State's visit, which could have contributed to how Chinese officials thought about that visit, which is significant. We should also note that Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, who is also compromised in this hack. She is planning to visit Beijing in the coming months. Kylie Atwood, CNN, Washington.",

As the name suggests, this is India's third lunar mission, and it's part of the country's greater bid to be a space power. During the last mission in 2019, the rover crashed after a hard landing. With this mission, they're aiming to land the rover near the moon's unexplored south pole. Officials say the landers due to reach the moon on August the 23rd. After the landing, scientists plan to deploy the rover and to conduct scientific experiments, including analyzing the chemistry of the lunar soil, measuring the temperature of the lunar surface and scanning for moonquakes. On launch day, India's Prime Minister tweeted this, quote, 14th of July, 2023 will always be etched in golden letters as far as India's space sector is concerned. Chandrayaan-3, our third lunar mission, will embark on its journey. This remarkable mission will carry the hopes and dreams of our nation. LU STOUT (on-camera):  Now, success would be huge for India.
