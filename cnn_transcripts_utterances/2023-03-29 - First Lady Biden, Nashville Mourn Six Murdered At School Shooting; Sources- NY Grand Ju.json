      "sentences": "Moments ago, a vigil for the three adults and three nine-year-olds who were murdered at the Covenant School two days ago ended in Nashville, a city still in mourning.Tonight, it was a moment for people to gather, to console, and to remember. First Lady Jill Biden was in Nashville tonight. Earlier, she placed flowers at the Memorial for the six who were killed, three children, all nine years old -- Hallie Scruggs, the daughter of Covenant Presbyterian Churches Senior Pastor, Evelyn Dieckhaus, and William Kinney; and the adults, the head of the school, Katherine Koonce, age 60; Mike Hill who was 61, the school custodian, and Cynthia Peake, who was also 61, a substitute teacher. A City Councilman now says he believes that Koonce may have died trying to protect the children. He says a witness told him Koonce was on a Zoom call, heard the shots and then abruptly ended the call and left the office. Nashville's Police Chief can't confirm how she died, but did say: \"I do know she was in the hallway by herself. There was a confrontation, I'm sure.\" So many are mourning tonight including Steven Curtis Chapman, a Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter. He and his family knew Katherine Koonce very well, not just as an educator, but as a friend and a lifesaver. After a tragic accident when Steven's daughter Maria was accidentally struck by a vehicle driven by one of his sons, Steven says that Koonce stepped into their lives in a powerful way, walking with them in their anguish and their suffering. I'm grateful Steven Curtis Chapman could join us tonight. Steven, I know you and your family are grieving and I appreciate you taking the time to talk with us about Katherine. She sounded like such an incredible person. The Police Chief has said, but he can't confirm it, but he says it is very possible that she was running toward the shooter. That probably doesn't surprise you given that when your family was grieving she ran toward your grief, toward your trouble. STEVEN CURTIS CHAPMAN, SINGER-SONGWRITER AND FRIEND TO KATHERINE KOONCE: Yes. Absolutely. Katherine -- Miss Koonce says my boys called her, she was an amazing person and she would run, that would be like her move towards step into trouble, pain, hard things. That's why her life marked our family so significantly. We knew her before we walked through the great tragedy of losing our youngest daughter, my sons were -- we had made a decision to have them go on the road with me, tour with me for a season, and she being an educator, the Academic Dean of the school that all my kids attended CPA, Christ Presbyterian Academy here in Nashville, she would have naturally said no, you need to, you know, do -- it's a college prep school -- go to college, get an education, but she -- the way she was, she said, I see a different story in you guys and I see it in your eyes and your heart. And she even found a way with us to help them go on tour with me, be in my band, and do kind of homeschool tutoring with her. So when they weren't on the road, they were either in her office or at her house. She had an unusual, amazing way with boys, you know, when it was time to, you know, close the books because -- you know, let them do their shenanigans or whatever and laugh with them. And then be stern and all of that. So they already had an amazing relationship, and we did our whole family with her, but then when we lost our youngest daughter, Maria, in a very tragic way as the story would be our son, Will, in particular was carrying a very, very heavy weight. And through the time that she was working with them, and would continue to be so much more, my son, Caleb said, mentor, friend, confidante. I mean she was all of those things, and teacher have so much more than what they learned in books. It's not an overstatement. We would have said this a week ago. We would have said it a month ago. We did say it all the time even before this terrible incident and this devastating thing that's happened. [20:05:08]",

In fact, when we first heard what was happening, and we were huddled up, praying, crying, begging God that this wasn't even true, we knew Katherine was there. We knew that she was the head of the school and my wife even said, as much as I don't want to believe Katherine is one of those that we're hearing about, I know her well enough to know, she probably was doing everything she could to change this story, to stop this thing from happening, to talk to this person, whatever she could do, because that's just her.",

She saw kind of -- and even just what most people saw, though she is a really bright student, but she just had this ability and the God gave her, I believe, to see into the heart, and the soul and the story of a student, the person that she was with, and help them steward that.

COOPER: We now have seen police response on this. And, you know, there's this video of the police moving through these empty classrooms. And it really struck me watching it, not only the police did a very professional job, but just how routine this is now for an entire generation or generations of kids. They know how to go into lockdown mode. They know they've had active shooter drills, they've had lockdown drills throughout their entire time. I mean, I never had that when I was a kid in school.

Narcan works on opioids laced with fentanyl, but the fight to stop fentanyl from actually reaching the U.S. has proven to be a tough challenge for both the U.S. and Mexican governments.Tonight's News (ph), David Culver traces the origins of the deadly drug and why it spread so quickly.

We looked into one of them, Hebei Atun Trading Company, accused of being involved in fentanyl precursor chemical sales. Public records show the company was dissolved in 2021, but our investigation found the same email address once listed for Hebei Atun now linked to this Chinese company, Shanxi Naipu, registered just days after Hebei Atun began to shut down. And look at Hebei Atun's Facebook page, still active. It links to Shanxi Naipu. Not to mention the Whatsapp contacts advertised for both companies, the same. So I texted a number listed on one of Shanxi Naipu's four websites. Without even mentioning the word fentanyl, the seller Linda Wang asked if we wanted this substance, which can be used to make fentanyl. Wang then sent me this full menu of chemical products. A closer look reveals these are mostly precursors, legal to buy, but ones that chemist tell us can be used to manufacturer illicit drugs, from fentanyl to cocaine.

Soldiers keep watch 24x7, preserving the scenes for prosecutors and preventing cartel members from restarting production here.
