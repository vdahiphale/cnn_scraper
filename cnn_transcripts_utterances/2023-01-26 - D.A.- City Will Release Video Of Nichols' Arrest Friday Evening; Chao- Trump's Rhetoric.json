And then, there was this chase. And then, there was a second encounter. And that's where the District Attorney says was the beating essentially, where this occurred. And then what we also learned and, I thought this was significant as well John, is that it took some time, to get him the medical assistance. We don't know exactly what that means, or how much time. But, I think, it explains why those two EMTs perhaps, were relieved - were taken off duty.

RON JOHNSON, FORMER CAPTAIN, MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY PATROL, OWNER &amp; FOUNDER, LODESTONE SOLUTIONS GROUP: Well I'd say, without seeing the video, it's hard to say, if they're the correct charges. But I would say from everything that I've heard, they seem, based on their expertise, it seem to be appropriate. I think we're going to see something that cuts at the core of who we are, as Americans. I think it's something we can't tolerate. I think it's something that we have to make sure it changes, and it can't continue to happen in our country. And we have to really do something, to change the culture, and stop this from happening.

And that's what they're charged with.And they were all there. And, as a result of that, assuming the video is consistent with that, I mean, it would be - it would be a consistent practice, to charge all five involved. Now, you'll have a trial, and it's conceivable that one person was more involved in than the other. But that doesn't mean that person isn't responsible. That would be an issue that would be taken up at sentencing, if and when we were to get that far. I know Steve Mulroy. I worked at the Justice Department with him. He may be new to the D.A.'s job. But he's a seasoned prosecutor. And he's a respected leader. And so, it's impressive that they got through this, in less than three weeks. And I have a lot of faith in what they have done together with the TBI, who is also working very, very hard. And I'll tell you, it's really important to make sure that you're thorough in these investigations. Here, in Maryland, where I live, the Freddie Gray investigation, the local prosecutors were very, very hasty. And, as a result, the criminal case, fizzled.

Now, the gentleman who was killed, a man in his 50s, was hit by falling debris, close to a power-generating plant, on the outskirts of the city, a tragic accident, effectively. There were 10 other people, around the country, also killed, in similar strikes.The authorities say that more than 50 cruise missiles were fired, at Ukraine, the vast majority, some 47 were shot down. And that's on top of a number of Shahed drones. These are the much more unsophisticated drones, manufactured in Iran, John, that are used to soak up the air defenses that the Ukrainians say, they so desperately need, to protect themselves, against just these sorts of attacks. This is now at least three or four months into a concerted campaign, by Russia, using the drones, and cruise missiles, to try to break the back, of Ukraine's capacity, to generate power. And, of course, that is all being conducted during the winter, when power is in most desperate need. Now it's ineffectively (ph) trying to undermine the capacity of the civilian administration, to reinforce their military options, as the bloodletting continues, particularly in the East, particularly around the City of Bakhmut, where the Russians are throwing huge amounts of men, and material, into that fight. The Ukrainians can't really understand why because that town is John, particularly - not particularly strategically important. But they believe that the Russians are desperately looking for some kind of victory, after about four months, or at least, indeed, now six months, of significant losses, in which they've lost ground they had captured early on, in this campaign, 11 months ago, in Kharkiv, and more laterally, in Kherson, John.",

She told \"POLITICO,\" in a statement, quote, \"When I was young, some people deliberately misspelled or mispronounced my name. Asian Americans have worked hard to change that experience for the next generation. He doesn't seem to understand that, which says a whole lot more about him than it will ever say about Asian Americans.\"This response comes after high-profile shootings, targeting the Asian American community, and after the former President, repeatedly used a demeaning term, in his social media posts, to describe Chao. I won't say it but you can see it there, highlighted on the screen. He has also singled out her Asian American heritage, as Miss - McConnell's quote, \"China loving wife.\" As the Editorial Board of the Wall Street Journal, noted, last year, quote, \"Her real offense was resigning as transportation secretary after Mr. Trump's disgraceful behavior on January 6.\" I'm joined now by CNN Political Commentator, Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as Director of Communications, for the former President, and has spoken out, against his remarks. Also, Senior White House Correspondent, MJ Lee; and Senior Political Commentator, Scott Jennings, a longtime adviser, to Senator Mitch McConnell, who is of course husband to Elaine Chao. MJ, I do want to start with you. You covered Donald Trump, for a long time. Trump's spokesperson, Steven Cheung, who is Asian American, told \"Politico,\" quote, \"People should stop feigning outrage and engaging in controversies that exist only in their heads.\" So, what do you make of that as both a reporter and as an Asian American?",

I think there's just the reality. And that is that, yes, Asian Americans, and Asian people, across this country confront all kinds of racism, all the time. And I think what is particularly disturbing to think about this week, is thinking about, when you see an ex-President, mocking and making overtly racist comments, about his former cabinet member? What message that might send to the average person, about what might be OK, to say, to the average Asian American, and Asian person, in this country? And I'm talking about your neighbor, your colleague, just somebody who looks like me, walking down the street. And Trump has been stoking these racial divisions, ever since he was a candidate, and going way far back, past that. He did it, when he was President. And I think we have no reason to think that he wouldn't keep doing that, if he were to get another four years, in the White House.",

He's done it countless times, since he was first a declared candidate. I think the two things stand out to me is the timing and the target.Obviously, as MJ mentioned, this tragic mass shooting, targeting the Asian American community, and just the fact that violence and harassment, against them have been on the rise, dating back to COVID, and conspiracy theories around that. But also the target, this is a woman, Elaine Chao, who served in the Reagan administration, the Bush administration. She has been a naturalized citizen, since she was 19-years-old. She's been in public service. She is an American, who served in his administration. Her only offense, of course, was that she opposed the Insurrection. But the question, again, for Republicans is, do we want four more years of this? Do we want four more years of explaining to our kids, why the President, or the former President, is saying racist, offensive things that we would yell at them, for saying, on the playground? Like it's just the turning a blind eye, and the Rick Scott, \"He likes to call names,\" I'm just calling him out there, like, no, this is blatantly racist. It's the worst timing.

But there's also a moral question here, is do we want four more minutes of a public figure, saying racist things? And how do you stop that from happening?And what would you advise Republican officials to say about this? And I ask, because Mitch McConnell has been reticent, at times, to even mention Trump's name. And he's doing that on purpose, I think, he doesn't want to necessarily elevate him. But, in a case, like this, do you think it makes sense to speak out? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, COLUMNIST, USA TODAY: Well, I think, it made sense, for Elaine Chao, to speak out, because she's classier than Donald Trump will ever think about being, and she's let this go for some time. But, at some point, it becomes not just an issue for her personally, but an issue for the entire Asian American community. I mean, Elaine Chao, her parents, her family, they are 1,000 times the American patriots Donald Trump will ever be. And for him to question their patriotism, and question their love of this country, and say, \"They have something to do with Communist China,\" it's outrageous. So, I'm glad that she stood up for the entirety of Asian American community. As for the rest of the Republican Party, I think if you hear Donald Trump say something blatantly racist, the way he's doing, against Elaine Chao, and you cannot summon the courage to deal with it, if asked? Then you needed to look inside of yourself, and say, \"What am I doing here? What kind of a party are we building here? And what do we want our country to be? And are we moral enough to lead this country?\" Candidly, I mean the Chaos are an American success story. Elaine Chao is the first Asian American woman to be in a cabinet, the longest- serving cabinet member, since World War II. This person is an inspiration to an entire group of people. Regardless of your politics, Asian Americans look up to Elaine Chao. And we have this egomaniac, this infant, this racist boob, who continues to make these statements, about her? It's outrageous. And we all ought to say it, every single day, even if a Senator McConnell, and Elaine Chao, choose not to wrestle with a pig in the mud. And that's where the Republican Party ought to stand.",
