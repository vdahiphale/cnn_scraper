      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, world leaders have arrived in Indiaahead of the G20 Summit this weekend to address the crisis facing the world today. But unanimous decisions might be hard to achieve, given the absentees. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Then Spain's national prosecutors files a sexual assault complaint against the now suspended president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales. What could come next, we will discuss. Plus, a strong storm brews in the Atlantic. We'll take a look at the potentially destructive path of Hurricane Lee. But first, tonight, it is almost midnight in New Delhi where U.S. President Joe Biden is joining other world leaders for the G20 Summit. The event officially kicks off on Saturday.  Mr. Biden has been meeting with his host, as you can see there, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But there are other major players ditching the event. Russian President Vladimir Putin is accused of war crimes in Ukraine. He is wanted on an ICC warrant, and rarely travels abroad these days. He sent his foreign minister instead. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also skipping the summit. Some see it as a snub to rival India or show solidarity with Mr. Putin. Still, the rise of China and its rivalry with the U.S. looks to be a major theme. President Biden is coming with proposals to reform the World Bank and other global bodies. The White House says they can provide an alternative to Chinese lending. Let's get more on all of this, and what to expect. CNN's Ivan Watson is in New Delhi with the very latest, and Nic Robertson is with me. And Ivan, let me start with you first, and this bilateral meeting that wrapped up in the last what? Two hours or so between President Biden and Mr. Modi. What do both men want to get out of this critically? What would be considered in their eyes a successful G20 here, Ivan?",

And Biden has come to this meeting, vowing to offer some kind of support for as Narendra Modi has called it, sustainable kind of equitable economic development around the world. Biden is pledging to increase financing at multilateral investment and lending institutions like the World Bank, like the International Monetary Fund. So, the bilateral meeting between these two leaders -- well, that was mostly addressing all sorts of cooperation between India and the U.S. on a whole host of issues, everything from space exploration to defense cooperation to developing microchips and trying to get a moon-shot cancer cure put together. And you know, we got a briefing from a White House aide who then said that the Indians are substantially -- they're seriously disappointed that the Chinese leader Xi Jinping pretty much at the last minute, decided not to attend this meeting. For the first time since he's become leader of China, and without any real formal explanation for why he is absent here, according to the Chinese government. That of course, is an issue when you're gathering leaders of 20 countries here, 19 countries in the European Union, and the world's second largest economy is not present, and they send their premier here to attend instead. And it's possible that Ukraine could be a contributing factor to that. We know that the European leaders who have been showing up one after another, have been saying that one of their key priorities here is to keep Ukraine at the forefront of the discussions that will be taking place here throughout the weekend.",

So, he's going to be a very big proponent likely here from President Biden, the same to explain why Ukraine is in this war, why Russia is the menace in this situation. So, I think you know, absent Putin, it may become a little easier, there's more maneuverability to have those conversations, but there's a lot of convincing to be done.

At least, four Ukrainians were killed today in new Russian airstrikes, and missiles slammed into police administrative building in Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's hometown, killing at least, one person and injuring dozens more. Three other people were killed in strikes on Kherson. Well, some of Russia's ongoing strikes aim to destroy expensive Ukrainian weaponry. But Ukraine has a strategy to outsmart the enemy by luring them into costly mistakes. Our Melissa Bell shows us how decoy weapons are shielding Ukraine's true military targets from Russia's fire.

But it does seem like they were aware that they were recruiting efforts going on, and that there are intermediaries, essentially recruiters both in Russia are working with a large Cuban community there. And recruiters here on the island, essentially trying to find people they felt would go to Russia -- or would go to Russia first, then they deploy to Ukraine with the Russian military. And as the Cuban investigators said in the information that was released, a lot of times, it looked -- these recruiters for Cubans with a criminal history tellingly enough. It's very interesting of course, that Cuba of all countries would roll up a Russian recruiting effort because these countries have been close allies since the cold war. But Cuba says their laws are very clear, they do not let their citizens go and fight in other countries and they do not want them to become mercenaries. And the people that they have arrested here, some of them are recruiters, some of them are alleged mercenaries that they are going to be facing decades in prison. And I have to say from experience, usually in Cuba, when you are charged, you are as good as guilty. So, this has some serious implications for the people who are involved in this, and certainly, for the people who would consider for a lot of money and the possibility of Russian citizenship, going to fight in Ukraine.

Now, she officially made a complaint to the prosecutor earlier this week, and you know, this is what the sexual assault part of the prosecutor's complaint would be. The coercion part however, happened several days afterwards. And this is when, you know, questions about Rubiales' behavior began circulating online. And according to the prosecutor's statement, Jenny Hermoso said she came under pressure from Rubiales and his associates to put out a statement in defense of him saying that nothing and toward -- happened. And as a result, the prosecutor says that pressure could be considered as harassment or coercion. So that's why you have those two terms in the prosecutor's complaint. Now, it's not likely that we're going to see trial any time soon, this is still an evolved legal process, the next step would be for the national court to start an investigation, still gather more evidence, and remember, this all took place in Australia, so it does mean that prosecutors actually have to consult Australia as well, Isa.",

Let's get the very latest from our Brynn Gingras who is in New York. Brynn, I mean, this, in many ways, contradicts what the police officers say occurred. What is the attorney saying here for the police officer? What has been the reaction? Because I know you have seen more than this little bit that we are showing. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. And actually, it was the family's request, the victim family's, Eddie Irizarry, their request that the entire body cam footage be released to the public. Now, yes, as you just mentioned, Irizarry, I have actually seen other footage that was released by their family attorney shortly after this shooting happened in Philadelphia on August 14th. And I want to make this a point because this is why it's kind of raised a lot of alarm in the community and Philadelphia itself. Because when this happened, police in Philadelphia initially said that Irizarry was shot while he was outside of his car and he wasn't obeying commands from police after being pulled over. But it's very clear when you see that body cam footage and other footage, again, that was brought forward by the family's attorney, that he was inside his car. And that was the major issue here is that police did not give an accurate description of what happened initially and had to somewhat give a mea culpa. And then now we have the videos from the incident in its entirety. And so that's where we are right now. That police officer Mark Dial, he fired those shots very soon after he got out of his police car, giving very little warning before firing those shots. And as you pointed out, actually saying I'm going to shoot you right before firing those shots. And as far as that officer, he was immediately put on leave by the police department with the expectation of being fired. He has been fired and today he turned himself in, but he's facing some very serious charges. He's facing murder charges. He's facing aggravated assault charges.

But a grand jury in that case recommended charges for 21 other people, including current U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham. This is according to a report released by a judge just hours ago. It says jurors also wanted indictments for former Republican senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, retired three-star general Michael Flynn also made the list along with Trump's advisers Boris Epshteyn there. Ultimately, Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, chose not to pursue those indictments. She also charged Trump campaign official Mike Roman, who was not mentioned in the report. And all 19 defendants have plead, important to point out, not guilty. Let's get more in all of this. CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is life for us in Washington. And Paula, I mean, it is stunning to see this report because it includes a sitting senator and two former senators. Ultimately, like we said here, Paula, I mean, they were not charged, but what does this tell us about the grand jury's thinking here? What are the major takeaways in your opinion from this report?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's extraordinary to see this kind of thing. Typically, the public does nothave access to a grand jury report like this. Grand jury proceedings, by their nature, are secret to protect witnesses, to give them the confidence to speak freely and also to protect people who are not ultimately charged. What's so fascinating here is we see these two groups of people in particular, both the senators, the current senator, Lindsey Graham, former senators, Kelly Loeffler, and David Perdue, and then three Trump advisers, Mike Flynn, Boris Epshteyn, and Cleta Mitchell. These are the two groups that are really drawing a lot of attention. Let's start first with the senators. What you can see from this report is that there was some dissension about whether these folks should be charged, particularly Senator Lindsey Graham. There were 13 votes in favor, seven against, and that is notable. I mean, if you look at that math as a prosecutor, you can see you have problems with your case. If in a grand jury, they -- that was the vote that you got on Lindsey Graham, I think that would give any prosecutor some real pause before actually filing criminal charges because a grand jury is the most favorable environment possible for a prosecutor. It's no lawyers with the witnesses. There's no defense presentation, and there's no standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. Now, looking at the Trump advisers, more questions there, it's not clear why Fani Willis did not charge them. If you look at the math, the votes, they appear very similar to those for people who were charged, like Rudy Giuliani and former President Trump so that's something we're really going to be watching. Why were these individuals not charged? Epshteyn was listed as an unindicted co-conspirator, but were you watching in any eventual trials? Are these incredibly valuable witnesses? Have they provided something that would make the district attorney reconsider charging them? CNN was one of the media organizations that fought to make this public, and it really does give us some extraordinary insight into a historic case.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and probably more questions than answers at this point, but you know, important to point out for an international view is they are notcharged, but a grand jury recommended, of course, they ought to be.

      "sentences": "You know, I'm sure there'll be a lot of spin out there. There's also legitimate questions about whether this should have been made public. LikeI said, the grand jury process is usually secret because they're testing a case. Oftentimes, they'll hear matters that are never ultimately charged, and if you are charged, there's a process to clear your name, or you could also be convicted. If there is a recommendation that you be charged and you're not charged, there's not really a process to clear your name. So, I think there are some fair questions about the impact of transparency like this on this process. And as we've seen, the former president and his allies are certainly suggesting that at this grand jury was willing to indict a then-sitting senator and then other now-form lawmakers, that there was some sort of political bias, but it appears, again, there was some dissension here. All of these people fit somewhere in the narrative, and this is how the process works. People are getting rare insight, but these recommendations were not binding on the prosecutor. She takes these. This is one part of her assessment of who to charge, in addition to, of course, how much evidence do I have? Am I going to be proved -- able to prove this at trial? So it's really fascinating to see what they recommended and what she ultimately wound up doing.",
