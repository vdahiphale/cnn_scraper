And no soup for you -- the big change coming to a 155-year-old canned classic. The panel is here and ready to go, so sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first, it's on.

Welcome back everyone.Jim, where does this race stand now post-debate? JIM GERAGHTY, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE NATIONAL REVIEW\": Well, anyway, you slice it, Harris went out and did exactly what she wanted to do. The national polls show a nice little pop, probably around four or five percentage point lead. What would worry me if I were on her campaign is that Michigan has had a couple of polls in the last couple of days. Trump by one, tie, her by one. The swing states still look pretty close, and you very rarely can find a poll that has one candidate or the other outside of the margin of error. The Walz pick seemed to be popular. Everybody raved about the Democratic convention. She did great -- all this stuff is going right for her, but you're not seeing it generate a significant lead in the swing states. And so I think they'll be sweating all the way to election night. WALLACE:  Nia, there are some debates that shift the momentum of a campaign, like the first Kennedy-Nixon debate in 1960, and some that don't, like all three Clinton-Trump debates back in 2016. Where do you think those race stands right now, post-debate? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, OPINION COLUMNIST, \"BLOOMBERG\":  Yes, listen, I think it's a dead heat. It's going to come down to these six states. She's got to figure out what the easiest path to victory is. She has more paths than Joe Biden did, but it's still incredibly tight. It's a --",

Trump spent less than 30 percent of his time attacking Harris. Harris is acting like an underdog. Trump is not acting like an underdog. And what Trump needs to do is zero-in, not on 200 messages, not on every last thing someone says and then counterpunching.
