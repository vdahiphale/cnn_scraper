      "sentences": "Can you believe it? Can you believe it? Yes, we are expecting a record amount of shoppers over the holiday weekend and record spending. However, sales growth year to year is expected to be normal. So on average we have seen about 4.3 percent in sales growth from year to year, especially over the pandemic people were really spending. This year, it's about 3.3 percent. That's considered normal, moderate. And that is because a lot of consumers are shopping discretionary. They're not going all out this year. They're choosing, what do I really want to spend my money on for the people that I love?On average, American families are going to be spending about $900 on gifts this holiday season. But you have retailers kind of trying to figure out where the consumer is right now. Target, for example, didn't do so well in the third quarter. So they are now really, really, really revving up their promotions and their sales to try to get shoppers in the door. But then you have a company like Footlocker, which got stuck with a ton of inventory last year. So they have scaled back on their inventory, so they may not have as many sales or promotions. But one thing to look at is the holiday season this year is a week shorter, and so that means that all retailers want to make sure that they get people in the door to get all their inventory off the shelves. That extra week that retailers normally have is a little bit of a cushion. This year they simply do not have it. Top gifts this year, toys, media, candy, food, and electronics. Of course, people love that.",

We've got a cold front coming through right now along the eastern seaboard. That's what brought rain to Ryan's live shot earlier this morning. That's since moved on. So we're clearing things out near Atlanta Hartsfield- Jackson International Airport. The same cannot be said, though, for JFK into the other airports across the east coast because this cold front is impacting you as we speak. So we do believe that this could have some knock on effects for future cancellations, or at least delays through the course of the morning and afternoon hours. That's why we've highlighted these potential airport problems from the nation's capital through the Big Apple all the way to Boston as well, where the storm system is currently located.Another, more impactful storm will really start to fire up over the western parts of the U.S. I'll show you that in just one moment. This is the current storm bringing some mixture of rain and snow across the northern sections of New England that will impact the roadways there, but closer to the largest population densities of the eastern seaboard, it is now bringing all rain. So this is all the liquid variety, the I-95 corridor will be wet. So if you're hitting the roads to grandma and grandpa's house, expect some potential delays there. Everybody has difficulty driving in that type of weather. There's the weather moving on from Atlanta, though, so we've cleared things out for Interstate 75, 85. That moves right behind that live shot that Ryan was at just a moment ago. This is a major storm, though. Over the western U.S. the good news is that the majority of the snow that's falling from the sky is actually west of the Denver International Airport, so I expect minimal delays there. Could be some impactful snow for Salt Lake City, but look at the rain falling along the west coast from San Francisco southward into Los Angeles. This storm system will deepen significantly. Wednesday will be your best day to travel on the roads or in the skies along the east coast. Look what happens as I advance this radar from Wednesday into Thursday. A major storm system will impact this region, bringing the coldest air of the season, snow to the northern New England, but all rain along the coastal areas, just in time for John Berman to stand outside and talk about a big Macy's Day, Thanksgiving Day parade in the rain.
