What do you think realistically will be done in Washington, if anything? SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO): Well, I completely agree that we need regulation. We have not regulated at all the social -- the massive social media platforms in this country. That has huge implications for antitrust, for example, but also for our kids' mental health. I used to be the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. We are having an epidemic of adolescent mental health issues in America today. I am not saying that's all social media's responsibility, but a huge piece of that is. And they have gone completely unregulated here. We need to have an agency in this country, like the FDA, like the FCC, to negotiate on behalf of the American people, and that's why I introduced the first bill in Congress to create a new agency that could do that.",

That is something that the American people never consented to. Our kids never consented to it. And moreover, I think the American people have never consented to the economic relationship they have with, you know, the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and other people. So -- and the kids, my old school district, they think their parentswho are working don't have the time to negotiate with the big media companies and social media companies, and they can't rely on their student council to do it.
