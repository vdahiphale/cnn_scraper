The ruling allows doctors to continue prescribing mifepristone in States that allow it, but there's almost no chance the protective ruling will be the final word on regulation of the drug. In the next challenge, the Texas case that challenged mifepristone's 23-year-old FDA approval heads back to the Fifth Circuit Court for an appeal on May 17th. Right now, we don't know why the Court which last year overturned the historic Roe vs. Wade decision moved to protect this drug. Justices offered no explanation with Friday night's ruling. I spoke last hour with Minnesota Democratic Senator Tina Smith about the ruling and what comes next. Here's what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TINA SMITH (D-MN): The Supreme Court did the right thing. They did the only reasonable thing. It is really incredible that these Lower Courts were prepared to buck precedent and follow their ideology in my view to overturn the authority of the FDA to be deciding what medicines are safe and effective. I mean, Judges are not doctors and they should not play doctors. For now, this right is still protected only in States where abortion is still legal, but this fight will continue in the Courts, and I believe it will continue in the ballot box as well as people who voice their values on election days.

He saidSo here in that statement, Jim, an acknowledgment that this is not the end of the road, that White House officials do say that they are prepared for quite a lengthy legal fight as this continues to make its way through the appeals process. Now, in the lead up to this decision yesterday, behind the scenes, there was quite intensive preparation at the White House Counsel's Office, at the Department of Justice, and among the President's senior advisers about contingencies, should these restrictions remain in place on this drug. Now, those preparations will continue. Those options are still on the table about what the White House has been quite frank on, quite candid about is that they are limited in their ability to do much to expand abortion protections that were included in Roe vs. Wade, that were of course, stripped away by the Supreme Court last year. And the President did acknowledge that in his statement that if people want to see those protections restored, they will have to use their vote as their voice, elect lawmakers who support abortion rights. Of course, this will be a central issue as the President gears up to run for re-election potentially announcing as early as next week -- Jim.",

Be afraid of 16-year-old honor students in Kansas City, 20-year-old women in New York, always be prepared to shoot all-star cheerleaders in Texas.\" What did you mean by all that? RYAN BUSSE, AUTHOR, \"GUNFIGHT\": Well, my story, Jim -- and thanks for having me on -- I lived within the machine that built this hate and conspiracy we now live with, in far too much of our country. I saw with my own eyes how the NRA radicalized this whole debate, it radicalized the issue, it handed it off to the right side of our political aisle. Eventually, Donald Trump put that whole thing on steroids. And let's face it, fear and conspiracy were very effective political tools for the right side of the aisle, certainly for the last five or six years. Sadly, they're exactly the same things that drive gun sales. And while the vast majority of people in this country, the vast majority of gun owners are responsible gun owners, I count myself among those, it only takes a small percentage of people who are really affected by the sort of fear and conspiracy that the NRA perfected, and when they are gun owners, bad things can happen incredibly quickly, like we saw in Kansas City and Albany, and with the Texas cheerleaders, it's just horrific.",

So there is now permitless carry in 26 states. You can't do all that, and think you're not going to have these issues. So my point here is we can have freedoms, we can be gun owners, but wecan't do it without reasonable, responsible norms and regulations. It's just that -- it's just, again, not a perfect analogy, but you can't drive through a town or through a city without speed limits and stop lines and licensing and liability insurance for your cars.

However what reasonable citizens in a democracy like ours have always done, work to make things marginally better, instead of working to make them marginally worse. You don't rollback permitting, when you have more guns and more gun owners, you increase it, okay. We still have on the books, you have to be 21 to purchase a handgun federally, but you can be 18 to buy a rifle. That's a throwback to the days before AR-15s were ubiquitous everywhere. So we can change that. We can do things that make it better if you don't think we can, think about cigarettes, right? In the early 90s, cigarettes were everywhere. We had much higher lung cancer rates. You couldn't walk into a bar without washing your clothes four times after you're done, you could smoke on planes still, right? We changed that culture. We didn't ban cigarettes, you can still go buy cartons of them, but we changed the culture. We made things marginally better. We lowered lung cancer rates.

So when you have two conflicting rulings like that, oftentimes they do end up back to the Supreme Court on its merits. So, I think we're in for a very long legal battle ahead.

He and his aides are really focused on looking presidential on theday-to-day job of governing. You know, he is meeting with foreign leaders, traveling abroad, dealing with domestic policy and obviously, selling his legislative accomplishments. So that's what they're going to focus on in the coming months until the campaign season really ramps up in earnest next year. But he's got a lot to concern about. We, at the AP just did a poll where it said three out of four voters believe that the country is on the wrong track. You also have only half of Democrats who actually are excited about him running again, who want him to run again, so his challenges are to keep everyone that he persuaded in the 2020 election, whether it's the Democratic Party and these independent swing voters in in his camp and also hope that the economy's doesn't get worse than it already is right now.",

Keep in mind that India may have actually crossed that threshold in terms of numbers ahead of China, perhaps even a couple of years ago, because its last census was in 2011 and then you had the COVID 19 pandemic.

Keep in mind that China's having to deal with the fact that there are higher living costs, there are shifting attitudes amongst its younger generation towards family and marriage.COVID-19, again, had a huge economic slowdown, so the cost of having a family are significant. The One China policy had a massive impact on the imprint of China's population, which would have resulted in stiff economic penalties if you had more than one child. Now to try and reverse that is proving to be very hard. One thing that's very interesting, if you look at what President Xi's government is trying to do is that they're in a race to attain Paramount influence before its population gets too old. So China's military spending, its economic expansion via the Belt Road Initiative is certainly something that they're pushing. It's a calculated risk, but it also potentially brings them further at odds with the United States and also with India as well.",

An anonymous TikTok user named ghostwriter977 claims to have used an - used AI to generate the music. It appears the artists themselves have nothing to do with this, listen to this.The original TikTok video of the track has seemingly been taken down. It has also been removed from streaming services, including Spotify, but the conversation and controversy over this technology continues. CNN's Jon Sarlin joins us now. He's the host of CNN's NIGHTCAP. This is bizarre, what's going on here? JON SARLIN, CNN HOST, \"NIGHTCAP\": Jim, this is the first AI hit song, right? When you look at all the different AI products and new ones are coming out every week, this is some of the best technology we've seen. I mean, the output of this technology is basically indistinguishable from the original singers. And I think it's worth to take a step back and think about what this means. Anyone with a modicum of technical technological ability can create the song in their house and have the voice of a famous singer on it that is virtually indistinguishable from the original, right? That is something that can happen right now. You can have infinite copies. If you want Drake to be the lead singer of your band, you can do that. But when you start to think about that, your mind begins to reel about all the different scenarios that that - the questions that beg. Culturally, will we still value a Drake song when anyone can create a Drake song on their own? Maybe this will be kind of a novelty factor, right? Think of it like fan fiction. Then you start to think about the legal implications of this, because this is a gray area. The law has not caught up caught up with the technology, which is moving at a rapid pace. The recording industry has been prepping for this fight. Last month, they launched what's called the human artistry campaign, which is a recording industry coalition to advocate for the recording industry for exactly these kinds of cases for what they call human created art. UMG is the record label of both Drake and The Weeknd and they have been very aggressive in this case. They issued takedown notices to platforms hosting the site like Spotify and YouTube and then they released a scathing statement in which they called for people to - they call for Congress - sorry, they call for copyright law to be factored in here. So when you take a step back and you look at all this, this is a brave new world that recording industry or - the recording industry, lobbyists groups are all circling.",
