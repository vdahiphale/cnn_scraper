But A-groups is saying that is not enough. The United Nations has issued a warning that four out of five, 80 percent of households in Gaza right now don't have safe drinking water. According to the Ministry of Health there in Gaza, at least two more people died today from severe hydration and malnutrition.In response to the crisis, the White House has announced that the U.S. would join other countries to send aid from Cyprus to Gaza by ship, by barge. And as part of that, the U.S. says it will build a floating pier and a causeway on the coast of Gaza on the Mediterranean Sea to help deliver that humanitarian aid. Pentagon says the port could help deliver more than 2 million meals every day, but they warned that it could take weeks, even up to two months, to build that pier. CNN's Clarissa Ward is on the ground in Jerusalem for us tonight. Clarissa, there are consistent warnings about Gaza being on the brink of widespread famine. President Joe Biden has told Israel there are no excuses not to open more border crossings to get more aid in, and yet, they haven't. And you've seen a big reason why, many Israelis are against that.

They have been actively trying to block it from going in.The difference now is that the Israeli authorities and border police are taking a much stronger hand.

According to Gaza's health authorities, at least 17 children have died of dehydration and malnutrition already.

We know that one of the key issues during the talks that have been going on is that the Israelis have been pushing to get a list from Hamas, which hostages are alive, which hostages are dead. Hamas has not been willing to hand that over. And there's been a lot of speculation from analysts that Hamas at this stage is not really interested in agreeing to a ceasefire, that it would like to use the holy Muslim month of Ramadan as a period to try to ignite more fervor, more anger across the region. And, of course, a lot of world leaders fearful that that will happen. Up until this point, it hasn't spilled out of control to a mass regional conflagration.

In this case, we don't know who did it. But CISA, the cyber agency, was forced to take two key systems offline, Alex. One was a computer system that houses information on the security of chemical plants, and the other is a program that federal government employees share cyber tools with the state and local governments. So not a trivial issue. There's -- CISA is saying no operational impact, but they're also trying to use this a teachable moment saying, hey, we got, we got hit, everyone, everyone can. So make sure you have a plan in place. Which is also something that applies to health care hack. There haven't been enough plans in place, according to everyone I talked to -- Alex?",

For more than 60 years, presidential nominees have received classified intelligence briefings. There also available for former presidents like Donald Trump.But until Trump, none had been facing trial for allegedly mishandling classified materials. Back in 2021, well, before federal agents recovered classified materials at Trump's Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, President Joe Biden said that Trump should not get those briefings. This week, the White House implied that Biden stance has not changed. We're joined now by former principal deputy director of National Intelligence, Andrew Hallman. He has also now the vice president of national security strategy at Peraton. Andrew, thanks so much for joining us. So how do you think the intelligence community is going to handle this now that we believe Trump is, indeed, going to be the Republican nominee?",

And this is my -- my understanding is there's no real legal or policy restriction on even a former president who's facing -- who's indicted for these charges to receive these briefings. And the really important point here, Alex, is that the intelligence community, being very professional, dedicated service where apolitical professional behaviors is currency the realm, they're going to want to do this straight down the middle and apolitically. And partly out of concern if they want to be treated fairly. When/if former President Trump is elected, they're treated fairly and they're not criticized as he did when he was in office before.",

But the risk is relatively low during the candidate briefings. They keep them fairly high level as they have in previous briefings. So I don't think they'll pull their punches. I think they'll give honest assessments of the world's situation. But there will be some concerns about the potential that you make compromise information provided in those briefings.
