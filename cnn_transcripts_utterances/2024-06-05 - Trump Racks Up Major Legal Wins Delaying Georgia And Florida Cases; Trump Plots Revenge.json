      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextBreaking news, on hold indefinitely. An appeals court putting the brakes on Trump's Georgia election interference case, making it highly unlikely Trump goes to trial before the election, as the judge in Trump's classified documents case hands Trump another win. Plus, Republican revenge. Trump promising to punish his opponents if reelected as his allies on Capitol Hill follow suit and now are doing Trump's dirty work. And tonight, an OUTFRONT exclusive, the neighbor at the center of the dispute with Justice Alito's wife is my guest. What she says happened just before the Alitos flew an American flag upside-down. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, breaking news, a major legal decision in Trump's Georgia election interference case. And that case is now postponed indefinitely. The Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis had been promising that, quote, the train is coming. She had wanted a televised trial to start on August 4th, but that is not happening. A Georgia appeals court putting a stop to the trial while a panel of judges decides whether Willis should be disqualified. Trump's legal team wants her out because of her romantic relationship with the top prosecutor on the case. Now, the appeals court is not even scheduled to hear arguments on that part of it until October, just weeks before Election Day, which makes it almost certain that there will not be a trial before in-person voters head to the polls in November. And we have more breaking news this hour. Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida handing Trump a victory in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. This time, she is agreeing to hold a sprawling hearing on a whole host of topics. Trump's requests to get rid of Jack Smith altogether, his appointment, his Trump's requests to have evidence found at Mar-a-Lago thrown out, all of that now, she's going to have a hearing about. In a moment, I'm going to speak to Trump's former White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. But, first, we want to begin with Sara Murray OUTFRONT live in Washington. And, Sara, what does this decision by the appeals court mean for Trump's case in Georgia?",

      "sentences": "Well, Erin, it essentially means that barring some sort of a miracle for the district attorney's office, there's just no way that Donald Trump is going to be going to trial anytime before this November election in this Georgia election, interference case. Now what normally happens when an appeals court takes up an issue is that automatically what has been going on at the trial court level is stayed. But this was an unusual situation where the trial court judge, Judge McAfee, said he was going to continue on, even if the appellate court decided to take up this issue.So, today, the appeals court made it very clear that this prosecution against Donald Trump could not continue at the trial court level as long as they're weighing these issues. And again, this means we're looking at potentially months of re-litigating Willis's romantic relationship with a fellow prosecutor, whether she should have been removed for the case -- from the case as a result of that, as a result of other public comments she made about the case as well. The trial court judge criticized her conduct very heavily, but allowed her to remain on the case as long as her fellow prosecutor stepped down. What's also interesting about the way this process works is once the floodgates are open, now that this for has agreed to hear this appeal, it allows the district attorneys office to bring aspects into this, too. So they are going to the appeals court and saying, look, the trial court judge throughout a couple of counts against Donald Trump and his co-defendants, we want those brought in. We want those charges brought in. So this is again, something that's going to involve a lot of lawyerly arguments. It could stretch on for months you pointed out this is tentatively set for oral arguments in October, but again, that's a tentative date. We don't have even have a hard date on the calendar of if this appeals court is going to hear oral arguments, and when that could happen.",

She wants to avoid at all costs making a decision that Jack Smith can appeal to the 11th Circuit, where the 11th Circuit, who has already reversed her twice, and reprimanded her harshly, will have -- would have the opportunity to reconsider potential for removing her from the case, which I predict as you know, will happen.
