This is in federal court in Washington, D.C.Important to note, the focus here is not so much on the Capitol attack on January 6th as on the conspiracy in the weeks and months leading up to it, the conspiracy to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 election using knowingly false claims of election fraud. Now, today, there will be litigation over a protective order. Prosecutors have said, judge, you need to limit the way that Donald Trump uses the evidence and talks about it publicly. Donald Trump's team asked for a little more time to respond and the judge said, nope, you have got to respond today, Monday. We'll get that response later in the day. The next court appearance is going to be on August 28th. That's three weeks from now. And the key issue there is will the judge set a trial date? I think she will. She has signaled that she's likely to. And I think it's likely to be before the election. But the question, of course, is will that date hold? That's where we are on the newest of the indictments.",

After storms delayed the show, the stadium says a number of people were treated on site for heat exhaustion, given the very high temperatures, how packed people were in the concourse, one person was taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion.The show did go on. Beyonce's tour covered the $100,000 that it cost to keep D.C. metro stations open running for an extra hour. Nice of her. The storm was one example of severe weather sweeping the nation. Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is with us with more. It doesn't stop.",
