I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with this breaking news and powerful and historic storm bearing down on Southern California. Right now, we're getting our first images as Tropical Storm Hilary slammed Baja California and Mexico. Intense rain causing massive flooding there. Mexican officials say at least one person is now dead after their vehicle was swept away. Hilary is expected to hit the U.S. later on today. Officials warned, the storm could bring life-threatening flooding. Some areas could see up to 10 inches of rain. In California, mudslides remain a growing concern in the burn areas of the San Bernardino Mountains. The sheriff's department there ordering people to evacuate. Along the coast, Hilary could bring large swells and potentially life- threatening rip currents. Visitors and some residents on Catalina Island were encouraged to leave on Saturday. In Los Angeles, people filled sandbags ahead of Hilary's arrival. Mayor Karen Bass said today, the city is prepared. But a big concern right now is for people who are homeless. Yesterday, sheriff's office flying over the riverbed areas warning people there to seek higher ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is one of those major roads that the mayor was talking about that they've closed down here.One of the officers I spoke to said that they get accidents on these roads already, without rain. So just to be safe, because of potential flooding, they've shut it down. Out in the distance there, there's Interstate 10. So people have been coming down here trying to get to the highway, but have to go another way. And then out in the distance behind the police officers here, that's where you would find Joshua Tree National Park. And that is also supposed to see a lot of flooding. They're worried about the mudflows, they're worried about how much flooding there will be, so that's where they want people to stay safe, stay inside. They say, according to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, they're saying, most of the reason that we see interruptions in service is because of debris flying around in the wind that then knocks out poles or knocks down some of their towers. So because of that, they have crews staffed for 24 hours who will be out looking for that, looking to restore service similarly in other parts of the state as well. But overall, this is a very bizarre thing, and that is why we have seen on all of our social media, L.A. County, San Diego, all of them putting out, FEMA, the state of California, putting out messages, telling people to be prepared because no one looks at the weather in August, Fred.

This is an unprecedented weather event, but Los Angeles has deep experience responding to crisis, whether it be wildfire or earthquakes, the city is prepared. A lot of work has already been done to prepare, and there are a few critical areas of focus. Our primary mission, of course, is to protect the life and property of Angelenos. Second, we need to keep our city workers safe. Third, we must ensure that city services are operating as best as possible given the circumstances. Last night Chief Crowley, who is the incident commander, activated the Emergency Operations Center to level two. It was very important that we started in-person preparation last night, so that this morning, we were already in action. Last night, I also signed a declaration of local emergency to immediately activate the emergency operations organization and waive any regulation that may inhibit the saving of lives here in Los Angeles. I want to thank President Biden and Vice President Harris, as well as Governor Newsom, for their support and preparation and their pledges to support with recovery as needed. Right now, again, it is critical that Angelenos stay safe and stay home, unless otherwise directed by safety officials. Avoid unnecessary travel. If you do not need to be on the road, please don't get in your car. Make sure your emergency kit and essential devices are on hand and ensure that all of your devices are charged. In the event of life-threatening emergency, Angelenos should call 911. For impacts like roadway flooding, tree limbs blocking roads, or mudslides, Angelenos should request service online or by calling 311. In the event of power outages, our main water -- our water main breakage, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power customers, can call 1-800 Dial, D-I-A-L D-W-P. If you see downed power lines or wires, please do not approach them. The water surrounding the wires could cause serious damage, serious injury or death. Just to reiterate one last time, stay safe, stay home, and stay informed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know how to do this. We live through COVID. This is -- the worst parts of it are going to be over by midday, Monday.You do that, one, because you protect yourself. Two, because you don't want to put first responders in harm's way, because you're out and about where everyone can stay put. The second is people thinking that this is not as bad as we thought it was going to be 24 hours ago. So a little science here, hurricane categories are based on wind speed, not water release. And so the wind may be going down, that's good news, because then you're going to have less damage. But the rain forecasts are pretty bad. And this is a land that does not get this kind of rain that cannot sustain. There's nowhere for the water to go, except for the kind of flash flooding we're worried about. And that goes to the, you know, Fred, the cumulative impact of these climate disasters. So you have the drought and the fires related to the drought. That then leaves land that is then more susceptible to flash flooding, because there's no -- there's no vegetation that can sort of absorb the water.

There's just no need to risk this at this stage because we know -- we essentially know when it ends. And then -- and then you rebuild. So we're -- you know, for Los Angelenos and everyone in the area, this is a period in which they can take responsibility for their own safety and security.

The reason why they call that voluntary evacuation is, you know, if there's elderly people there that might mean medical needs, you just want to make sure that they're -- that they're -- that they're going to be safe or so two major issues for Los Angelenos. It's a wonderful diverse city, lots of languages. Information is being translated. I'm monitoring really sophisticated and great communication strategy by the mayor and her team, in terms of getting out to those pockets of immigrant communities, or whatever communities that may not have English as a -- as a first language, you want to get that -- those language translations out. The second is, of course, the homeless issue, those without homes. There's been an extensive effort to get people into shelters, but those are communities that are hard to reach. And ones that may not want to move. And so those are some of the challenges that you would have in a -- in a -- in a community. I guess I'll, Fred, and you have an entire city not used to this, right? I mean, a hurricane in Los Angeles, none of us were alive. Most of us were not alive at the last one. And so communities can get acclimated, as you certainly know in the Gulf area and other areas like, you know, they get acclimated to the kinds of disasters they expect in this age in which these -- the climate changes and the weather changes are causing sort of these unprecedented and a historical event the kinds of fires we saw in Maui, the kinds of rains we're seeing in Los Angeles.

And that is why they have this road blocked off. It is blocked off all the way down the other side at Interstate 10. So if you try to get off of this exit, which is one of the main ways into town, you're not going to be able to do it right now. And that's why they're concerned. They shut this down at midnight. So this is some of what you're seeing. You're seeing Caltrans also shutting down some of the roads, just because they're saying if there could be flooding, they don't want people driving through that. And they're saying they, this could take out a car here. That's some of the concern here along with the mud flows. And all of that other flooding that we may see. I also wanted to know what this means for, you know, the quote- unquote, fire season in California, which does seem to get longer and longer. And I checked in with Cal Fire. And they're saying, just because we're going to get inundated with so much rain, it does not mean that fire season is over. The other issue is because of those damaging winds that can spark and spread things. And because of the fact that you do have lightning strikes without the rain, and that can spark a new blaze as well. So they're still being very vigilant to watch what happens with the storm as it spreads into Southern California. But it's very, very quickly changing here. And this is a very weird storm to even have at all, let alone any kind of rain of this level and historic amount of rain of, you know, what we've seen a year happening within just a couple of day period here. So they're really trying to get the word out for people to be prepared. And to get away from all of those places where you can see the water flooding in so fast that it could just really take a car out. So if you don't have to come outside, don't. That's the messaging. That's messaging. That's the messaging.",
