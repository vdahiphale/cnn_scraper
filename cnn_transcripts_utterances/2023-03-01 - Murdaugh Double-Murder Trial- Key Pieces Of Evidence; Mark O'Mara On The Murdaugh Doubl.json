And they will resume, tomorrow, and come after five weeks of tense, emotional and graphic moments, as a jury of 12, in Walterboro, South Carolina, will soon decide Alex Murdaugh's fate.Now, for the very first time, today, they visited the scene, of the murders, of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, traveling to the family's hunting property and, for the first time, we also got to look at the crime scene, up close, via video, released today. Now, here's how tonight is going to work. We have assembled some of the nation's most prominent trial and jury veterans, to analyze the key pieces of evidence, and which side may have presented the very best arguments. On the defense table: Mark O'Mara, who defended George Zimmerman; Jennifer Bonjean, who defended Bill Cosby and R. Kelly. On the prosecution table: Loni Coombs, a former Los Angeles criminal prosecutor; and Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi, a veteran former homicide prosecutor, in Brooklyn. Now, in our makeshift jury box, the neutral voices, at least for tonight: Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant in many high-profile cases, including the O.J. Simpson, and Casey Anthony trials; Judge Glenda Hatchett, who was the first African American Chief Judge, of a State court, in Georgia; and Ken Turkel, who represented everyone, from Hulk Hogan, to Sarah Palin. Now, before we begin, look, if you have not been following this trial, we're going to give you the quick overview, of just how we get here. So, let's go live to Randi Kaye, who has been following every twist and turn. Randi?",

So let's focus first on the timeline, the prosecution is laid out. And the big question, did Murdaugh have time, to commit murder, get rid of the guns, clean himself up, leave and return, in about an hour and 17 minutes? Or is there a reasonable doubt? Let's drill down, on that key kennel video that Randi just mentioned. I want to turn to the prosecution first. Because, listen, he's admitting now that he is at the scene of the crime, moments before the murders. Is that enough?

I'm talking about the big lie, of his alibi, where he said, \"I was not there at the crime scene. I was at the house taking a nap.\" He told this, from the first moment he called 911, to the first responder, to the first interview with law enforcement that night, to two more interviews with law enforcement, to all of his family members, to friends, everyone he has told that lie to, until, as you said, this video came up. And, in court, witness after witness came in and said, \"That's him on that video. That's him.\" So, that explains. It blows that up. And now he has to explain it. Why did he tell about lie? If his family has just been murdered, and he wants to help law enforcement find the real killer? He knows that telling them the last time he saw them is a critical piece of evidence. He lied. Why? Because he knows when the time of death is, because he was there. That's why he went to so much lengths-- JENNIFER BONJEAN, R.

But when you couple it with all the small pieces of evidence, all the different things that happened, all the lies? This is a tsunami about to hit this man, to rip apart this legacy that his family that has been the meaning of their being, in that area, for years. And you look at the fact, you have motive, means, opportunity, and every small piece, large piece, in this case, those lies, coupled together, with the other pieces, I think, if the jury sees what the prosecution has been putting together, can overcome that extremely high burden, as it should be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. O'MARA: It is an enormous stretch, to say \"I will steal from people. But now to cover up that I stole from people, on my opiate habit, whatever, I'm going to kill my son, and I'm going to kill my wife.\" That is such a stretch. If the State's case was so strong, circumstantial, as it is, why the big focus, on the finances? Why the big focus on the fraud? Why try and convict him for that which is not being prosecuted for, in front of this jury? It's because they don't have a strong case, on the actual murders.",

Because we are all lawyers. And I just want to make sure that we remember that the people who are viewing this typically are not. And so, I want to do two things quickly. One is the point about reasonable doubt. It doesn't mean that you have to prove beyond any doubt. It means that you have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. And secondly, the prosecution, under the law, is not required to outline and prove a motive. So, I just want to frame that, as we're talking about that. Having said that, I think the fact that he waited until there was testimony, in this courtroom, from multiple people, and then said, \"Oh, yes, I was there.

I think their details were important, because they could talk about how he was so cold, and stealing from friends, who were dying, and just taking their money, and telling them \"I'm sorry, you're doing so poorly.\" But in the closing argument, he expanded the motive. He said, \"It wasn't just the financial crimes.\" He said, \"It was the family legacy.\" And that's one thing that came out very clear, his legacy that goes back 100 years, in this low country, is the most important thing to him. His prominence, in the community, all of this was tied in with what was going on, on the financial side that was being covered up, and it was all going to be exposed, and it was going to tear down his family legacy. And that was part of the reason why that's more of the motive why. But remember, the reason why we don't have to prove motive is because there's no rational motive for murder, OK?

He talks about things he's comfortable with, and then they confront him with something and he switches gears.

How lucky was it this person that was coming in to kill found these guns laying there and used them to kill. MARK O'MARA, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Oh, but again, the prosecution does a good job of explaining away evidence they don't have because they don't have it.

They have all of the resources they could have gotten. They've gotten everything from the cell phones, everything from the cars, everything else.
