This is ahead of the crucial meeting this afternoon between President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. June 1st now just ten days away, that is the date that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says is a hard deadline to avoid an economic disaster that would impact millions of Americans. We're talking Social Security checks, Medicare, veterans' benefits, the salaries of thousands of federal and military employees. They are all at real risk. We have reporters standing by at the White House and on Capitol Hill hounding their sources for any insight from either side. This is the last we heard from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.

The negotiations are taking place right now, but there are huge obstacles ahead in order to avoid the nation's first ever debt default and to raise the more than $30 trillion nation debt limit. If they don't, the U.S. government won't be able to pay its bills, and then as a result, economic calamity could ensue.Republicans and Democrats are still not on the same page on a whole wide range of issues, namely on how much to cut federal spending. Republicans had been demanding significant spending cuts to pare back from last year's level. The Democrats have pushed back on that, but are now are starting to negotiate to try to see if they can find any sort of middle ground. There are still a whole host of other policy issues at play, too. But negotiators, including one key negotiator, Garret Graves, he is someone who is in that meeting right now with White House negotiators, indicated to reporters yesterday that, first, they need to find a deal on how much the federal government will spend, and then the rest of issues could fall in place. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. GARRET GRAVES (R-LA):  But I want to be very clear, the numbers are foundational here. The speaker is very clear, a red line is spending less money. And unless and until we are there, the rest of it is irrelevant. The reality is that I think once we're able to close the numbers and truly put ourselves in this trajectory, and then I think that the speaker's direction is very clear. I think once we are able do that, I think everything else cascades in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Typically, these fiscal agreements take months to hammer out, and oftentimes, it can't even get there after months of talks. They have to do that in a matter of days, because, for months, they had disagreed about whether to even have negotiations. The White House had refused to have any talks, saying that the Republicans just simply raise the national debt limit without any conditions, Republicans, of course, rejected that approach, wanted a whole slew of conditions. So, no, those talks still underway about what those conditions are.And over the weekend, you saw back and forth posturing and blame game trading, but after McCarthy and Biden spoke last night, the temperature was dialed down a little bit. Some of the negotiators said that talks had been a little bit more productive, but they acknowledged there is a lot more to do ahead of that key meeting of the president and the speaker later today, John.",

He noted that this will need to be a bipartisan deal, getting sign-in from both Republicans and Democrats, and that in order for that to happen, the Republicans need to make some concessions in these negotiations. But, certainly, at this moment, they are facing incredibly real time constraints, as President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are hoping to come together this afternoon to restart those conversations as a potential default is getting closer and closer in this country.",

He's still has these followers and they need somebody to lead them, they need somebody to look to an alternative. So, they're all going to have to answer the question, what do I do with Donald Trump?But I don't think Tim Scott is looking to be a Donald Trump V.P. Donald Trump has been very hard on the Republican Party. It's been very hard. And so I think he's looking to set his own path, set his own goals forward. Tim, I know him very well, I worked with him. He is actually a really good friend of mine. He is policy-oriented. And one of the things I'm really proud of with Tim is that he is the only one, really, that has tried to solve the major issues in the Senate that we've been dealing with, police reform. He was right there at the very beginning with criminal justice reform. These are issues that have helped Americans and will potentially continue to help Americans when we look at police reform.",

He spoke at the -- he had a keynote slot at the Republican National Convention a few years ago, and it was very, very good. It was very effective. He talks about going from cotton to Congress. He had a grandfather who had to drop out of school in the third grade and pick cotton, and then here he is in Congress just a generation later after being raised by a single mom, a great, inspiring story.Unfortunately, it does not translate into policy. I mean, Mia mentioned the criminal justice reform, and there was a lot of hope riding on Tim Scott to work with Senator Cory Booker and come up with some police reform. But in the end, they came up with nothing. The policies -- your personal biography and his sunny, optimistic outlook has to translate into policy, if anything is going to change. Politically, he can ride pretty far on that biography, but what comes from that, again, we're going to have to listen and hear what he has to say today.",

When I encountered them back in December, they were fighting very heavily south of Bakhmut on the front line there. It now appears that they have crossed into Russia with an all-Russian team, according to the Ukrainians, and the Ukrainian government is saying somewhat coyly that they are operating there entirely as Russian citizens, as free agents, not as part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, although, of course, they're using Ukrainian uniforms, weapons, bullets and arguably vehicles. Now, their spokesman or the member of their political wing here in Ukraine has told CNN that the combat is ongoing and certainly social media would indicate from a number of videos that are being posted that they have deployed themselves in a number of villages very close to the border. This is the first time that we have confirmation from the Ukrainians that, let's say, a Ukrainian-backed organization, military organization, has conducted overt military action against Russia inside Russian territory. We've seen in the past covert military operations deep behind Russian lines here in Ukraine and indeed mysterious activities inside Russia itself.
