Last month was a big one. And as you already mentioned, you know, we - our philosophy is that when workers do well, the economy is stronger, the nation is stronger. And this jobs report is an example of that. Unemployment remains historically low. It's now been at or four - at or near 4 percent or below 4 percent for the longest stretch since before many of us were born. Real wages continue to be up. Inflation rate and the interest rates are going down. And all of this is a sign of a historic and unprecedented economic recovery and also just continued really steady and stable growth.",

There was no national strategy to address a global pandemic. Four years ago, in October, kids were being told trick-or-treating was canceled. It is an entirely different world right now. And that is, in large part, because of historic investments made by the Biden-Harris investing in America agenda, and the job growth that's come with it. And when I travel the country, I see just the impact of that, right? We want to see higher wages. We want to see, you know, more security. We want to see more money in the pockets of working families, more breathing room. We want people to be able to relax, you know, feel some joy, not have to work all the time, and we want them to be able to retire with dignity. All of these things are happening. We are not done by any stretch of the imagination. This is not a declaration of victory, but it is a declaration of progress. And this month's jobs report really just drives that point home.",

Election officials and voting rights advocates say Donald Trump and his allies in battleground states are ready to use the same playbook they used in 2020 if Trump loses this election.CNN's Sara Murray is following this story for us. What are the parallels - and we're hearing some of them already - but what are some of the parallels that are being seen that are very similar to 2020? SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, Sara, I think when you look back at that filing, we saw this blockbuster filing from Jack Smith, a lot of the tactics that were laid out in that filing around 2020 are very much back in play for 2024. A couple of them are these sort of widespread claims that there are non-citizens who are going to vote in federal elections. Something that experts say is very rare. Another one is lawsuits challenging voter rolls all over battleground states saying that states aren't maintaining the voter rolls, there are dead people on the roles, there are people who have moved. We saw a lot of these kinds of claims after the 2020 election that were thrown out in court. And another thing that just popped up in one place in 2020 in Michigan was an election board that was refusing to certify the results that ultimately backtracked. That has become so much more widespread in the time since 2020. We've seen it happen in 2022 in the midterms. We've seen it already happening this year. And ultimately these boards haven't been successful. But it's a big concern for election workers. And I think another piece of this is just a continuing climate of misinformation around elections, the way that that can whip up citizens, lead them to believe things are happening that aren't actually happening, and potentially inspire them to take action, to show up at election offices, to show up at counting centers. This is something that, of course, election workers are worried about this time around. And, you know, you're seeing this sort of groundwork being laid in lawsuits across the country led by Republicans, these lawsuits. Places like Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Wisconsin, all of these big battlegrounds have faced an avalanche really of lawsuits from Republican groups that voting rights activists and Democrats say they view as kind of a pretext for efforts to try to overturn the results if Donald Trump does not win this time around.",
