The meeting is also to include some heads of regional banks, which have been dealing with investor turmoil. Matt Egan is with me.

And so there is always the risk that they end up getting it wrong if there is a miscalculation, and instead of this intentional default, where maybe some House Republicans are sort of willing to talk about a default, you get an accidental default, and intentional or not, I mean, it would still be really, really bad. So yes, I do think that that's a risk and during this meeting, going on between Secretary Yellen and the bank CEOs, I think it's clear that, you know, they all understand the stakes here. Certainly Yellen, but also to the bank leaders and this group includes Jamie Dimon and Jane Fraser and Brian Moynihan and Richard, Jamie Dimon, he has been very outspoken about just how terrible a default would be.",

And you know, you would be sort of like a 2008 TARP moment where if you'll recall, the House initially voted down that very controversial Wall Street bailout.

The court said that while the material in tweets by terrorist groups, ISIS was illegal, the company did not provide substantial aid to terror attacks.

They are very grateful today that the Supreme Court ruled in their favor. Both of these cases were brought by families of victims of terrorism and those families said that content, third party content both on Google and Twitter had helped the terrorists and they wanted to hold Twitter and Google liable. The Twitter case, what the court basically said is that the families hadn't reached the bar, high enough bar to show that Twitter somehow aided and abetted through this terrorism law. And in the Google case, which was a separate case, it had to do with this federal law that gives these internet companies this broad immunity from these kinds of challenges.
