Take a look.(END VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (via phone): We were there from about noon until about just after 6 p.m. local time when we had finished our last live shot. And I guess what we hadn't quite surmised was exactly how bad it had gotten south of us on Pacific Coast Highway. And that's the way we came in to get to our spot to cover the fire. And we knew that we had heard reports that the flame jumped the highway, but I guess we had not seen with our own eyes just exactly what that meant and what that looked like for us getting out of there. So at the end of the night, you know, we pulled up to a fire truck and kind of waved at a firefighter and said, hey, where do you think is the best way for us to leave, to get out of here? He kind of shook his head at us and said, well, I guess you go south. And so that's what we did. Pretty quickly realizing that there were flames on both sides of the highway. There were embers flying over the lanes of the highway. I spotted an emergency vehicle and decided our best bet is to just follow that car, to follow right behind him as closely as possible. If he's driving, then he's probably knowing the best way out. So as we're driving behind this emergency vehicle, I'm hearing an explosion on my right. There are houses on fire right up against the road on the left. And as I mentioned, embers flying. And so at this point, Rosemary, I'm just holding my breath, and I can feel the heat from inside the car, just watching the embers fly across the windshield. So not ideal. In that kind of, you know, we get put on a lot of risky assignments, and in this situation we had to make a calculated risk for the best way to leave. And I think, you know, thankfully we got out of there and we got a real look at just the level of destruction and really the fear that a lot of those residents might be feeling if they're looking at those images on the news, if they've evacuated. I can't imagine. They're wondering if their house is the next one on fire if they have anything to go home to. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He said if they are not released by the time he takes office, all hell will break loose in the Middle East. He also did not rule out pardoning January 6th defendants.

Coming from Northern California.We pre-positioned 110 engines. We've got fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, dozers, Water Tenders, specialty personnel putting everything we can to not only suppress this fire, but to prevent additional fires over the course of the next few days. Unprecedented winds for this time of year. And, of course, this time of year traditionally has not been fire season, but now we disabuse any notion that there is a season. It's year-round in the state of California. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As night falls, we are expecting the wind gusts to peak overnight, creating a real problem for firefighters on the ground.Residents, meanwhile, have evacuated this particular neighborhood, though some are still stuck in there. We talked to many of them who had come down the hill. Unfortunately, this is only one path that they can take out of their neighborhood, so there was a lot of gridlock there. Some of them have been abandoning their cars and coming down the hill by foot with a suitcase with their pets, telling me they had very little time to put together their bags, seeing how fast this fire was moving. We've now been told that the flames have jumped the Pacific Coast Highway, where we are, just a little bit south of us, and even burned a couple of lifeguard stations. The firefighters are working through the night. There are hundreds of them working this, and now there are thousands who have been ordered to evacuate or have gotten evacuation warnings to prepare that they could be next to be asked to leave. Though we know a lot of people to the neighboring Malibu, as well as Santa Monica to the south, have seen these orange glows in the distance, and they are starting to move on out, not taking any chances.

This is an event that had exceptionally long lead times, not only of the powerful windstorm that we anticipated, but also the potential for a particularly dangerous situation, red flag warning, fire weather conditions. This event had significant notification ahead of time.I know that when we have these wildfires spread rapidly, you know, it's a very horrifying experience for many. It just emphasizes the absolute need to take all of the notifications, all of the emergency alerting from local law enforcement and emergency management personnel seriously, because seconds save lives.",

I'm actually here right now at the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management Emergency Operations Center where all of our emergency management partners, fire agencies, they're working together to make sure that all of the resources that are available to keep people safe and respond as effectively as possible are implemented based on the forecasts that we're issuing ahead of time.
