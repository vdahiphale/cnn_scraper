We are live in eastern Ukraine. Then, as the government arrests four Israeli settlers for violence in the West Bank, we will tell you what message the U.S. Security of State has for Israel. And then later, the submersible wreckage surfaces. What these pieces can tell investigators trying, of course, to learn lessons from the deadly implosion. But we begin with new information on the deadliest attack against civilians in Ukraine in months. Officials now say, at least 11 people were killed, including several children, when a Russian missile slammed into a restaurant in the heart of Kramatorsk. Dozens of other people were wounded. Some are still feared buried underneath the rubble. Ukraine says, it has detained a man who scouted the restaurant before the attack, and sent a video of it to Russia's military. Russia says, the site hit was actually a temporary command post of the Ukrainian army. Well, our Ben Wedeman visits the site of the attack, he joins us now from eastern Ukraine. And Ben, you were on the scene late last night. You painted a picture of a very busy residential area and this popular restaurant. Was there military value in hitting the target?",

      "sentences": "We were at the restaurant a day before yesterday, Isa, and all we saw was people eatinglunch. Not just -- there were soldiers, but there were also plenty of civilians as well. That area I know quite well, having spent a lot of time in Kramatorsk. It's a civilian area, there is no question about it. There is no military base or any military facility in there. What we saw today was that the search and rescue crews have been working overnight, trying to remove rubble and see if anybody is left alive inside. We were there when they came out with a stretcher on top of which was a black body bag. And as they were taking it out to put it in the van, relatives, loved ones, friends who were there, sobbing as they watched that happen. And there are more waiting on the scene to find out about the fate of their relatives, who were either eating in the restaurant or working in the restaurant. We understand from people who work there that, there are still several people who are unaccounted for. Now, what exactly hit that restaurant is now becoming clear. Last night, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his nightly address said it was an S-300, that's an anti-surface-to-air missile. But today, they've come out to say it's an Iskander missile, which is a hypersonic ballistic missile. It travels at speeds that make it very difficult to be detected by radar or downed by air defenses. It is a very precise missile with a very large payload. Which would explain why there was such massive destruction in that entire area. Now, the question is, were the Russians targeting the restaurant? We don't know. Certainly, in turn, if they are trying to damage the morale of the soldiers and the civilians here, that is probably the effect that it has had. But it certainly -- it just underscores just how dangerous this city, which is really just a half hour drive from the frontlines, can be. Isa?",

Remember, at times, Russia is just a kleptocracy, and so, there will be people too trying to use the situation to get more money out of the state coffers. All of this, essentially, will likely undermine Putin's position. He's been shown to be exceptionally weak by the betrayal of a confidant like Prigozhin, possibly expected at some point, as that may have been after Prigozhin's months of open criticism. But it's an exceptionally fragile time for the Kremlin, and it might feed a little bit too into Ukraine's strategy. Maybe you let this play out, you let the recriminations, the scrutiny, their sort of unexplained absences of key military figures for a number of days.

The day after CNN obtained an audio recording of him discussing confidential documents in 2021, the former U.S. president told FOX News the vigil that he has done, quote, \"nothing wrong,\" saying it is a \"whole hoax.\" He also told \"Semafor\" that he was showing off classified documents in a 2021 meeting, saying they were just papers.

Jean Carroll for defamation after a New York jury, if you remember, found he sexually abused the former magazine columnist and defamed her.

Well, Trump is now countersuing E. Jean Carroll for comments that she made on CNN the morning after that jury verdict. She was asked by Poppy Harlow about the jury finding that he had sexually abused her and not raped her. And Carroll said that, in response to that, oh, yes, he did. So Trump is now saying that that statement that she made was defamatory. And she made it maliciously and intending to hurt him because he is saying the jury did not exactly find rape; they found sexual abuse. Isa.",

Jean Carroll. Now it's also important to remember that after the jury had awarded Carroll the $5 million, Trump spoke at a CNN town hall and was asked about the jury's verdict. In that, he doubled down on his denials of rape, saying that he did not know who E. Jean Carroll was. Well, Carroll got a judge to allow her to amend that initial lawsuit. So she's asking the potential jury in the future to consider those statements that Trump had made at the town hall after the verdict. And she's trying to get $10 million in punitive damages.
