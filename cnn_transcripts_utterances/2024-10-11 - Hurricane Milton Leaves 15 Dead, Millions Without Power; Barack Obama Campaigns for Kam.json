This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Hurricane Milton leaves a path of destruction that could take years to recover from. We'll hear from officials on the ground in Florida.Barack Obama on the campaign trail trying to close the deal for Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign. And Israeli strikes hit central Beirut's residential neighborhood. Witnesses say they got no warning. We begin in Florida where millions of people are dealing with the lingering dangerous conditions in the wake of Hurricane Milton. Search and rescue efforts are ongoing. More than 24 hours after the storm made landfall, Milton has led to an infrastructure crisis in the state with some areas lacking clean water and electricity while extensive flooding damaged roads and buildings. Many people have lost everything. Milton unleashed and extraordinary storm surge and torrential rain and spawned a swarm of tornadoes before moving offshore over the Atlantic. More than two and a half million homes and businesses are still without power. Roughly a thousand people have been rescued so far. Hurricane Milton whipped up more than 30 reported tornadoes, often so quickly that residents had little time to react. At least nine tornadoes plowed through St. Lucie County, including three in less than 25 minutes. Milton hit Florida as residents were still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which made landfall less than two weeks ago. CNN's Randy Kay reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The next two, I want to put those two picks together.The United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza and the International Court of Justice, there's been a lot of backlash against the idea of rewarding those two organizations because they're perceived certainly by many in Israel as organizations that in the case of UNRWA have included a few employees being members of Hamas, very few confirmed it should be added, and the ICJ criticized as being biased and targeting Israel. So why did you pick them? URDAL:  So advice, it's important to say its a humanitarian organization and said lifeline for nearly 6 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, but also in the neighboring countries. And it has staff over 30,000 and it's true that there have been allegations of ties at some of their employees. At the same time, it says very clearly that they have a zero tolerance policy, all those who are associated with militant organizations are dismissed, and it's important in conflicts like the one in Gaza that were seeing now, that were not politicizing the role of humanitarian organizations, this is an important U.N. organization providing absolutely essential support to a population in need and that's why I think it is important to highlight that we need to protect the offices of humanitarian organizations and advice and important such organization. When it comes to the International Court of Justice, this is, of course, the primary U.N. arena for solving conflicts peacefully between states. It has ruled in a number of different cases, including both in Ukraine, saying very clearly that Russia needs to immediately suspend military operations in the country. It also has said that Israel has responsibility to prevent acts of genocide in the Gaza Strip, but it's in court that is also engaged in a number of other has major conflicts in recent in we solving them peacefully. And as such, it would speak very much to the part of Alfred Nobel's testament that refers to Peace Congress. So I think that would be very appropriate candidate.",

We didn't really experience the storm surge. What we experienced was flooding in areas where people were not prepared for flooding. People like Sheriff Chronister said an area that was a non-evacuation zone and people who are very economically vulnerable. So that was this apartment complex that our first responders bravely got in and save 500 people from today.",

And they got out there right before sunrise.When they saw the situation, they had people neck deep, chest deep. They had this first floor, which they weren't sure if there were people still alive in there or not. So it was an overwhelming task. So they pulled in the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, two other Florida County Sheriff's offices and state agency from the state of Florida to scour the whole building, do a search and rescue operation.
