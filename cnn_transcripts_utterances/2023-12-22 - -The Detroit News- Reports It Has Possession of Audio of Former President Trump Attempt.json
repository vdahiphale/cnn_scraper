I am not sure if it would change Donald Trump's status as the current Republican frontrunner for the Republican nomination, but they have definitely helped him in his campaign.Now, another thing that she's candidates have been pointing to is they are making it an electability argument against Donald Trump. They're arguing to voters, do you really want a candidate who comes with all of this drama and all of this baggage? And I think it's a salient point. We saw in 2020, one the key reasons Donald Trump lost to Joe Biden in that election is because there was this Trump fatigue. So many people were tired of the rhetoric that Donald Trump was using. They criticized him on the campaign trail. And now it's hard to see how Republican primary voters are receiving that argument, if they are receptive to it.
