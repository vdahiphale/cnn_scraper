They were offering as part of that deal Victor Bout, who was part of the prisoner swap today. But that's not the deal that ended up securing things today. According to a senior administration official, it became clear in recent weeks that the Russian side was only going to go for Brittney Griner. That was the only option here. And the White House, of course, is elated that Brittney Griner has been released after 10 months in prison in Russia. But, of course, they say they are going to continue working for Paul Whelan. Listen to what the secretary of state, Tony Blinken, said this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  This was not a choice of which American to bring home. The choice was one or none. We will never relent until Paul and, for that matter, every other U.S. national held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad is free and coming home and joining their families. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I also want to note that the United States worked with the United Arab Emirates on the logistics here. That was the country where both Victor Bout, Brittney Griner flew to. They were able to help secure the logistics to get Brittney Griner home. And the Saudi officials are also saying they were involved. We're waiting to hear more details on that, but rest assured the Griner family elated today that Brittney Griner is finally coming home -- Ana.",

Is it just the Russian playbook that you negotiate a deal and, at the very last minute, you turn the tables and pull the rug under your co-negotiator and just take away something that was originally on offer? We don't know the answer to that. Just picking up something you mentioned there, though, Ana, about, is Victor Bout useful going forward? He's been in prison for 13-plus years. His e-mail communication -- I tried to have an e-mail exchange with him when he was in prison -- is monitored. So I'd be very doubtful he retains the contacts to be of use in a very changed world the last 13 to 14 years or so, but still remarkable value to Russia.

But it's like, if you want to buy a house and you walk up to someone's house, and you give them money, they don't have to take that money. They don't have to sell you their house. And when you're dealing with nation-states who are taking people hostage, it's very difficult, even if the U.S. government has all the tools available to encourage the other side to give up the hostages. And that that's not just Russia and President Putin. It's Syria, it's Iran, it's China, where other Americans are being held.

So, Iran has been arresting people, Russia has been arresting people, Americans are being wrongfully detained in these countries for years before the U.S. government really got its act together to start dealing with it. And we have seen a huge change in the last two years, as the U.S. government has passed the Levinson Act. They have -- President Biden passed an executive order about wrongful detention. So we're seeing much more movement. But I think they're still behind the curveball.

But there could potentially be next week, I think, on Thursday, when the other three drop, because they are much more about that very tense moment, when the couple left their royal roles, and they had to explain that.

So, first of all, it affects fewer than 5,000 people in the United States. That's a very small number for such a large country. It is twice as likely to effect to women, which is interesting, and it's thought that there's maybe an autoimmune cause, that that's related, or maybe the causes associated with diabetes. It's really quite unknown. So, as you mentioned, people experience extreme muscle stiffness, to the point where they often fall. And that's one of the big dangerous with this syndrome, is that people fall and hurt themselves that way, also painful spasms. Now, there are treatments. There are muscle relaxants. People try muscle relaxants. They try pain relievers, a couple -- some other drugs that people try. I want to be clear. There's no cure for this syndrome, but there are ways to manage the symptoms. It is possible in many cases to manage the symptoms, but it takes some work to figure out what's going to be the most effective. So I know people are wondering, will she get back out there on stage?
