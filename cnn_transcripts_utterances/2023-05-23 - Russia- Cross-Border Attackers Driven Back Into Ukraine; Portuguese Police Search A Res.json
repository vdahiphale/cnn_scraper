      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Russia says the fighters who haveencroached on their territory are dead or pushed back into Ukraine. Why this Belgorod incursion is a major moment in the war. Then, Portuguese police are searching a reservoir for fresh evidence in the missing child case of Madeleine McCann. We'll take you live to the site. And then later, officials warn millions living near Mexico's most dangerous active volcano get ready to evacuate. But first this hour, just one day after a bold attack on Russian soil. The Kremlin is claiming they're back in control. Moscow says they have pushed back fighters who carried out a cross-border attack in the Russian region of Belgorod on Monday. All of this is just what Russia is saying, as CNN has not confirmed these details. The governor in the Belgorod region says the counterterrorism operation is now over, and that one civilian died as a result of the fighting. Now, Moscow is referring to the attackers as Ukrainian, although Kyiv, remember, denies involvement. They say they are Russians acting independently. Two groups of anti-Putin Russian nationals are actually claiming responsibility. They are both Russian units in the Ukrainian security force. So let's get more from all of this from our senior international correspondent Sam Kiley who has spoken previously to someone involved in this incursion, is in Kharkiv for us now, that's northeastern Ukraine, just across the border from Belgorod. So Sam, you and I were talking about this yesterday. Just bring us up to date then with this attack, what took place in Belgorod and what the Kremlin, Russia, is saying about this.",

      "sentences": "So, very briefly, Isa, what has happened is that two units that are almost entirely made-up ofRussian nationals, but are part of the Ukrainian security services, and have seen action under the command of the army in the past, crossed from Ukraine into Russian territory about two hours west of where I am, northwest of where I am, and conducted a combat operation over at least 24 hours. Now, the significance of this is that the Ukrainians are keeping them at arm's length, essentially saying somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that they are Russian citizens acting alone, whereas, in fact, they are members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, they are also Russian citizens. They were driving vehicles that are part of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, carrying weapons and uniforms that indicate the same thing. But nonetheless, they went across and occupied or fought in three small villages up to about 8 kilometers, 5 miles inside Russia, and campaigned very aggressively, while they've been doing that on social media. And that's a very important aspect of this, because this is as much a psychological operation, Isa, as it is an attempt at land grab. Now, it seems, from the Russian perspective, that they're saying that what they're calling a counterterrorist operation is over. The Ukrainians are being stunned(ph), frankly, about whether or not that group, now those two groups have come back into Ukrainian territory. They did post pictures of themselves in what they said were captured Russian vehicles. They claim to have had some military success there. The Russians are making similar counter-claims. We can't prove one way or the other quite yet, but it is clear that this Ukrainian-backed group of Russians did go into Russia, and this is all of course, ahead of the anticipated Summer offensive being launched, but expected to be launched by Ukraine. I think it's very important to see it in that context, all about rattling the Russians, Isa.",

This main road that you can probably see on your map if you drew a line between the two cities, that would basically be it, was the main line of advance made by the Russians when they drove into northern Ukraine as, indeed, was the area that the Ukrainian-backed Russian units traveled in when they went back into Russian territory. It's a very important access of the northern part of the invasion. And it has been pounded frequently, all along that border area, villages are getting hit on a pretty regular basis by the Russian artillery. So, it's a very important real base for Russian artillery. Now, Belgorod itself and the fields just south of it, Fred Pleitgen was reporting from right at the beginning of that war when I was here and he was watching missiles take off that we were seeing and hearing landing here. It is that close. You could actually see the takeoff and the landing on live television because they're so close. It's a very important area, indeed, for the Russians. I don't think that the Ukrainian-backed Russians were imagining that they would be able to do any significant strategic effect, but they've certainly --",

The suspect now identified as Sai Varshith Kandula, 19 years old from Chesterfield, Missouri, he was arrested and charged with threatening to kill, kidnap or inflict harm on the president. That's one potential charge he's facing, another is assault with a dangerous weapon, also reckless operation of a motor vehicle, destruction of federal property and trespassing. We did learn last night that in the initial moments after he crashed that vehicle, then exited it, the law enforcement authorities who responded to the scene were concerned that there may be explosives inside that truck, so they evacuated the Hay Adams Hotel, which is just across the street from where this occurred. They evacuated that hotel for a brief period. They did search the vehicle and found that there were no explosives inside the truck. So, they did allow people back into that hotel.

The ash can be very damaging to planes and it can have a huge impact on air travel. It can be dangerous when you think about pieces of ash getting into planes' engines. That is something that officials are very concerned about.

It will be paid with funds from the Inflation Reduction Act. Snaking across the Southwest and into Mexico, the Colorado River is the lifeblood of the region, supplying water to more than 40 million people across seven states and 30 tribal nations. Major cities rely on the water, including Las Vegas, which gets nearly 90 percent of its water from the river. This deal comes at a critical juncture for the region, as water levels have been decreasing rapidly for nearly 20 years. Two of the largest reservoirs in the nation, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have seen water levels plummet close to so-called deadpools, which means water would no longer flow through their dams.

They want to make decisions and choices that benefit what they think are the real strengths of the Florida governor and the way he wants to run this campaign. So this is certainly a place they feel is in line with that, they feel it makes a lot of sense. There has been so much talk around Ron DeSantis getting into this race. His chief rival, former president Donald Trump, got in months ago. Other rivals have joined. Earlier this week, Tim Scott from South Carolina. But it's no question that DeSantis is the biggest name to get in after Trump. And you can tell simply by how much incoming he is taking before even got into this race. We know he's going to be here in Miami in the next couple days, where he's going to gather his donors as they begin to really ramp up the fundraising arm of this campaign.",

And even though the minimum age for a lot of these sites is 13, as many as 40 percent of kids between 8 and 12 are on social media.

But the list of risks here is much longer. Connections to things like depression and anxiety, poor sleep, online harassment and low self esteem, the list really goes on here.
