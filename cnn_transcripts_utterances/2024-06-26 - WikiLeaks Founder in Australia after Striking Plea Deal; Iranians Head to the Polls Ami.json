Also happening over the next two hours WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange ends a 14 years stand-off with the U.S. pleading guilty and is now home in Australia. Kenya's President calls protesters treasonous after night of bloodshed. Iran's snap elections just days away as candidates make a final push. And the stock market in New York will open at 9:30 Eastern Time, about 30 minutes from now. And if the futures markets are any indication the opening looks weaker today. Well, Julian Assange will not give up the fight for human rights according to his wife speaking a short time ago. WikiLeaks' Founder arrived in Australia earlier as a free man. He was briefly on U.S. soil for a hearing in a remote Pacific Island. After pleading guilty to a single count Assange was freed on time served, thus ending a legal odyssey that stretched over more than a decade. Let's have a listen to what Assange's lawyer said just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In order to win his freedom, Julian pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage for publishing evidence of U.S. war crimes, human rights abuse, human rights abuse and U.S. wrongdoing around the world. This is journalism. This is the criminalization of journalism. And while the plea deal does not set a judicial precedent, it's not a court decision. The prosecution itself sets a precedent that can be used against the rest of the media. It's important that journalists all around the world understand the dangerous precedent that this prosecution has set. An award winning Australian Journalist who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for these publications, has spent more than five years in a high security prison because of this extradition request from the United States.

I'm not sure if the statement that we're expecting from President Ruto can forestall any more action from these young people on the streets of Nairobi and across the country is going to be difficult to convince them to turn about when President Ruto did not even mentioned the finance bill in his address last night, that's the controversial tax increases that led to all these protests in the first place, and he didn't even mention it.",

You can see behind me there, there's a children's band currently playing. We're at the tail end of that campaign event. And of course for Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf like for all the conservative candidates, the participation has been one of the main issues and that he gave his speech on the stage there just a couple of minutes ago, where he urge people to get out and vote, he obviously wants them to vote for him. But he said going out and voting is important for this entire political system here. There is a sense of a turnout could be a little higher than the last election when of course when Ebrahim Raisi was elected, because there is still a moderate candidate that is in the race. You recall, years ago, when Ebrahim Raisi was elected there are no moderates who are still in the final candidates up for vote. Now you have one pilot -- one moderate candidate who's left in the field. His name is Masoud Pezeshkian. We're going to go to a rally of his a little bit later today. But that the authorities here will cause more people to come out and vote. There are a lot of things that are already going on your alliances being forged. Certainly that campaign event that we were just that for Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf one of the main conservative candidates, he counts as one of the front runners, as you can really feel here in Tehran at these events and on the street. That right now, crunch time in this election is coming closer. And you're also absolutely correct to point out that, of course, the economy is one of the main issues, inflation, rising prices, unemployment and how to deal with that, of course, all of that, with the backdrop of those massive sanctions Iran is under by the U.S. and by allied countries Becky.",

He has been trying not to only you know focus on the word of the term West, but the world, which includes the region, Western power Eastern powers as well as -- you know some Western states as well.

They said his case is not about evidence, procedural norms or the rule of law. It is about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political objectives. Russia should stop using individuals like Evan Gershkovich or Paul Whelan as bargaining chips -- they should both be released immediately. So that makes it pretty clear that they believe Russia is doing this for political purposes. And obviously, we see the evidence around the trial itself. The prosecution hasn't made public any evidence to support their claim that he was acting on behalf of the CIA or collecting secrets about a Russian tank factory. The prosecutor himself came out and spoke to the media but didn't actually take any questions. It was just a brief statement. As you said, there's been barely any consider access at this trial or even frankly, in the lead up to it over the past 15 months of pretrial detention. And of course, the political climate provides a motive for Russia to want to convict him. This is Becky the first time that we've seen American journalists accused of espionage since the Cold War. It was very jarring today for those who are reporting in Moscow or whoever have reported in Russia to see him in that glass box that Russians affectionately referred to as the aquarium his head shaved and although he appeared calm and collected even smiled at one point, it's clear that the last 15 months have been quite an ordeal.",

And the moon is a very important, I think piece in our deep space exploration of our solar system, in that it's not only a stepping stone to Mars, but it's potentially a resource rich, celestial body that we could exploit in the future. So looking for things like ice like helium three, like some of the rare metals here on Earth, that could actually help fuel our industries would be I think the objective of some of these missions.

This watersupports the largest carbon sink on the planet right now globally important. And, you know, all rivers are born at their sources. Well, the security comes from the sources. It's the under -- it's just water. Sources are infested with its saturated and have some form of water storage and water tiles of Africa, the Great Spine of Africa. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): \"Call to Earth\" Guest Editor Steve Boyce has dedicated his life to exploration and the science of Africa's freshwater systems. Having said comprehensive scientific baselines across the length and breadth of the Aka Vango (ph), Steve now plans to do the same for the remaining five inland river basins of Africa this MBZ, the Nile, Chad, Niger and the largest of them all, the Congo. The Congo Basin stretches across 3.4 million square kilometers of the continent, barreling through the borders of up to 10 countries, but its further source is the Chambeshi, in the northern corner of Zambia. Steve and his team are the first scientific expedition to ever attempt to trip down the length of this river.",

You don't recognize the trees. You don't recognize the birds. It just becomes foreign. There's magic, there's mythology, there's power to these rivers. It's the unknown, and that's every single corner. And typically of these rivers, no one's ever photographed them. There's no record of what they are, we produce that in the end. Of course, I'm nervous. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Along the water, the stream of data is relentless. Every bird, settlement, boat, bridge anything that can be seen from the river is recorded by the team, creating a comprehensive snapshot of the ecosystem. Throughout the journey, the team is recording 360 degree imagery and stopping at regular intervals to do environmental DNA sampling and fish biodiversity monitoring.",

In some of these rivers it's even though I've studied fish, the diversity is incredible. And there are not many people in the world you actually know all the fish that we're collecting. So we often find new species or new subspecies of fish. And the Chambeshi River in particular is very poorly sampled with regards to fish diversity.",
