Biden telling Netanyahu that a plan should be in place for the more than one million people sheltering in Rafah before any military operations move forward.And from Pennsylvania to Maine, a potentially dangerous winter storm is about to wallop the northeast with some areas seeing up to a foot of snow. And King Charles is seen in public for the first time since it was announced he has cancer. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hello, again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Despite growing tensions President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a call today for the first time since mid-January. It comes just days after Biden delivered his sharpest rebuke yet over Israel's military campaign in Gaza, calling it over the top. The president is now pushing for a clear plan from Israel as its military prepares to move its ground operations into Rafah, where more than a million civilians are currently taking shelter. And on Capitol Hill, this afternoon, the U.S. Senate in a key vote moved one step closer to passing a bill that would provide tens of billions of dollars in assistance and military aid not just for Israel but also Ukraine and Taiwan. We have team coverage. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live for us in Tel Aviv with more on Israel's looming military offensive. And CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is at the White House where we begin. Let's talk about this call between these two leaders, Priscilla. What do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a call that comes amid tensions between President Biden and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But it also comes at a critical juncture for these hostage negotiations. Again, the focus here, releasing those hostages who have been held in Gaza.Now this is a call that lasted 45 minutes according to a senior administration official, two-thirds of which was specifically focused on the release of hostages. Senior U.S. officials have been deploying to the region to hammer out a framework for their release that includes of course freeing of the hostages, but also a humanitarian pause. Now the senior administration official said that significant gaps still remain, though it's unclear what exactly those are. But again maintaining that there is progress on this front. Now a readout from the White House says that President Biden emphasized all of this to the prime minister, noting that they should work on moving this forward and building on the progress of the last few weeks. Of course, this comes after the prime minister slammed Hamas' recent proposals, calling it, quote, \"delusional.\" But another important element of this phone call between the two leaders was that military offensive in Rafah. This is something that the U.S. has been forceful about, especially because it is an area where there are millions of Palestinians, many of whom were displaced to that region and have nowhere else to go in Gaza. And the senior administration official saying that it would require moving people for this to be tenable at all. So the U.S. still holding the line and saying that this is not something that the U.S. can envision under the current conditions. But it was clear both from officials today and also from this White House readout that the prime minister and the president are going to remain in close contact as both of the storylines are developing.",

There has been rampant criticism and concern expressed by not only countries in the region who don't have diplomatic relations with Israel, Saudi Arabia, for example, saying that there would be serious repercussions if Israel moves forward with this offensive and demanding once again an immediate ceasefire and a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, but also from partners in the region like the United Arab Emirates and Egypt who have been raising serious concerns, and of course key allies like the United States, just last week saying that it would be a disaster if the Israeli military moves forward with this operation without significant planning.And obviously, that was a key point that the president -- President Biden stressed during his call with the Israeli prime minister. So what's remarkable, of course, beyond the overwhelming concern and criticism is the fact that the Israeli prime minister is doubling down in spite of all of that. And that gives you just a sense of where his head is at and what could come next from the Israeli military.",

A lot of Biden's aides have been urging him to really expose, do a much bigger public rupture than what we're seeing today, and really make clear while the president is a strong supporter of Israel, it doesn't mean he has to wed himself so closely to Prime Minister Netanyahu who is obviously quite unpopular among Democrats but also unpopular in Israel. And there is growing concern that this is a liability for the president in swing states. And it's also just hasn't been a successful policy to keep all of the differences between the two men in private. It doesn't seem to be the best way to influence Israeli positions and behavior.",

And in some cases bypassed congressional review in the process of getting it is there so urgently. Now U.S. officials say this is defensible. They needed some of this weaponry, some of its precision-guided weaponry, some of the small diameter bombs, but for the critics who are urging a different policy, they're saying, unless you exert leverage over things like you mentioned, the billions of dollars in aid, and threaten to withhold it, you're not going to influence Israeli behavior. The same -- the other critics within the administration have said, that's not the right way because that will embolden Israel's enemies Hezbollah and Hamas, and encourage further attacks on the Jewish state. But really, where the debate is right now for the administration is whether or not to dial that rhetoric up or down. They're really not closely considering pulling off aid or even threatening to reduce military assistance to Israel.",

And I think rather than just trying to explain it away, the most effective thing that President Biden can do is govern, is to show himself in public and to demonstrate through what you see and what you hear that the reports are not true.

Even now some of those same Democratic fans of her are, you know, alleging that he is politically motivated.So does this hurt or help, I guess, Democrats who are being critical of his characterizations? Because now it has taken on a life of its own, hasn't it? ZELIZER: I think you're right. And it's a delicate situation. I mean, it is traditional for presidents to attack special prosecutors and to raise questions about their motivation. But what Democrats don't want to do is raise broader questions about investigations, special counsels all together because President Biden's opponent is facing some pretty serious indictments. And those are underway. And so they don't want to fuel the rhetoric that the former president has really made central to his campaign, that everything is illegitimate, everything is partisan, nothing can be believed.

You know, Joel Osteen has a controversial, complicated that -- but his congregation is equal parts white Caucasian, Hispanic, and African-American. And so, it's a very diverse congregation. It's not one or the other. And the fact that this was the sermon that was going to be in Spanish or bilingual makes sense given who comes to the church. So we can't -- you can't really determine anything from this because every week he has a very diverse parts of Houston come for his sermons, nor do we know exactly where he is or what time. So, obviously, the second thing I'd say, these mega churches are often protected by public safety for the reasons that you don't want a mass shooting at a mega church. It appears that the deputies or some deputies were already assigned to the church and were therefore there when something bad. We don't know the extent of it, when something bad happens.

The cameras -- some of these mega churches actually have metal detectors, most of them do not allow guns in them, regardless of what the state or local rules are and so, we'll find out what numbers are. I mean, look, Joel Osteen is a global figure. This is relevant simply because we don't know where he was at the time. And whatever your religion or politics are, he is someone who is a anything happening to him would be or at his church would have at least national impact and so well just wait to see what the -- what the specifics are, and what -- what was meant by that shooting.",

We're going to see it if he could go and get a third Super Bowl title.Now, a 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, is playing his very first Super Bowl. He's proven that he's not just some fortuitous game manager. He's a beast, 21 in five as an NFL starter, he's worked his butt off to take advantage of these opportunities, got a big one in front of them. Now, we have a kickoff just around the corner and Taylor Swift is in the building. Can her boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Chiefs become the first back-to-back champs since Belichick and Brady?

That says that the defense secretary was sent to the hospital at around 2It also notes that the secretary is retaining the functions and duties of his office and that the deputy secretary is prepared to assume the functions and duties of the secretary of defense if required. Of course, all of this comes after the secretary of defense was admitted to the hospital in early January for complications following prostate cancer surgery. He was later released from the hospital, discharged in mid January. Of course, that -- that time in the hospital really sparked a firestorm in the Capitol Hill, and at the White House because the defense secretary didn't notify Congress or the White House when he was admitted to the hospital. This clearly different circumstance as he is providing notifications. In fact, in this statement, it says that the White House and Congress has been notified that he did go to the hospital because of this again, emerging bladder issue. We'll get more updates as they come, but for now, this is what the Pentagon is sharing with reporters -- Fred. WHITFIELD: Okay, of course, we're wishing him well.

It is a megachurch right in the heart of Houston, Texas, very, very the diverse congregation.This apparently was shortly before the Hispanic language portion of the day. There is a Spanish service at 03:00 p.m. and one of the parishioners told our affiliate, KPRC, that they were in the church ready for it all to begin. They started hearing multiple shots. The usher told them to run. Now, we do know that the sheriff of Harris County has said that that he believes that the shooter is down. He is on the way to the scene. We know the public information officers for the police department are on their way also, but the latest we have is that there is a family reunification area that they are asking all parishioners to go, all family members to go at the Lifetime Fitness Center. It is in the Gateway Plaza area, right there in Houston, Texas -- Fredricka.",

That we actually just simply don't know right now. And the cameras are going to show us a lot.These facilities are -- you know, have layered defenses. This is a lot of people go in and out in a very short period of time. And so it's not just the cameras, it is -- it is personnel are deployed at various areas. They work with state, local, and federal law enforcement in terms of training and preparedness and evacuation routes, you saw a little bit of that today. These are these are I hate to make the comparison, but these are sort of Super Bowl of churches, when you have that many people in a single site who are -- who are praying, who are not there for interrupt -- you know, are not expecting to be to be victims of a shooting. There is a lot of preplanning that goes into it and this facility is known for that. So, we'll find out exactly what happened. But there was a deputy on site and therefore, he minimized the threat.",
