Jason, thanks so much for coming on CNN NEWS CENTRAL and sharing part of your afternoon with us. I'm wondering when what went through your mind when you found out you won the primary in American Samoa? JASON PALMER (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I knew that there was a lot of support from the people in American Samoa because I'd done multiple virtual meetings with them. My team on the ground was keeping me updated with pictures that seemed to come in every 30 minutes of new signs that were being put up and new people they had talked to who were interested in my campaign and what I could do for the island. I think it really was the first time that a presidential candidate really took American Samoa seriously and listened to the people and responded to their needs.",

I wasn't just focused on American Samoa.I actually am on the ballot in 16 states and territories, and we're looking at adding additional states and territories, too, now that we have this win under our belt. I mean, as you know, two thirds of Americans and two thirds of Democrats say that they want a younger candidate. They want someone who's in tune with them on Gaza, on immigration, on investing more in the American people. And if you look on my Web site, you know, it's all about building a new color economy, restoring the American dream for young people, actually addressing the crisis in Gaza differently. I would not have vetoed those U.N. resolutions.

He could do that in a month. He could do that at the convention. Now, that said, he may continue to run for president. And if he does, then I will support him because I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is. And I voted for Joe Biden four years ago. I just don't think he's the best president for our times right now. I do want to also take this moment to mention that I will be co- founding a new organization in the next few weeks. This will be the first time that I'm mentioning it. We need to actually pull the country together. And in fact, that's going to be the name of the organization \"Together!\" -- with an exclamation point. And its goal will be to try to rally independents and young people to the cause of taking back our government, having it be radical common sense, actually passing bipartisan legislation, none of this constant government shutdown and continuing resolutions. We actually need to address these problems. And this is going to be an important part of what I do over the summer while continuing to campaign for president.",

State lawmakers are set to hold a key vote this afternoon after Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are unborn children, throwing many families' plans into chaos. Three of the state's fertility clinics put IVF treatments on hold almost immediately because of the huge threat of liability. This new law would protect patients and providers from that legal liability.Joining us now is Dr. Beth Malizia. She's a fertility specialist and co-owner of Alabama Fertility, which has paused some IVF treatments. Doctor, thanks so much for being with us. When this bill becomes law, we understand you're ready to begin procedures immediately. Is that right? DR. BETH MALIZIA, CO-OWNER, ALABAMA FERTILITY: That's correct, yes, we have patients who are anxiously waiting this news, hopefully later this afternoon, and they're already teed up on medications and we're ready. We're ready to go. We're ready to take care of our patients as we always have been.",

Have you been in contact with any of them, what their plans are? MALIZIAit slowly trickled in and made us reevaluate exactly what we were doing and make sure we're staying safe for our patients in our clinic. So we put a couple of our specific treatments for IVF on hold. Each patient received a call from their doctor specifically. So we made lots of phone calls. We modified patients' plans individually to try to ensure that we were giving them the best opportunities and gave them some choices. I personally have only one patient that has decided to go out of state, but I totally respect that decision and I think patients need to do what's best for them.",

And so, there are ways -- I was talking to a state legislator earlier -- there are ways in which he believes that there could be loopholes and that patients could once again be targeted.So I'm wondering to opponents of IVF in Alabama and beyond, what would you say to them about the procedure? What would you say is perhaps their essential misunderstanding about what it is that you do for families?",

You know, remarkably, regardless of patients affiliation regarding any of their religious or political affiliation, most patients and even just, you know, members of the community are supportive of IVF.There was a poll done of GOP voters in Alabama showing 81 percent support IVF and fertility treatments. So I think hopefully across the board, this is something that's supported more than it is opposed. And then the second thing, to answer your question, is that this is a conversation that we have every single day with patients in our office. We take into consideration all of their concerns. We want to provide their care in a way that they are comfortable. We are not creating embryos for the use of discard. We are creating embryos to have the opportunity for patients to grow their family in a healthy way. So all of the things that are sort of discussed out there, I would love to have those things reviewed with physicians who do this day to day. A lot of the concerns that people have are about things that we're already doing. We're already talking to patients about -- we have lots of things that are helping us through that.

He didn't answer the question, but he did say they're seeking whether or not there are guardrails that they could put in place in Georgia law, if there's any Georgia law, state law that Fani Willis broke. Now, let's be clear, there's no allegations at all whatsoever that Fani Willis broke any state laws, but that's what the committee here says that they're investigating. And they have the power to make Fani Willis' life a lot more complicated and difficult. They do not have the power to remove her, but they do have subpoena power to get people to testify under oath. And that's what we saw today, defense attorney Ashley Merchant testifying, you know, basically reiterating her argument as to why she believes Fani Willis should be disqualified from this case. And those claims largely went unchallenged by the majority Republican committee. We did catch up with one of the Democrats on the committee who called this hearing today silly and said that the Republicans are continuing on with political literature and that they just want to keep this story in the news. We should mention also, not only does this committee not have the power to remove Fani Willis, but the recommendation of what to do next will come long after Judge Scott McAfee makes his decision. Remember, he said last week he expects to order -- or give his order in this case of whether Willis should be disqualified in the next two weeks -- Brianna.",
