This is -- this is a good example of how things can -- can very quickly spiral out of control in the region. Fortunately, I think our administration has exercised some patience in terms of responding to this.

More now from Patrick Oppmann. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Residents run for their lives in Chile. Firefighters wave them forward, away from the ferocious flames burning behind them. Witnesses say it was a terrifying night. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): There was smoke. The sky turned black. Everything was dark. The wind felt like a hurricane. It was like being in hell. OPPMANN (voice-over): Daylight didn't bring much relief. Neighborhoods were still smoldering when some residents returned to find their homes gutted, workshops ruined, and some people reported seeing bodies lying in the streets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Look, there's nothing left of my house. Nothing, as you can see. The neighbor across the street could not leave. He burned to death, because he did not want to leave to abandon his house. OPPMANN (voice-over): Many of those who did evacuate were trapped in traffic jams and highways, with burning ashes raining down on their vehicles. Chilean officials say it's one of the deadliest wildfires on record in the country. And many of the fires are still active, with tens of thousands of hectares of land burned in the South and central parts of the country. Chilean President Gabriel Boric has declared a state of emergency and deployed additional military units to help battle the flames. A curfew is also in place in some towns to allow authorities to focus on battling the blazes and to bringing emergency supplies. But the losses are just beginning to be counted. A popular botanical garden has been razed, and some residents say many areas near it have yet to be reached by emergency services. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): So far, no one has come. We're alone here in the middle of nowhere. You can see how the house has been abandoned, totally disintegrated. We need them to come and remove the bodies of our relatives. That's all we ask. OPPMANN (voice-over): Authorities say extremely hot temperatures are complicating conditions to fight the fires. At least one person has been detained so far in connection with the blazes, who officials say was doing welding work when a fire accidentally broke out and spread in nearby grasslands.

If you are a small aircraft operator, it is going to be nothing but IFR conditions. As a matter of fact, it is ill-advised that you go either boating or in an aircraft, On some of the roads and you're headed up into the mountains, it could be extraordinarily difficult. We saw right around San Francisco, all the way down towards Salinas and into Monterey, where there was copious amounts of wet weather. We just saw from that video. Now this is transitioning a little bit further towards the South. This is what we're looking at: one to two inches of rainfall per hour. And this is going to be a 24- to 48-hour event. This is going to linger. That's what makes it so devastating. If you are living in some of these South-facing beaches or Western- facing beaches in these beautiful Southern California counties, this is going to be fairly treacherous. Point conception just about there. We're looking at wave heights between 18 and 22 feet. This is so powerful. And a lot of this is long stretch of moistures, fairly warm. So these coastal areas are going to see round after round after round of fairly continuous rainfall. Where you see this red shaded area, that's where we have flash flood warnings out. Ventura; also San Luis Obispo, L.A. counties. Those are going to be some of the hardest hit areas. And I took a look at some of the reports, and they are forecasting nearly ten inches of rain for Pasadena. That is almost the entire amount that they would expect for a year. The same for Los Angeles. For downtown Los Angeles in a year, about 12 inches of rainfall. From this particular event and the one we saw last year, there's going to be about nine to ten inches accumulation of rainfall. Twelve inches is what you see for about a year. So this has tremendous impact. Where you see this purple shaded area, excessive rainfall risk, only a handful of days out of the year. We'll see a flash flood, threat of a high level. But it is responsible for more than 80 percent of the flood damage. And a good majority of the injuries and fatalities associated with flooding events. Now, I'll be back coming up in the next hour to tell you more about this flooding threat, but also heavy snowfall, high winds.

There's a disagreement as to whether that security guard fell or not. It was raining out. This is not a significant thing.The funny thing is Killer Mike won a couple of Grammys, and this overshadows it. In the hip hop world, any altercation with the police is a plus side. This is a minor kerfuffle.",

Well, we have to talk about one of the biggest winners of the night, Taylor Swift, adding to her Grammy collection.Interestingly, we have to point out that in 2010, after Taylor Swift performed at the Grammys, you wrote, \"Taylor Swift can't sing,\" and you added that, \"Did Taylor Swift kill her career overnight? I'll argue she did.\" So are you eating your words today, given her career is soaring, she's breaking records, she's making records.",

Today, a faux pas is immediately forgotten, and you have the narrow vertical of your fanbase.Never has anybody this big, known by fewer people. You talk about the \"Fast Car\" Luke Combs duet. They pan to the audience. Everybody on the floor, which is (UNINTELLIGIBLE), was singing \"Fast Car.\" There was not an equivalent with any other song. Prior to the Internet, especially from the '80s and '90s, the MTV era, we had a monoculture. So I challenge people in your office right now to sing even one song from \"Midnights.\" I am not making a judgment as to the quality. It's just this was the problem with the show itself. It made it like we live in a monoculture when we do not. The overall market share of the so-called hits, this Spotify top 50, is actually going down. So kudos to Taylor Swift. But you can ignore and live your life quite fine.",

And people started talking about their records.I'm not saying the Grammys have that much gravitas, but she hijacked them to ill effect. Her fans will be thrilled. Everybody else, why did you have to rain on everybody's parade and hype yourself when everybody else is getting into the moment? As far as those chart numbers, I don't like as -- she already wrote one song about me. But the charts in America are different from a lot of other charts. Physical means more, such that if you sell vinyl, you can manipulate being No. 1. Don't confuse the recorded success of Taylor Swift with that of the Beatles. Forget the statistics. The Beatles, the Stones, everybody in the world knew who they were. Everybody knew their songs. The times are different. There's nobody bigger than Taylor Swift. In this past year, Morgan Wallen in the U.S., a country artist, actually had more recorded success. His record was in the top ten for a year. But it's a different landscape.",

In the pre telecast, where they have, like, the other 90 categories, there was a victory for \"Barbie\" for her and from some other ones.These votes -- since they expanded the categories, you can win the award with 18 percent of the vote.
