He said he did that because he knew that if he didn't do it, that no one else would, and that was his primary concern.It is one of the few stories out of this that you have seen that has been just one small, gleaming hope out of everything that we've heard coming out of Israel. Of course, we will continue to cover it all here on CNN. Hopefully, we will have him on so you can hear from him himself about that. Right now, CNN News Night with Abby Phillip starts.",

She held these children. These gunmen took her house to house, trying to you -- told her what to say to other families who are hiding in their homes, trying to get them to come out of their homes. So, they could either kidnap them as well or shoot them. We don't know. Few of the families would actually come out despite her pleas at the hands of these Hamas gunmen. They then began to bring her into Gaza, walk her into Gaza carrying these small children. And then for reasons, she still doesn't quite know, they let her go and they let her leave with the children.

The Israelis could very, very quickly build up that force. They've drafted some 300,000 reservists into duty. And this is why a ground incursion and continued airstrikes could be so deadly because this is so incredibly dense. I've been in this -- in Gaza during the wars in 2012 and 2014. There are -- it's a maze of roads, of refugee camps, of high rises, people really packed together. You have some 2 million Palestinians living here. Around half of them are children in just 140 square miles. And so civilians will almost certainly be killed as this Israeli offensive continues.

This is a drone image that was taken, that is the before of a satellite image, now obviously completely in ruin, completely destroyed. And then this is the third mosque, the Yasin mosque, in the same refugee camp. Why is Israel targeting mosques? Well, they claim, as they have in past conflicts, that Hamas is using civilian infrastructure, whether it be residential buildings or even mosques, they're holiest places, to hide their forces, but mainly their weapons.

She was super confident. I called her everytime and she would be like, hey, don't worry, I'm in the shelter, I'm fine. Like nothing will happen. Just make sure that you're okay, that you're all good. And those were also her last messages. She was always an optimistic person. She really loved her community, the kibbutz and just besides what just happened to her, everything that community has gone through, the murder of the families at their homes, babies, the kidnapping of 70, 80-year old women who just had surgeries and stuff like that. Those are all personal stories I know from my grandmother's, like neighbors. And I cannot imagine how those families feel right now when they have complete uncertainty of their family members and where they are as your previous guests have spoken about.",

But you know, I'm just getting all those people from Israel just writing me, please post this and post that, post about my sister, about my father, my grandmother is missing, my little sister, my baby, my, you know, horrific stories from this massacre, from the party, from the kibbutz, from everywhere. And I decided to dedicate myself to -- posted on my social media so the world can hear and know what is going on, that this is not a freedom fighter. This is not about liberation of the Palestinian people. These are monsters. This is Daesh, ISIS. This is like a second Holocaust. And that's why everybody in Israel calling it the second Holocaust, because that's what happening right now. They're slaughtering our families, our women, our babies, they kidnapped little kids. You heard it from, you know, from everywhere, but I want to, I want to have, I want to have my social media and everywhere here in the States, in the world, so people can hear about that.

It's also watching for signs that this conflict could ignite further hostilities across the broader region.In an extraordinary show of solidarity, President Biden, along with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the U.K. released a joint statement condemning Hamas and its appalling acts of terrorism. And also tonight, the Biden administration told CNN that there are no plans right now to put U.S. boots on the ground. But it is sending a show of force, deploying the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier to the Eastern Mediterranean in a message to any groups considering fanning the flames of a broader regional conflict. And with me now is Morgan Ortagus, the former State Department spokesperson and also Klon Kitchen. He's a former intelligence officer. Thank you both for joining us on a historic week here for the world. Morgan, this concern about a broader conflict is very real. We've already seen some movement from Hezbollah in response to Israel's limited Israeli strikes. How big of a concern should that be right now for the world?",

You obviously have in the South, in Gaza, where Israel is going and has started today, their response to Hamas and their attempt to root the terrorist threat out of Gaza.Of course, in the North, when you look at Hezbollah in Lebanon, this is sort of what Iran does in the region. You know, Iran doesn't like to directly confront. They like to use various Shia proxy groups. So, whether it's Hezbollah in Lebanon, there were Shia militia groups in Iraq in the last administration that were attacking our embassy. They like to do this through the Houthis in Yemen. They like to fund, train, and equip terror groups to spread their influence and their ideology. And the one thing that all of these countries have in common that are under Iranian influence is really in many ways, they're almost failed states. You know, these are not the crown jewels anymore of the Middle East, Lebanon, Syria, places that used to be where you wanted to go and travel to in the Middle East. And sadly, under Iranian influence, we have just seen them decay in terms of civil society and government infrastructure.",

      "sentences": "Well, it makes the whole situation much more dangerous. So, Iran, historically, exercises much more significant control and influence with Hezbollah.And previous engagements between Hezbollah and Israel in various intifadas have showed that Hezbollah is very capable. They have done a lot of damage to Israeli armored personnel carriers and other tanks and that kind of thing. And it's been a real tactical problem for Israel in the past. So, if they were to get formally involved, it means two things. One, a more dangerous enemy, and two, a much more significant risk of a -- expansion of the conflict through the region. Because what Tehran is likely going to intend to do, they are absolutely going to be stoking Hezbollah into that type of posture. Because what they want to do is provoke a wider conflict so that they can ultimately bring the United States into the conflict, as well. Morgan, as we speak here, there's no U.S. Speaker of the House. There's a rift in the Republican Party over funding Ukraine. And I saw today some analysts raising the possibility that it is in Russia's interest for this conflict to kick off in the Middle East, that it'll strain U.S. resources. Where do you think this all goes? First of all, will Republicans need to get their act together sooner? And do you think you can count on this Congress to properly fund both conflicts, Ukraine and also backfill Israel here?",

And I think you have seen a number of Republicans, especially those in the Senate, call on Republicans in the House to make a decision, decide who is going to be speaker. There's also a number of confirmations that are up in the Senate, including the ambassador to Israel.And other diplomatic positions around the world I know is very frustrating. The last administration tonight get our ambassadors are our assistant secretaries confirmed. I think that needs to stop on both sides of the aisle in Congress and get these people through these key positions to, you know for the President. And as it as it relates to you know where we where we're headed in this in the Congress in terms of funding and payment, you know, historically that the United States Congress has funded Israel's security needs, security assistance on bipartisan levels. In fact, when President Herzog was here in Washington just a few months ago, I went to the Congress. And one of the things I thought was so encouraging is that you saw Republicans and Democrats who are not agreeing on anything lately standing up and giving multiple standing ovations to President Herzog, the president of Israel. So, I am hopeful that there is going to be support for Israel. But we also have to get our own munitions going here in the United States. You know, we need to reinvigorate our factories here, our production lines. We have to get Americans doing this. And we're woefully unprepared.",
