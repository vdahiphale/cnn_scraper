      "sentences": "A counterpunch as the president races to save his campaign. That's tonight on NewsNight.Good evening. I'm Abby Philip in New York. And I want to get right to it tonight. In just a few moments, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus will join me live on his group's critical meeting with the president just a short time ago. But here is the backdrop that we face as a country. The president is now defiant. He's launching an all-out offensive as conversations intensify among Democrats about replacing him over conversations about questions about his mental fitness. Now, today alone, he called into a morning show, he sent a letter to House Democrats, he spoke with his donors, he chatted with black lawmakers, and Biden's message is that he's not going anywhere. He says that he's fine, there's nothing to see here. And he continues to insist that he is the only one who can beat Donald Trump. He's even daring Democrats to challenge him at the convention. But what is interesting about how this is playing out are the sides in this fight. He's getting support from progressives. These are the very same people who preferred someone else in the last Democratic primary. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she says today she's all in. Ditto for Ayanna Pressley, who says Democrats have lost the plot here. And even Ilhan Omar, who says it is vital that Biden is re-elected. But the ones who aren't so sure are the moderates. These are Biden's go-to people in the halls of his old stomping ground. Senator Mark Warner says Biden needs to do more to be more aggressive. Patty Murray says Biden must consider his legacy in the steps that are ahead. Brian Schatz says there should be an open debate. The vulnerable Jon Tester, he's essentially saying, don't tell me, show me. And so far, it's a tough go for Biden and his White House. Just moments ago, the White House released a letter from the president's doctor trying to put to bed a press conference dust up over why a Parkinson's expert was on the White House grounds eight times in a span of eight months. Basically, the letter says that there is nothing to see here in those visits and that the president did not see a neurologist outside of his normal annual physical. The White House would not say that earlier this afternoon during a press briefing that became incredibly combative with reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Has the president been treated for Parkinson's? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No, he's not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson's? No. I'm not going to confirm a specialist, any specialist that comes to the White House. I am not sharing, confirming names from here. It is a security reason. I am not going to do that, Ed. It doesn't matter how hard you push me. It doesn't matter how angry you get with me. I'm not going to confirm a name. It doesn't matter if it's even in the log. I am not going to do that from here. But I am telling you that he has seen a neurologist three times while he has been in his presidency. That's what I'm saying. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, M.J., you raise an important point. I mean, the story has been floating around for some time. Those visitor records are out there. It is a little surprising that the White House would wait until it becomes a firestorm to release what seems to be pretty basic information about what this neurological specialist was doing there. M.J., thank you for joining us on all of that.I want to get straight to CNN's Medical Analyst, Dr. Jonathan Reiner. He is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. Dr. Reiner what do you make of this explanation both in the letter that was released from the White House tonight and also just how we even got here. Why they couldn't simply say that Dr. Cannard was there to consult about all the other hundreds of military service members who support the White House on a daily basis? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Right. It shows how I think defensive the White House has become about the health of the president. We know that the president has been seen by a neurologist, presumably Dr. Cannard, but, certainly, not definitely, at least once this year, because Dr O'Connor described the visit in his annual report in February, in which he basically stated that they did not think the president had evidence of Parkinson's disease. But this whole, you know, story over the last day about Parkinson's disease is kind of a distraction in one way, but it's also emblematic of a perception that there's a lack of transparency in the White House as it pertains to the president's health. And I think the best way for the White House to move forward and, you know, create some trust perhaps with the public and the press perhaps about the health of the president would be just to basically have a press conference with some of the medical staff, let the reporters with the president's permission ask questions to his healthcare providers and just move on. I mean, this is this is a presidential election, but yet we're focusing on the president's health rather than on the policy. It's a gigantic distraction.",

And one can argue that what was witnessed by the country ten days ago does constitute sort of a constellation of symptoms, and that would be worthy of at least some kind of evaluation.And, again, it's one thing for, for a, you know, sort of a random patient to suggest that to me. It's another thing entirely for the current president and candidate for another term of presidency of the United States to demonstrate symptoms like that certainly should be evaluated in a formal setting, at least once and then put that to rest.",

We have 60 members, the largest in our history. We represent a third of the U.S. population collectively, more than 120 million Americans, some 20 million Black Americans. And the president was clear that he is in this race. We have one objective and that is to win, because it's about a choice between the chaos and extremism of Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress versus civility and experience with President Biden and Vice President Harris and Democrats who are focused on lifting up the American people, protecting our freedoms, our rights, and our opportunities that would be eroded under a second term of Donald Trump.",

Biden is not in a position to run an effective campaign for the next four months. If I'm Donald Trump, I'm really afraid that Joe Biden will get out. I mean, a theme through the four years of this administration has been that Kamala Harris' polling had been worse than the president's going through. You would have a poll with a horse race with Trump and Biden and the one with Trump and Harris and Harris would run worse. I don't think that's true anymore. I think it's clear now from what polling we've seen after the after the debates that the Democrats will be stronger if they replace Biden, whether with Harris or with a different candidate. And I think, you know, in a way, it would be the best possible introduction of Kamala Harris as the candidate for Democrats, because attention would be drawn to her contrast with Joe Biden. There's all this focus on Joe Biden as old and declining, and the first thing people would see and think about Kamala Harris is she's young, she's energetic, she seems like she's in appropriate age to be president. It's a good comparison with Biden, and it's also a good comparison with Trump. And so I think at this point, At this point, it's clear that she's a better candidate.

We, of course, will support the inarticulate candidate over the criminal. But this process, this whole debate aftermath, we just stood back and looked at it and said that everybody's debating which is the least bad option. And I think there's a real opportunity here, if we choose to pursue it, and it really is Joe Biden's decision, to showcase a deep bench of talent that has a future perspective, young, dynamic, up-and-coming talent that can paint a picture of a better future.

It's his decision.I think he could go down in history right alongside George Washington. He could do what he said he was going to do, which is to be a bridge to the next generation. And he could push the party and the country to do so much more than we do today and move past a really dismal, dispiriting set of discussions where we are locked in on whose past is worse than whose past and whose golf game is worse. I mean, it's -- it's there's the country's hungry for a proposal that pushes us to think ahead instead of quibble about the past. And, you know, the stakes couldn't be higher. So, we're hoping that Jill and Joe Biden are watching this. They call us tomorrow and say, tell us more. Oh, my gosh, I could be a hero. They won't do that. It's probably not going to happen.

A majority of Democrats, 54 percent, say, yes, he should, in fact, stay in.Now, there is this substantial minority here, 39 percent, who say he should quit. But again, the clear majority of Democratic voters say that Joe Biden should stay in this race. And I want us to look back at a little bit of history, right, of other incumbents who actually quit the presidential race, all right? So, let's take a look at choice for nominee when incumbents quit, 1952, Harry S. Truman quit. Look at this. He was getting just 31 percent of the vote and a potential Democratic primer against Estes Kefauver, who is, in fact, leading that race with 35 percent of the vote. How about in 1968, Lyndon Baines Johnson quit that race? Look at this. He was trailing with just 41 percent of the vote. RFK, Sr. is getting 44 percent of the vote. At this point, the majority of Democrats want Joe Biden to stay in the race. And when we look back to the past, when incumbents quit, in fact, the majority of Democrats were not for them.

Truman dropped out. There was 148 days when Lyndon Baines Johnson dropped out. Look at how many days there are now. There are just 42 days until the Democratic National Convention. There is nothing like this in history with either Harry S. Truman or Lyndon Baines Johnson. This is very, very different.Of course, the thing I will note, Democratic primary electorate is one thing. But in terms of the general election, look at this point. Donald Trump is ahead by three points. That's very different than what we saw in either early July of 2020 or even Biden's worst polling position in 2020. Fact is, Joe Biden may be liked by Democrats.
