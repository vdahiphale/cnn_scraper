And I think there's a lot of questions, a grumbling among Kevin McCarthy's coalition right now of whether he failed to take this threat seriously enough over the past month and a half as he was projecting confidence. You know, the talks that they're having now where he's sending emissaries to seriously listen to his detractors and try to figure out what they want and find a way to accommodate them, why wasn't that happening for the past month and a half because it seemed like yesterday there were more no votes for Kevin McCarthy on the floor than people expected going in. He's - he was losing support and that was why he decided to come off the floor. And so I think today you're going to -- there is going to be a lot of those conversations. They're going on right now. They're going to be going on until the House comes in at noon. And as Doug said, you know, anything can happen. We are in uncharted territory. There is pretty - there -- we are already in a situation that -- where nobody knows what could happen. Anything can happen.

The warden here at the Monroe County Correctional Facility has confirmed with us on the record he is no longer -- Bryan Kohberger is no longer in this facility. He is now in the custody of the Pennsylvania State Police. That's what we know. That is all we know.They are being very tight-lipped of when he will go to Idaho, when he -- how he will get to Idaho, and this is because of safety concerns. But we can confirm he is no longer here in Monroe County, northeastern Pennsylvania. He is in the custody of the Pennsylvania State Police at this point. Now, it wasn't even 24 hours ago that he was in court right here in northeastern Monroe County, Pennsylvania. One interesting thing we learned was about his mental state. And this is important because the mental state may become an aspect of the defense once this case and the discovery gets going. He was asked by the judge -- and it was in relation to whether you are voluntarily, freely wanting to be extradited back to Idaho, and she asked him, have you had any mental diagnoses or are you on any medication that could make you not be able to give a lucid, free and voluntary answer, and he said, no, I'm not. So that's in regard to his mental state. Right now, not at the time of any crime that took place, but right now he says there is no mental diagnoses in his background. You know, yesterday, his family was in court. I was sitting right behind them. And they were very emotional. I mean, very emotional. His mother, when she heard that he would be extradited back to Idaho to face four homicide charges, she just sort of collapsed into her daughter's shoulder. And it was -- they brought out the Kleenex. He kept looking at his family when he could. But it was interesting. And the fact is, the prosecutor in this county does have that probable cause affidavit that was sealed, but the chief public defender, his sole representative here, told me he never got it. Jim.

There's the actual order itself, a judge saying, yes, go arrest this person, but there's what's called the Probable Cause Affidavit. This is the rich detail that the officer or the agent puts in there to say, you know, this is why we know this suspect is the person who committed these alleged crimes.And, you know, they have to get into evidence. They have to actually convince this judge that, yes, this person should be under arrest. Now, interestingly, under Idaho law, that document, this affidavit, can't be released until Kohberger is physically back in the state of Idaho. But here's one thing that I think we'll have to watch and, you know, the police chief there in Idaho said that he expects that this document will be released very quickly. He's not the only stakeholder here. The prosecutor there is the one who will actually have to take this to trial if there's not a plea.

I mean imagine if you needed an antibiotic, and the only way you could get it would be to go to a hospital or clinic or doctor's office. And that's really what this situation was for these - this drug in particular, Mifepristone, for almost the last 20 years. Essentially that's where a woman would have to go. And over the course of the pandemic, they eased that a little bit to say that she could have a tele-health visit and get it sent to her via a mail-order certified pharmacy. But now to be able to say, you don't have to have an in-person visit, you do still need a prescription, and you can go to your local pharmacy, brick and mortar pharmacy and pick this up, as long as that pharmacy is certified, there's no question that's going to help a lot of women obtain these drugs easier.",

And the way it works is essentially it prevents the body from being able to use the hormone progesterone, which is important to maintain pregnancy, it also dilates the cervix. And then after you take that dose of the Mifepristone, about 24 to 48 hours later, you take a different medication called Misoprostol, and that basically causes uterine cramping and expelling of any tissue.So, this is really - this is going to be a big step. Certainly not for women in many of the states where we do have restrictions and bans, but for women who live in those other states that do no, I think we're going to see potential changes hopefully by some of the big pharmacies that may be, you know, adding this and also doctors who are increasing prescribing this because they don't have to have it stocked in their office.",
