I spoke to the person that shot one of those videos that we showed, the video of her walking out of her living room. She says she was having lunch when she heard this noise that sounded like a drone and she decided to go out to her balcony to see what that was about. And she saw the plane starting to spiral down.She said she just walked right back inside and she crouched. She said, Julia, I did it like I saw in the movies. You know, you're supposed to stay safe. You just crouch down and go under the table. That's what she did. That was her reflex. She also brought her animals inside with her and she just started to pray. That area that you see in the video, that's her next door neighbor. That's where the smoke is coming from. That's where the fire is coming from. At least a part of the airplane seems to have fallen there, she said. That's what she saw. But right now, all of the streets are closed off. Authorities are on the scene, firefighters, medics, police, to try and make sense of it all. We did hear from President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva that all the 62 people on board, the passengers and crew, are dead or appeared to be dead. We're still waiting on more confirmation. If there were other people injured when the plane hit the ground, I know we have now geolocated all the videos that we're showing you so we know exactly where that happened, but we still don't know the impact that that had in that community. Now, the woman who shot that video, she told me right now everyone is just praying that everyone is well. We know that this is going to have a massive impact, and in the hours to come, we're going to get a better sense of what it all means. We do have a statement from Voepass, the airline that the airport - airplane belonged to - they said that they confirmed the accident, the occurrence of the accident involving that flight. It was leaving from Cascavel, Parana. That's just one state over from Sao Paulo, Guarulhos, where it was headed. That's Brazil's largest airport, busiest airport that it was going to, and it crashed just about eight minutes before it was supposed to land. So it gives you an idea of how close this city, this town of Vinhedo, is to one of, you know, the major city of Brazil. And just south of that, that's where President Lula was when he made that announcement. Voepass said that they are using all means to support the people involved. At the time, they said that they don't have confirmation of how many people were killed or survived in that crash. But as you heard from the president, we're expecting everyone on board to have lost their lives.",

I do want to let our viewers know that we are getting some new video in of the wreckage of this plane crash just outside of Sao Paulo. You can see this is just adjacent, I mean, really just yards from where this plane crashed. And you can see just how populated this area is, homes very close to each other.So there is certainly a risk, even as we know that 62 people on board this plane have died, there is a risk, of course, that people on the ground as well have been injured or may have perished in this and we are awaiting some information on that. Of course, the hope is that as people did see this plane falling, maybe they were able to get some sort of warning from their neighbors. We don't know. We're certainly waiting for news on that. I do want to go now to CNN Transportation Analyst Mary Schiavo.

      "sentences": "Well, there are so many clues in that video. And just like you, when I first saw it, I was questioning whether this was accurate or not. But, you know, sadly, I've worked other crashes where this has happened. This is clearly a stall, what's called an aerodynamic stall. There's not enough air speed and air flowing over the wings to keep the plane in the sky.At this point where we see it in the video where the plane is falling, the pilots would have had no ability to control that plane, so they could not have directed it away from houses or populated areas. When you're at that point in the fall, you have lost all control and controllability and surfaces of the aircraft. And we also heard, very, you know, good to note - to listen because we also note that the engines are still running, so the plane did not stall, did not lose its air speed because it lost its engines. We've now also learned that throughout most of the flight, the plane was flying in a hundred percent humidity and below freezing temperatures, which is very significant for this kind of aircraft, which is something called an ATR 72, which is not, you know, a popular thing in the United States anymore because it had a problem in icing. Now, they still fly in the Caribbean and other places. There's a smaller model called an ATR 42, but there were a number of crashes and accidents in the U.S. because of the de-icing systems. There was criticism that they weren't robust enough, that it didn't cover enough of the plane, that it couldn't handle a tough icing condition. So it's possible that there are two systems, anti-icing and de-icing, so because of the weather information we now have, people will want to consider that as well, and pilots are trained to respond to the stall. But given that they were coming in, they were already at about 17,000 feet, so they must have been descending, getting ready to land, they might not have had enough altitude and enough time, literally, to try to recover or one of those systems may not have been robust enough or might not have been working enough to get rid of that icing. And I've been in icing conditions in a small plane, it's terrifying, and you don't have a lot of choices if your anti-ice and de-ice can't handle it, you can descend and try to get out of the ice or climb and try to get out of the ice. But if you're coming in to land, you're just about out of time. I think they were eight minutes out of the airport. It's very close to the ground.",

He's also the creator of the political docuseries, \"The Circus.\"Great to have both of you here with us. Thanks so much for being here. Mark, I just want to start first with you because it is noticeable the tone and tenor of these campaigns now that Harris is at the top of the Democratic ticket are very, very different. And we do see Trump getting back on the campaign trail. He's going to Montana where a safe state for him in that presidential race, but that Senate race could be a big one.

And it's interesting that they're in Arizona today. Ron, I remember when I did my very first Trump rally, and it was in Arizona in late 2015. And I went down there and there were - it was the middle of the day, 110 degrees and lines around the block. But now that's happening with Harris and Walz.

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I mean, you know, heading into the decision by the President Biden to step aside, there was an enthusiasm. It wasn't even a gap. It was a chasm. You know, in some polling, the share of Republicans who said they were very enthusiastic about voting was 25 points higher than among Democrats and now that has narrowed and virtually disappeared.Trump has a passionate base. I mean, there's no question about that. And that base - he has shown both in 2016 and 2020 that he can get that base to show up on Election Day. But there is, I think, what Mark was referring to underway, which is, you know, when Harris says we're not going back, that argument exists on two levels. I mean, in the most immediate level, she's talking about the rollback of rights on abortion and other issues that's been engineered in red states and at the Supreme Court. But I think there's something deeper there, too, that he's alluding to, which is that we're not going back to necessarily the highly conflicted, you know, intensely polarized politics of the last decade. And that may help explain why she is polling so well among independents who have been pretty skeptical of the Biden administration. Just a desire to turn the page, we'll see if that can carry her all the way to November, but it's real.",

So, you know, this convention, I think, is more consequential for her than for any nominee in either party, at least, since Bill Clinton in 1992. And the reason is she is the first major party nominee who was not an incumbent president, who didn't spend a year and a half running around the country getting bruises and triumphs in primaries.You know, I think both sides agree that impressions of her, positive or negative, at this point are pretty shallow. So there is more opportunity than usual at the moment of the convention to kind of draw on a blank piece of paper. I mean, what has to concern Republicans is that her favorable ratings are now significantly better than Trump's or Biden's with the convention coming up and the opportunity to tell her story to voters who know less about her than they typically know about a nominee at this point. Now, the risk, of course, is that Republicans have been kind of casting around for how they want to describe her, but I do think they're heading toward a message of - that she is dangerously liberal and weak and won't keep you safe. And so there is a lot more at stake, I think, in the kind of back and forth that happens around the convention than is often the case simply because impressions of her are so more loosely formed than they usually are for a candidate this late into the year.",

They prepared everything, the resources they're planning, their strategy for Joe Biden, and now it's a completely different script.And the compressed time schedule is really interesting, as Ron was pointing out. He's one of the smartest guys in politics, and he's right. But I think when we look back, if Harris wins, well, it'll turn out that this compressed schedule was a huge advantage for Harris because, again, as Ron pointed out, they didn't have a whole year of battering and bruising Harris, which normally would have been the case. And also, they don't have their Republican convention. They wasted that completely, that whole time, attacking the wrong candidate. And now Harris has had this rollout and dominated nearly every single news cycle since she announced, and that's going to go right on through the convention where they will dominate coverage for, you know, almost a period of month going into September. So they're winning, you know, nine out of 10 news cycles and dominating the coverage.
