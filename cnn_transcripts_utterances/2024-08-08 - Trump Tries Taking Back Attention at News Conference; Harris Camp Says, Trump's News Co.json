Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race. Good evening, I'm Audie Cornish in New York. Abby Phillip is off tonight. So, let's get right to what America is talking about, whether Donald Trump can cut short the Harris campaign's political honeymoon. And Trump had to work to do something he's never had trouble with before, steal the spotlight. And despite this being a very online election, he did it the old fashioned way, taking questions at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago. So, what's interesting is we got a glimpse into how he sees the state of the race. But if it sounds familiar, that's because you might have heard some of these lines before, say on the economy. When we look back to 2016 and 2020 -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D. TRUMP:  You're going to have a depression worldwide, the likes of which you've never seen. If the Democrats get back in, you will have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. We have a lot of bad things coming up. You could end up in a depression of the 1929 variety, which would be a devastating thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

TRUMP:  We have somebody that, in my opinion, is more incompetent. She couldn't pass her Bar exam. She's not smart enough to do a news conference. And I'm sorry, we need smart people to lead this country. In terms of intelligence, Hillary was far superior, Kamala, who, by the way, is worse than Biden. And she's actually not as smart. No, I think she's actually not as smart as he is. I don't think he's very smart either, by the way. (END VIDEO CLIP) S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  You know, what was once a very disciplined Chris LaCivita machine is off kilter and they're sloppy right now. This was sloppy. It wasn't intentional and there are plenty of intentional things that they could do to talk about policy. But what's really important here, this might play to, you know, the MAGA base, although without the clap track, it sounded weirder, but what they need to do is get swing state voters. And swing state voters don't want to be told by a vice presidential candidate to be afraid of childless cat ladies. They want a person to come in and say, you've got a problem, I know what it is and I have a solution, here's what it is. And none of this, Kamala Harris isn't black, none of this is solving a problem that real voters in swing states have, and they're clamoring for solutions. That's why they're undecided.",

And then on the 19th, we're going to have the convention. You have set up beautifully for the Democrats in this honeymoon, this period of events that is happening all the way through the end of the Democratic National Convention. He had to engage and insert himself in some way.Now, I appreciate the talking points of, he sounded diminished and he was off kilter and all of that, but what he did today and the reason we're starting with this at the top of the program is he was able to get back into the debate, which he hasn't had for the last two years.",

And if you can answer that question as resoundingly yes, then we probably need to go to commercial break and take everybody's temperature.And so my point is that today was more of Donald Trump just talking about things that are factually inaccurate, but yet he is not on the campaign trail. He's not engaging voters. And the juxtaposition is someone at the UAW in Detroit, Michigan, versus someone in their lobby spewing lies.

TRUMP:  Well, what's different with my book than any other book that has been written about Donald is I was there during his formative years. He was the first person to put a golf club in my hand. I knew him during his school years. I knew him during his business career. And I knew him during his political career, including being in the White House. The reason it took so long in some people's mind to write the book is that, as you may know, my wife Lisa and I have a young son who has complex disabilities. And during the 2015, '16 campaign, we had dead animals thrown on our lawn, reporters coming up to our house uninvited, and cars in our driveway that we didn't ask to be there. William has recently moved to a group home outside of our home. So, we thought the time was right, A, for us to go with a platform to advocate on behalf of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, but also, you know, the insurrection was a very devastating time for our country, and that really wanted me to tell the story of Donald in a very personal way.",

But one of the reasons why I think the media is saying we're on an online election is because it's very easy to take those short clips and throw them up on the screen.But much the same as when I was in the White House and we were talking about Donald Trump's tweets, I would ask the average person, how did you hear about that tweet? Were you on Twitter? And they'd say, no. We saw it on CNN. We saw it on Fox. We saw it on MSNBC. They saw it or read about the tweet. They didn't actually receive it in the format it was delivered. And I think we're doing the same thing here with Reels, with TikTok and others. The media loves this because it's real easy to throw that clip up there. But it's not where the majority of Americans are getting their news. They're hearing about it from where they do get their news because we're elevating that level of discussion.",
