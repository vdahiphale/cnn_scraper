I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is still counting the votes.We are closing out an extraordinary week in American politics, with plenty still to be decided. Late last night, Democrats learned that they will keep control of the U.S. Senate, after Catherine Cortez Masto held off her Republican challenger in Nevada, and Democrats have the potential to win one more seat with the Georgia run-off in that state next month. In the House, control is still up for grabs with 20 races yet to be called. Republicans must win seven seats to take control, while Democrats need 14. That Democrats have a chance to keep the House at all is sending shockwaves through the GOP, which had expected so much more winning, their disappointing results fueling a fight over who gets to lead their party in the House, the Senate and into 2024. As we wait for the votes to be counted, I will speak with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and get her take on what it's going to take for control of the House, when it is so close right now. But we begin with huge victories for Democrats in key governor's races, as the party rebuilds its swing state blue wall, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all states that went for Trump in 2016, now breaking blue. Let's talk to two of those Democratic governors who beat their opponents with sweeping double-digit margins about how they did it and what it means. Let's begin with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who achieved a truly historic victory, beating her Republican opponent by more than 10 percentage points. Thank you so much.

So we were able to vote -- we were able to talk about how we are working to lower costs and address inflation, whereas folks like Rick Scott and others in the party, they wanted to talk about inflation without articulating a plan.
