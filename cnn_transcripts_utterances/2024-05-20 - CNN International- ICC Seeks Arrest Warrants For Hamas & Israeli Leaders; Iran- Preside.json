If they are agreed to, then they go into effect. But, the real question is, because the ICC does not have law enforcement or apprehending capability, it is up to, in this case, the parties themselves to do that.And again, Israel is a democratic state with an independent judiciary and law enforcement body, obviously, and it could. And he said that if indeed Israeli institutions decide to take this up, then the case would be in their hands. The situation is very different with Hamas because it is very differently organized. It's described as a terrorist organization by Israel, the United States, Europe and others. And as you know, the two top leaders anyway, the military leaders, are believed to be somewhere underground, in tunnels, as this war continues. So, there is that issue. And this is also the first time that leaders of a democratic nation such as Israel have come under an ICC target, if you like, in terms of trying to get arrest warrants for these charges. And this is going to, he said, prove to the world that both by sending out these requests for arrest warrants for both sides, that justice must be blind, and that if we allow these -- this evidence to go unpunished or unheld, unaccountable, then, in his words, it really does help to destroy our species. I mean, that's basically what he said. There is so much at stake here. And remember, this is the same prosecutor who issued actual arrest warrants in 2023 against President Putin and his henchwomen in the illegal abduction of Ukrainian children from areas that Russians had occupied inside Ukraine and taken them back into Ukraine, and very few of them, if any, well, some of them have, but very few of them have been released to their parents.",

Hospital officials there say at least 35 were killed on Sunday in an airstrike that hit a refugee camp in central Gaza. The IDF says two senior Hamas operatives were among those killed in the weekend strikes. Gaza's Health Ministry is reporting the highest daily death toll since mid-April. It says 106 people were killed in military operations within 24 hours. And this comes as the United Nations says the number of people displaced from Rafah in southern Gaza has risen to more than 800,000, after Israeli forces started expanding its aerial strikes into ground attacks in the area. Let me get you the very latest on the developing news out of Iran today, and Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber has held an extraordinary meeting with the heads of the country's legislative and judicial branches following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash. The country's Foreign Minister and seven others were also killed. Iranian media report the aircraft went down in heavy fog in a remote mountainous area of East Azerbaijan province. Iran has announced five days of mourning. (VIDEO PLAYING) Well, the deaths of President Raisi and his Foreign Minister come at a tense moment in Iran and around the wider region. Just a few weeks ago, Iran launched a missile and drone attack in -- on Israel in response to a suspected IDF airstrike in Damascus, Syria. And at home, President Raisi led a crackdown on dissent after protests against clerical rule. Well, the deaths and this gap in Iranian leadership have brought the expected regional reaction.

What we're seeing is an expected outpouring of condolences from various countries, but some of them, for instance, Saudi Arabia, until March 2023, had very rocky relations with Tehran. But, after China negotiated or brokered a reestablishment of ties, we've seen a ties between Riyadh and Tehran get ever closer. So, Saudi Arabia was one of the first to come out to express their condolences on the death of President Raisi. In addition, we're seeing that Pakistan, India, the UAE and others doing the same.Now, Lebanon, which has close ties with Iran, officially, has come out in declared three days of mourning. Hezbollah has come out and described Raisi as a big brother lost to that group. The Houthis and Hamas have also expressed their condolences. It's important to keep in mind that Iran may not be the favorite country in the region. Many of its neighbors are worried about its ambitions. But, there is a feeling that the political structure in Iran, which has basically remained intact for the last 45 years, despite intense external and internal pressures, the system has held fairly well, certainly if you compare it with the other countries in the neighborhood. So, the feeling is that even though this was a shock, a very unexpected event, and leaves a rather large hole near the top of the pinnacle of leadership in Iran, fundamentally, the country remains on course.

They are asking questions of Michael Cohen about his interactions with Robert Costello right now.

The whole ballgame, when you call a co-conspirator, someone who has criminal exposure for the charge defense, is to build around that witness a wall of corroboration. That's why you heard from David Pecker. That's why you heard from Stormy Daniels. That's why you're seeing text messages in these audio recordings. The prosecutor wants to argue to this jury, look, Michael Cohen has done some despicable things. He is a convicted liar, but you can count on his testimony because it is consistent with all of that other evidence. I will never predict what a jury will find. It's impossible to know. But, none of this is a surprise to the district attorney. They certainly knew what they were getting when they called Michael Cohen.",

The burden of proof rests with the government. Even if the defense presents a case, the prosecutor may have rebuttal evidence. So, there is more evidentiary showings potentially to be had. But, again, for the prosecutor, they have the burden of proof, a very high standard in American courts. They were aware of all of the problems with the case before they brought the case.

Becky, good to have you this hour. As someone who covers the region so closely, now with 50 days until the elections, I'm curious what you're watching over the next few weeks. Is there any chance based on the conversations you've had that the next leader will not be someone who resembles Raisi in terms of those hardline policies?",
