More than 2,000 people have died, thousands more injured, many of them in critical condition.Emergency teams have been desperately combing through the rubble of flattened homes using picks, as you see there, shovels as well, even their bare hands to search for any signs of life. Earlier, a woman was rescued after being trapped under a collapsed building for about 12 hours. Those who did not survive the disaster are being laid to rest already as tradition dictates. And to honor them, the government says Morocco will observe three days of mourning. The World Health Organization says the disaster has affected more than 300,000 people in Marrakech and the surrounding areas. Locals say the city's world heritage, old city in Medina have seen extensive damage. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And you can see the remains, the glorious remains of its past and now here is much of its present. This devastating earthquake killed 13 people here in Marrakech, mostly here in the Medina, because the city is ancient and it is very tightly packed.There are buildings here that if there's another quake that have riven already by cracks that could come down. But elsewhere in the country, things have been even worse because in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, where the devastation was most keenly felt, there are whole villages that have been destroyed, utterly flattened. We've seen that in pictures coming into us from the authorities and from the local media. And it's those areas that the government is desperately trying to get to now. The king of Morocco, Mohammed, has declared three days of national mourning. The whole country is being mobilized to try to cope with this, but it's coming at a time when they are been very serious aftershocks, particularly south of the city. If you look here, up through here, this is a building that has collapsed from within. I'm standing on what was up there. That black hole there is the sky. The whole thing just plummeted down and landed under where I'm standing. Now, there is a fear, of course, that these walls could collapse in further. So as a result of that, this major tourist destination here in the Medina is being evacuated. Large numbers of tourists are being moved out of this Medina, and that's for their own safety. So far, it's kind of on the edge of feeling like a ghost town. And of course, it's a little bit frightening every time there's a fall of dust or rubble. But that wasn't an aftershock.

So that's significant, especially because a lot of the buildings, the structures are already compromised from the initial quake and so any additional quakes could cause further damage.

And that's where all these leaders were paying their respects.There was a wreath laying ceremony. All these leaders maintained a moment of silence as well. And after that, you could see Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walking with the U.S. President Joe Biden. And alongside Biden was Rishi Sunak. Quite a symbolic visual out there, really, of two global leaders who have strongly and repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it was just yesterday that you saw a watered down version of what could have been a stronger condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in that declaration that was put out and announced by the Indian Prime Minister. But also very symbolic, what you're seeing at the Raj Ghat in moments from now, you will see these leaders ahead to the venue of the G20 summit, where the third session will commence. But you did, a few moments ago, even see Modi put around the necks of these leaders a scarf. Highly symbolic again, because this scarf is a hand woven scarf made of a material called khadi, which is cotton. And Mahatma Gandhi, decades back did endorse this as part of the freedom movement that he had started against the British in an attempt to boycott any of the textiles produced by the British here in India. It was a symbol of self-sufficiency, self-reliance that he led. So highly symbolic here to see all those leaders, almost 40 representatives from India's -- from the world's topmost economies, as well as leaders from institutes, financial institutions right there, maintaining a moment's silence and then laying the wreath at the Raj Ghat in memory of Mahatma Gandhi.",

So there's a lot of money that's been invested in the G20 summit.We believe, reportedly, there's more than $100 million that was spent for this summit here in India. Preparations, if you see, all across Delhi and the other cities, have been massive. So for the Indian Prime Minister, this has been a critical moment to push India and project India as a global power. And he has succeeded to a massive extent, really, because what he's done yesterday is actually get all these G20 leaders on the talking table and bring about some consensus. There's been massive consensus on issues like climate change, but there hasn't been as much on Russia's invasion of Ukraine as much as he would have liked. But it's been a balancing act for the Indian prime minister. You know how close India is to Russia. They've been partners for decades. Along with that, the proximity between Biden and Modi has been immense in the last few months as well. You saw that state visit of Modi's to the U.S. a couple of months back, and that was a statement, indeed, of how close the two strategic partners are getting. So to have that statement has been critical for Modi, he can now step up and be seen as a global leader, and that's something he's really wanted to do. Along with that, what he's also done over the last year is he's tried to make sure that there's more representation of the global south at this G20 summit. And to that effect, you have now seen the African Union being a permanent member to this bloc. A huge, huge symbolic step taken by the Indian prime minister. Many would say it's been a coup for him, but, of course, there's been condemnation that this declaration is pretty watered down, more watered down, some experts would say, than the Bali declaration last year.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HOLMES (voice-over): The scope of the devastation from the earthquake in Morocco may take days to become clear, but there is one thing that is certain the country will need help to recover from this disaster. People in Marrakech are lining up to donate blood after hospitals and health centers in the area made a plea to stock up. But that's just a tiny fraction of what the country urgently needs.

HOLMES (voice-over): Turkey, which is still recovering from its own powerful earthquake earlier this year, which killed more than 45,000 people, says it can send more than 200 aid workers and 1,000 tents to affected areas. That same quake killed several thousand more in Syria. And the White Helmets, a volunteer group that provided emergency services in that crisis, is once again stepping up, saying, quote, \"With our experience in search and rescue and in responding to earthquake disasters, we confirm our full readiness to aid in the rescue efforts in Morocco of those trapped under the rubble\". Israel, which routinely sends emergency personnel and supplies to disaster zones, says it is preparing to send a rescue team and humanitarian aid to the area.

The other nations said that this took, you know, 300 hours of talks, 15 drafts, and so it wasn't necessarily a foregone conclusion that they would be able to come up with anything at all that they did sort of reflect the divisions that still exist in this block. The language in there didn't call out Russia's invasion. It didn't mention Russia by name. Instead, it referenced things like protecting sovereignty, territorial integrity, the importance of not using nuclear weapons. So that is far short of what, for instance, the United States typically says about the war in Ukraine and European allies. [00:40:01] The White House has been very favorable of this communique. They said that it was consequential. That was how the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, described it. And they say that President Biden is, of course, still working to obtain peace in Ukraine. But one of the objectives certainly for the President here was to talk about this issue with the countries that haven't necessarily been as forceful in their condemnation, countries like Brazil, South Africa and India, the host country, which still buys plenty of fuel from Russia. It hasn't necessarily been as forceful in its condemnation of Moscow. These leaders' statements do tend to reflect the host country's prerogatives. And certainly India is a country that has tried to maintain relations with Washington and with Moscow. And so I think that is part of why this statement wasn't necessarily as forceful as last year's. But certainly the fact that it exists at all is itself its own accomplishment, Michael.",

Vietnam moving the United States from the lowest rung of its diplomatic rankings to the highest. And it's interesting, the other countries on that highest rung are Russia and China. And this is all part of President Biden's effort to expand American influence in this region.And when you talk to senior administration officials, they say this is not about countering China explicitly. And they do make the point that it would be impossible for Vietnam to cut off ties with Beijing. It is right in China's backyard. Those ties have gone back for decades. But they say it is about trying to expand American economic influence in these countries, trying to improve living conditions, and really trying to act as a counterweight in some ways to China's economic and military aggressions. And you see that President Biden has done that with other countries as well, including herein India and in the Philippines. Now, you mentioned that report about Vietnam purchasing Russian arms. That has, of course, been a long, historic tie between those two countries. But I am told that tomorrow in Vietnam, President Biden will make announcements about U.S. providing its own systems to Vietnam, potentially trying to wean it from its dependence on Russian arms. So certainly some things to watch as this visit proceeds, Michael.",

Kevin Liptak in New Delhi as always, thanks so much.All right, for more now on Ukraine's reaction to the G20's declaration, here's CNN's Melissa Bell. MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kyiv has condemned the final declaration coming out of New Delhi at the G20 leaders' summit, saying that it goes nowhere near far enough. It had been a difficult compromise to reach, given that both Russia and China needed to be on board. In the end, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said that the final language, which reflected the fact that there were different views and assessments within the G20 about the war in Ukraine, should have condemned far more strongly Russia's war of aggression, he said, and more strongly urged for it to come to an end. This as the counteroffensive continues here in the Zaporizhzhia region to make very slow progress. We've been following some of the artillery's efforts as it seeks to inch forward under constant drone fire and replies from Russian artillery positions. Still, the Ukrainian position is that the counteroffensive is making slow but steady progress as it seeks to head towards Tokmak on one hand and ultimately Melitopol further south. This as in the occupied regions, the voting has been taking place. Voting that's been happening around the Russian Federation, but also in those four regions that are now occupied by Moscow, voting that's been described by Kyiv as a sham, with Ukraine urging Ukrainian citizens not to take part.

Let's start with the 2003 winners, England, who began their campaign against Argentina on Saturday to the Stade Velodrome in Marseille, where the English had a very early setback to deal with as they're reduced to just 14 men after only three minutes of play when Tom Curry is sent off. This was why the bunker abuse system for a clash of the heads with Juan Cruz Mallia in that one. England had to dig deep in this one, and they did. After that, it became the George Ford Show. The 30-year-old remarkably scoring every single point for his country in this game. All 27 of them, in fact. The playoff weighing in with three dropped goals. And then six penalties as well from him in total. England with his 27 points to 10 or put another way, George Ford 27, Argentina 10. Welcome relief for Australia meantime, as they record their first win in six under head coach Eddie Jones following his return to the national team. The Wallabies with a superb start here against Georgia, taking the lead within the opening couple of minutes of play. Jordan Petaia going over in front of more than 75,000 spectators at the famed Stade de France on Saturday. The Aussies, in fact, running in a total of four tries, two of them coming from their fullback. Ben Donaldson, who scored 25 points as his country record an emphatic win in Pool C. The 24-year-old with an occasion he really will have enjoyed on this, just his fourth appearance at test level. 35 points to 15, the final score in Paris. And top ranked Ireland beginning their campaign with victory over Romania. And when we say victory, we mean emphatic. 82 points to 8, the final score this day. Will be remembered for a long time to come by Ireland's skipper Johnny Sexton, who scored 24 points to make a really impressive return from injury to the sport. He now becomes his country's record World Cup points scorer. Sexton, as prolific as ever with the boot, and also scoring two of Ireland's 12 tries as the Irish recover from the shock of an early Romanian score in this game. Ireland's come back to the sport after a near six-month injury absence. Sexton's tally taking him to 102 points, surpassing his predecessor as fly half Rona Nogara, as Ireland's record World Cup scorer. The victory margin in Bordeaux, the largest ever for the Irish at a World Cup. Italy also breezing past Namibia on Saturday. Three matches on tap for Sunday at the World Cup. First up, it's the 2019 host Japan who take on Chile in Pool B. We got defending champs South Africa facing Scotland at the Springboks like New Zealand aiming for a record fourth title. And Wales and Fiji meet also in action in Pool C. But for now, with that, it's right back to you.",
