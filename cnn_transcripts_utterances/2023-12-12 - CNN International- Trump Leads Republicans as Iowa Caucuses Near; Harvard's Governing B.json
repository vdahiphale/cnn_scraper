A new Iowa poll, conducted by the Des Moines Register, NBC and Mediacom shows more than half of all Republican caucus goers plan to vote for Trump next month. The former presidents also gaining traction in battleground states against current President Biden. CNN's Jeff Zeleny breaks down the numbers.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tonight, Donald Trump holding a commanding and widening lead in Iowa, just five weeks before the state opens the 2024 Republican presidential contest. DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you, everybody. ZELENY (voice-over): The former president crossing a new threshold, with 51 percent of Republicans now backing him, according to a new \"Des Moines Register\" poll. That's up from 43 percent in October. The shrinking GOP field has boosted Trump, who now holds a 32-point lead. The race for second place is a showdown, with Ron DeSantis at 19 percent, followed by Nikki Haley at 16 percent. RON DESANTIS, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He's his own worst enemy by not being able to control his mouth. And that has consequences for governance and us being able to get things done. ZELENY (voice-over): On a weekend Iowa campaign swing, DeSantis and Haley sharpening their attacks on Trump's record. NIKKI HALEY, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We know that the economy was good under Donald Trump, right? But what we need to also remember was that we went $9 trillion in debt during that same time. And we are paying the price for that. ZELENY (voice-over): Nearly half of likely Iowa caucus goers say their minds are made up. But among Trump supporters, 70 percent say they are firmly committed in their decision.",

In an email to CNN on Monday, he wrote: Once external pressures, whether from ultra wealthy donors or from politicians pursuing their ideological agendas override the internal decision-making processes of universities, we are on the road to tyranny.

We are saying you have 27 years to transition to avoid the impacts that we are seeing everywhere in the world, floods, heat, cold, etcetera. I think it hits every corner of the world this year. So, and fossil fuels is the main cause of the climate change that we are seeing now. 80 percent of emissions are from fossil fuels. So, there is no way that we are going to keep the temperature to 1.5 global warming if we don't tackle fossil fuels. And it's phasing out, it's not just reducing.
