And we start the hour with a question. Was Richard Nixon actually right when he said, when a president does it, that means it's not illegal? Well, a judge may have just said in one very specific and important way that, yes, he might be right. Tonight, Sarah Wallace says that Donald Trump gets to stay on the ballot in Colorado, this despite the judge finding and saying in pretty plain English that Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection during the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. Now, the court found that Trump intended to incite political violence, that Trump wanted to direct it at the Capitol, and that Trump's plan was to stop the peaceful transfer of power, and that Trump was not, in fact, protected by the First Amendment when he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women. And we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength. We fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Read her reasoning, and it sounds an awful lot like what you might call a technicality is the very thing that protected Trump, that the 14th Amendment does not actually specifically mention the office of the president.So, the judge in her ruling said that she was reluctant to embrace stripping Trump's name from the ballot without, quote, clear, unmistakable indications. That's what the Constitution demands. But follow her logic and the judge may have just set the table for presidents, past, current, and future, to potentially commit insurrection, to direct other people to do another January 6th without fear of accountability. In a statement, the Trump campaign said in part, quote, these cases represent the most cynical and blatant political attempts to interfere with the upcoming presidential election by desperate Democrats. And here with us to help understand what this ruling really means is Harry Litman. He's a former U.S. attorney and host of the Talking Feds podcast, and also with us, former White House lawyer for Donald Trump James Schultz. So, Jim, I want to start with you. What is your reaction to this sort of double-barreled ruling here by the judge?",

She followed kind of Michael Mukasey's argument that he authored, I think, in The New York Times, where he said that the presidents were not included in Section 3 of Article 14 of the Constitution, and that they specifically say, members of Congress, state legislator, judicial officials and executive officers of the United States.So, the key question is, is the president an executive officer of the United States? It's not in the plain text of the Constitution, therefore, this is something that's going to go, if the president gets knocked off the ballot in one of these states, and I say if, I think this is something that will go up to the United States Supreme Court after getting through the Supreme Court of whatever state it is, and then the Supreme Court is going to have to make that interpretation. But without the plain text, I think it becomes a very difficult argument, and a good argument that the president is, in fact, excluded because he's not included in that language. The idea is that these are appointed officials and not elected vice president or president of the United States.",

And they're going to look back on that and have to make that judgment as to whether the president of the United States applies.So, I do think this court is going to look at the plain text of the Constitution and likely say that the President is purposefully excluded from this because they list off so many others that are included. But I do think, look, the facts that were borne out in this case are going to be heard again in the January 6th trial, right, the January 6th trial in D.C., right?

So, that Collins went ahead and decided these big, chunky questions on the facts, I think, more or less advanced the ball of a question that has to be served up for appeal. You're absolutely right about Chutkan. I think that becomes more and more the big event, especially as the Mar-a-Lago case seems to slip.

First, I would like to think that, in a broad sense, that President Biden is doing what he believes is right and that that will count for something to the voters, that that's who they voted for in 2020 and that's who they vote for in 2024. Second, I think, you know, a lot of people, and not to say that it's all young people, because there are people of all stripes and colors and ages who have concerns about what's going on, as do I, as does anyone who's watching what's happening. But a lot of them are young and need to learn more about what's happening. A perfect example is when they're chanting, from the river to the sea. I'd like to think that most of them don't know what they're saying, and when they have learned, they have stopped. But my point is, is that there's going to be time for people to understand and learn about what's happened the same way that people in colleges now weren't alive for 9/11, which is an experience that we all had that shapes our views. Third, to get down to the brass tacks of it, as Nina alluded to, you have a couple of options. One is that they don't vote. That's actually not great. Two, that they vote for one of the third party candidates, particularly Jill Stein, who was absent in the 2020 campaign but very much had a negative impact on the 2016 campaign, or that they vote for the Republican who is likely Donald Trump. I don't think three is going to happen. I'd like to think at the end of the day, people will look at this election, like every other election. It's between two people. And under no circumstances should any Democrat or anyone who loves America look at those two people and say that Donald Trump is the better of the two.",

They understand that President Donald J. Trump, there's a difference between -- there's a difference between rhetoric and Trump's rhetoric and Biden's reality. And the reality is Donald J. Trump is not the president of the United States right now. Donald J. Trump didn't take us into two wars. We got a war going on in the Middle East. We got war going on in the Ukraine.

And when you have countless lives being taken, innocent lives being taken, people are standing up and taking notice of that. The L.A. Times is saying no more.

Now, more and more companies are suspending their ads on X, and that includes IBM, Apple, Disney, and CNN's parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery.The response putting ex-chief executive, Linda Iaccarino in damage control mode, writing in a post that X has been clear on its efforts to combat anti-Semitism, noting that there is, quote, \"no place for it anywhere in the world\". But Musk has also been changing his tone today. He's calling out and condemning anti-Semitism on the platform. Curiously, it was enough to elicit praise from a long-time critic of the platform, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who called it a welcome move. And then there is Sam Altman. He's seen as the face of artificial intelligence. Altman is the founder of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. But today his own company fired him. The reason is still a bit of a mystery but an internal investigation shows, according to the board, that he was not consistently candid in his communication with them. I want to bring in contributing writer for \"The New Yorker\" Ronan Farrow, who recently wrote a deep dive profile of Elon Musk for the magazine. Ronan, thanks for joining us. Now, this move of just so many companies, it seems like a real avalanche of companies deciding to pull away from running ads on X. What does that mean for the consequences here of Elon Musk's repeated amplification of these kinds of anti-Semitic and all kinds of dark posts, sometimes from other users? RONAN FARROW, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, \"THE NEW YORKER\":  Well, this is the double-edged sword of Elon Musk's role in the world. He is someone who is tremendously mission-oriented that's translated into advances in multiple significant fields, often in areas where the government has under invested and he becomes essentially the most significant first mover. He's become the only way Americans can get astronauts into space. Launched off of American soil. For years we were relying on Russian launches. He controls more than half of the electric vehicle chargers along America's highways so he's very pivotal for green energy policies. And yet we also have this other dimension of Elon Musk, where, you know, I've been talking to people in his inner circle today, and they say they worried about him, that he is caught in this cultural crossfire, and he has seen a warm embrace from conspiracy theorists, anti-Semites, racists, and we see him retweeting a lot of, as you say, really dark content. And there are people in his life that see that as a spiral, that don't know how to respond to that. You know, he's a smart guy, but he is espousing some really important views.",

I have never lied about anything or been unethical during my time as a sports broadcaster.\"Joining me now are two veteran sports broadcasters, Cari Champion and Jemele Hill. Jemele, it is the confidence that really gets me about how she said that. And she said that she never lied, but then in the clip, she says she was making things up. So how does this work? JEMELE HILL, CONTRIBUTING WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\":  Well, when I did sideline reporting in 2012, it didn't work that way, certainly for me. And listen, it's the toughest job I've ever done. A sideline reporting is no joke. And look, I work with Charissa at ESPN. I found her to be likable and enjoyable to work with. But this is -- I think it's the way she made the admission, like you said, the confidence, her saying, well, I haven't been fired because she's not worried about being fired.

It should really be about, well, why does she feel comfortable enough to say that?There seems to be a lack of awareness on her part in terms of the privilege that I think she has. I think Charissa believes she's worked hard to get everything that she has. I think she believes she deserves everything that she has received, but the lack of awareness is what other reporters who are like what I like to call our day-to-day grinders, someone like myself, just would not feel comfortable ever saying anything like that. First, we would never do it, but we just wouldn't feel comfortable to go on air and say, look, the coach didn't come talk to me, so I just took information from the game, and I feel comfortable going on air saying what the information I have and presenting it as if I spoke to someone. She may not have ever had attribution, but she's presenting it. And in the world in which we live, in the fake news world where we are fighting daily to prove that we are accurate and our content is fact, not necessarily just opinion, it's really hard for you not to be aware of this environment that we are working in.

They're the ones who feel like despite whatever he has done, that he is worth them taking the public relations hit.But it points out to something that is very ugly about sports. Miles Bridges, as awful as it was that he said that, he is absolutely right. Because we have seen it so many times before that athletes who have done horrible things to women, whether it be sexual abuse, whether it be domestic violence, they are forgiven. I say this repeatedly. Somebody like Colin Kaepernick would be back in the league had he hit a woman and not taken a knee in protest during the national anthem. Okay, because that is the way, unfortunately, sports is set up. It's a results-oriented game. And all they care about, and a lot of fans are this way too, is that they will forgive the most unforgivable things as long as somebody helps their team win. And the fact is, Miles Bridges is still a young player. He's still got a long career ahead of him. And that outweighed what he did to his girlfriend in front of their children.",
