When a Secret Service agent noticed would appear to be the barrel of a gun sticking out from between a few trees. The agent opened fire. Officials say the gunman did not fire any shots back, but he quickly fled the scene. And then when law enforcement searched the area, they found a rifle, similar to an AK-47 and two bags in the bushes as well. An eyewitness saw the gunman leave in a car, and police were later able to pull him over. They made an arrest. He has been, as you pointed out, identified as Ryan Wesley Routh.",

It was not on his public schedule yesterday. And in fact, we're told that the former president decided to go golfing almost at the last minute. And so authorities are, at this hour, still trying to figure out how Routh would have known that the former president had left his Mar-a-Lago resorts and was coming to this golf course here behind me. That's only about 10 to 15 minutes from Mar-a-Lago. But to a kind of recap, just kind of how things played out yesterday, it was around 1:30 in the afternoon that we're told by authorities that a Secret Service agent that was ahead of the former president playing golf, spotted a part of the rifle that was used in all of this, sticking out through a fence. Now, there had been some confusion in the minutes and in the hours after all of this happened about whether there had been an exchange of gunfire between the 58-year-old and Secret Service agents. But we now know that the only people that opened fire were -- was this a Secret Service agent who fired anywhere between four to six shots. From there, we're told that Routh tried to get into a car, but not before he was spotted by someone who took a photo of him getting into this vehicle and essentially, eventually called 911, told authorities what this person had seen. All of this finally comes to a head about an hour north of where we are in Martin County. It's there that authorities pull over 58-year-old, Ryan Routh. They take him into custody. And the sheriff really describes almost an emotionless Routh. He says he didn't really have much of a facial expression on him. He seemed very almost at ease with what happened. So, authorities were able to stop him there. They took him into custody. Now, the sheriff of Martin County, William Snyder, he talked a little bit about that encounter, how things went down. Here's a portion of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I think the sheriff in that press conference yesterday really kind of raised that question andsaid explicitly that the next time Donald Trump is on his golf course down on Palm Beach, he would expect that there would be more personnel around the perimeter of the course. But in reality, sources have been raising concern for years about Donald Trump's golf course down in West Palm Beach in particular because it's bounded by three major roadways. You don't close the road when the president is on the golf course. And in fact, the club itself remains open to members. And so it remains something of a porous environment for Donald Trump when he is out on the golf course. And this is something that is true really for any kind of golf course. Presidents, this is kind of the only place that they're able to walk around in the open air for any length of time. So it's not something that the Service is going to say, no, you can't go out there. And it does remain on the agents to kind of secure it as the president goes from hole to hole. They drive their own cart. There isn't an armored suburban vehicle that's trailing them, which is often the case when they're not on the golf course. And so it remains, you know, kind of -- kind of an environment that is tricky for the service to secure. When Barack Obama was president, he used to golf almost every weekend. But he golfed at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington. So it's on a military installation. It already has a perimeter established around the course. That's not true of the courses that Donald Trump plays golf at, which are his own courses. There's the one in Palm Beach. There's also one outside of Washington. It really abuts the Potomac River providing its own security concern. He has his course at Bedminster in New Jersey, which is a little harder to get to. But certainly these places are very difficult for the Service. And you did see President Biden today, you know, when I asked him what kind of help the agency might need, he specifically pointed to personnel. And it is true that the Secret Service has long had staffing issues that have made it difficult for them to put individual agents on individual details in a way that would provide the security that is clearly needed. The Secret Service director, when she was still the Secret Service director, was testifying over the summer and said that the agency currently employs 8,000 people, which is below the 9,500 figure that they have tried to target. And so that remains an open question, whether more funding will help that or whether it's more of a cultural issue within the agency. And you do hear agents and officers talking about burnout, talking about high turnover. So this is a very serious problem. Certainly President Biden today, on the South Lawn, wanting to get in front of it and wanting to show that he has it at the top of mind. But as this election continues and as all of these candidates go about their campaign work, but also their personal lives, it will be an issue that the agency has to deal with going forward.",

Did he have another one secreted somewhere where he actually could watch either the golf course or Mar-a-Lago to kind of see from a distance whether or not the president was moving in that direction? I don't know the answer to that. But clearly, you know, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered because this was an off the record type of event. So how could he possibly know that the president would be on the golf course yesterday? But again, he had scouted it out.

But it looks like he actually traveled in from a different location. So when they start really going through text messages, other types of information that they got, they'll be looking for all the kinds of clues you would need to find out whether or not he got a tip somehow that the president was going to go there.

KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you have to remember this is completely different from what we saw after the first assassination attempt in which Donald Trump got out there. He spoke to numerous different outlets, particularly conservative outlets, saying that he was calling for unity, saying this wasn't a time to be politically divisive, that he wanted to bring both Republicans and Democrats together, particularly the Republican Party. We were told, time and time again, by his senior advisors if he was a changed man after that assassination attempt, that is clearly not. What we are seeing from the former president right now, and I do want to read you in part of that interview where he goes on to blame Biden and Harris even more. This is what he says. He says, he, speaking about the shooter, believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris and he acted on it. Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at when I am the one who is going to save the country and they are the ones that are destroying the country both from inside and out. Now, we have seen a sort of evolution from the former president in terms of blaming the Biden administration for that first assassination attempt. He has walked slowly into blaming them before it was essentially this was a crazy person. We need to bring everybody together. Now he has essentially said that it was them. One point saying Kamala Harris was completely responsible. Obviously, this is a political tactic in part because of the fact that he is running against Kamala Harris and there are incredibly tight polls. But that is not fair to say in this circumstance because of the fact that there was now a second assassination attempt. We don't know what there -- what if anything is part of a strategy behind this.

Joining us is Margaret Talev, a senior contributor at \"Axios\" and the director of Syracuse University'sInstitute for Democracy -- and bless you -- and Citizenship. Margaret, welcome to the program. So picking up on where we left on there with Kristen, it does appear that the president, the former president is doubling down on targeting Democrats, specifically Kamala Harris and her campaign for some of the statements that she, he says, that were false, that were made during the debate last week. I'm curious if you think what happened yesterday, and it's quite stunning and unprecedented, I think we should note, to thankfully failed assassination attempts within just a matter of weeks against one candidate. Do you think this changes the tenor and the strategy for either one of these campaigns in the remaining 50 days left?",

So I think what have we heard so far from President Biden, from Vice President Harris? We've heard there's no place for violence in America. We've heard that they're so glad that President Trump -- former President Trump was unharmed. So those are not the signs of divisive violent rhetoric. And I think neither is winning a debate decisively by critiquing your rival's past performances, president and conduct. That's not inherently violent language, and that's not inherently insightful language. So you are hearing a lot of politics at this moment. But it does seem that there is a difference between how former President Trump handled the response around the attempt in Butler versus this. In that case, there was clearly a message that he just wanted to go on with the campaign and would keep fighting. And here, there has been a quick pivot to try to blame his opponent. And this is happening against the backdrop of just a lot of violent rhetoric outside of politics also. You're seeing multiple school shootings. You're -- there's just -- there is a bigger backdrop here. As a journalist, I can focus on the campaign and say how might this impact turnout or people sympathies? As someone who's trying to understand democracy and civic engagement, there's just a landscape right now in the U.S. that's littered with violence as an acceptable way to construct sentences and as a way to respond to conflict in your life, and it's beyond the election, and including the election, it's very troubling.",

And so I'm just curious to get your perspective on, despite the sort of statements we've seen from Kamala Harris saying, oh, we need to tone down the rhetoric. We don't support political violence. Can the rhetoric actually be toned down in the next 50 days? And if so, how? Specifically, how do you begin to -- go ahead.",

But I'm just wondering now that we've had two, Margaret, and we're focused specifically on a small number of voters in seven states, those that are undecided.

Nobody wants -- people shouldn't get hurt for practicing politics. Our systems will be clear of anything like that. So I would say -- traditionally, you would say, this could benefit the former president politically. But there are so many other particulars to this year that this is the second attempt that most people have made up their minds about this race that early voting has already begun. And fundamentally, that a few months ago, he pledged that he was a vowed man and then went back immediately to the kind of campaigning we had seen before. So I think there are too many variables to really predict how voters are going to respond to this. But I think it's important for voters to get accurate information about what's actually going on. This is about a man's actions that we are still learning a lot about who this person is. And there's no evidence, at this point, that either the sitting president or that the vice president are involved in this, in any way, other than saying they want to be helpful towards making sure the Secret Service has the resources that it needs.

Then, of course, in the lower elevations, it's falling as heavy rainfall leading to catastrophic flooding. Look at this video from the Czech police, a river bursting its banks and this very daring helicopter rescue of an individual who was stranded by these flood waters. Wow. Just to see that unfold is incredible. Here's the storm system in question. That storm Boris. It's kind of that clockwise or counterclockwise spin in the cloud cover. It's been meandering over Central Europe. It's produced significant rainfall totals. In fact, storm reports in the Czech Republic have topped 350 millimeters. Equally is impressive. The further south. He head towards Austria as well. In fact, Vienna reports over 230 millimeters of rain. That's four times their September average rainfall just from this storm alone. Now, the wind reports have been equally impressive as well. Check this one out in the Czech Republic of 205 kilometers per hour. We're almost getting that jet stream winds right down to the surface. Incredible. A lot of rain still to go, but the storm still is weakening as it kind of turns its energy out. Still some snowfall for the higher elevations of the Alps and heavier rain across the Adriatic. Let me take you to China because we have had a land falling typhoon near Shanghai. This was the scene just a few hours ago near Shanghai as Typhoon Bebinca made landfall. It made its presence known. This storm, still a typhoon as it moves inland. The real threat going forward is certainly going to be the heavy rainfall that could lead to flash flooding. But when it made its initial landfall on the 16th, it was just incredible because there was one wind report of 187 kilometers per hour near the greater Shanghai region. The rain totals going forward will easily eclipse 150 millimeters. So that's why we have the flash flooding and a possibility for this part of Eastern China. Zain, Bianna, back to you.",
