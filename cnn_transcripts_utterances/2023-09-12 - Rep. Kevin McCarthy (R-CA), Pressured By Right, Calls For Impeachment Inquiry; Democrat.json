I'm Abby Philip.And after centuries of impeachment inquiries being extremely rare for the United States, they are becoming more common than the Olympics. So, is Kevin McCarthy launching into one for President Biden in order to save the republic or to save his job? Well, today, this House speaker is now green-lighting an investigation into Biden without any evidence of wrongdoing. And in moments, I'll speak with the thorn in McCarthy's side, that is Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, who is threatening to oust the speaker, in part over this issue. But, first, some context. Republicans, they want to know if President Biden benefited from his son's business dealings. And that is a legitimate question. But the DOJ did spend years investigating Hunter Biden. And so far, there has been no evidence that his father did benefit. Meantime, House Republicans and their investigations have presented zero direct evidence to contradict that. Also, McCarthy is doing this now unilaterally, without even a vote, even though Kevin McCarthy himself from 11 days ago disagreed with that method. Quote, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People's House, not for a declaration by one person. And just four years ago, McCarthy attacked Democrats for doing the same, both on Twitter and right here on camera. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Speaker Pelosi happens to be the speaker of this House, but she does not speak for America when it comes to this issue. She cannot decide unilaterally what happens here. She cannot change the laws of this Congress. She cannot unilaterally decide an impeachment inquiry. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

When people speak of choice, they are speaking of two different things that are of comparative nature.What we are faced with in Chicago is an absence of a choice, is an absence of resources. And furthermore, school choice in this country has been anchored to a very racist and angry right-wing. I can show you a whole host of emails that have come to me and my family detailing that level of violence and racism. So if the Choice Movement does want to move away from their angry and violent rhetoric, I might add, then they would do themselves a favor and reject the rhetoric of the right that tells us that history is not important. I understand the impact of segregation in Chicago, the impact of destabilization in Chicago. And I faced that along with over 90 percent of my neighbors and that the school that is supposed to be down the street for the cop that lives across the street from me or the retired teacher and her family that lives next door to me, that's not afforded to us. So when we talk about rhetoric, we also have to talk about the historical record. And the historical record is very clear. The school choice movement was a cudgel for integration in this country. That is a fact. Number two, the destabilization of black spaces throughout this country has been reprehensible and is most acutely felt with families who want to send their children to public schools. As I've said before, my children do attend public schools. My son, he has the opportunity to play sports at a school, sports by the way that are not offered at our neighborhood school or any school close to our address. Again, students in Chicago, especially black students on average, travel almost two hours back and forth to school.

I believe I was let go because I challenged the NFL to live up to the standards that it says are important to it, that are core principles to the league in terms of diversity, equity, and inclusion.And for the last two years, I've been pointing out both internally and externally that in our newsroom, we did not have one Black manager. We did not have one black copy editor, and we did not have one full-time black news assistant. And yet we were covering a player population by the league's data that is 60 to 70 percent black. And so my issue was how can we effectively and fairly cover this player population if they have no one at the table, the decision-making table who shares the same cultural and life experiences that they have been through? And I had been fighting that for two years and not getting anywhere with it. And in fact, in November, when my agent reached out to them to see if my contract was going to be renewed. They said, we see no reason whatsoever it won't be renewed, although it may come with a pay trend. Well, after I asked Rodger Goodell those questions, several weeks later, I was told that was no longer the case, that it was being reviewed. Three weeks after that, I was told my contract was not being renewed.

And there was a reporter from NFL Network who made the allegation that Terry Pagula was addressing the issue of player activism, had said that basically, if players don't like it, they should go back to Africa and see how bad it really is.When the Jerry Jones case a year later, I was asking Jerry Jones about why NFL owners have such a hard time hiring black people into decision-making positions. I asked him three different times about it, and after the third time, he told me he was starting to get a little defensive. I told him, I'm not talking about you directly. I'm talking about owners as a collective. And that is when Jerry said to me, if Blacks feel some kind of way. They should buy their own team and hire who they want to hire. This just speaks to the culture within the NFL, in my opinion, about how they feel about black employees and black men in particular. When we look at the head coach situation right now, there are 32 teams. There are only three head coaches who identify as black. We know that the league has a long and complicated history as it relates to race and the NFL going back to the 1930s and 40s, where they had a 12 year ban on black players to then black players coming into the league and being told they couldn't play certain positions because they were thinking man's positions. And then we can fast forward to things like race norming in the concussion settlement case where they relied on that for a time until there was such a public outcry that they had to remove that. So Abby, this is a long pattern in terms of history of the NFL as it relates to race here. And I just believe that if I'm not willing to stand up and fight for this, then I have no reason to complain about what's going on.",
