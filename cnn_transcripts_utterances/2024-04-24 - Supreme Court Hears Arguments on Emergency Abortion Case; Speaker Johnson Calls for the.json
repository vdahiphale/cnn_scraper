Now, you have been presented here today with very quick summaries of cases and asked to provide a snap judgment about what would be appropriate in those particular cases.

But I have countless briefs that say that both -- that HHS has filed that pre- Dobbs, pre-2009, this is not an unprecedented position. That HHS, in countless situations, cited hospitals for discharging patients who required an abortion as a stabilizing treatment. Congress discussed that topic in the Affordable Care Act and explicitly said that nothing in the Affordable Care Act shall be construed to relieve any healthcare provider from providing emergency services as required by state or federal law. Medical providers have told us that for decades they have understood both federal law and state law to require abortions as stabilizing conditions for people presenting serious medical risk.

Having access to safe abortion care is critical to a safe healthy healthcare system. And that's what we've seen fall apart in Idaho since our ban went into effect. We have lost a multitude of providers, particularly my OB/GYN colleagues who cannot continue to have themselves in the position of trying to make these decisions in emergencies where a patient's health and life is threatened.

To the folks who say, look, there is a law that allows people when their lives are in jeopardy to get abortion. This federal law, it's just looking for a loophole.DR. GUSTAFSON:  This federal law is what every doctor practicing in American right now has grown up under and what -- it is what keeps everyone safe. It is the reason that you come to any emergency room and you have to be provided that lifesaving care when you have an emergency. We must have that in place because laws like we have in Idaho are making pregnancy care unsafe for all. And that threatens our communities.
