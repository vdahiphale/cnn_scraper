      "sentences": "Well, Boris, these were blockbuster numbers and the best part is virtually no one saw it coming, 336,000 jobs added. That is spectacular growth in any economy. But in an economy where you're dealing with high borrowing costs and high inflation, it really is impressive, as you mentioned, about double consensus. But even more impressive is if you look at the range of forecasts, this was 80,000 jobs stronger than even the most optimistic forecaster had anticipated. Now, there really was strength across the board, as you can see, hiring heating up. When you look at the sector breakdown, we saw tens of thousands of jobs added last month in health care, government, leisure and hospitality. We see bars and restaurant employment is finally back to pre-COVID levels. The unemployment rate is now at 3.8 percent. It stayed unchanged. This is really low, miles away from that spike to almost 15 percent back in the spring of 2020.So you put all this together, it paints the picture of a strong economy, a strong jobs market. It should go a long way towards quieting those recession fears. I mean, an economy adding 300,000 jobs in one month is nowhere near a recession. Think of anything, though, the question is, is this economy and is the jobs market too strong from the perspective of the Federal Reserve and their quest to get inflation under control? Remember, Wall Street and Washington really wanted goldilocks, not too hot, not too cold. This report, Boris, was on the hot side.",

And then there's Jim Jordan. He's the chair of the Judiciary Committee. He has ties to the far right. And he also just picked up an endorsement from former president, Donald Trump. But both Jordan and Scalise are making a play for the more moderate members in the party, whose votes are really up for grabs. And they are also among the most burned and feel the most upset by the Kevin McCarthy removal earlier this week. And so it makes sense that both Scalise and Jordan are trying to pitch themselves as best positioned to unite this bitterly divided conference. Our Manu Raju caught up with Jim Jordan earlier today.

Many of them are coming to the U.S. southern border. And that has been a very unique challenge for the Biden administration, when really all they could do was process them and release, detain or send some of them back to Mexico, but not necessarily deport. So now they're trying to signal that they could levy consequences for these migrants crossing unlawfully while also trying to maintain the stance of providing some sort of lawful pathway for them to come to the U.S. But this is really a reflection of just how difficult it's been to deal with this particular subset of population that continues to come to the border.",

As always, the Biden administration moving forward with new border wall construction. Is that the right move or is this, as AMLO describes it, a publicity stunt? REP. CARLOS GIMENEZ (R-FL): There's not too many times I agree with the president of Mexico, but I'm going to have to agree with him now. This is a smokescreen, a publicity stunt. The situation at the border is completely out of control, where even mayors and governors and blue states and cities are crying for relief. And this is just one way to say, to let them say, hey, we're doing something about it. We're building 20 miles of wall. That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of in my life because he has to build it.

And also, the proof is going to be in the pudding. This administration has said that we're going to do this. We're going to do that. We're going to control the border by doing this and that. I never, ever listen to what they say. I watch what they do. They said - they've rolled out different policies and said this is going to stop it. Oh, and by the way, the border is under control. How many times have you heard that one? So now, again, this is more politics. But again, why is it just Venezuelans? Maybe they're ideologically not aligned with your party.

And that judge's order had argued had found that Trump was liable for fraud and ordered the dissolution and the cancellation of business certificates for the Trump organization and certain of its entities.

Now, the attorney general's office is opposing this, saying that this trial is underway. We're in day five, that this is too late to make this ask. They're also saying that a delay would create a cascade of delays in not only this case, but also other litigation involving Mr. Trump. If the trial is delayed at all, there is significant risk that defendants will request further delays of the trial based on the deadlines in these other cases. And then that would have an impact on some of the other cases and they say that they're trying to use one court against another in their bigger litigation strategy. But the issue here is, will this be delayed. Now, out of the top of this hearing is one judge that is hearing the arguments. He said he was not inclined to issue an interim state, but he has not yet ruled. So we're standing by and waiting for this ruling, which should come shortly. Now, the Attorney General's office said that they were willing to work with Trump to postpone the implementation of the judge's order. This part being what assets might have to be sold, saying that they would be willing to put that off until this trial is done and until the judge rules on this trial. So they said that Trump's team is not willing to engage in that. Trump's team obviously is going to the court to try to get a judge to put the brakes on that as well, saying that it would have severe and irreparable harm not only to the Trump Organization, but all of the employees that work at some of these properties in New York, such as Trump Tower, among others. So that is their ask now. It comes as this trial is in its fifth day. They just finished the examination of the third witness in this case. As the attorney general's team is trying to get at the heart of this issue here, that the valuations that the Trumps used for many of their assets, including Mar-A-Lago, golf courses, a number of their commercial properties was inflated. So they've been bringing through some of that testimony in this trial so far. And next week will kick off a busy week with some additional kind of big name witnesses, including the former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, who's at the heart of this, had been working for the Trump organization for 40 plus years. He is expected to take the stand on Tuesday. Pam?",
