And they say that they apprehended Evan Gershkovich in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg when he was in the process, apparently, of trying to get secret information about Russia's military industrial complex. There are no more specific than that. Within the past few minutes or so or within the past hour, at least, Gershkovich has appeared in a court in Moscow. And as you mentioned, that court has designated the case top secret. They've said that Evan Gershkovich has not admitted guilt and that's one of the reasons they've designated it top secret so they can go to trial. And they've remanded him in custody until March 29th, so one month and 29 days from now -- from now. Obviously, you know, immensely worrying. You mentioned \"The Wall Street Journal.\" They've issued a statement saying they vehemently denied the charges against their reporter and they've called for his immediate release.

Now to be clear this -- what happened in Huwara in this incident is separate from that May night of revenge attacks and rampages that we have been reporting on now. This happened a couple of weeks after those in immediate incidences. But as we've been noting, since that day, since that day that those two Israeli brothers were shot and killed and then in Huwara and then a few hours after the Israeli settlers went, going on that rampage across Huwara, Huwara has remained a flashpoint for violence, not only Palestinian attacks, mostly on Israelis driving through the town but also on settler attacks against Palestinians. Part of the reason, of course, is that main roadway that Huwara sits on, that's used by Israeli settlers and also the fact that Huwara is surrounded by several Israeli settlements, Jewish settlements, that tend to be further right wing even than most sellers. Now, according to Israeli authorities, two men were charged with terrorism for this attack. Happened when a family was sitting in their car. Now the Israeli authorities say that the two began throwing stones at the family in the car and that one person in the group hit one of the occupants of the vehicle with an ax. They were arrested a week later, the authority said. And said that they are charged with several counts, including with a count of terrorism. Now this -- the Israeli authorities also accused the two of being a part of a violent group, they say, that works to harm Palestinians as well as to disrupt the activities of Israeli security forces in thwarting Palestinian terrorism and maintaining public peace in the area. Now an attorney who is representing -- helping represent the two settlers claims that the evidence against them is very thin. But I think it is quite significant to see Israeli authorities starting to hold Israeli settlers accountable for what's been happening in Huwara recently.",

They told us yesterday to expect a few days in hospital for these treatments, for the respiratory infection. To give you an idea, the pope's rooms are just behind me. Here, the top floor. There's about five windows with the shutters down. Those are the rooms the pope stays in when he's here at the Gemelli Hospital. The Vatican said that this morning he had breakfast, he was able to read some newspapers and indeed do some work. So certainly a reassuring update from the Vatican. Remember, of course, the pope is 86 years old. When he was 21, he had part of a lung removed due to a respiratory infection. Becky, so that's important to take into consideration in this whole thing.
