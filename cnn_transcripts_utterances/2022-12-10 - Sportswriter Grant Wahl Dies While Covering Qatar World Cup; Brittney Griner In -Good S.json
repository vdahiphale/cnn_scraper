Details still coming in all the time exactly in terms of what happened. But the disbelief relates to the fact that we are talking about one of the giants of the sport who won't be coming home. And when I tell you he is a giant, I just want to be able to give you some of the background to that because he was a guy who showed up. He was a guy who carried, if you like, U.S. Soccer, U.S. football, as we call it in Europe for many years. He was the journalist that everybody knew. And whether it's a migrant worker, whether it was for the LGBTQ community, whether it's for journalists within the industry, Grant Wahl showed up. He fought. He used his platform. He spoke truth to power. He got answers from the people at the highest levels of the game. And right now, there is just disbelief that he will no longer be around to do that.",

And what we understand the State Department are doing, they're asking the Qataris to expeditiously as quickly as possible work with Grant Wahl's family and meet their wishes quickly. So, in this case, it's likely to mean whatever medical examinations are required to satisfy the family about the nature of his death, and then to repatriate his body back to the United States. There will clearly be some expectation in his family for this process to be expeditious, but clearly for it to be thorough, to have second opinions. But, you know, at a time like this, I think perhaps the strongest words coming from the State Department were condolences for his family, so well respected a figure, so well-known figure, so upstanding a figure. This does seem to be a matter really now for the Qataris to, as the State Department has requested, to work with his family and to meet their wishes.

So we are right down to the wire. But they're playing in some ways for pennies, relatively speaking, compared to the larger bill. And and the reason, by the way, for the difference in a lot of ways is that is inflation, the cost of everything has gone up so that what they thought everything would cost from hiring new officials to buying medicine or anything else, the price has just shot up in recent weeks.",

Some of that is because of flu season, some of that is because of the relaxed mandates. Some of that is because the disease is evolving, you know, genetically.So we've got a real difference between them.

Is that the focus is going to go from the Pacific northwest down into more of southern California by the time we get to the latter half of the weekend. Very heavy rainfall along the coast, but also incredibly high amounts of snow. The highest will be in the sierras where 3 to 4 feet is not out of the question. Remember, this is on top of what they've already had the last couple of weeks as we've had some potent systems move in. This is a look at where the best chance for flooding will be northern and central California for today, southern California for tomorrow. But this system then gradually moves east in the coming days, bringing blizzard-like conditions to the north, severe storms to the south.",
