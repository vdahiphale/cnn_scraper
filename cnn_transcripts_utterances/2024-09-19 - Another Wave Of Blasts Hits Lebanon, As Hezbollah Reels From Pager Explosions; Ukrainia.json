Dozens of emergency crews and first responders were sent to help be injured and put out fires.In one instance, the walkie talkie exploded during a Hezbollah funeral in the southern suburbs of Beirut. A witness telling scene and that they heard a loud bang followed by screaming and saw a man covered in blood, his hand blown up. It comes just a day after hundreds of pagers, some owned by Hezbollah members, blew up simultaneously across Lebanon in an unprecedented attack which wounded 2,800 people. The death toll rose to 12 on Wednesday. An Israeli source told CNN that Israel carried out the pager attack after it believed Hezbollah discovered the device's capability. The attacks have led to an outpouring of anger on the streets. Video showing people throwing rocks at vehicles for the U.N. interim force in Lebanon following Wednesday's explosions.

They do suggest slightly higher unemployment rates than had been forecast a few months ago, slightly lower inflation for that matter, and lower interest rates, but still not a recession, right? I think what the Fed is trying to communicate is that the economy is slowing. They are on top of that softness that we're seeing in the labor market. But we shouldn't panic.

You know, since, let's say, April, credit card rates, auto loans, some of those rates have already been coming down. That said, you know, there's this expression coined by Milton Friedman that monetary policy works with long and variable lags, meaning that it will be a while before these rate cuts that the Fed put in place today are actually felt throughout the economy against some of that's being priced in but it will be many, many months before we see the full effect of what The Fed decided to do today.

But they also acknowledge that they don't necessarily believe that New York is going to turn red in November.Now, few notable things that Trump spoke about on Tuesday. One is that he addressed an endorsement from a major union group, the Teamsters Union actually, I should say, a non-endorsement from the union group. However, Donald Trump falsely claimed that they had endorsed him. I'll note that their decision not to endorse this cycle is a big deal. They have been going. They have endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee for the last several election cycles, every election cycle, really, since 1996. Trump also vowed to visit Springfield, Ohio, of course, the place where both he and other Republicans have been spreading baseless rumors about Haitian migrants eating pets. He said he wanted to go visit that city, as well as Aurora, Colorado, another place where he has claimed that Venezuelan gangs are taking over the city, something that officials on the ground argue is Grassley overstated.

This is part of a larger continuum of intelligence failures over the last few months.I mean, it's worth noting that if you look at Hezbollah's losses recently, right. They lost their chief-of-staff a few months ago. They lost regional division commanders a few months ago. And they have lost some of their prominent commanders and their special forces groups. You're talking about an intelligence failure and a security breach that seems to -- I mean, they just can't plug at this point that they cannot seem to counteract. In fact, the reason why they used pagers in the first place was so as to avoid, I have to say evade the surveillance from drones and elsewhere. But that hasn't proven to be so effective as we know now. And so I mean, in terms of I think a long-term effect on Hezbollah, I don't think obviously this would have an issue. I mean the group -- I mean it has enough cadre is to reconstitute itself. But in terms of the short-term effect, of course you are talking about losses of leaders, but also the losses of mid-level people in the military and logisticians and not to mention there is now going to be a crippling of its communication network because that has to be adapted (ph) completely to try to avoid, I guess further penetration.

It says, \"Dear President Biden and Vice President Harris, we are artists who want sustainable peace in the Middle East and recognize that the first essential step towards that peace is Hamas returning the 101 remaining hostages including five Americans who were stolen from their lives on October 7.\" Now it has been nearly a year since these hostages have been held in Gaza against their will ever since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th of last year. This also, of course, comes after six hostages were brutally executed by Hamas a few weeks ago, including Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Now the letter goes on to say, quote, \"We urge you to continue to protect and support the only democracy in the Middle East. Please do all you can to pressure the terrorists to release the hostages now.\" There has been a growing divide in Hollywood over the war in the Middle East. And this letter comes after an entirely different letter from Artists for Ceasefire with many celebrities ranging from Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, Dua Lipa, Mark Ruffalo calling on the U.S. for an immediate halt of selling arms to Israel.
