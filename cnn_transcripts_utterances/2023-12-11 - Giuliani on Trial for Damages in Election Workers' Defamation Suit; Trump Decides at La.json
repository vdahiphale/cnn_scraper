They're asking for the jury to determine a mount somewhere between $15.5 million and $43 million. And that's just a start. That's just for reputational damage that the judge has already said that Giuliani and the Trump campaigns lies about them, you know, really did in this case. And, look, she's also asking -- both these election workers are asking for the jury to also include punitive damages to really deter people from singling out election workers in this way and having to have them go through the same sort of pain that they went through after the 2020 election. So, we'll see if Rudy Giuliani takes the stand at some point and what his response started, because this will also be the first time a jury in D.C. will get to hear about the actions and hear testimony about the actions of the Trump campaign and the Trump legal team after the 2020 election. Of course, this is a civil trial, but in a couple of months in the early part of next year, there is a criminal trial scheduled to start. And that one revolves around similar issues as we're going to be tackling over the next four days in this trial.

This case is not about whether they committed fraud. It's about how expensive it's going to be because they did commit fraud. And so the defense has to preserve a lot of things on appeal. If you don't bring up on trial, you cannot do it on appeal later on. They probably got everything they need to get into the other witnesses and having him there opens a door for a lot of things, namely the gag order. He's likely to violate it. The money you're talking about is very low, you know, $5,000, $10,000 for him.

Instead, their lives were turned upside down because it was convenient for them to be used as pawns in an overall political game. And because of that, they were defamed, the judge has said so. They testified for January 6th hearing committee members as well about the idea of what had happened to it. So, him going to talk and address these claims, what can he possibly say to defend, excuse me, his behavior? The whole point is the way he suggests about what he was basing his information on, a way of suggesting a ten-foot pole should extend, I really didn't know everything you know now. Hindsight is 20-20. But it does not excuse when you make statements that are defamatory in nature that the consequences they very well did. One was scared to actually have her name said in public to this very day because people know her so well as this person. And there was not a single element of truth to what was actually said. Again, it was about her convenience. And the courts really come down quite strongly on that very notion. Remember, neither Ruby Freeman or Shaye Moss, although they're very well known now, are public figures, therefore, they don't have to have a higher level and to say that definitely actually occurred. They are normal people, regular election workers. We need them for our democracy.

So, right now, at this particular point in time, it's about what will they will find, whether you can actually pay it in the long run is a very different story. But at the end of the day, looking at all these cases with an eye towards jury selection, we've got another big case coming out of Washington, D.C., where everyone is thinking, gee, how will this work in election subversion cases and how this goes down?

Nikki Haley, who's been rising in other states, really has been stable or flat-lining a bit in Iowa. And the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, of course, has increased a touch (ph). When you take a look inside the reason why this might be, take a look at this number. I'm really focused on this, this morning, 63 percent of first time Iowa caucus-goers are supporting the former president. What that means is this. That means that his campaign is in a much stronger position than it was eight years ago when they were just sort of struggling to organize. Now, they are going out to find Donald Trump supporters who may not have participated in the Iowa caucuses before. It's sort of an inside process. There's a series of neighborhood meetings across the state on a Monday night in Iowa. They are going after those first-time caucus-goers. So, this is contributing to his rise in support. So this certainly is disappointing to some of his rivals who are also trying to expand the electorate, if you will. So far, it's expanding to Donald Trump.

So, that is why he has a commanding lead.But we should say nearly half of the voters there say they could still change their mind. Among Trump supporters, 70 percent say they are locked in with him. But overall, among half of voters said they could change their mind. So, that's why we have to keep an eye on this.
