Well, all day Monday, Fox nor Dominion would give any public comment to the matter.

Our Matthew Chance has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, RUSSIA OPPOSITION ACTIVIST: Today, the whole world sees what the Putin regime is doing to Ukraine, the cluster bombs on residential areas, the bombings of maternity wards in hospitals and schools. MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): It was this speech before the Arizona State House that Russian prosecutors used as part of their case against Vladimir Kara-Murza. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine just a few weeks earlier, and the veteran Kremlin critic, like so many others, was incensed. KARA-MURZA: The war crimes, these are war crimes. CHANCE (voice-over): Less than a month later, Kara-Murza was arrested in Moscow, accused of discrediting the Russian army. He was later also charged with the much more serious offense of treason. In a court in Moscow, Kara-Murza stood motionless as he was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Outside, there was international outcry. LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: Criminalization of criticism of government action is a sign of weakness, not strength. We support the right of Mr. Kara-Murza and every Russian citizen to have a voice in the direction of their country. CHANCE (voice-over): More than 40 other foreign diplomats were at the sentencing, too. While in Britain, where Kara-Murza is a dual citizen, the Russian ambassador was summoned over what was called a politically motivated conviction. It would by no means be Russia's first. The country's most high-profile opposition figure, Alexey Navalny, who is already serving an 11-1/2-year sentence amid renewed concerns for his health behind bars. Another prominent Russian opposition leader Ilya Yashin was recently sentenced to 8-1/2 years in jail for criticizing the Ukraine war. This will all end soon. He shouted out in court. But there's no real reason for optimism. In fact, the Russian crackdown on free speech is getting worse. Only last month, U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich of \"The Wall Street Journal\" in Russia was arrested for espionage. The paper vehemently denies the charges against him, but it all sends a chilling Kremlin message aimed at silencing the voices against it. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
