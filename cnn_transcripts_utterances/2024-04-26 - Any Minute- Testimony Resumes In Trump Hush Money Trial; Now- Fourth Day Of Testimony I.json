Michael Cohen, of course, had to plead guilty for his role in some of these payments. And then years later, we're here with Trump in court.So, this really is an important aspect of Pecker's testimony to clarify. But what they're trying to do is show that he was under pressure when he signed that. So, there were business concerns that the whole FBI investigation had to be remedied somehow had to be resolved before the company could move forward with some acquisitions that it wanted to do. So, they're trying to show to the jury that look, he was under a lot of pressure. This is what he had to do.",

Now, just to guess I think if you're going to look at David Pecker's testimony, remember, we're in the very early stages of laying out this case, you could call for example, Hope Hicks. She came up a few times because he was in some key meetings with Michael Cohen and/or Trump and/or Pecker.Another possibility is Kellyanne Conway because she could talk about -- remember, she was a very powerful official at the White House. But before that, she was leading the Trump campaign. The first woman to lead a successful presidential campaign. She could come in and talk about the Access Hollywood tape. And what a bombshell that was for the campaign. I've read her book where she talks about just what a difficult time period that was. That is significant -- that could be a significant piece of testimony because it sets the stage for why Michael Cohen and Trump were in a hurry to suppress Stormy Daniels' story. So, we don't know who's going to be called. But I think those are two possible --",

But we've lost a lot of time this week because of Passover, a dentist appointment, no court on Wednesday.So, the judge wants to keep this moving along. He could allow that next witness to take the stand and allow prosecutors to begin questioning him or her by the end of the day. KIESEL: I suspect it depends on how long the redirect examination is going to be. And redirect examinations are tricky because they really are limited to anything that was brought out that hurt your case on cross. And very often, lawyers will try and expand what they want to talk about on redirect. But I suspect Judge Merchan, who's trying to keep this moving, will keep it tight.",
