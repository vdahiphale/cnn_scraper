CNN's Nick Valencia joins us now from Lawrenceville, Georgia,just north of Atlanta. Nick, you're inside an election center where they are processing ballots, getting things ready for Election Day.

We're working with our social media team, like you said, last week trying to hurry up and knock down that fake video that popped up here in Georgia. So we're constantly -- it's nonstop. And then here at the office, as you can see, it's purposely built wide open.

There were wild allegations of fraud, Rudy Giuliani before the Four Seasons Total Landscaping Company, the press conference at the RNC, again, really sort of bellicose accusations of fraud, none of which turned out to have any substance.

And this will have an effect not only at home, but around the world. Only 31 percent of the countries of the U.N. have ever had a woman head of state. So the United States is an influential country. And if the United States had a woman head of state, that would have enormous benefits for many countries, women in many countries around the world. If Donald Trump wins the election, then not only will he be the oldest president we have ever had, but he will be the first twice-impeached president to be reelected. He's the only twice-impeached president we have ever had. But, more importantly, he will be the first person in American history to have come to power after provoking an insurrection. He will also be the second president to have won a campaign based on vengeance. But his vengeance is different from that of Andrew Jackson's. And, in 1828, Andrew Jackson sought vengeance, but he sought vengeance against John Quincy Adams for losing the 1824 election to him. He didn't seek vengeance against half the country. So either outcome is certain to produce historic consequences for this country. And it'll be an election remembered, I would argue, forever.",

In 2012, you had Superstorm Sandy sort of move that race towards Barack Obama when he was running for reelection. He was probably going to win anyway, but it was moving in that direction. 2016, you had the Comey letter. In 2020, we were all dealing with COVID. And so, sometimes, these outside forces have an impact.
