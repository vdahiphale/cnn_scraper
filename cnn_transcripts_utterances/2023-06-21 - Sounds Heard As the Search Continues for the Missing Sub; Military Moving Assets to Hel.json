      "sentences": "Yes, so hopeful that we've heard these noises, that they've heard these noises. But also, as you point out, totally unnerving. And the reason is that even if they locate this submersible, it is going to be very difficult to actually bring them to the surface.Let me tell you what's going on now. The U.S. Coast Guard, which is the lead on this, just told us in the last few minutes that Canadian ship, another one, the John Cabot, is headed to the area, and they're going to use what they're calling side scanning sonar. What does this do? Simply put, it is using sounds that it detects on the sea bed to actually map it. By mapping those acoustic sounds, they may be able to better pinpoint the location of this submersible. John, even if they find it, what they've done now, and what they've been doing for the last 48 hours, is pre-positioning, both equipment and expertise that is already there or headed there, and that means more submersibles that can go deep into the deep sea and actually continue to search or, in the best case scenario, they find the submersible and will begin thinking about how to raise it to the surface. Crucial here is everyone is watching the clock. I mean, look, they have about a day's worth left of oxygen. I wouldn't ever be specific about that. I mean experts tell me that because of the expertise on this submersible, they might be able to use that oxygen for much longer. John.",

      "sentences": "Thank you, John.If officials are able to locate the missing sub, they will then be tasked with the highly complex mission to recover the craft and the five people on board. There are very few assets in the world that can reach more than 12,000 feet below sea level, where the Titanic lies. And even those that can, they can only travel about 1,000 feet per hour, which means it could take 12 hours to reach the Titanic, if it is at the bottom, that submersible. Let's take a look at those machines which are called remotely operated vehicles or ROVs. This is one of them that we know has been deployed to that search site. ROVs are about the size of a cargo van and they're tethered to a surface ship with a 2 inch thick cable which provides power and communication. Now, U.S. military ROVs have electric motors and cameras but would not have the capacity to actually be able to lift that submersible. That is where this piece of technology could come in. Experts have suggested an ROV could attach a cable to what's called the Fly Away Deep Ocean Salvage System, or FADOSS. It has the ability to lift loads up to 60,000 pounds and could potentially haul the submersible to the surface. But, of course, they have to find it first. And that is where the trick is. Kate.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): The issue here is not just politicization. The issue here is, these were presidential political campaigns.

We already heard from Jim Jordan, who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, talking about Mar-a-Lago, the search of the former president's home there. We also heard from Jerry Nadler, the top Democrat on this committee, basically questioning if Republicans are using this as a way to just distract from Donald Trump's recent indictment.You knew, we got John Durham's opening remarks so far where he does raise concerns about the way the FBI conducted themselves. So, we're going to wait and see how much of this devolves into sort of a proxy fight over Donald Trump and his legal woes more broadly versus how far they really get into the depths of the Durham report and possible changes that could be coming to the FBI. And, Kate, we should note, the FBI has said in a statement that they have made changes in the wake of a Justice Department inspector general report on these same issues. So, again, we'll see how much of this devolves into a sort of partisan food fight or how much they stay on topic today, Kate.",

Overnight, \"ProPublica\" published an investigative piece alleging that in 2008 Alito went on a luxury fishing trip to Alaska with businessman Paul Singer. \"ProPublica\" describes Singer as a hedge fund billionaire who has repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to rule in his favor in high stakes business disputes. The story says Singer flew Alito to Alaska on a private jet and that the justice did not report the fishing trip or the private jet flight on his annual financial disclosure. \"ProPublica\" also says Alito did not recuse himself from cases involving Singer's hedge fund that came before the court after that trip.Now, hours before this article came out, Alito wrote an op-ed in \"The Wall Street Journal\" alleging that the hospitality did not have to be reported under the rules at the time and that the accusations against him are not, quote, valid.

You do not usually see that.And here's what he wrote about the ride on the private jet, because I think it's interesting. He said, I was asked whether I would like to fly there in a seat that as far as I'm aware would have otherwise be vacant. It was my understanding that this would not impose any extra cost on Mr. Singer. Had I taken commercial flights, that would have imposed a substantial cost and an inconvenience on the Deputy U.S. Marshals who would have been required for security reasons to assist me.
