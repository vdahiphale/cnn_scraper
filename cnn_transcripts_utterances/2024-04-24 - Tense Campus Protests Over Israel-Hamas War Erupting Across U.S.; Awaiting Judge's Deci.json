Dave, if we pull over here, you can see how close they are to the protest. You can maybe also hear LAPD choppers in the air.

We also just heard from the provost, Wolf, who said that they believe a lot of outside elements have come in and have caused that chaos that we saw earlier on today. I have certainly seen on social media outside organizations asking people to come down here. So, what the college has done is they've closed all the gates. They're saying, if you want to get in, you will need a USC I.D., because they want to keep this as small as possible. Now, this morning, when it got ugly, it wasn't that big of a protest. Since then, as it's been peaceful and calmer, the numbers have been growing and growing and growing. And there is, of course, a fear that it's going to get out of hand. There aren't that many of these campus officers and there are a lot of protesters. Now, I've spoken to some Jewish students who have been trying to prepare for their finals walking by, and, yes, they don't feel great about hearing, you know, Intifada revolution, Intifada is the only solution. That's troubling for them on their campus. But this protest very passionate and they say, in solidarity with what's going on at Columbia and around the rest of the country, and they say that they are not leaving. So, there is going to come a point where the desires of the protesters and the rules of the college will clash. The protesters say they're not going to go anywhere.

So, I think we're going to hear a lot tomorrow about cases real or hypothetical other than January 6th and the justices trying to figure out if there's an easy and obvious way to put the charges against former President Trump on the non-immunity side of the line while either recognizing that there's some immunity for former presidents or, Wolf, leaving them out for a future case where it comes up.

It's possible that even though the court didn't act as quickly as we might have wanted it to, it's still willing to act quickly now. And maybe we get a decision, perhaps by Memorial Day.

The statehouse just voted to overturn a Civil War-era abortion ban that was revived by the Arizona Supreme Court in a very controversial ruling that got national attention. This paves the way for Arizona, potentially, to return to a 15-week limit on abortions. A state Senate vote is expected next week.This comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is now weighing a case focusing in on emergency abortion care, as CNN's Paula Reid reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Today, the Supreme Court heard another historic case on abortion as protesters on both sides of the issue gathered out front. High-stakes hearing focused on Idaho's abortion ban and how it applies in medical emergencies. The state allows exceptions when the life of a mother is at risk, but the Biden administration sued the state arguing that federal law requires the state to allow the procedure if it is needed to stabilize a patient, even when the mother's condition is not yet life threatening. Joshua Turner argued for the state and faced a barrage of medical hypotheticals from the liberal justices. JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT: All of these cases are rare, but within these rare cases, there's a significant number where the woman is -- her life is not in peril, but she's going to lose her reproductive organs. She's going to lose the ability to have children in the future unless an abortion takes place.",

And as she referred to as they've had to resort to airlifting patients out of state once a week. They said they are sending patients at the state and this is from the attorney that was arguing the case today. The real implication, right, is that you have providers who have to second guess for how they treat pregnant people that walk into the emergency rooms for their care. And the implications of what that means, right, not just for the life of the parent, but for the pregnancy itself and for future fertility, you know, to hear the justices argued about the impact to organs -- how many organs being impacted is enough for you to provide a standard of care really should be shocking to us all.
