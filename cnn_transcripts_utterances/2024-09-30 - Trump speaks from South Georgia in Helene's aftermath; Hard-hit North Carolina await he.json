But clearly, they do when you have a swing state that is so important being affected by such a big storm. We know that FEMA has already deployed some satellites for Starlink connectivity to the region. And you hear Trump trying to create a sense of the Biden administration hasn't really done much to help out.He's made some baseless claims about that. We know the President has approved an emergency declaration days ago in Georgia. Tell us what you're seeing here and what the Trump campaign is saying.",

He is being treated not just as a former President, but almost as though he is a sitting president. As Boris, you just noted, getting a briefing from FEMA, getting a briefing from the National Guard. That is not something that is typically just offered to a candidate. They are treating him as though he is a former President who is there to help. And one thing that I had noticed earlier during our 01But I will note that he and the campaign say that they have arrived in that area with trucks full of supplies that they plan on giving out. So there is something there for them to offer. He also said that he had a tanker truck full of gasoline, which obviously, if you've ever covered one of these storms, you understand that one of the first things, that hardest things to come by is gasoline. So he said that he was going to be giving that out. He is clearly taking this seriously as a politician, is on the ground trying to show that he is there in support of the people on the ground in Georgia. And of course, this comes as well. He is again offering a message of unity. He has spent the last several days slamming Kamala Harris, his rival, for not being on the ground, for not helping with this storm. And I do want to point out what you said was very interesting about the Starlink. FEMA, yes, has been doing that. But Donald Trump taking it to another level, saying he's going to personally have a conversation with Elon Musk, which does matter given what we know about their relationship, trying to insert himself there to say that he has the efforts, he has the resources to actually help people on the ground. ANNE-MARIE GREEN: Yeah, it's interesting to see the disparity in the comments he made before today's event and the comments he's making now. Kristen Holmes, thanks so much. We want to get you a look on the ground from this area as people across the southeast face a long road to recovery in the catastrophic aftermath of Helene. The storm ravaged communities from Florida to Virginia with some of the hardest hit areas, as we've been saying, in western North Carolina.",

We have Republican Strategist Shermichael Singleton, Democratic Strategist Meghan Hays, and CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger. You guys, I wonder what you think about this visit of Trump's. All of this is happening. It's affecting key states in this race for the White House, states that also need a lot of help. We're hearing from people who need so much help.

Yes, it will pull resources away from him being -- by him being there. But he talked about, as Kristen Holmes stated, bringing resources, having fuel there, talking with Elon Musk to make sure that people have Internet connectivity. And so while he's not the sitting president, what he's showcasing, is that during moments such as this, I am capable and ready to be there to lead through these types of disasters that matters in what we know will be a critical battleground state, where Kamala Harris has somewhat moved the margins in places like Atlanta, where there's a large African-American population. Marietta, Georgia, is another place that her campaign has focused heavily on to make this race competitive in Georgia.So I think it's smart, strategically speaking, for the former President to be there. And then he stated, well, where is Vice President Harris? You can debate whether or not she should be there or not. But to point out that contrast, I think, matters.",

I know when I was at the White House, we always waited until we were invited to come. There's a lot you can do from afar. He could have done a press conference from Florida. He could have done a press conference from New York talking about the resources. So I do -- I have a little bit of a problem with pulling the resources away from folks who need. But also, the federal government is on the ground.They have 50,000 people with fire -- you know, putting up power lines and pulling resources from different states to get those power lines back up. They have 3,300 federal people on the ground with FEMA, you know, making sure people are getting food. So I do think the federal government response has been -- has always been speedy with the President on these types of disaster situations. But it is political.
