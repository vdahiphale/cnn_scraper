Residents in the unincorporated community of Rio Verde foothills are suing the city to restore their water delivery service. They were cut off because of the extreme drought conditions in the Colorado River. That's where the majority of Scottsdale's water comes from. Last year, Scottsdale's water department told CNN in an email that they were being good neighboring in allowing this community to temporarily use that water supply. Well, the department said that due to the current water shortage by law it, quote, must dedicate its limited water supply to their residents.They started doing that in the beginning of this year and now there is a crisis for folks. A mega drought plaguing America's west is the worst in 1,200 years. Look at this. These are images of Lake Mead, the nation's largest reservoir in volume. You can just see how much the water levels have decreased in the past two decades. That is because the levels of the Colorado River, which feeds right into Lake Mead, are also plummeting, affecting millions of people across seven states and in Mexico. Our chief climate correspondent Bill Weir is with us. I was just asking in the break, is this the same Colorado River crisis that is causing another issue in Colorado? So, walk us through - I mean this -- can you imagine living there? You can't flush your toilet. You can't take a shower. BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT: But it's sort of like they've been living as if they were hooked up to the public water utility.",

If you are in the market for an electric vehicle, this might be your year, especially early in the year. We're talking about a $7,500 EV tax break. So now the baseline Model Y crossover for Tesla is now under $53,000. So, it will qualify for that. You can see the income limits, those first two lines there are how much money you have to make less than those income limits to qualify for this free money from the government. The high-performance version of the Model 3 sedan, now $53,990, so it would qualify. Also you've got GM and Toyota cars that now qualify as well because they've lifted that -- the Inflation Reduction Act lifted that 200,000 car cap for how many cars can qualify for tax credits. So, there's some tax credits, there's some lower prices. You look at the Chevy Volt. I think if you put that $7,500 tax credit on there, it's like a $20,000, $19,000 car, which puts it cheaper -",
