It comes as the broader loan forgiveness announced by the president in August remains tied up in court.Let's go to CNN's Sunlen Serfaty with the details now. Sunlen, good morning to you. Who would get help with this new plan?",

      "sentences": "Well, Don, it mainly targets low and middle income borrower. These are people who are enrolled in the loan repayment plans that are tied specifically to income. And the Department of Education actually estimates that's roughly 8 million people this could affect. People could see potentially huge savings, monthly payments cut in half, or even potentially paused.Now, this proposal revises the existing proposal. It sets a hire threshold for repayment. Single borrowers making less than $30,600 per year would not need to make any payments. And that's an increase from the current threshold at $24,000. And for those making above the income threshold, they could still see some savings too. The undergraduate borrowers above that threshold will be capped at 5 percent of their income. That's half of the current 10 percent. And the Department of Education would also stop charging monthly -- unpaid monthly interest and would shorten the time it takes for some smaller loans to be forgiven. Now, this would apply to current and future borrowers. But importantly, Don, there's no timeline yet for when this would go into effect. This is a regulatory change of it's adopted. Borrowers could potentially, though, see the relief later this year.",

It was Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to appeal to the Christian faithful and trying to show that it was Ukraine violating the ceasefire.Aside from that, this is an indication with this dramatic decline in artillery fire that something is clearly changed within the way Russia is fighting this war. The question is what. From the wartime high of 20,000 artillery rounds per day, down to about 5,000 rounds per day now. Russian military doctrine, the way Russia fights its wars, calls for a barrage of artillery fire and then essentially ground troops go in and clean up or mop up what's left. So, why this significant difference. And that's what the U.S. is trying to figure out according to U.S. officials. They have talked for a long time about a shortage in Russian precision weapons. Less so about the conventional (INAUDIBLE), just like artillery fire. Maybe, the U.S. officials tell us, this is an indication that Russia is beginning to run low on its vast stores of artillery after ten months of fighting and with no end in sight. Ukrainian officials say, look, we've also hit a number of Russian weapons depots. So, this may be making a dent, or, Poppy, they may be regrouping for future Russian operations.",

In a 92-page lawsuit, the school district claims that social media giants violated Washington's public nuisance law and has, quote, been a substantial factor in causing a youth mental health crisis with higher and higher proportions of youth struggling with anxiety, depression, thoughts of self-harm and suicidal ideation. The district says that the wait list for mental health services were astronomical, requiring significantly greater and longer-term funding to address the issues that have been caused, they say, by social media use.In a statement sent to CNN, a Meta spokesperson responded saying that it continues to pour resources into ensuring that young users are safe online with tools to support teens and families, including letting parents limit the amount of time that their teenagers spend on Instagram and also age verification technology that helps teens have age appropriate experiences. The other companies have not yet immediately responded to requests for comment. But joining us now to talk about this major lawsuit are two parents and two amazing reports, CNN's Audie Cornish and Erica Hill. This is really remarkable in the sense of they say that they want damages here. They want them to stop creating the public nuisance, to award damages and to pay for prevention education and treatment for the harm they say is being caused by these companies.",

They have different ideas about mental health than I think some of us around this table grew up with. And they are expecting some support. And, you know, it's interesting when you sue, sometimes you can get information, right? We saw this - you see this with lawsuits all the time. You can compel executives to speak. You can get papers and documents out. You can bring things into the limelight. And I think that's something that this school system is trying to do.",

They're focused on lawmakers as they are giving speakers or on the dias (ph), every now and then sweeping across the House floor, but not usually offering much also.Last week, however, we got a close-up view of what was actually playing out on the House floor, capturing moments that typically you would never see, such as when the holdout Matt Gaetz was angrily pointing at the would-be eventual speaker after another failed vote, or when this happened.
