They want to take the fight to the Russians. They understand they need more modern Western weapons to do that, but at the same time, they are also bracing for a possible massive offensive by the Russians. Here is what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice over): Preparing to defend against a second gigantic attack even as they are already under assault by Russia. Ukrainian units held large scale drills to prepare for bigger battles to come. The head of Ukraine's Joint Forces Command tells me. (LT. GEN SERHIY NAIEV speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"We need to know what exactly to prepare the forces for and how they should be prepared,\" he says, \"That's why this is so important.\" We are in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, site of the worst nuclear disaster in history, Ukraine Special Forces also practicing urban combat in the abandoned buildings. PLEITGEN (on camera): The US and its allies believe the Russians could mount a massive offensive once the spring comes. That's why the Ukrainians are getting their forces ready even as they are already fighting the Russians on several fronts in this country. PLEITGEN (voice over): The Ukrainians say that to win, they need more modern Western weapons, especially main battle tanks. (LT. GEN SERHIY NAIEV speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"In terms of quality, of course, there is a big difference,\" the General says, \"Because the fire control systems of Western equipment are far superior to Russian weapons.\" As the battles in places like Bakhmut in Eastern Ukraine remain brutal and casualties mount, Ukraine's leadership says it is grateful for the massive military aid announced at the Ramstein meeting. But Kyiv is disappointed Germany still hasn't signed off on sending Leopard 2 main battle tanks, which would be key to help them turn the tide, a top presidential adviser tells me. (MYKHAILO PODOLYAK speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"Our guys won't leave the battlefield even if they aren't provided with new equipment,\" he says, \"But more of them will die. This must stop. We want our people to have a better chance of saving their own lives.\" The Ukrainian say the new aid announced Friday will go a long way to help them beat Russia back and Mykhailo Podolyak says he hopes the US and its Allies will keep weapons flowing in the long run. (MYKHAILO PODOLYAK speaking in foreign language.) PLEITGEN (voice over): \"I think our allies have the perfect understanding of the price we're paying,\" he says. \"But it is very important for Russia to lose. They understand the nature of this war, the nature of Russia, and why it is impossible to negotiate with them.\" The Ukrainian say they need to grasp the initiative before the Russians can recover from their losses, and they are gearing up for what could be a brutal spring.

So, they are think, especially if they get those tanks because those are so important right now in the east of the country for those battles that they'll have a good chance to make a lot of headway before the Russians are able to get in place for a massive offensive -- Anderson.",

She is currently a Global Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center. General Hertling, you saw the report from Fred Pleitgen. What is Germany's hold up on sending the tanks? Is it just, and I know Germany is saying that they want the US to send M-1 Abrams as well. The Abrams require a special, I think, they require jet fuel and more maintenance and would probably be difficult to repair and service in Ukraine. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, all of those things are factors, Anderson. I will correct in saying that they only require jet fuel, they do not. It is a multifuel engine. But the problem is, well, first of all, I will say that Chancellor Scholz has said that they are not tying Leopards to Abrams delivered. That's kind of a change over the last couple of days. He has reportedly said that now, but there is still a delay and it is a combination of politics and the fact that, truthfully, Germany is very concerned about losing a lot of their tanks to the Ukrainian Army, because they have to defend their own territory too, as do some other nations. Whether that's a specious argument or not, it doesn't matter. Every single nation is really focused on how to defend themselves. What we have to point out, though, is that the United States gave 500 armored vehicles total during this last tranche of vehicle delivered. And the goal has been provide Ukraine with the equipment that they can immediately put to use, and which they can easily train upon. And Fred just mentioned about the problems that the Ukrainian Army is having with sustainment, getting parts for their old equipment. The same thing is going to be true in terms of getting parts for new equipment. And with some of these advanced Western-style vehicles, you're talking about the requirement for a long logistics supply lines with very unique parts. And if we go over the list of equipment that Ukraine has already given, or I'm sorry that the West has already given to Ukraine, you're talking about dozens of new pieces of equipment, each one of them with distinctly different spare parts, types of repair, fuel requirements, training requirements. So, it's been complicated for the Ukrainian Army to handle all of that.",

Florida's Republican led government is blocking a high school AP course, advanced placement course on African American studies, alleging it was, \"inexplicably contrary to Florida law\" and other broad things like it, \"significantly lacks educational value.\" When questioned for more specifics by CNN as to what exactly was objectionable, Governor Ron DeSantis' administration initially didn't provide many details.Tonight, we have some more answers. A few hours ago, the Governor's office sent out a list put together by the state's Department of Education, outlining six topics that are of concern. They say among them subjects like the movement for black lives, black feminism, Reparations, black queer studies. It also questions the inclusion of certain black authors whose writings touch on critical race theory. I want to get some thoughts from someone who is actually teaching the pilot AP placement course. It's being taught in a number of dozens of schools around the country as a pilot to see how it's going. Lisa Hill is Director of Inclusion, Equity and Diversity at the Hamden Hall Country Day School in Connecticut and Chair of its Department of History. She joins us now. Ms. Hill, I appreciate you joining us. What is your, first of all, your reaction to the reasoning from Governor DeSantis' office about why this class should not be taught in Florida? Because some of the specifics they're saying are -- that, you know, a topic of intersectionality and activism, black queer studies, topics about black feminist, literary thought, the reparations movement and others? LISA HILL, DIRECTOR OF INCLUSION, EQUITY &amp; DIVERSITY, HAMDEN HALL COUNTRY DAY SCHOOL: I would have to say that, as I said before, I was a little baffled because it is just illuminating history that has essentially been left out. And when you look at Florida, which has such a large population of minority peoples, it seems to me as if they would want to embrace more of that so that it gives a fuller picture of what this country really is. If you're going to go down that line, I did see things like Black Lives Matter, black feminism. I wonder if you start to redesign any curriculum, does that mean then that you take out the women's liberation movement? So, my concern is, why is it that when certain people are a part of a movement or group, that it's considered to be less than, I guess, educational, less than scholarly, but you don't mind having other courses that do speak to other people's cultural contributions and histories.",

It's the hidden histories that aren't -- haven't been told for generations in this country widely. It's the histories of black people in this country, of, you know, people of color in this country, of gay people and lesbian people in this country.

David Crosby died yesterday at the age of 81, after what his family said in the statement was a long illness. My next guest, James Taylor, was fortunate enough to know and work with and befriend Crosby at the 25th anniversary of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame more than ten years ago.

And in the court affidavits filed this week, the state's forensic experts stated there appears to be transfer and spatter stains on the front of Murdaugh's t-shirt. Murdaugh's lawyers have argued the blood got on his shirt when he touched the victims after finding them and deny he was at the house when the murders occurred.
