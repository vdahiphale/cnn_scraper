Early voting underway in most states now.CNN's latest national polling average shows little to no daylight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. It's a busy week, understandably for both candidates as campaigns blitz across the handful of battleground states expected to decide the election. On Sunday, thousands of people queued up outside New York's legendary Madison Square Garden for a Trump campaign rally. The gathering featured a slate of Trump loyalists and included racist, profane attacks against Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, other Democratic leaders, and even the island of Puerto Rico. In a rare campaign appearance, Melania Trump introduced her husband to the crowd during his, as usual, disjointed and meandering speech. The former president used dark rhetoric and invoked fear when talking about Democrats, women and immigrants and made a slew of false claims about his opponent. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Over the past four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon our people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens. There has never been anything like it anywhere in the world for any country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because most people will say no. I mean, there's a lot of frustration with the Biden economy. He's had a lot of accomplishments, but they've been overshadowed by inflation.

He said that the party has been held under harsh judgment from voters. This vote was harsh. He called the loss painful and said that the party needs to basically be reborn. And that is very important because right now, Japan has some very big issues that it needs to confront. And the question is, does the party in this current landscape, have the power and the poll to get things done. That is what the big challenge is going to be. So there's a lot of work taking place behind the scenes. Most likely to try to strengthen the existing coalition from some parties outside. So that's going to be the behind the scenes maneuvering that is taking place. Now, as far as the issues that need to -- that need to be confronted, certainly the economy. Right now, the Japanese yen, it has become week once again. Inflation is high. So there is this economic unease facing the country. And then the other issue that has really hit this party hard was a political scandal, allegations of kickbacks, allegations of lawmakers, not necessarily disclosing the true state of their finances. So that is why this is going to be so difficult for this government moving forward. So the real question Michael, is will the prime minister be able to get the support he needs or is this a sign that the government's going to go in a different direction. I should point out, it's not unusual for prime ministers to change to change position on a frequent basis. We had Prime Minister Abe there for a long time. We had Prime Minister Kishida there. But there's often this phrase of musical chairs or realignment in Japan when it comes to the prime minister's office, that spot. We do see things change frequently. So if that does happen again, that wouldn't necessarily be out of the norm. But a lot of people are watching. A lot of nations are watching, including the United States which has -- certainly Japan depends on the United States for military support, but the United States also very actively helping Japan's strained relationships with North Korea in many ways as a front because of the concerns being faced from here in China, Michael.",
