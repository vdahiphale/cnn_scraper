We have a special report on that coming up. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news: a senior Russian general fired for speaking out against Putin's war. OUTFRONT tonight obtaining remarkable audio of a Russian general in command of forces in southern Ukraine right along that crucial front line near Zaporizhzhia. The general says he was relieved of duty, fired, because he is now telling the truth about what's really happening on those front lines. Here is General Ivan Popov in a tape meant for the Russian public. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) IVAN POPOV, RUSSIAN GENERAL (through translator):  I had no right to lie, therefore, I outlined all the problematic issues that exist today in the army in terms of combat work and support. I called a spade a spade. I drew attention to the most important tragedy of modern warfare. This is the lack of counter-battery combat, the absence of artillery reconnaissance stations, and the mass deaths and injuries of our brothers from enemy artillery. I also raised a number of other problems and expressed it all at the highest level, frankly, and extremely harshly. In return, the senior commanders apparently felt some kind of threat in me and quickly in one light day concocted an order, the minister of defense signed the order and got rid of me.

And then he continued in this audio to accuse Russian leaders all the way to the top, Russian leaders of betraying the military. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) POPOV (through translator):  As many commanders of divisional regiments said today, the servicemen of the armed forces of Ukraine could not break through our army from the front. Our senior commander hit us from the rear treacherously and vitally decapitating the army at the most difficult and tense moment. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly. You've got to put it in the context of the last remarkable three weeks inside Putin's military. We've just had the Wagner armed rebellion, a mercenary group, yes, but essentially fueled by very similar complaints about essentially Russia losing the artillery war in key front lines as Ivan Popov was making. Except Popov, a general, is speaking from inside Russia's top brass again about their misconduct and poor execution of this war, and he spoken out and lost his job very fast.Now, this I think is another sign of disarray, a disarray which we saw spilling out after the Wagner rebellion. And it comes in a really odd 48 hours for Russia's top brass where we've seen high-profile assassinations deep inside Russia, key commanders killed by missile strikes, and now this extraordinary dissent from Popov. Here's what we know. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over):  For Russian generals, a home once so distant from the front is no longer safe. Here, former Russian submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsky runs his usual route at the usual time, but with a new unnoticed companion on a bicycle. Moments later, he was gunned down. Ukrainian defense intelligence said they had nothing to do with it, but they knew a lot about it, saying he had been shot seven times with a Makarov pistol and heavy rain meant no witnesses. Rzhitsky commanded a Russian submarine accused of many attacks on civilians, Ukraine also said, although his family reportedly denied that. Ukraine added later, perhaps sarcastically that he had been killed by his own men who refused to kill Ukrainian civilians. Russia was quick to respond with their own propaganda, claiming to have captured the gunman within hours. Video we can't verify. But it was a crude bit to show they are in control of the fate of their top brass after now weeks of chaos. Russian media said the killing hinged on a clumsy detail that Rzhitsky had made his daily run public on the running app Strava which has a long history of accidentally exposing the location of people who don't want to be found, revealing U.S. military bases in Syria and Yemen five years ago. There are the dead and also the missing. News Wednesday, too, about this key Putin lieutenant Sergey Surovikin who vanished since he appeared early in the armed Wagner rebellion to plead for it to stop. A top Russian lawmaker claimed he was, quote, resting, whatever that means.",

Dead jogging or still missing, a turbulent time in the top brass.(END VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (on camera):  Erin -- Erin, important to add that we've heard today from Russian state media confirmation that another key commander again in the south, Lieutenant General Oleg Tsokov was killed it seems by a long-range missile that's being blamed by Russian bloggers potentially on British supplied Storm Shadow missiles. This again is another commander, for different reason, suddenly not in their post in the most vital part of the area which Russia is defending from Ukraine's continued counteroffensive, this picking up pace. These departures will have a tactical impact regardless of how fast these people are replaced. Yesterday, the Russian ministry of defense put a brave face on, saying that Wagner's handed over 2,000 pieces of equipment, tanks, artillery, et cetera. But really what we're seeing here is increased dissent spilling out at the public, that's exceptionally rare. It will damage morale, but most likely, it'll damage Russia's performance in the very places they need to fight hardest -- Erin.",

So he definitely has some place to live.But what we did, we produced kind of psychological portrait of Mr. Prigozhin. We tried to answer the question what kind of person he is and how his personality could influence the mutiny that he started on June 24th. And we also went into the details of his relationship with Putin. And the picture looks very gloomy. Prigozhin is a real sadist, a man really and truly obsessed with cruelty, unimportant physical or verbal cruelty. For example, just a short example, you must understand that in Prigozhin's office in St. Petersburg in a very visible place, there was a photograph of the severed head of African rebels who were killed by Wagner group presumably in the Central African Republic. Just imagine, just the photographs of the head. We also found a lot of evidence of how Prigozhin personally beat his employees or gave orders for cruel punishment of ordinary people including some Russian opposition leaders and their relatives. So, it's also clear that Prigozhin has been personally associated with Putin for a very long time, at least since 1995, they know each other.",

Maybe Prigozhin takes command of Belarusian forces, blends them in with Wagner Group, opens a northern front. Maybe Prigozhin goes back to Africa. I think all this is sort of being worked out. Maybe this is a way of getting at Lukashenko, giving Lukashenko a pat on the back for stopping the coup. Here, you take Prigozhin, and then Prigozhin works for Putin underneath. We just don't know what this is. But, remember, Putin is a trained intelligence agent. He's not a Western political leader. He operates on schemes. He has -- he uses maskirovka. So, you can't assume it's straightforward. We're all saying he's weaker now, but that's the consensus of Western opinion. But actually, he's used this to tighten up his grip.

Benson is the latest in a growing list of state officials who have cooperated with the investigation. And we know have appeared in front of that grand jury.

So, Zach, what more can you tell me? ZACHARY COHEN, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Yeah, Erin, I've learned that we can now count Jocelyn Benson, Michigan secretary of state, among this group of state officials who have been interviewed by the special counsel's prosecutors in just the last few weeks. It's yet another indication that Jack Smith's team is honing in on what former President Donald Trump and his allies were doing at the state level after the 2020 election in a bid to overturn the results. Now, Jocelyn Benson is an interesting witness to speak with prosecutors. She was one of the loudest voices in real time trying to knock down those baseless claims about voter fraud. Michigan, of course, was at the center of a lot of those unfounded claims that Trump and his attorneys were pushing at the time. But Benson, like others that have gone into talk with prosecutors can add testimony to what they were seeing on the ground after the 2020 election and how that did not line up with what Trump and his lawyers were trying to convince the population that was actually happening. So, look, another witness from a state official that's gone in, spoken to prosecutors in recent weeks. And this investigation does seem to continue to be progressing towards a charging decision.

For example, we had a newspaper article I put into the record indicating the FBI wanted to just call the whole thing off when the president's lawyer asserted that a diligent search had been done and everything had been found.

But you've got a Green Party candidate who's going to be on that final ballot, right? I mean, that's the way it goes. Green Party is a party.Cornel West, David Axelrod was saying he's worried about Cornel West. He believes that that could cost Biden dearly, right? You just have to siphon off a few thousand votes in a few states. Do you worry that a progressive African American candidate is going to appeal more to Black voters who have been cooling to Biden in recent polls? We see it in recent polls, support for Biden among African Americans dropped from 84 percent in 2021. It's down to 56 percent from earlier this year. I mean, that's a stunning plunge.",

Obviously, every single vote will matter. But what we are seeing voters are becoming increasingly unhappy with elected officials. That's not particular to President Biden.But, again, I believe that when the policies are focused on in the midst of a campaign when people are reminded of how the American Rescue Plan Fund sent money to cities in Atlanta, it stopped us from having to furlough city employees. It allowed us to do things that we otherwise wouldn't be able to do. When these type policies I think are put in front of the voters at the height of a campaign, I'm less concerned about a third-party candidate. Do I wish that there were not a third-party candidate? Certainly. Cornel West has a lot of respect not just in the African American community but across the country. So do I wish that he were not a candidate? I certainly do because we know that the margins will be thin. But I'm still very confident that President Biden will be re- elected.",

She carried a message of peace. North Korean athletes and cheer squads got a warm welcome to the 2018 Winter Olympics.She rose to fame as a fixture to her brother's side, standing silently behind Kim as he met with former President Trump, that brief period of diplomacy feels like a distant memory. The silent sister now a loud voice of defiance, issuing fiery statements on state media, often laced with crude language. This week, she threatened to shoot down U.S. spy planes, accusing them without evidence of entering North Korean territory. Warning, in case of repeated illegal intrusions, the U.S. forces will experience a very critical flight. Past actions prove she's not all talk. In 2020, a dispute with South Korea ended with a bang. Kim ordered the demolition of a joint liaison office at the border, turning diplomatic dreams into a pile of rubble. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera):  She blew up that building because she was angry about activists sending balloons with leaflets that opposed the regime. That was her response, let's blow up the building. And she is the second most powerful person in this nation that has an ever- growing nuclear arsenal. And yet she's the one that says the U.S. is hostile and aggressive. She called South Korea's president a fool recently. And now that the Washington declaration will strengthen the military alliance between the U.S. and South Korea, we can expect a lot more from her, Erin.",

Team of journalists from the \"A.P.\", you may remember them, because they chose to remain in the besieged city of Mariupol, as Putin carried out horrifically brutal attacks, like the bombing of that theater that was sheltering women and children, civilians. These \"A.P.\" reporters were the only international reporters in the city, and they were documenting Russian troops targeting civilians, killing children, killing the elderly.In the documentary titled \"20 Days in Mariupol\", the reporters are sharing the images they were not able to get to the world at the time.

Mstyslav, I am so glad to see you. I remember those days when we knew nothing happening was there but we know you were there. You were there sacrificing, risking your life. You were capturing exclusive footage from the very start of the invasion in Mariupol, footage we would never know, things we would never know happened if it were not for you. The Russian tanks coming in, as you and your team are alone and reporters in that city. People are dying all around you. You chose to stay. You were the world's eyes and ears. You were historical record for this atrocity. Why did you do it, Mstyslav? What did you see? MSTYSLAV CHERNOV, AP REPORTER &amp; DIRECTOR, \"20 DAYS IN MARIUPOL\": Well, I think decision -- the decision to go to Mariupol and to stay there came before even the siege began, as it was clear that the invasion is going to-- the new wave of the invasion is going to start. We knew Mariupol as a key city going to be a target, and just logistically, let's say it is going to be surrounded. The choice came naturally, and we made this choice, we felt responsible as Ukrainians, as part of the community to just to tell the story of our fellow Ukrainians as an international journalist as well, it is my job. So, it's just -- considering all risks, we didn't -- we didn't know that we will be specifically targeted by Russian diplomats as information terrorists, and we didn't know that we will be alone there, but we were ready to keep working until we can, and we did.",

These attacks are happening all the time, deliberate attacks.So being able to capture this moment, being able to make sure it will not be forgotten, is very important.
