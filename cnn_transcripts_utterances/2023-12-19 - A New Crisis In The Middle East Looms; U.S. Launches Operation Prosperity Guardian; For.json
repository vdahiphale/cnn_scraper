And we must warn you, some of the video you're about to see is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ISA SOARES, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Sheer terror inside southern Gaza's Nasser hospital. An artillery strike has just hit somewhere in the building. With the power cut, people inside rush with flashlights and mobile phones to try and find where and who has been struck. Here they find her. Wrapped in a blanket is the body of 13-year-old Gina Abu Mossem. She had been recovering from an amputation at the hospital following a previous strike in Khan Younis according to the Hamas- controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. Weapon remnants found by her bed were consistent with an Israeli illumination shell, a weapons expert told CNN. In the destroyed grounds of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, another heart-breaking goodbye. This hospital had been under siege for days by Israeli troops, who claimed it was operating as a command and control center for Hamas. But they withdrew from Kamal Adwan on Saturday, saying in a statement, quote, their activity in the area was completed, and released video of a small amount of weapons they apparently found there. According to the U.N.'s Office for Humanitarian Affairs, quote, \"An Israeli military bulldozer flattened the tents of a number of internally displaced persons outside the hospital, killing and wounding an unconfirmed number of people.\" UNKNOWN (through translator): We have been displaced and today, they demolished the building, killing doctors, leaving nothing behind. They haven't even spared the doctors. Look, my son is here, under the rubble, and I can't reach him. SOARES (voice-over): The IDF has not yet commented on this allegation. Over the weekend, the WHO chief said that, quote, \"Attacks on hospitals, health personnel and patients must end, as medical facilities and those inside continue to bear the brunt of this war.\" Isa Soares, CNN, London.

Those evacuations have taken place from that town, the fishing town of Grindavik, 4000 people evacuated in all. They had been allowed home during the day. Now, they're being kept away. You can see in those pictures really just how spectacular the scenes are there on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwestern Iceland. That began at 10 P.M. yesterday. What we saw is that Fischer, the main crack, emerged. It is now four kilometers long, and for a while you are seeing 200 cubic meters of lava erupting, emerging from that crack every single second, so many hundreds overnight. What we're hearing, the very latest though, is that Grindavik may yet be spared from the lava flows. We understand from local authorities that they are now heading towards the north and east and therefore away from the town itself. Icelandic authorities have said obviously the main priority here is to protect human lives, although infrastructure of course is a crucial consideration, as well.

Do you think that this new coalition will be able to be a more effective deterrence against the Iranian-backed Houthis than the initial deterrent set out by the U.S.? And that is having two carriers in the region. MARK ESPER, FORMER U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Yeah, first of all, good to be with you both. Look, I think the carriers going back to early October were a good move in the wake of what happened on October 7th, the murder of what, 1200 or so Israelis. But they were there more to deter Hezbollah actions in southern Lebanon, northern Israel, and of course, eventually the arrival of the second carrier strike group to deter Iran. We're now dealing with, over the past several weeks, multiple attacks by the Houthi rebels with both missiles and drones against ships, presumably Israeli-linked, but it seems to be much broader.

They say as long as the United States supports Israel, as long as Israel continues its assault into Gaza, they're going to threaten this waterway, which is quite narrow.

Welcome, Michael. So let's think back to where we were at the beginning of 2023 when you had Ukraine really promising this sort of spectacular counteroffensive. They promised that they were going to sort of claim back Ukrainian territory that was occupied by Russia. And you think to where we are now, I mean, the gains by Ukraine have certainly been modest. I think that's not even putting that generously. Where did it all go so wrong for Ukraine and how does Zelenskyy get things back on track?",

And it's coming as, you know, we heard President Zelenskyy say he isconfident that European aid will come, but it's pretty clear that we have got about $100 billion on the line if you combine the 50 or so billion that is up for grabs now and being debated by the E.U. and obviously the 60 billion in the supplemental here in the United States. How much concern is there about the timing of these bills and this funding being agreed to and going to Ukraine and what are some of the consequences of it not getting there soon enough?",

And when Ukraine reallyneeds that, for example, the 61 billion that has been pledged by the White House goes towards military support, budget support, for example, salaries for teachers and pensions, also humanitarian needs and energy. And Russia has been striking energy infrastructure in Ukraine relentlessly. It's really shocking because politicians, whether here in North America or in Europe, should know better. They should know that if Mr. Putin is not pushed back, and I mean completely back to where he started, that he will make more territorial grabs. He will threaten the E.U. more. He will weaponize even further -- migration, energy and food. And Bianna, these are all things, as you well know, that will have reverberations across the world, as they already have. Higher fuel prices, higher food prices. Can Europe even handle more waves of migration should Mr. Putin strike more? So -- but you know, this is what we're seeing even here in Canada, a kind of infiltration of local politics into foreign affairs, where politicians are being very short-sighted, calculating their chances of being re-elected and not looking at the bigger picture of what would happen if an autocratic dictator like Mr. Putin is allowed to get his way.",

We could see that at the press conference today. I was listening to it in Ukrainian. He's projecting confidence, determination and even hitting back quite forcefully at questions about corruption. But I think he has to do this because in all the time I spent in Ukraine, I've spent most of the war there, you are realizing now this growing fatigue and weariness, families are being split up, people are no longer having the means to spend the way they could. So, he has to do this, number one, to keep the morale up. But you know, having said that, I don't know how he's going to get around things. For example, mothers and wives are protesting that their sons, their fathers are spending way too much time at the front lines, they hardly see them anymore. I know there's talk of immobilization, but that could be very expensive. And to directly answer your question, I think the air tinkering with, for example, the supply chains to make themselves more resilient, more independent of the West, for example, manufacturing more artillery, that sort of thing within Ukraine. But what's really needed immediately to just help the Ukrainian population get through this winter, because in fact an air raid siren just went off where I'm living in Odessa, is that more Patriot missile systems to push back those very, very damaging drones and missiles that Russia is sending to Ukraine almost on a daily basis.",

Now, there istalk in Ukraine of perhaps having an election, but that would be a terrible mistake, actually a tragedy during wartime for a number of reasons. Poll workers couldn't be protected. How are the millions of Ukrainians overseas going to vote -- that sort of things. So, I think, unlike in Israel where the average Israeli is calling for Mr. Netanyahu to go at any second now. I think people are willing to see Mr. Zelenskyy see the war through, but I think in order for him to do that, he has to tinker a little bit with things. For example, Martial Law, for example, might be suspended in areas of the country where there isn't active fighting. The other thing we're seeing is that, you know, if you tune in as Ukrainian to the press conference, you have to get into this 24-7 so-called T.V. marathon, where all of the main channels have been corralled at the beginning of the war, to give a pretty pro-presidential, I'd say, report of what's going on. And the opposition channels weren't included for this. This has to stop, I think Ukrainians can handle more critical reporting and more free and independent media. And I think that would also help bolster Ukraine's image overseas. So, little things he can do here and there, but I think he's there to stay. And one more thing I have to remind everyone that when he was running for president, he did promise to run only for one term. So, if an election were to happen, it could be a farewell for him if he sticks to his pledge.",
