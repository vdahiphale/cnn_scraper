The Biden administration is expected to announce that Ticketmaster and Live Nation will now give customers the actual price -- the actual price of their tickets before they hit purchase. So, that means that consumers and customers will be able to see all of those frustrating hidden fees upfront.CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us now from the White House with the details. So, Arlette, what is today's announcements mean for consumers and people at home?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, this is an issue that has affected so many Americans. You go to buy a concert ticket or other type of ticket and you see a price. But then when you get to the end of final checkout, you see that there certainly have been more items and fees added to that initial cost.And the -- what the White House is trying to do today is show that President Biden has used his bully pulpit to encourage companies to eliminate some of those hidden fees. Providing more information to consumers at the very start of the process. This afternoon, he will be hosting CEOs of major companies that have offered some commitments when it comes to disclosing pricing upfront. Some of those commitments are coming from some major entertainment and ticketing companies. Live Nation has said that they will be presenting one clear total price to their consumers when it comes to tickets. And Ticketmaster will soon be enabling an option that allows you to see all-in pricing as you're beginning to purchase those tickets. There are other companies like SeatGeek, and Airbnb who are also participating in this meeting this afternoon. And part of this is really the part of the Biden administration and the White House's push to focus on some kitchen table issues, especially as the economy and inflation remain top of mind for voters heading into the 2024 election. Now, all of these announcements that are coming today, they are voluntary. But the president has pushed Congress to pass a bill called the Junk Fee Protection Act, which would be aimed at addressing excessive concert fees, also airline fees, early termination fees, and destination fees. This is all a push from the White House trying to identify and address some of those issues that everyday Americans are facing that and that are hitting their pocketbooks. And so, we'll hear a little bit more from these companies in the White House later today.",

They've been incredibly powerful, incredibly intense, and the prosecution began by really contrasting an otherwise beautiful morning on October 27, 2018, at the Tree of Life synagogue here in Pittsburgh.Saying Sylvan and Bernice Simon, they were sitting in their usual pews. Irving Younger was passing out a prayer book. Cecil Rosenthal was greeting everyone who walked in. A beautiful picture on a rainy morning. But then the prosecution describes Robert Bowers, the defendant, turning a sacred house of worship into a hunting ground. And the prosecution was seeking to emphasize that Bowers killed Jewish people just because they were Jewish. And I got to say, the prosecution then went back and showed quite a number of the graphic, intense, horrible images of so many of the victims in that synagogue. It was visceral. It was brutal. We also heard more of those 911 calls we've been hearing all throughout this trial so far. And I got to say the family members, we can actually see them from our vantage point sitting in the main rows in that courtroom, they were still wick, they were dead set paying attention to the prosecution as the prosecution said every word. I got to say the prosecution also emphasize that Bowers, in their words, showed no remorse and said that they own -- he only stopped shooting because he ran out of ammunition. This is all to illustrate the point the prosecution has been proving this whole time that Bowers was there to kill Jewish people because they were Jewish. Now, at this point, we're still waiting for the defense to bring up their closing arguments. Remember, they did not bring up a single witness, but we're interested to hear what they have to say because they're focused on potentially the next phase if Bowers is convicted, that death penalty sentencing phase. That's the latest from here. We'll bring you more as we have it, Rahel.",

Take a look.This video shows an incident where killer whales bid off both rudders from a catamaran. This was happening near Spain. It's one in a series of encounters involving orcas actually sinking boats this year and sparking debate among experts as to what's prompting all this behavior. Spanish authorities now warning sailors to immediately leave the area if they see anything unusual in the waters. You wouldn't have to tell me twice. Let's bring in a wildlife and conservation expert Jeff Corwin, actually on a boat to help sort those facts from the fears. Jeff, great to have you. Looks like a great shot where you are, wherever you are, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. So, it does seem like there has been an increase in these types of attacks. I mean, what is prompting this? JEFF CORWIN, WILDLIFE &amp; CONSERVATION EXPERT: Yes, Rahel, I can report with confidence. No orcas here. I'm safe. And all as well. But that would not be the case in Spain. It's really incredible what we're seeing when it comes to really novel animal behavior. We've always known that orca whales are really intelligent as most of the cetaceans, the marine mammals. That includes the dolphins, the porpoises, and the whales. But this is really unique. So, what is likely has happened is that one individual whale, a very dominant female leader of a pod, she had a negative traumatic encounter with a boat. She was probably hit or stoked by a boat. There have been a number of accounts where anecdotally boats have hit orca whales in this part of Europe. So, she has associated this boat as danger as the enemy and so she has taken it upon herself to attack these boats when they come too close. But even more incredibly, is she's taught this behavior, this response, this defense than offense to other members of her pod.",

They discover. They explore. Also, play is a big part of the life of an orca whale and other dolphin-like whales.So, basically, through play, exploration, and discovery, they pick up behaviors and learn and respond in ways that allow them to adapt to their environment. So, yes, she has learned that for her, ships, specifically sailboats, they seem to be targeting sailboats, and especially catamarans. Then she teaches that behavior to other whales, then other whales teach that behavior to other members of the pod or other transient whales they may meet in the area. This is nothing new. For example, we've seen this with hunting techniques off of the coast of South America. Orca whales can incredibly beach themselves to grab first seals and bring them into the water. They teach that behavior to their offspring. Whales will actually cut through ice to trap seals in the Arctic, a behavior they then teach. These are very smart critters. They learn, they discover, they make those discoveries, and then share them with other members of their community.",
