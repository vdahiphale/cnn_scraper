Later today, President Biden is heading back on the campaign trail, and what does that political landscape look like on that trail today? The president hoped his NATO summit press conference would prove Democratic doubters wrong and refocus attention elsewhere. It did for some. It definitely did not for others. After the press conference three more Democrats spoke up to say that they think he should step aside -- Congressmen Jim Himes, Scott Peters, Eric Sorensen. Now, at least 17 Democrats in Congress are breaking from the president. CNN's Lauren Fox is tracking all of this reaction from last night, today, and for tomorrow, of course.

Because the focus right now is on Biden rather than Trump, and that is something the Democrats want to avoid going forward. Now, I think it is important to point out that we asked leader Jeffries, the top Democrat in the House, yesterday where he was, and he said he is still talking to all of his members and until he has conversations with every single one of them, he is going to put off having a larger meeting with his leadership team.

There were 31 other NATO nations whose heads of state were in Washington all week and several other Indo-Pacific observer countries.So, President Biden went from meeting to meeting, speech to speech in his official role as our president while also making time to do campaign events. He had a great rally with the AFL-CIO, for example, in the middle of the day. And late at night, last night, he gave a 10-minute speech about our place in the world. The importance of NATO. How it contributes to our security and prosperity. And then took a dozen questions. And I just want your viewers to ask themselves this question. If Donald Trump had been on that stage for an hour last night asking questions from reporters about foreign policy, could he possibly have delivered the answers our president did? We all know the answer is no. We would have gotten a weird, bizarre, diatribe full of vengeance. Comments about women's appearance. Strange remarks about inviting Hannibal Lecter over to dinner, or whether he'd rather be eaten by sharks or electrocuted. I'm not making this up. These are things he has said in recent campaign rallies. As President Biden said, Trump has spent much of this last two weeks playing golf so that we Democrats can keep digging a hole and picking on each other and debating. President Biden made clear last night as he made clear in a letter to all of us he's decided he's running for re-election.

He has, in the last two weeks, campaigned in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania. He is about to go to Michigan for the day today. And he has had good all-day campaign events. He's done small events. He's done large events. He did the Stephanopoulos interview. On Monday, in Texas, he's going to be doing a long interview with Lester Holt. He has done scripted things, like his compelling speech at the NATO summit. He's done unscripted things. So, frankly, I have been urging my colleagues to keep this a family conversation and not work through their emotions and concerns in editorials and public speeches, but to convey their concerns to our president. He has been listening. He has met with and heard from dozens and dozens of leaders -- mayors, governors, House members, senators.

There wasn't some big vision of what the next four years is. He answered the questions he was asked, but he may never have a platform as big as the one he had on the debate stage. So it's tough to see the case for how he's going to turn around these battleground polls we see where he's losing outside of the margin of error in nearly all of them to Donald Trump.",

It's also about what happened two weeks ago. And it's also about what happened today. And lost in that is the lack of vision or the mess of a vision that he can be making -- should -- could be making against his opponent Donald Trump. I want to read for you -- getting really to your point, Peter Baker ofThe New York Times, said at -- the top of his analysis today I think summed it up pretty well, which was this. \"Did President Biden really think that Donald Trump was his vice president instead of Kamala Harris? Of course not. Did he actually believe that he was meeting with Vladimir Putin instead of Volodymyr Zelenskyy? Not at all. But when it comes to his political future, did it matter that he mixed up those names in front of television cameras on Thursday? Well, it certainly did not help.\" So how did this become a Rorschach test in, like, lightning speed and overnight? And the fact that it has, I don't understand what that means for the -- what happens now.",

It felt like we have lowered the bar for the American presidency so low in the era of Donald Trump that simply being able to explain why we support NATO is like oh, that was so presidential. That was my genuine takeaway.How voters perceive it may be different though because as we saw in Gary Tuchman's group, these are complicated times. These are complicated issues that he's talking about and he's pulling from his years of experience. But again, I think what voters are -- I think what actually we're going to be talking about the most a week from and two weeks from now was the answer to the first question about the vice president. You chose her to be your vice president. Does that mean you think she's capable to be the president? And he answered affirmatively.",
