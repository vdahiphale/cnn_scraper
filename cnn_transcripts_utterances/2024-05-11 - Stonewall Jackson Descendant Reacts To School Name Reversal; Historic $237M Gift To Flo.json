I mean, that's enough money to make you want to shop, right? To start making plans, telling everybody you know, but then you find out that the actual value of that gift could be zero. Well, that's what happened this week on an historically black college -- black university campus in Tallahassee, Florida. This would have been the largest donation ever to an HBCU. And we know how these schools have been so underfunded, right? This one has had some very public financial challenges especially. But to understand this massive collapse, let's go back one week to May 4. That's the day of Florida A and M University's Commencement. Gregory Gerami is introduced as the CEO of Batterson Farms Corporation. He gave a speech that ended with a surprise announcement, along with a huge ceremonial check. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

On stage with him there, the school's president called The Gift transformative for the institution. That delay Robinson said it was more than $100 million larger than FAMU used current endowment.Really an historic gift from a 30 year old, whom they'd never heard of within hours, the announcement, alumni started to ask some serious questions online. Whether the story was just too good to believe, they and others started researching Gerami and they found some concerning details. One day after commencement, after that announcement, FAMU said in a statement as expected, some individuals in the public are and will continue researching Mr. Gerami. Please know that FAMU has done its due diligence when it comes to this matter. Well, we researched Mr. Gerami and the donation. Here's what we found. First, we obtained a copy of the gift agreement through an open records request. It shows that Gerami donated 14 million shares of stock valued at $239 million plus another 61 million worth of stock over the next 10 years. The University says it was of his small Texas Company that is not publicly traded. The agreement is between the Issac Batterson Family 7th Trust and the FAMU Foundation and details or even existence of this trust are not public record. But a man who controls that much wealth, a man who could give away nearly a quarter billion dollars you would expect the lives a certain lifestyle that would match that. Well record show that his company's mailing address is an 1,100 square foot house in San Antonio, valued at 177 grand. He didn't even own that house. We went to the website for his company Batterson Farms Corporation, it explains that it's a hydroponic farming and hemp plastic company founded in 2021. We looked for employees, there's one other person listed. Her name was Kim Abbott lists her is the co-CEO so we called her up. She said she is not the co-CEO of this company, despite what the website says. And we asked her whether she believed that Gregory Gerami could make good on a nine figure donation. She told us that she didn't know if he could support a donation of any size. Members of the FAMU Foundation's board of directors say they did not know anything about this donation to the foundation until the OJ Song started playing a commencement. Well, that's a red flag because the purpose of the board is to oversee major gifts. At an emergency meeting Thursday night, foundation board members were skeptical of Gerami's, \"the money is in the bank\" lie. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Listen to this, he told the Tallahassee Democrat newspaper that he does well and quote, \"keeping things off the web and keeping things under radar\". He added this, \"I will say everything is out there. The only thing you cannot find is the money. That's really the only thing you can't find online.\"Next week, the FAMU board of trustees will be holding their own public meeting on this. The vice chair of the board was among the first to raise questions about the donation and Deveron Gibbons joins me now. Mr. Gibbons, thank you for your time today. I look at this and nearly quarter billion dollar donation and we'll get into who knew and who did not. But from your perspective, did they just want it too badly? That they do want it to believe that this 30 year old out of nowhere had a quarter billion dollars to give. DEVERON GIBBONS, VICE CHAIR, FLORIDA A&amp;M UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES: Victor, good morning. Yes. I think that the FAMU folks, it's unfortunate that they did -- I don't think that they did their due diligence. But also, this is the reason that a board of trustees exists. I'm currently on the board of three college and two universities in Florida. And red flags went up. I happened to be with my mother. I didn't have an opportunity to go to the graduation. I had to take her to take care of some business out of town. I got the text messages. And when I read it, I immediately said there's some things wrong.

We have a gift and a donor of clause in our bylaws. And we follow that accurately into the rule. And any gift you are supposed to bring it to the board, because we're on the board because we have large networks. We know a lot of people and we understand a lot of these issues. And so it would allow the President and other folks in the administration to get someone to bounce this off of have we done our proper background. Have we done the vetting? Do we hire a tax attorney? Who did the valuation? Who transferred the stocks? I mean, there are so many questions that come up with this particular type of donation. That is why the board trustees in place. We are the fiduciary body of the university. And really it should have come to us to have proper vetting so that we can make sure that we weren't put in a situation.

A group of self-described non-African American voters sued to block the creation of a second majority black district in the state. This is what the map looks like. It was enacted in January.Last week, a conservative leaning lower court struck down this map. The 12 voters say their personal dignity was injured because the map quote, \"racially stigmatizes us, racially stereotypes us, and racially maligns us as citizens who will supposedly make vital decisions as voters based on our race, even though our races and unchangeable physical characteristic that does not compel our beliefs, our character, our judgment or our votes.\" But right now, Louisiana has only one majority black district, only one black representative to Congress, but black people make up almost a third of the state's population. And state officials argue they need to know what the map will be, what they'll be working with by May 15th to prepare for November elections. In their emergency appeal on Friday, the officials told the court that Louisiana's impossible situation in this redistricting cycle would be comical, if it were not so serious. Marina Jenkins has been involved in this Louisiana case. She's executive director of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Marina, Good morning to you.

Warren, thank you for being with me. So on the question of should these names have been restored, they've now made the decision, what's your message to the board there in Shenandoah County?WARREN CHRISTIAN, GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON OF \"STONEWALL\" JACKSON: Well, my message is, I mean, I'm saddened, I'm disappointed. But as a firm believer in democracy, public schooling and local control of schools, I respect their right to rename the school, and I respect their right to do what is morally wrong. And, Victor, I really appreciate you having me on and giving me the opportunity to speak about this. But honestly, I don't think it should matter so much what I have to say about it. The school board shouldn't particularly care what I have to say. And I can't imagine they do. But I think who they should listen to is their own students. And that night before they change -- Thursday night before they changed the name, there was another speaker who I don't think you mentioned, a courageous eighth grader, Alia (ph), who stood up in front of the school board. And she said, I'm a black student. And if the names are restored, I would have to represent a man who fought for my ancestors to be slaves. That makes me feel like I'm disrespecting my ancestors, and going against what my family and I believe. And she's exactly right. No student should have to go to a school named after someone who fought for the continued enslavement of their ancestors. And even for those who liked the name, or wish it hadn't been changed. I don't know how you can vote for that name change to rename it again after my great- great grandfather, after that brave student and others so clearly and cogently explained how that this would harm them. And it costs you nothing to just leave it how it is. So I think it's just wrong.",

You got to think about letterhead and signage and websites and school uniforms and all the things that think about what your high school name was printed on that have already been changed over the last four years.You know, we have this conversation about Confederate monuments. Often it's framed as a reckoning with decisions of another time, of the mood of another era. But when a school board today says we are going to honor Stonewall Jackson, we have to consider what they're telling us today that they think about the people who live in this community. I want to read for you what the Coalition for Better Schools that pushed for this locally what they said, they said that we believe that revisiting this decision is essential to honor our community's heritage and respect the wishes of the majority. The heritage not hate justification to that. You say what?",

How do we help be a steward for just changing every aspect from the wine industry and bringing more people of color and especially more black Americans into this trillion dollar industry? After the post George Floyd movement and we saw a lot of racial injustice in the world, I was made aware of The Roots Fund. And for me, they shared a mission with that we had or I had, which was how do we make the industry more diverse. DUBOSE-WOODSON: I appreciate all of you for coming tonight and supporting our organization.

They use photography, film and augmented reality to raise awareness of issues impacting their community.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BETTY YU, CO-FOUNDER, CHINATOWN ART BRIGADE: My name is Betty Yu. And I'm a co-founder of Chinatown Art Brigade. And I'm also a multimedia artists, filmmaker and installation artist. Our brigade was created in 2015. And all of us who are artists, scholars, tenants, residents, we all have a real deep love for Chinatown. We've seen about 130 galleries, mostly commercial galleries replace Mom and Pop places. And artists are often thought of as the vanguard of gentrification and neighborhoods, right, the up and coming neighborhoods. But we want to change that narrative. We've been working with tenants to put projections on walls at night. And it's their stories of how displacement is affecting them. And so people in Chinatown actually see the immediate connection between what's happening here in Chinatown in the U.S. locally, and what's happening in Gaza and also the solidarity around displacement and what global displacement looks like. And so they're the ones actually who want to participate in the marches. Sometimes it's just the process of bringing people together to make a banner, to paint a banner together to make signs. Art culture and media has the power to really change hearts and minds. And for us, the huge -- sort of putting a lens on the human story, the human impact story is really, really important.
