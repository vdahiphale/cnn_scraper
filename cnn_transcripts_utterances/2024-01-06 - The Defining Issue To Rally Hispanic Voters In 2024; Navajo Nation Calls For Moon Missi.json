He says that is what the 2024 election is all about. Sure. But with a new poll that shows that nearly half of independents say that too much has been made of January 6, and it's time to move on. Does that framework earn him a second term? We'll get into it with an advisor to the president.Plus, a group that works to elect Latinos to Congress says if there's one issue that will define this election for Latino voters, it's not immigration. The leader of that group is here to explain what it is and why. And we have details of a last-minute meeting after the Navajo Nation asked the White House to delay a mission to the moon scheduled to launch on Monday. The president of the Navajo Nation is with us to explain why this mission would be a desecration of the moon. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. Republicans are 10 days out from their first caucus votes, but President Biden is looking ahead to the general election. He says that this will be about democracy and freedom. In his speech in Pennsylvania ahead of January 6, the president argued that Donald Trump and the GOP are threats to both. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And on Monday, President Biden will speak at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. You remember that's the historically black church where a man killed nine people during Bible study in 2015.Let's talk about this with Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta. He's a member of the Biden Harris campaigns National Advisory Board, and he joins us from South Carolina. Sir, you are the right person to speak with from Pennsylvania in South Carolina advising the campaign. Let me first ask you after I say good morning, the message of taking this next event to South Carolina to Mother Emanuel. MALCOLM KENYATTA, MEMBER, BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN NATIONAL ADVISORY BOARD: Yes. Good morning, Victor. You know, the President yesterday, I think had a legacy-defining speech. It was powerful, it was substantive. And it continues to drive home the point that this next election is about ensuring that we can have elections, about ensuring that the promise of America that people get to decide not only their representatives but the direction of their government. And if Donald Trump is to be elected, again, the fundamental democracy that we've come to depend on as the bedrock of all of our other freedoms, that is really at risk. And I don't think it's hyperbolic what the President laid out yesterday. This former President Donald Trump has made it very clear that he wants to be a dictator on day one. He is proud of the fact that he appointed the justices that overturned Roe v. Wade. He wants to go back to an economic system where he's given more and more of the benefits to the wealthiest Americans while working families like mine and North Philadelphia struggle to get by. And I think that as we continue to make this case, you mentioned it, I'm going to be here for a number of events, the vice president be here, the President will be here. He's speaking to every single part of his base every single part of our nation and coming back here to South Carolina to make it clear. He's not taking anybody or any vote for granted.",

      "sentences": "You know, I will say this. This, you know, three years since this attack, which we all watched, and I could never imagine that I would see a day where a president of the United States would encourage folks to come to the Citadel of democracy or U.S. Capitol, and to file it in the way that they did using, not just armed with -- with weapons, not just using violence, but also armed with lies pushed to them by the President. So I think what's very clear, and this President understands that his key responsibility is to make sure that democracy doesn't die on his or our watch. And he has to make that case. That's the point of -- of campaigning. You make your case to the American people.And I think that because too many folks in the Republican Party, who've either you know parroted directly the talking points of the former president and other Republicans who said it was just a peaceful tour, or others who've said nothing and been complicit in the reframing. We have to -- we have to push back and remind people of what happened on that day of how close we came to losing our democracy. We can't continue to have the economic growth that we've seen under this president without a strong democracy. We can't continue to lower -- lower the debt burden for it -- for students, borrowers like myself. We can continue to do things like cut the cost of insulin, which 90 percent of Americans support. Both my parents died by the time I was 27 because they didn't have access to the type of health care that everybody deserves. And so what the President has made crystal clear is that this is going to be an election about the work that he's done about finishing the job. But you don't get to do the critical work that's necessary on the economy, on protecting abortion rights, on expanding the right to vote on doing criminal justice reform. None of that is possible if our democratic republic ceased to exist.",

And so here in Pennsylvania, you know, we took the house majority by one vote. And you're absolutely right. I've been on the House State Government Committee, which oversees Pennsylvania's election. And we've pushed back and the majority and the minority on attempts to make it more difficult to vote. And I'm grateful for House Democrats who have continued to make it clear that we're going to make sure we have free and fair elections, but also that we have secure elections, I think, you know, across the country where these barriers have been put in place, you see folks using a strategy of litigation, a strategy of education, and really a commitment and a determination to show up and make their voices heard. And that's why this election and what the President laid out yesterday, was so critical. We have a choice. And this choice is between continuing the democratic experiment, which has had bumps along the way where too many folks who look like me and come from neighborhoods like mine have not always had the type of access to the American promise that they deserve. But we have never, as the President often says, walked away from it.And Donald Trump has made it clear not only does he want to walk away from it, but he does not respect the Constitution. He's not in this race for any of the issues that are motivating people to show up to the polls other than the small Maga days. And he's not the type of person we need.

On Friday, coalition of abortion rights supporters in Florida announced that they now have enough signatures to put a state constitutional amendment protecting the right to an abortion on that state's ballot this year. And we know abortion will come up before the Supreme Court this year too. Democrats rallied around the issue during the 2022 midterms. And now political action committee for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus says that they see reproductive rights as a key to their outreach to Hispanic voters for 2024.Joining me now is Congresswoman Linda Sanchez. She's a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and chairs the bold pack. Congresswoman, good to have you. Up next, let's start here with why this is the issue. The President says this is about democracy. We saw the success of arguing reproductive rights in 2022. Why is this the issue that should be the center? REP. LINDA SANCHEZ, (D) CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS: Sure. Well, we saw because of the results of the 2022 election, that it was a very motivating factor, particularly for Latino voters. And I think where the republican party gets it wrong, they have this blind spot that they don't understand that women, and Latina women in particular, see that as a fundamental right, that is being slowly taken away from them. And it is a very motivating factor for them to show up to knock doors to turn out and to vote. And Latino voters were made a difference in critical states like California and Pennsylvania and Arizona, in the last election cycle, and we expect that it will be a very motivating factor for them in the 2024 election.",

So that's a 40-point, gap there.And 2022, and this is months after the (inaudible) decision reverse Roe. Democrats won only 60 percent of Latino votes, Republicans 39 percent.

Overall, for the Latino community, that's men and women, economic and kitchen table issues are what is foremost driving their vote. But for Latinos, in particular, reproductive care and access to reproductive care is foremost in their mind. Half of Latina women in the United States, half of them are of childbearing age, and they want to have the full range of access to reproductive care. They do not want the Republicans telling them what they can or cannot do with their bodies.They do not want State's Attorney General deciding how sick or close to dying they have to be, in order to access abortion care. There already is a huge discrepancy in terms of access to health care for Latinas to begin with. And now they see it as a critical issue for their own health and well-being. If Latina women don't have access to that care, 42 percent of them live in states that are taking away that right or heavily restricting that right. And they don't have the economic means to be able to travel out of state should they need that kind of care. So it's a very motivating factor for Latina women. We will be bold PAC, which is an all-female lead this year. I'm the I'm the first woman to head Bold PAC.

Now to understand this, here's what you need to know. There are companies that will for fee fly your cremated remains to space, in this case, bury them on the moon. Two private companies that provide these lunar burial services Celestis and Elysium Space planned to send dozens of sets of human remains on a lunar lander set to launch on Monday.But the president of the Navajo Nation says that turning the moon into a burial ground would be offensive to indigenous cultures. They've asked the White House and NASA to delay the launch and consider this that NASA apologized for doing something similar more than 20 years ago. In a statement the CEO of Celestis says they reject the concerns, the flight desecrates the moon, it is a touching and fitting celebration, he says, for our participants the exact opposite of desecration, it is a celebration. Joining me now is the president of the Navajo Nation, Dr. Buu Nygren. Mr. President, thank you for being with me. Let me start here with just the explanation of why sending these human remains, these capsules with DNA to the moon would be considered by the Navajo Nation and others a desecration of the moon.",

But one of the things that our elders and our Hataliis, our medicine people have told me that the moon is sacred. It's in our songs, and it's in our stores, it's in our creation. We've used the moon as a place that we've looked to for hundreds of years to make sure that we continue to exist. So they're a part of ceremonies that have been around with the Navajo people for a long, long time.So when this happened in the 90s, it was very clear that we should make sure that we consult our medicine people, consult the Navajo people before we do something like that. The Navajo Nation has never been opposed to exploration, or curiosity or space missions. It's just the fact that the uniqueness of life is so important that there's only one place no matter how far into the universe, we look, we have looked for decades. Now with the technologies that we have, we haven't found human beings. We haven't found another place like Earth. So to us, it's we're very unique. We're created here on Earth. And we should continue to exist here on Earth as we move along out of this life. So that's one of the things that have -- that the medicine men have told us, and then the fact that there's ceremonies that continue to exist here within the Navajo Nation, and across all indigenous cultures that have looked to the skies for thousands of years. And to know that you have human remains circling the Earth, that's a little concerning to think about, because a lot of us pray to the moon, pray to the moon. And that's the female counterpart of the Sun in our culture.",

And one of the -- I had a discussion after the meeting with the NASA administrator, Mr. Nelson, and he did say, you know, I support you, Mr. President.And but in return, I did ask him, we should sit down and talk about that, if NASA is going to be a part of any mission they should fulfill, even if it's a private company, because most of these private companies would probably not launch into space without the dollars that come along with partnering with NASA. So one of the things I ask is, if NASA is going to be a part of it, they should just have strict guidelines that's set. You know what, we have a promise with indigenous people that exist in the United States that we're not going to -- we're going to consult them, and that we're going to make sure that human remains don't go into space.
