Plus, the head of the U.N. pleading for countries to continue funding its humanitarian aid work in Gaza. As countries withhold support amid allegations. Some U.N. aid agency staffers had a role in the October 7th Hamas attack. Well, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are treating this weekend as the opening salvo for the 2024 general election. Both men are visiting states they'll be sure to win in February's nomination contests. Well, Former President Trump is in Nevada, while current President Biden is in South Carolina. And the insults are flying from opposite sides of the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  You're the reason I am president. You're the reason Kamala Harris is historic vice president. And you're the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you're the reason we're going to win and beat him again. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Let there be no doubt what Joe Biden is doing is a crime against our nation. It's an absolute betrayal of our country, and it's an atrocity against our constitution. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. Crooked Joe will not get away with these crimes. He will be tried at the ballot box in November. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Instead, she's on the ballot for the state's primary. But the caucus is really where the state's crucial delegates will be awarded.And so, that was really a big part of Donald Trump's message on Saturday. He was telling voters to skip the primary altogether and make sure they get out for him on caucus day. But because Donald Trump and his team don't really see Nikki Haley as a player here, that allowed him Donald Trump to pivot to more of a general election message. And a big part of that message was talking about the border. One reason is because the border is a key issue for Nevada. It's a state with a large migrant population. But another part of it is the timing. And that's what I found really noteworthy. He spent a lot of time railing against Congress's bipartisan negotiations over securing the southern border, and he went farther than he had before in declaring that there is, \"Zero chance I will support these horrible open borders betrayal of America.\" Take a listen to how he put it.

And he also argued that he was happy taking the fall for its potential failure.Now, one more thing I just want to point out that I found very noteworthy is that Donald Trump did not address the $83.3 million dollars that a jury decided he owes E.

Maidstone United in the sixth-tier of English football, pulling off a historically huge FA Cup upset after beating second-tier Ipswich Town. Maidstone sit almost a hundred places below their opponents in the English pyramid and they take the lead here just before the break when Lamar Reynolds produces the sublime dink over the keeper. His first ever goal for the club. What a moment for the Jamaican player.Ipswich who are battling to return to the premier league levelling, but then Maidstone getting their way with Sam Corne, finishing off a wonderful team move on the road there at Ipswich. Scenes of pure elation for each and every one of those Maidstone players. Remember, they are a semi-professional, non-league team. Their home stadium holds just over 4,000. But now, they're dreaming big as they reach the FA Cup's fifth round. Their ecstatic head coach from Cameroon, George Elokobi. Now get this, the former Wolves player, and just 80 months ago, still a Maidstone player. Someone who's also appeared in the hit \"Ted Lasso\" series as an opposing player to AFC Richmond on multiple occasions. GEORGE ELOKOBI, MAIDSTONE UNITED MANAGER, PLAYED \"FOOTBALLER\"ON \"TED LASSO\":  I doff my hat out to our community. This is for our community, Maidstone. Again, the magic of the FA Cup. We have to believe. This is an inspirational moment for us all, for Cameroon, for Africa, for every young man that has gone through what I've been through in life. Always believe there is hope. Always believe there is faith. Believe in yourself. Always stay humble and respectful. And if you got that, you can create a group like I've done. You can create a club like our football club.",

He is as well, as I mentioned, he's even played a role on the hit series \"Ted Lasso.\" He certainly brings that joy, that spirit in real life too.[04:55:00] ELOKOBI:  Firstly, \"Ted Lasso\" is a brilliant show. When I had a call -- when I got a call, I wasn't the manager then. So, I was using some of my spare time to explore, was around, explore some of my strengths. I'm a man of many talents. And when the opportunity came to appear in that series, I jumped onto it. It was a fantastic experience to be casted as one of Man City's player at the time. Also, got a chance to obviously meet Pep. We did some shootings down at the Etihad. I know I've played there before as a Premier League player, but this time I came in as a little bit of an actor, if you want to say -- put it that way. It was a fantastic experience, but also learned a lot from it, from the actors. And I met some incredible people in that process, made some connections. And you never know, one day I may find myself in Hollywood, right?",
