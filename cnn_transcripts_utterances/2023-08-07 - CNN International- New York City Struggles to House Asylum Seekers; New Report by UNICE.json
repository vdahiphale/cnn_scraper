And if you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Donald Trump has just a few hours to respond to a protective proposal order that would limit his access to evidence in the 2020 election interference case. Trump's attorneys says that they plan to fight that request. And nearly 120 million people are under severe weather threats across the Eastern U.S. Tornados, thunder storms, heavy winds and large hail are expected over the next few days. New York City is racing to help thousands of migrants who are seeking asylum there. Nearly 100,000 asylum seekers have come through and city's intake center since last spring and nearly 200 cites have been open to shelter them. City officials say that they need federal help. CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval is in New York with more on this growing crisis. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They have been placed at shelter facilities in and around the city. In fact, the Roosevelt Hotel that you see behind me here in Manhattan, that not only serves as a shelter but also as that primary intake facility where many of the newly arrived are directed to, so they can best be at least make contact with those resources that they need. It was as recent as last week that we saw dozens of asylum seekers, mostly men, actually forced to sleep on the sidewalk because of an influx in the numbers. We should note the New York City officials were later able to actually place them in temporary shelter facilities so this weekend no signs of that kind of an issue. However in Eric Adams's most recent remarks, the New York City mayor, he's made very clear that that scene is bound to repeat itself if the city does not receive any further support at the state or at the federal level.

      "sentences": "You know, in Europe and parts of America, like you just mentioned, people are reeling under extreme heat waves. But in South Asia, according to this UNICEF report, that is basing its findings on data from the year 2020, almost half a billion, Bianca, half a billion children have been affected deeply by the high temperatures triggered by climate change in the region.Now, we're talking about 460 million children. At least 460 million children from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Afghanistan, and some other countries in the patch. A few highlights and key take-aways from the report that we have seen and understood was being almost 76 percent of children in South Asia were exposed to high temperature compared to 42 percent globally. Almost 28 percent of children in South Asia were exposed to 4.5 or more heat waves per year, compared to 24 percent globally and 800,000 children in flood-affected areas are in risk of severe heat stress in June 2023. According to this analysis, 3 to 4 children in South Asian have witnessed and been affected by high temperature compared to 1 of 4 globally. So the are staggering figures. And it talks to the plight of one or more children and women who are deeply impacted by climate crisis, and how that's triggered frequent heat waves across South Asia. And supports really that will continue until there is some solution for the region which, of course, we keep talking about, but we don't really see any solid solutions coming our way. Now, according to the regional director of UNICEF South Asia -- I'm going to quote him here. He talks of the concerns that these findings lead to. He says: The lives and well-being of millions of children across South Asia are increasingly threatened by heat waves and high temperatures. Young children simply cannot handle the heat unless we act now, these children will continue to bear the brunt of more frequent and more severe heat waves in the coming years through no fault of theirs. I think the last five words, no fault of theirs, is significant here as well. Because this is a legacy that has been left behind for these young children under the age of 18. The biggest headline from this report, Bianca, would be that children under 18 in South Asia have been hit hardest by climate change that's triggered frequent heat waves and high temperatures in the region.

Where the Matildas, the hometown heroes will play against Denmark in this round of 16. This do or die match. You'll remember that they had to beat Canada to get here. So this is almost like the second knockout stage that the Matildas have had to play. They won 4-nil in that game against Canada, the Tokyo 2020 cold medalists. Now against Denmark, let's see what they can do. Everyone here sweating on the fitness of Sanco, that calf injury has kept her out of the World Cup so far.

Her final play for Team USA was a crucial miss in the penalty shoot-out. It was hardly the ending that she was hoping for, of course. But as CNN's Carolyn Manno reports, the football star will leave an impressive legacy behind her. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALEX MORGAN, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: She is someone who has, I think, made this team so much better than when she entered into it. CAROLYN MANNO, CNN WORLD SPORT (voice-over): A legendary career on the world's biggest stage has come to a bittersweet end for Megan Rapinoe.

As a gay athlete who was never afraid to speak her mind and her truth, she transcended her sport. MEGAN RAPINOE, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: I feel like I used my career to do the thing that I'm, you know, the most passionate about and I feel like it's more of a purpose in life than, you know, doing things out on the left wing. I hope nobody thinks what I did on the field is more important than what I did off it. I don't think it even really comes close. MANNO (voice-over): Rapinoe came out publicly in 2012, and she has always been a voice to the voiceless and an inspiration to the LGBTQ community.",

For years, she was instrumental in the lawsuits brought by the U.S. women who lobbied the U.S. Soccer Federation for equal pay and conditions. In 2022, their sacrifice and determination finally paid off in an equal rate of pay in all friendlies and tournaments, including the World Cup. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Megan Rapinoe challenges and inspires millions of people who believe in themselves and the possibilities of our nation. MANNO (voice-over): She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, becoming the first soccer player ever to receive the medal. A heartbreaking loss to Sweden on penalties in the round of 16 won't be how she imagined her international career ending. But if there's anything to know about Megan Rapinoe, this is not the end.",

Animal experts in Alaska are caring for a rare walrus calf found wandering alone on Alaska's north slope four miles inland. It's unusual, because this species is often found in the ocean or along the coastline and with their mothers. The wayward calf is believed to be just a month hold and has medical issues. [04:55:00] He's now under 24-hour cuddle care at the Alaska Sea Life Center to mimic the maternal closeness that these calves are used to. The center says that he's eating well, remains alert and is on the road to recovery -- which is very good news. It's Elon musk versus Mark Zuckerberg. And this time, they might step into the ring for a physical showdown. Which Musk says will be streamed on X -- formally known as Twitter. In June, the two tech billionaires seen agreed on participating in a cage fight. Sorry if I'm laughing. The stakes for the potential fight were raised last month when Zuckerberg's Meta launched a new Twitter competitor called Threads. But Zuckerberg says that these still waiting for Musk to confirm the suggested date of August 26th for the fight. So that could be quite soon.
