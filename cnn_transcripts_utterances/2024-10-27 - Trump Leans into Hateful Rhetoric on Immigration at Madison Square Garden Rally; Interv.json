The president, the former president has sold out Madison Square Garden and is putting on a spectacle. But the real question is, does this spectacle, given that they are preaching to the converted as Elon Musk noted, do people that are tuning in to this message, are they going to remember that bad things that they didn't like about Donald Trump, or are they going to remember the things they liked about him?

Trump, who we have just gone through with Kristen Holmes and Alex Thompson, fact-checking a number of falsehoods that he has centered around immigration. And we also have heard from people who came before him on the stage and were cheered by that crowd. They called Vice President Harris the anti-Christ, the devil. They railed against what they called effing illegals. This is some of what we have heard out of Madison Square Garden tonight. And of course, the former president is still going.

I also thought it was interesting, he did touch when we were listeningin on General John Kelly and Milley, Mattis. He called them stupid and weak.

John Kelly, I mean, this is something we have seen now for several months.The campaign doesn't believe that this is going to impact them at all. They don't believe these kind of comments have impacted them. They'd say that John Kelly has already spoken out against Donald Trump. You can tell that it's gotten underneath Donald Trump's skin. The fact that he's bringing it up at this rally, the fact that he's bringing up the two of them saying that they were stupid, that they made bad decisions. It clearly goes to show that the fact that they had spoken out against him is getting underneath his skin here.

      "sentences": "Well, and it's not only that the vice president has told people to watch the former president's rallies to see what he's about. But rather, I have been to a rally of hers rather recently where she played clips of the former president talking about, for example, his enemy from within comments. So she has invited them in her own rallies to make her point that it is the former president using what she has described as the same tired playbook.Now, that is much of the response that we are getting tonight as well from campaign officials, from Democratic officials who are watching this and they are seeing it as fearmongering. [20:10:06] They're seeing it as the former president using again the playbook that he has used before when running back in 2016 or in 2020. But this is also part of the strategy that is starting to come together in the closing days of the vice president's campaign. For example, the vice president has recently been using a line where she says that the former president is consumed by what she has called as the, quote, \"enemies list' versus her to-do list. So they are casting a picture of the former president obsessed with revenge, plotting revenge in the Oval Office, and rallies like tonight and the former president rhetoric tonight play into what the vice president and her campaign have been saying that he is consumed by his own troubles or issues with, for example, some of his former officials, be it John Kelly who called him a fascist. Now, in terms of immigration, that has been a political vulnerability for the vice president and for the president for some time now. In fact, it was political vulnerability with Republicans who had attacked the administration repeatedly over the last several years. But it also became an issue with Democrats amid the record number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and then going to these Democratic cities. It also raised alarm among people within the Democratic Party, so not only became a Republican issue, but a Democratic issue as well. And that has been something that they have had to navigate. Now, the vice president, when again presented with this, has called for two things, border security. In fact, she has leaned even harder on that as of late, while also saying there should be, for example, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, trying to strike a balance here. And so this dark rhetoric from the former president is in some ways a problem for this administration and this campaign, knowing of course that there have been border crises over the last three years and that they have struggled to grapple with those crises. But when pressed on this, the campaign will often say that this is just the former president resorting to his fearmongering. So certainly they are seeing it that way and we have to keep an eye out now for these next several days, including Tuesday, where we anticipate the vice president's closing arguments at the Ellipse, and that is where I'm told we'll see more of this dark or rather we will see more from the vice president on this stark contrast between her and the former president, notably with the White House behind her. And notably, of course, where the former president delivered his speech on January 6th, that then led to the attack on the Capitol. So all of this to say is that they are watching this closely. This is the type of rhetoric that they warned about when the vice president talks about the stakes of the election. And Jessica, as we talked about earlier today, what was also interesting about the vice president's remarks here in crucial battleground Pennsylvania, is that she didn't mention the former president, but she talked about the broader tent that they are building because of what they're seeing and what their hope is, is that there are Republicans who are watching tonight, who are turned off by what the former president is saying. And that those are the votes that they can try to peel off from the former president. So certainly, all of this expected to certainly be featured or at least accounted for as the vice president closes out this presidential election.",

I first just want to get your take on what we have heard from the former president tonight and what we've heard from that rally. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): I mean, it's a horror show where they're trying to invoke all of the racist and misogynistic and anti-immigrant themes that they've run their utterly content list campaign on. There are no issues. There's no policies being advanced. It's all about scapegoating people and so it's fitting that they would end up there, what, 85 years after, you know, the last group of authoritarian anti- democratic, you know, fascistic people gathered there. So -- but I think it will backfire. I mean, you know, he seems blissfully unaware when they start off with a comedian calling Puerto Rico a floating pile of garbage that there are more than a million Puerto Ricans just in the New York area alone. And Puerto Ricans are part of our country but of course I think it's a major affront. Hispanic Americans, generally, I mean, if you think the people laughing and cheering about that kind of racist statement distinguished between Puerto Ricans and Venezuelans and Mexicans and Dominicans.

Mark, there were so many facets to tonight's rally to talk about. Melania Trump has barely been seen since Trump announced he was running this cycle. This was her first speech of the year. She came out to introduce her husband at a rally where we saw incredibly dark rhetoric and the kind of people that were going before Trump, the opening act as it were. calling Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage and Harris the anti-Christ. So what do you make of seeing Melania Trump there tonight? MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST (via phone): Well, a couple of things. What's interesting is that Melania Trump, if you go back to 2020, Jessica, she was on the campaign trail onetime basically, and that was about one week before election day. She did it up right outside of Philadelphia. You know, in talking to our good friend, Kate Bennett, at the time, she spent a lot of time covering Melania Trump, but I remember talking to her and her just talking to me about how Melania Trump really wouldn't spend a whole lot of time on the campaign trail. Well, we've seen certainly in this election and you could even argue actually that she's not on the campaign trail. I mean, she went right down the street maybe 20 blocks or so, you know, to do the speech. But she's only done a couple of fundraisers. And other than that, she has been absolutely -- she's been absent but again, not totally surprising given that she is a very private person and the president himself, you know, when asked about this, has noted that she would prefer to stay private as opposed to being in the public eye, which, you know, in this day and age is kind of interesting given the fact that if you're going to run for president United States, you are going to be in the public guy.",

We've seen a lot of different, you know, dynamics amongst spouses on the campaign trail. Sometimes, you know, spouses just love it. You know, they're in it together. You know the husband is in it, the wife is in it, you know, regardless of, you know, who's running. I think we're seeing that on the Democratic side with Kamala Harris and with Doug Emhoff.

And then on the contrast, you have President Trump, who's closing argument is Kamala broke it and he will fix it. And that is something that resonates with the American people. When the vast majority of the American people don't believe that we are moving in the right direction, why would they want to vote to continue the same failed policies we've had for the last few years? And that is why we're seeing President Trump is doing so well in all polling, in the early vote numbers. They look excellent for him because Americans are answering the question that he asked at the beginning of every single rally, are you better off now than you were when I was president? And the overwhelming answer is no. The American people were much better off when President Trump was in office. And that's why he is doing so well. That's why we're seeing a lot of flailing on the Democratic side candidly, messaging is all over the place. President Trump is going to get reelected. He's going to focus on the economy. He's going to focus on immigration and look at the coalition he has built. He has former Democrats. There were people speaking at that rally, African-Americans, Jewish Americans, Hindu Americans. These are a diverse group of people who were united around the concept of we are going to get our country back on the right track. And that's what I think we saw tonight.

Because of the pandemic we saw an unusually high amount of mail-in voting that year. And that in turn caused the lag in results from several key states.

Let's dig in for one quick second and then we'll kind of go back out and explain why it's so important for the bigger picture.What just happened is we saw vote come in from Clayton County. Clayton County is a Democratic county. You can look at the margin right there. Obviously, Joe Biden leads the county pretty handily, and over the course of the night, they have been the county that has been reporting. Hats off to them for working through the night and continuously churning out votes. And as they have continuously churned out votes, batch after batch after batch, even if it was only 200 votes, we're going to Joe Biden by a rate of about 84 percent, 85 percent. That was what he -- that was above what he needed. He's been overperforming. The reason why, Democratic county, reason why, mail-in vote. It's what we've seen across several states. And that put Joe Biden over the top. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Georgia's, you know, secretary of state was talking about how he expects most of the votes to be counted by 8So that's a lot faster, but if it's close, then they'll start looking to overseas ballots, to absentee ballots, to people who, you know, cast provisional ballots.
