His actions raising concerns about efforts to win the release of other Americans in Kremlin custody.And the sports world is stunned as another athlete collapses, this time it's LeBron James' 18-year-old son, Bronny, who suffered cardiac arrest during a college basketball practice. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is reviewing the case. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with the intense scrutiny of the federal grand jury investigating Donald Trump and 2020 election interference. Anticipation about the panel's next move running high right now as Trump has acknowledged he may be indicted again, and he may be indicted soon. CNN's Senior Justice Correspondent Evan Perez is working the story for us. Evan, the federal grand jury was expected to meet today. Where do things stand tonight?",

And, today, we did not see them.So, the question remains, when is this going to happen? The former president was notified, as you pointed out, just over a week ago that an indictment could be coming. And so everything indicates that that is still the case, that the former president is likely to be indicted by the special counsel. It's just a matter of when. Now, we've been -- it's a bit of a guessing game, right? The last time, there was more than three weeks between the time, a target letter and the time of the indictment. We don't anticipate that that could happen this time. There's no indication the former president is asking to meet with the Justice Department to try to forestall this, to try to prevent this. And so now, it's just a matter of whether the grand jury will show up on Thursday. Now, there's a lot of things that could explain a delay. One of the possibilities, Wolf, is the fact that the Justice Department has another very big case that is coming to court tomorrow in Delaware. That's the case of Hunter Biden. He's pleaded guilty to a couple of tax crimes. And so that's one of the things that we know the Justice Department is very sensitive to. Obviously, there's a lot of focus on that. And the idea of indicting the former president just right before this other case is probably something that might raise some concerns on Capitol Hill. At this point, though, Wolf, the possibility or the expectation is that we're going to see this grand jury come into the courthouse and hand down an indictment, and then the former president will be notified, and then he'll tell the world about it.",

There could have been personal conflicts on the part of some of the prosecutors or some of the grand jurors for any other number of reasons.It's also important to note, Wolf, that though the target letter went out last -- news of it was released last Sunday, the former president had until Thursday to respond or come in, signify he was coming in to the grand jury. It's really only been four days since that happened. In prosecutor terms, in court terms, that's really not a long time and not an incredibly unreasonable delay. And so I think backing up Evan's point, an indictment is probably imminent and imminent can mean a matter of days or weeks when you're talking in prosecutor speak.",

And that sentiment among Republicans, who matter the most to him right now, because he wants to get the nomination when the voting starts early next year, they have rallied behind him. And there's no indication that that has changed.If anything, the indications are that his lead is becoming more and more cemented and that as he gets closer to another indictment, if he's driving in the race for president, he's looking in the rear-view mirror and everybody else who is running, they're getting smaller and smaller and smaller as he gets in more legal trouble. It is still something that -- it's something that we've almost come to accept with somebody like Donald Trump, but it is worth noting how incredibly unusual and upside-down the sentiment is and this phenomenon is for anybody else who is not named Donald Trump.",

But right now, based on the private conversations he's having, he's not planning on showing up.And that's despite people like Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, going to him personally and urging him, making their case for why he needs to show up. But I think as his legal troubles are piling up, but as what you just noted there, how well he's doing in the polls and whether or not Republican voters seem -- whether it registers and affects their support, it's factoring into his thinking but also what he is hearing from advisers whether or not it's worth it for him to show up.

And they don't appear to be directly related to affect the timing of a Trump indictment. And I think to Kaitlan's point, certainly, the Justice Department and Jack Smith's office, they're all very keenly aware of the calendar. They know that the first debate is just within a month. And so you have to believe that if they're going to do this, they know they have the clock ticking. And so the former president, if they decide they're going to indict him and then perhaps come back and address some of the other people who were part of this, these efforts, these schemes to overturn the election, they could do that.

He was taken to Kyiv for medical treatment, firstly. And then he was evacuated to Germany. We understand that he's now being treated at a U.S. military medical facility, the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center that is near the Ramstein Airbase. But, Wolf, there's still a lot of questions that we don't have the answers to. What are the extent of injuries? Where was he when he was injured? What unit was he fighting with? Let's remind our viewers that Reed was held in Russia in prison for three years, from 2019 until last year. The U.S. had determined that he was wrongfully detained. He was traded last year for a Russian pilot named Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been convicted by the U.S. for drug smuggling. The Biden administration is making clear they do not want to see Reed or others like him coming here to Ukraine, fighting here in Ukraine. We heard from U.S. officials today saying that Reed was not engaged in any activities on behalf of the U.S. government.

We went to France before. We declared war on Germany in World War I. We did the same thing in World War II. And now with Ukraine, you have a situation where so many people believe what Jason Mann said in the previous piece from Alex that this is a fight for democracy.

So the USC medical training staff at the Galen Center, obviously at games and certainly in practices are prepared. They have the right equipment and they are trained. Go back to December 12 of 2020. Keyontae Johnson, then the SEC preseason player at the University of Florida collapsed during a game at Florida State in Tallahassee, had to be revived, spent a couple of years not allowed to play. Ultimately wasn't allowed to play at Florida, went to Kansas State, had a great year. But then in May, I spoke with him at the NBA draft combine in Chicago. And the NBA has another level of clearance. He had to go through extensive medical testing before the NBA was allowed to draft him, which they did in the second round in the Oklahoma City Thunder. So every case is different.
