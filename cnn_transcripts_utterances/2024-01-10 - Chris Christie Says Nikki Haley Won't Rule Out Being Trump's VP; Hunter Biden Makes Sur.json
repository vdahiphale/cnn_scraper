You've been in favor of moving forward on impeachment proceedings with this president.But there simply is -- running out of time where the Congressional calendar is closing, you have a very narrow majority. Are you concerned that -- simply that time may be running out for actually moving ahead with articles of impeachment for Joe Biden? REP. RALPH NORMAN (R-SC): There's two separate issues. I mean, the impeachment of Biden, Mayorkas, and so many others is secondary to -- and that go on while we're deciding what to do in the budget. But the fact of the matter is the solvency of our country and the decisions on what we spend, which up until now is not looking good because you can't continue to spend more money than we make and add to the debt. So, it's designed like this. I've seen this movie reel play out since I've been here six years, wait until the final minute, and then all of a sudden, oh, we're going to have to get serious about the budget. Well, our budget ended in September. You start a new budget. And so, we should have had it done way before Christmas. But we'll deal with it. It is what it is.",

But, this could be a potential optics problem here because she has also been accused of having an improper relationship with the same prosecutor by one of the co-defendants in the Georgia election subversion case, the subpoena coming on the same day as these allegations were raised in a separate court filing in the Trump case by one of Trump's co-defendants.And they accuse Fani Willis and this prosecutor of not only having an improper romantic relationship but the DA financially benefiting from that relationship, going on vacations based on the prosecutor's salary. Now, we should note that there is no direct evidence in this court filing of anything improper, of anything that would potentially derail the case itself. But as you said, it does raise questions that -- very least an optics problem for the District Attorney who has really been a target of not only political attacks but personal threats, violent threats, throughout her time overseeing this case. Trump and his allies predictably have already jumped on these allegations despite the lack of evidence that has been presented so far. Trump weighed in himself yesterday attacking Fani Willis directly. So more fuel to the fire, more criticism as Trump is trying to throw really anything he can at the wall to sort of undermine and erode trust in these investigations. As you know, this is one of several ongoing criminal investigations into Trump. I mean, we've seen a similar strategy from him before. But this one does raise questions for the District Attorney and the prosecutor's office says that they'll respond in court filings. We have yet to hear any sort of pushback (inaudible) on the record from the DA's office there so far.",
