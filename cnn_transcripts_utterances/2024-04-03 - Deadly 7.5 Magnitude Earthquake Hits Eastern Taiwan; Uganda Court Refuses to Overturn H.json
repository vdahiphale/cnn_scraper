It is 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi, 9 am in Washington. I'm Eleni Giokos and this is \"Connect the World\". Also, buildings collapse, people trapped. These are also live pictures that were getting wiped from Taiwan. The country has been rocked by the most powerful earthquake to hit the island in 25 years. And dozens of people were killed in a nightclub fire in Istanbul. We'll have the latest on that investigation. Right stock markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes or so we're checking in on the DOW futures and as you can see, we're off to a slight negative start. But of course markets closed lower yesterday, it took a 400 point nosedive on the DOW in yesterday's session, investors continue to worry about the Federal Reserve and whether it's going to cut interest rates later than expected. Of course, oil prices are a big concern. Now we're following the aftermath of that powerful earthquake which has brought death and destruction to Eastern Taiwan. Officials say at least nine people were killed and more than 900 others injured after huge tremors rocked the island and triggered landslides on Wednesday. And you can see here the power of that earthquake the strongest since 1999, which brought down buildings and also damaged roads. Now 75 people trapped inside tunnels were rescued by emergency responders, about 137 people are still trapped. The majority of them are in a mining area. We got CNN's Hanako Montgomery joining us from Tokyo to bring us the latest and watching the aftermath of this earthquake. And also in the moments that it occurred. Can you give me a sense of what we're learning this hour and the status of the trapped people?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, of course, Eleni. So as you mentioned, I mean, the scale of this devastation, right, we're stillhearing details about it. But this is the largest earthquake, to have shaken Taiwan in 25 years. So Taiwanese authorities have told us that at least nine people have died more than 900 have been left injured. We also know that of the nine who died, all of them were killed in Hualien County, which is located on the eastern coast of Taiwan, and it's very close to the epicenter of this earthquake. This is where we're seeing most of the significant devastation. Now for some context, Hualien County is known as a tourist hotspot. It is known for its also rural area, and it's also where Taiwan sees most of its earthquakes occurring. We also know like you mentioned 137 people are still trapped in Hualien County most in a mining area. Authorities have not been able to confirm whether they've gotten those people out. But we know that the Taiwanese Defense Ministry has deployed military troops and is also working with local governments to try to get those people out to try to get those people to safety. Now the Taiwanese government is also warning about aftershocks. They're saying that in the next several days, we could see aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 7.0. So this is really significant, Eleni and you know, as someone who lives in a really seismically active country Japan, these aftershocks are no joke, they can be just as powerful, sometimes more powerful than the first initial earthquake and you never really know when the shaking is going to stop. So it can be very traumatizing for those people in Taiwan right now. Also, we know that because of these aftershocks that are still occurring across the island plans for a Tomb Sweeping Day. Tomb Sweeping Day which is a holiday in Taiwan. It's a time when people in many Chinese speaking parts of the world go to visit their ancestor's graves and pay their respects and say hello to their loved ones. But again, because we're seeing these aftershocks right shake Taiwan. Many people have to cancel their plans because they just don't know whether they're going to be safe, Eleni.",

And it was on the basis of that you heard from the Chief of the General Staff of the IDF last night Herzi Halevi explaining, giving a very fulsome apology in English on video and explaining that this had been a misidentification. Also vowing that this sort of thing would not happen again and there had been so many questions over the course of the day, of course, Eleni about what sequence of events could have allowed this very clearly marked convoy that was coordinating its movements with the IDF to be targeted, and it appeared repeatedly. So we have to wait until we get the full investigation. But Israeli authorities of -- has said that they will provide full transparency on this but all the -- so I think that you've heard that outrage expressed by -- President Biden himself. I'm standing here by the way outside the Knesset. I feel I should explain the noise around me, Eleni. This is the end of four days of protests against the way the government here has prosecuted the war in Gaza. And to the images that we saw yesterday of the strike that killed those humanitarian workers, the World Central Kitchen workers, I think these are images that are further fed. The anger of the crowds that he saw out here in Jerusalem last night, many thousands of them out here in front of the Knesset to say their displeasure, not just at the fact that the hostages, and within 130 of them have not been brought home. But that so much is being done in their name that they simply don't agree with for the most part, Eleni.",

And then into the strip itself, coordinating with the IDF, or all the way, but also with local Palestinian authorities to try and get safely in and out of wherever you're trying to deliver that too is really a remarkable project of logistics and determination and courage. They had a particular role, you know, we've seen them as journalists, wherever there's disastrous, these people tend to be. This particular charity, aiming as they do to get food to the hungry fast, whether it is a natural disaster or the war in Gaza, where the war in Ukraine and I think that is what made them so key, such an important key to what's been happening in Gaza and getting around. The many layers of authorizations that U.N. agencies have struggled with over the course last few months, but it's also in a way what made them so vulnerable, Eleni.",

Now, a bid by human rights activists in Uganda to overturnsome of the harshest anti-gay laws in the world has failed.

Pro-gay groups had asked Uganda's Constitutional Court to throw out the laws, but the five judges have sided with the government. They did -- find certain parts violated a person's right to health, as well as privacy. I want to bring in David McKenzie, who's been following this for us from Johannesburg.

We spoke to one neighbor who actually thought that the fire when it first started was in her building in a panic. She jumped down off of her balcony and when she got down, she saw that it was the building next door that was burning and when she saw the smoke and the fire, she thought that perhaps she had arrived in hell.

Hours later the human cost becomes tragically apparent as firefighters pull bodies out one by one. All afternoon police investigators and exhausted firefighters came in when wondering what went wrong. All told at least 29 people were killed. All of them were workers doing renovations on a nightclub housed in the bottom of this 16 storey apartment block.
