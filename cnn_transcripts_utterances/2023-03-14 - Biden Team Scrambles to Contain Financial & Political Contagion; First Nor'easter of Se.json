Now, most of the American public would not have done so, but now investors are doing so. Regulators belatedly, it seems like, are doing so. So yes, a lot of this sort of irrational fear. But I think that there actually is a reason to take another look, to reassess, at the very least, how these banks are doing and maybe to assume that they may be subject to more regulation, which will allow them to do less risky things in the future, which could also curb some of their profits.

The education divide is one to watch throughout this entire cycle. It's really a fault line in American politics, but so is it inside the Republican Party. Among college graduates in this Republican, Republican-leaner universe, Trump is at 23 percent support. DeSantis is at 41 percent support. Pence at 8. Haley at 12 percent. Without a college degree, this is -- this is Trump's homeland, 48 percent support here. DeSantis at 34 percent support, and single digits for Pence and Haley.

But this is the clearest comment we've gotten yet from Ron DeSantis.And you just heard the sound that you guys were playing from Trump last night in Iowa, trying to put DeSantis in -- in the category of former House Speaker Paul Ryan or Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney. Well, here's an example where DeSantis actually is aligning with Trump on Ukraine. The issue is, is Ukraine going to be a driving issue in this campaign? And if you look here among Republicans we asked, most important issue in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, far and away, it's the economy at 32 percent, then immigration at 16 percent. Candidate quality is at 13 percent. You see, you get down to 9 percent say foreign policy here. Also, I think this is really interesting, guys, and something to watch. Are you looking for somebody who shares your positions? Or are you looking for somebody who can defeat Joe Biden? That's your ultimate goal in this Republican nomination race. You see here here it's about a 60/40 split. Fifty-nine percent are looking for a Republican candidate who shares their positions. Forty- one percent looking for somebody with a strong chance of beating Biden.",
