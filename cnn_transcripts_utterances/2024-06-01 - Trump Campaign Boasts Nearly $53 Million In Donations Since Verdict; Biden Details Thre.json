The prosecutor campaigned for the job of Manhattan District Attorney basically saying he was going to go after Trump, which raises an interesting question of democratic theory because he was elected and then did what he told the voters he was going to do. There will be appeals, obviously, and questions of whether this is selective prosecution or malicious prosecution in New York. We will see what happens on appeal, but it seems to me the trial itself was fairly conducted. The New York law was applied and 12 citizens rendered 34 guilty verdicts and whatever Trump wants to say about why he was prosecuted, the case itself seems to me to be very hard to ignore. And I think, for most Americans who don't follow politics, the way we do in Washington, when 12 of their fellow citizens convict somebody is a felon, that's going to have an impact.",

Now, of course, the president has met with border mayors over the course of his administration, but this is going to mark a moment, should they make this announcement on Tuesday where the administration has really evolved on the issue of border security. What they're trying to do here is also happening just before the first presidential debate in trying to preempt his Republican rival on one of his key campaign issues and try to flip the script on Republicans after they walked away from that failed bipartisan border bill. So this executive action is quite controversial if you're talking to immigration advocates. There are others who say this type of action is needed to clamp down on unlawful border crossings, but what its certainly marks is a change in the way that the White House has talked about this issue by being far more forceful and aggressive on border security.",

But this feeds into the wider debate on the quality and speed of equipment weaponry being given to Ukraine by its allies. [18:35:07] Most recently the focus is on allowing weapons given to Ukraine to be fired into Russia proper to hit weaponry and troops attacking Ukraine itself. Poland where I'm standing here, quite clear, they want Ukraine to do that. The U.S. sort of having a debate it seems increasingly in public about that. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying today they continue to adapt and adjust the support they give to Ukraine, not really clarifying where they are on that. But as you heard from the troops there, driving those Abrams tanks every delay, every shift in policy essentially buys them to cost them time and lives as well. (END VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The tank is vulnerable in certain areas and with drones being the key element in this war where both sides are using drones they can pop up anywhere.

They've also made some advances right in this region right here.But the key thing is this, what the U.S. administration wants the Ukrainians to be able to do is to attack the Russians and the Ukrainians want this in these areas. They've got various staging areas in Belgorod, which is this major city on just across the Russian- Ukrainian border on the Russian side. And if the Ukrainians are allowed to do this using U.S. weapons, they'll be even more effective. They've used Ukrainian weapons to do this but they haven't been able to use U.S. or other Western weapons.

If you can imagine this, it's been almost 24 hours since this water main break behind me here in the Midtown neighborhood started, and as you can see the water is still shooting up in the air about 15 feet high.Let me get out of the way so you can take a good look at what's happening here. And so what you see is the water, gallons and gallons of water that are being wasted hour after hour. And Jessica, throughout the day we've been reporting about how the multiple water main breaks in Atlanta like this one here in the Midtown neighborhood have paralyzed vast portions of the city, including the areas where some of the top attractions in the south are located. We just learned that Megan Thee Stallion concert schedule for tonight has been canceled and that's according to the venue State Farm Arena. And also, Grady Memorial Hospital, one of the top ones in the region announced earlier that they continue to experience low water pressure, but remain fully operational and their emergency room is accepting all patients. Emory Healthcare. Another major medical services provider told CNN in a statement that they have had to take several measures, including diverting ambulances, transferring dialysis patients to other facilities and bringing in, imagine this, 58,000 gallons of water for the hospital chillers and cooling towers. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens just a few hours ago, Jessica, apologize saying that he understands what people are going through and assuring people that city teams are doing everything in their power to try to solve the situation. But again, this water main break behind me is not the only one, Jessica. There are several. But as you said at the beginning, it is two major water main breaks that are causing all of this problem. And before they can start fixing them, they need to stabilize the pressure or the other possibility is that there may be more of them and that's something that the water department here in Atlanta is taking a look at trying to fix as we speak.
