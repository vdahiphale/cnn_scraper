There is still no forensic confirmation, and the finalfacts still remain unclear, but there is plenty of suspicion and speculation surrounding the presumed death of Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin. Russian officials say that Prigozhin and his Wagner's top elite were on board a plane that crashed northwest of Moscow on Wednesday. The human remains found at the crash site have been transported to nearby morgue for DNA analysis. So far, the Kremlin hasn't said anything. They're remaining silent. But Kyiv has. Vladimir Zelenskyy says Ukraine was not involved, and we haven't actually heard from the Wagner group itself. The crash comes two months after Prigozhin ordered his mercenaries to march towards Moscow before calling off the short-lived Russian revolts. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us live now from Berlin. So, Fred, we have heard from a number of U.S. officials that, you know, they believe that Vladimir Putin's fingerprints are all over this. Do we expect a transparent investigation? What are your thoughts?",

All right, joining me nowto talk more about this is CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger. He is also the author of \"The Perfect Weapon\" and joins us live now from Vermont. So, David, Prigozhin is someone who had body doubles in the past. He's somebody who had at times other people traveling under his name. There was a plane crash back in 2019 and Prigozhin was thought to be on it and believed to be dead after that plane crash. But then he later resurfaced alive and well. How cautious should we be here?",

But it also -- there's reason to question whether or not the Wagner Group would take the huge risk of putting all of its leadership or all of its top leaders on the same plane, knowing that the Russians might well be gunning for them. And we still don't know entirely how the plane came down. There are some doubts now in the intelligence community that it was a missile, which had initially been suggested by some of Wagner-affiliated groups. But most intelligence folks that I've been in contact with seem to think it was some form of sabotage. The planes don't just fall out of the air at 28,000 feet. So, that suggests that he was certainly the target of an assassination attempt, whether or not he was actually assassinated is something -- it may take us a while to figure out.",

You've already heard some of Putin's allies say, well, maybe the Ukrainians did this, since the Ukrainians have a lot of reason to hate Prigozhin for what Wagner did in Ukraine. So, my guess is that he'll simply say this is dangerous business and won't really address the responsibility issues at all. But you know, think about how this played out, if indeed it is what we think it is. It happened on Russian soil, which means the Russians get to control the investigation. So, this isn't going to be like the MH17 case or something like that, where international investigators would be part of it. It was so dramatic and so much in the middle of the day that boy, it really sends a message, intentional or not, we suspect here it was, to other potential dissidents.

You know, it was Bill Burns, the CIA Director and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, who said that Putin is really the master of payback and that he would be perfectly happy to wait for the moment to strike.

Of course, a lot of them would be analyzing the situation, and of course, many of them would believe that Vladimir Putin was behind this as well. Where do their loyalties lie now? What do they do? It's a great question because as they were dismantling the Wagner Group, a number of fighters were offered a chance to go into the regular Russian forces. And it looks like some of them did. We don't have any concrete numbers on them. Some of them may have just picked up and gone home. Some of them were convicts and were trying to figure out whether or not they were returned to jail or whether their service was considered enough to win their release. And of course, many died. You saw in Prigozhin's own videos what appeared to be piles of his own dead behind him. And that's when he was raging against the Russian generals who he argued were starving him of ammunition.",

A number of protesters are there to show support for the former president, as well as those protesting against Donald Trump. About half of his co-defendants in the Georgia case have turned themselves in for fingerprinting and for mugshots, so far. The rest face a deadline 24 hours from now to do the same or they will be arrested. And while all of this is happening, Trump is shaking up his defense team.

Today, he's actually going to have to show up at the jail here in Fulton County. And again, as you pointed out, this should be a quick visit by the former president. Normally, it can take hours for defendants to be arrested and processed here, but a lot of this has been worked out ahead of time. He's negotiated his $200,000 bond ahead of time. He's negotiated with his, now, former attorney, the conditions of his release. Normally, when a defendant goes in here, they're going to be searched, they're going to go through a medical screening, they're going to have their mugshot taken and they're going to be fingerprinted. And we're waiting to see if Donald Trump actually has to go through all of those steps or if he does get some kind of expedited treatment in order to get him in and out more quickly. In his previous three arrests, for instance, there has not been a mugshot. So, we're waiting to see if the sheriff sticks to his plan and his commitment that he's going to treat Trump and the defendants in this case the same way he would treat any other defendants. Now, as you pointed out, this all comes amid a pretty abrupt shakeup of Donald Trump's legal team. The lawyers who were there with the Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis just days ago negotiating the bond, negotiating Donald Trump's terms of release have now been replaced. He now has a new criminal defense attorney, Steve Sadow, here in Georgia. We haven't gotten much of an indication of why Donald Trump made this switch, but it's obviously not uncommon to see the former president shaking up his legal team. We've seen him do that in nearly every case. But again, it's still hours away for when we expect the former president to show up here, but we're already seeing, as you said, protesters on both sides and this enhanced security presence in anticipation of the former president.",

She attacked him for running up the national debt by eight trillion. She attacked him and said directly to that crowd -- that Fox News crowd, that he is the most disliked politician in the United States and they all booed. But she is objectively correct. And so, she went out there and actually, probably made the clearest case about why Donald Trump should not be entrusted with a third nomination. So, yeah, I do think she's going to get a little bump.

No one really took control of the non-Trump group in this campaign. DeSantis has occupied that role for most of it. There's obviously blood in the water now. I was also surprised he did not get attacked more than he did. I think he lives to fight another day, but he's still got a long way to go to consolidate that non-Trump group around him.

First, it's the very diverse alliance here of geographically distant countries and economies with unequal growth. There are also rival interests. China is 70 percent of the group's GDP, and clearly China was in favor of the expansion, but not all the countries at the very start like India or Brazil who feared that an expansion would dilute their influence and they were -- don't want to be dragged into a cold war that Russia would like to have, for example.

How theinstitutions of Bretton Woods can support the African continent in its development. And this question is more relevant than ever. And you can see that even for the U.S. it's also a question on the table. A few months ago in January 2023, you remember right after the U.S.-Africa Summit of Washington, Secretary Yellen, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen, in a very unusual move, decided to go -- to visit several African countries. And the major topic of discussion was the reform of Bretton Woods, of the World Bank and the IMF. And a few days ago, the Biden administration announced at the very opening of the BRICS summit, announced that they would strengthen the financing capacities of the IMF and the World Bank on the occasion of the next G20 summit to be held in India, a BRICS member, on September 9. So, that means that the U.S. has the willingness to respond to this BRICS move, to this new development bank, to this new geopolitical shift. And that's why we are really at a turning point.",

The Wagner Group played a key role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, taking part in some of the fiercest fighting along the frontlines. But its mercenaries are synonymous with ruthlessness, bloodshed, brutality and carnage across the world. That is particularly true in Africa where Wagner's private military force has been repeatedly accused of war crimes. And just days before the plane crash that presumably killed Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner boss appeared in a video that suggested his troops were refocusing their efforts on the African content - continent, rather. CNN's Larry Madowo joins us live now from Nairobi. So, without Prigozhin -- without Prigozhin at the helm, what happens to the Wagner group's operations across the continent, Larry?",

      "sentences": "That is still the big question here, because it's not clear if there was a succession plan, especially because alot of these relationships that Prigozhin had with these military rulers or other governments in Africa were very personal. He was very charming to these men and their old men, and that's why they were welcome in places like Mali. Even though the U.S. State Department, the Secretary of State Antony Blinken has warned that everywhere the Wagner group has gone, death, destruction and exploitation has followed, and they have been accused of many human rights abuses here on the African continent, but I still believed that there were thousands of Wagner fighters, especially in West Africa here. And if it is true that Yevgeny Prigozhin died in this air crash, like Vladimir Putin has been signaling in the last hour or so, it's very clear that Africa was on his mind until near the very end. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MADOWO (voice-over):  It's here in an undisclosed location in Africa, that the Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin recorded what's believed to be his last undated video message, a recruitment promo for his private mercenary company and its operation in several African countries. YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, WAGNER CHIEF (through translator):  Wagner PMC is conducting reconnaissance and search operations, making Russia even greater on all continents and Africa even freer. Justice and happiness for the African peoples. Let's make it a nightmare for ISIS, al-Qaeda and other thugs. MADOWO (voice-over):  It was also the first clear video of Prigozhin since his march in Moscow in June. Once known as Putin's chef, Prigozhin largely disappeared after his failed mutiny. And quickly, Russia sought to assure its allies, especially across Africa, that Wagner's presence in their countries won't be affected. In the two months between his mutiny and presumed death in a plane crash, Prigozhin's fleeting messages were mostly focused on Africa. A photo on the sidelines of a Russia-Africa summit with a visiting African official, an audio recording on a Pan-African channel, and many audio messages on his telegram channels. Wagner has been expanding in West Africa for years. CNN filmed the mercenaries training security forces in the Central African Republic. They are also active or have been linked to Libya, Mali, Mozambique and Sudan. Huge countries with vast natural resources, some of which Wagner are exploiting. Over the past two years, investigations by CNN and human rights groups have established Wagner's involvement and complicity with atrocities against civilian populations, and the French say the group is also behind a smear campaign against them. In Niger, supporters of a July military coup were burning French flags and waving Russian flags across the country. Prigozhin was quick to offer his services.",
