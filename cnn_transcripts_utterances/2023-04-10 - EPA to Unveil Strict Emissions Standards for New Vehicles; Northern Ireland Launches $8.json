So, the U.S. is behind Europe, Europe is behind China, China leading the world this. These are global car companies. This is the White House, the EPA proposing these roles.

Here this could hurt their profitability.But this is the fifth time it's clearly as those tax credits next month, maybe get more difficult to get the full tax credit. You've got some of these companies, specifically Tesla cutting prices again to try to continue to generate interest in the car and for these car sales. You know, the movement toward E.V. has been fascinating to watch. We have range anxiety, you and I have talked about that before, but this is getting better. You've got all the major carmakers really full throttle onto the E.V. bandwagon. We will see what this year looks like. But with these emission standards, with these tax credits, there may be a tipping point we're seeing in the U.S. where you're moving more towards electric vehicles.
