Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we start tonight with terror and trauma around the world. In Russia, four men from Tajikistan have been charged in the attack on the concert hall in Moscow, which killed at least 137 people. ISIS has claimed responsibility, but the Kremlin says, without evidence, that Ukraine played a role. Kyiv denies that, calling those allegations absurd. Russia continues its assault on Ukraine with heavy missile attacks across the country. In the Middle East, an alleged hostage deal hangs in the balance, and the death toll in Gaza reaches over 32,000 amid fears of an Israeli offensive on Rafah. European Union Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell joined me from Brussels to discuss all these challenges ahead. Hi, Representative Borrell, welcome back to our program.",

As yousaid, as we said, it's not a question of creating the, in singular, European army. We have 27 member states, all of them sovereign, defense, it's their capacity, their competence, and they have, they own armies. But these armies has to be more inter-operational. They have to be more ready to work together than what we're planning to create the rapid deployment force. They have to create a European pillar inside NATO. The Europeans have to take more responsibility for our defense, certainly a stronger partnership possible with the U.S. inside NATO. But we have to increase our military capacities, starting with the industry and also with our armies. But it's topical to believe that we are going to cancel the 27 armies act to create a single one. What we have to do is be more realistic. And maybe what do we have to put better together? Filling gaps, avoiding (INAUDIBLE) cities, spending better our money. We are spending more. We are increasing our military's expenditure. And believe me, the Europeans have been taking stock. They are very much aware of the challenging world in which we live. And we have to be prepared for that. Mr. Borrell, moving on to the war between Israel and Hamas, you've accused Israel of using starvation as a weapon of war.

We asked for increased humanitarian entrance into Gaza because they are -- it's not enough. The number of trucks is much lower than before the war. And as the secretary-general words, there are more than 1,000 trucks waiting to enter. The backlog of the number of people sometimes waiting for days and days. So, the European Union Council, I want to repeat our wording, is in one hand to remind that everything is started with a terrorist attack by Hamas against innocent civilians on the Israeli side. And we understand the shock and the feeling of the Israelis being attacked and many people being killed, innocent civilians. This was also a terrorist attack. But on the other hand, everybody says in Europe that the number of civilian casualties in Gaza is too high. Everybody is saying that there is starvation. And everybody is saying that there is not enough humanitarian aid entering into Gaza. So, make a logical relationship between the two facts. The European Union Council asked clearly for unimpeded access to Gaza, increased humanitarian support, and for immediate humanitarian ceasefire, a pause, a pause in the combat, in order to allow the entry of support, to stop the fighting, to free the hostages, this is important to remind that there are hostages to be free. To avoid regional escalation, the spillover of the war in Lebanon, in the Red Sea. And then start discussing about the political solution, because it is not a military solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, who last for more than 75 years. The lesson of what's happening in Gaza, that attack by Hamas. And this is really the answer, is that we need to look for a solution where the two people can live side by side, because it's not going to be possible for them to live together in peace and common security. So, ceasefire or humanitarian pause leading to a ceasefire, free hostages, increased humanitarian support, and political solution, which can only be based on the two-state solution.",

Back when I lived there, there were independent TV stations, which were sort of destroyed after these terror attacks. Now, there's not much left to destroy. And really, I mean, this is a huge failure on the part of Putin, who is now openly a dictator and who now brazenly purely positions himself as a strong man who's, you know, dedicated to security and war.

It's always a two-way movement. It's not that people are, you know, so stupid or something. People usually actually know at some level what the truth is. It's that they have an interest in agreeing with a certain disinformation that is put out because it enables them to do what they really want it to do. So, if there's groups in America who want to find any excuse to blockade to Ukraine, for whatever reason they may have, they'll use the disinformation that Putin provides. I think generally when we're talking about communication propaganda, it's a two-way street. There's always the motivation of the receivers of the disinformation that we have to understand. And sadly, there are people in the American political system who are, you know, to some extent on Putin's side, or they are so against Joe Biden that they will sacrifice, I don't know, the interests of global security just to hurt Biden.",

Of course, their argument, or their pseudo argument, is that everybody's doing it to them, that CNN, or the BBC, or human rights organizations that will be on your program in a moment, are all part of a demonic conspiratorial plot.

And the more that narrative goes uncontested, the more he can say, don't you dare do anything because I am so in charge. So, the ability to force an absurd narrative onto the population becomes a sign of your power. Now, of course, one man who did challenge that was Alexei Navalny. He would be, I think, right now, Putin's only serious opposition. He would be right now telling his really rather large audience that, you know, this is, as you said, a failure of the strongman that Alexei Navalny was imprisoned and killed in one of Putin's jails very recently.

And I want to start with a point which may be a little bit surprising in that I have witnessed some real acts of beauty, joy, and really strong humanity in Gaza over the last few days. I've seen a six-year-old boy who is getting physiotherapy for his leg, which was badly wounded as the school that he was sheltering in was bombed, and he was in the arms of his father the whole time that he was he was getting his leg manipulated so it could rehabilitate as quickly as possible. I've seen a couple of girls a similar age in the Indonesian Rafah Hospital, which is a sense that we're working with the ministry of health to try and as a wound specialist sensor. And these two little girls were the life and soul of the hospital. They were cheerleading the other patients, it was as if they had been -- they were stimulating and adopted the whole community. And at the same time, I've seen medics, ICU medics, intensive care units, medics who have had to move from hospital to hospital and are now having to retrain to be able to treat the rising rates of malnutrition that we're seeing across Gaza. And at the same time, I visited the Al-Aqsa Hospital, which is in the middle area of Gaza. I arrived at around 8:30 in the morning. And throughout the night, there had been some heavy bombing, probably not as heavy as we've been hearing about around the Shifa area the last few days. But as I walked in at 8:30 in the morning, there's a morgue in the hospital grounds, and I walked past the morgue, and there were bodies filling the morgue and coming out of the morgue. I tried to make myself count the bodies that were there, but I couldn't bring myself to do that. And after that, I went into the hospital itself. And it's so packed inside that hospital. There are patients lining the corridors, on either side of every corridor, waiting for their wounds to be redressed, waiting to go into surgery. The pressure on that hospital is immense. And one of the most excruciating stories I heard was speaking to some of the medics and the questions that they're having to ask themselves in terms of the trade-off, do they give space and beds to those who are war wounded, suffering from trauma, or do they give space and beds to those that need to treat the rising rates of malnutrition?",

We're seeing -- just a few days ago, as the latest round of fighting around Shifa was starting there was an evacuation order to -- for the people of Shifa to move towards the Al-Mawasi area of Rafah, which was where I was staying. Firstly, they couldn't make that movement because of Israeli military checkpoints on route. Secondly, it makes no sense for sending people into - - to join this other one and a half million people if they are going to become the victims of a ground offensive. Large parts of the north of Gaza have been completely pulverized. And I've tried to illustrate a little bit of a picture of what can be seen in the middle area, in the Al-Aqsa Hospital. It really doesn't bear thinking about. I can't imagine, any scenario which is not utterly catastrophic.",

I had not lived enough life. I can say that now. Then I would not have ever thought that. It was just, you know, we're going to do this. You know, we'd even gone as far as to do a photo session with me and kind of photoshopped my head into images of her as we were putting together the package to go and get the financing for it. But I wasn't ready.

You know, when you are a person that's embarking on a journey like that, where there's no blueprint, no one's done it before you, that's a really lonely path to go down. And the people, Barbara Lee -- we got a Representative Barbara Lee, we got a chance to talk to, and Robert Gottlieb, who Lucas Hedges plays in the film, and her goddaughter, Maria, I got a chance to talk to these people who really knew Shirley. And one of the things that I did take away from talking to Barbara and Maria is that she always put on such a good, strong, you know, presentation of a politician, of a leader, but they always felt like behind the scenes there was a loneliness.
