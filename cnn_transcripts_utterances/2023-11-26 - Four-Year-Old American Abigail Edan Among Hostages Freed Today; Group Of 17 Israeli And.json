      "sentences": "As I said when I spoke about this deal on Friday, this has been the product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement for me and my team. We've been in close contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel, speaking with each one of them repeatedly over the past few weeks to help secure this deal.We spoke again yesterday with the emir of Qatar who I owe a special thanks to, in order to keep the hostage release on track and push for Abigail to be a part of this release, and I'll be speaking again shortly with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and we continue to remain personally, personally engaged to see that this deal is fully implemented and work to extend the deal, as well. For weeks, I've been advocating the pause in the fighting for two purposes, to increase the assistance getting into the Gazan civilians who need help and to facilitate release of hostages. We know that innocent children in Gaza are suffering greatly, as well because this war that Hamas has unleashed has had such consequences. Thousands have been killed. And from the earliest days of this crisis, I've worked closely with President Sisi of Egypt, the Israeli government, King Abdullah of Jordan, and leaders throughout the region, the expand the delivery of critical humanitarian assistance, to help innocent Palestinians in need who are not part of Hamas. Under this deal, the fighting in Gaza has now been paused for three days. Over that team, 58 hostages have been released including Thai, Filipino, and Russian nationals. Dozens of families have been reunited, and we worked urgently, urgently to take advantage of the pause to surge aid into Gaza. We've moved approximately 200 aid trucks into Gaza each day, loaded with food, water, medicine, fuel, and cooking gas. More is needed, but this is delivering life-saving results. Critically needed aid is going in and hostages are coming out, and this deal was structured so that it can be extended to keep building on these results. That's my goal. That's our goal to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into -- into those -- who in need in Gaza. We've seen this is the day by day approach, hour by hour process, and nothing is guaranteed, and nothing is being taken for granted, but the proof that this is working and worth pursuing further is in every smile and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again. The proof is little Abigail. More than 20 other children 18 years and younger have been released. They've been released through this deal, as well. They've endured a terrible ordeal. They can now begin the long journey toward healing. I'm going to continue working with the emir of Qatar, President Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to do everything possible to see the hostages are freed, all of the hostages. I am grateful for the personal partnership as we go through this deal they just mentioned. As we work together to see all of this implemented and now to try to extend it further. I'll continue working with all our partners to take the hard, but necessary steps to build an integrated and more prosperous and more peaceful future in the region. A two-state solution is the only way to guarantee the long- term security of both Israelis and Palestinian people, to make sure Israel and Palestinians alike live in equal measure of freedom and dignity. We'll not give up on working toward that goal. But thank you very much. Thank God she's home. Little -- I guess can't imagine the enjoyment and the -- I just -- I wish I were there to hold her.",

Her parents were murdered by Hamas terrorists in front of her. She was just 3. She just had her birthday. That, of course, happened on October 7th. Abigail is part of the today's 17 hostages released by Hamas to begin making their way home. This is according to the Israeli Defense Forces. This group includes 17 hostages total, 13 Israeli citizens and three Thai citizens and one other and they are all now in the care of Israelis. In the exchange, Israel will release 13 Palestinian prisoners on Sunday. That is according to an official out of Qatar. This is all coming as we learn more about the conditions where these hostages are being kept, that at least some did not get enough food and have signs of malnourishment. Let's go straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. Jeremy, I just want to underscore what the really important good news that this baby, 4-year- old girl is now back in Israel, that this is not a time to praise Hamas. It's to remember the barbaric actions to kill her parents right in front of her and then take her hostage. And, of course, it's wonderful that she is okay and will be okay, but just to remember all those who were killed and did not make it out.",

Twelve Israeli civilians who were taken hostage 50 days ago recently just crossed into Gaza, and I think we are seeing them now as we arrive. I will move out of the shot so you can capture this moment of these multiple vehicles we're seeing a police car followed by a van, several vans, it appears -- and let's just pause and look at these images.See if -- yeah. There's people waving. There are people waving from inside these busses, and you can see some of the vehicles again with them, against the Israeli ambulance and the Israeli Red Cross equivalence. And you just saw multiple vehicles going by. We saw people waving from one of those vans with windows in it and there are long convoys, vehicles with flashing lights and some Israelis who just came here to celebrate this moment. Bee we know that there are people positioned at various junctions en route to the Hatzerim air base where we understand that they will be going there and then bring helicopters from there, Dana, in order to go to hospitals across Israel. These hospitals have been preparing for their arrival with psychological, social and medical services at the ready. They have established creative rooms, effectively quarantining off portions of the hospital for these hostages to be with their families. And again, there is such an enormous effort with the Israeli government here, but also every single person in Israel feels involve in the release of these hostages, mostly because it is extremely rare to run into somebody in Israel who doesn't know someone who was either killed or taken hostage or injured in the terrible day of October 7th. And so many Israelis feel united in the sentiment of watching these hostages be able to come home and now, Dana, as we've been talking about the question is, can this last? Will more hostages come home? Will more families feel the joy of seeing their loved ones finally come home for the first time since October 7th?",

We just saw a short while ago, through the Rafah Crossing, three Thai nationals and one Russian who both were released outside of this framework who have come through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. They got into the bus and are headed to Israel. This is the same crossing that a lot of the hostages, that all of the hostages released yesterday went through, today it was a different direction.But these are foreign nationals released by Hamas have come through the Rafah crossing into Egypt and onward into Israel. It is important to note that these were part of those released Friday that came out of detention and out of Hamas hands and into Israeli hands and eventually we are seeing this going on, as well. A spot of the wider pause in fighting which a lot of aid organizations have been calling for. Before October 7th, about 455 aid trucks got into Gaza every day and that almost stopped completely. It's began in a trickle in late October, and since Friday, we've seen hundreds of trucks carrying much-needed humanitarian aid come into Gaza with water, with fuel, with medical supplies and relief items that so many people badly need, 1.7 million people in total. And so, so far, today, the Egyptians tell us 120 truck made it through the Rafah crossing into Gaza and the Palestinian Red Crescent has confirmed that at least 100 trucks made it to northern Gaza. Now, that's important because yesterday. Hamas delayed the release for several hours complaining partly that not enough aid going to northern Gaza and that's been worst affected by the aerial bombardment and the fighting that happened over the last 50 days or so. The U.N. is warning that there's a risk of dehydration there, that there is a risk of diseases breaking out, people don't have water, people don't have food and they're consuming water from sometimes unsafe places and that's why this aid is necessary not just for the people but to run the humanitarian infrastructure, the food distribution facilities to run the hospitals and other places where a lot of people have been temporarily settled as they figure out what the next move is, Dana.",

They're slowly, from what I am being told this from the trauma team that is with them, so I can only imagine that it's going to be close to October 7th all over again for them, and it's only the second chapter of a book that we don't know how many chapters it's going to have. It's not the end. It's not the middle. It's just the beginning. BASH: The kibbutz Be'eri is one of those where the most brutal, inhumane, barbaric, I mean, choose your word of horror that that happened, and the fact that Shiri and Noga were taken away. I mean, it is true, until you said it the way you did, it's important to remember that these hostages, as far as we know have been in a bit of a time warp and we don't know what they knew or didn't know on October 7th.

This is a very fluid situation and even though Israeli forces are the preponderance of military power in the north they are not the only power in the north and that's, I think, where the next step is.Israel has indicated that they will move into the central parts and even the southern parts of Gaza.
