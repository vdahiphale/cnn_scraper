We'll explore what that means for the people there. Then Iranian climber Elnaz Rekabi gets a hero's welcome back in Tehran after competing without the hijab. But fears grow for her safety. And a new blow for British Prime Minister Liz Truss as she deals with a shock cabinet resignation. We'll have the latest on the leaders rocky premiership. But first tonight -- but first tonight, Russian President Vladimir Putin has just declared martial law in the four Ukrainian regions he claims to have annexed. Mr. Putin says it'll come into effect on Thursday in Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia claims sovereignty over these territories, which the U.N. General Assembly, if you remember, has overwhelmingly condemned. But Russia does not control the entire region. Right now, its troops are retreating in Kherson as Ukrainian forces gain more ground. The top Russian allied official in the region says his administration will help Moscow carry out the new martial law. Matthew Chance joins me this hour live from Moscow. And Matthew, good to see you, just talk us through Putin's decision here or thinking.   What is the aim?",

      "sentences": "Well, that's a good question. I think it's probably to stamp his authority on this country andon these areas as much as he can. And to show that, you know, despite the setbacks on the battlefield, he's not going to back down, he's going to double down. And that's what Vladimir Putin seems to have done in those areas of Ukraine that Russia annexed within the past month. He has declared martial law. What it means in effect, it's unclear because much of the territory as we've been reporting is not actually under Russian control. But for the areas that are under Russian control, then that's going to mean you have military restrictions. The military will essentially run the region hand-in-hand with the civilian authorities in a way that they didn't, you know, beforehand. But I think more significantly are the security announcements for what will take place now inside of Russia. Right, for instance, on the border territories of Russia and Ukraine. There's been a heightened security situation announced in which there will be travel restrictions, in which there will be kind of more military checks, a much greater degree of control. There have been lots of attacks of course, emanating from Ukraine into those areas. Just inside Russia, and this I think is a response to that. But also there have been heightened security measures announced elsewhere in the country as well with regional governors being given authority to impose similar restrictions to elsewhere in the country, but perhaps to a lesser degree. It's not quite clear what measures will be imposed. But for instance, the mayor of Moscow whose region falls under that category says that he doesn't think it's going to interfere necessarily with the rhythm of ordinary life of every day Russians. But I suppose we'll see. But certainly, Vladimir Putin, you know, tightening his grip on what has been a relatively critical country over the course of the past several weeks in particular as criticism has risen over how what Russia calls a special military operation has been conducted. And you know, in the backdrop against the backdrop of the, you know, succession of military defeats that Russia has suffered on the battlefield. Isa.",

But importantly for Russia, he controls at the moment the city of Kherson. He said that the martial law is going to mean that the military authority is going to have the control responsibilities passed to them from his, the civilian military infrastructure as he calls it. So, it's clear that the regional administrators under -- that Russia has put inside these Ukrainian areas are handing off control to the Russian military. So, what does that mean about the text message these residents in Kherson for example got this morning. Telling them that they needed to evacuate the city of Kherson and some of the surrounding towns. We don't know what the military will do if these citizens don't complain. The military is now in charge of the law. Will they lock them up or under martial law, are there even higher penalties that they could face? Certainly, this would give the military much greater powers to enforce what they want and things like moving out of Kherson a less likely to sound and be requests as they will become demands. Interestingly, both the military commander in Kherson and the civilian commander in Kherson are both talking in terms of losing territory. Moving their command structure east of the river, the important north-south Dnipro River, Kherson, of course, the only big Russian-controlled town in Ukrainian territory west of the river. They're indicating that they may be falling back across the river. And I think interestingly, of course, no surprise here. The Ukrainian authorities are saying that this new martial law is null and void and has no consequence, no authority over Ukrainian citizens. Of course, those facing a barrel of a gun in Kherson for example, Ukrainian civilians, you know, will undoubtedly feel the pressure to act under this new military command.",

There is a recognition as he has said, 30 percent of the country power taken down, the official you talked to yesterday saying, yes, we can repair some bits quickly. But the big generators in the power plants, if they're hit, that's going to take much longer to repair.   So the government is sort of laying out a pathway forward. Of making sure that the emergency and core functions of government, it can be kept in power online up and running. And i think rather than being cowed and afraid by what's happening, the evidence around us is that Ukrainians are listening to the government, listening to the mayor here and advice elsewhere in the country. And turning off electricity where they're not using it. Turning off the lights, turning off the heating. There is an indication the government may bring forward the actual gas heating for the country earlier than -- a little earlier, and perhaps, and they might have been planning, so people don't use as much electricity. People are doing what the government is asking to save electricity. This really is reinforcing unity at the moment.

So even though she's resigning for a technical reason, she definitely took this opportunity to criticize Liz Truss' current government trajectory. Now, we know Braverman is a member of the libertarian right of the Conservative Party. And now with the appearance of the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, there's sort of center, center-left part of the conservative party is becoming more influential, and we knew that, that was sitting very badly with the former Home Secretary. Now, Grant Shapps will be assuming the role. But this just underscores, Isa, the political whiplash of what's going on.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A hero's welcome amid a storm of controversy. Elnaz Rekabi's return to Tehran may have drawn crowds of supporters but it was her appearance without a hijab or head covering at a climbing competition in South Korea which drew the spotlight. ELNAZ REKABI, IRANIAN CLIMBER (through translator):  The situation happened entirely accidentally. The struggle that I had with wearing my shoes and preparing my gear made me forget about the proper hijab that I should have had. I apologize to the people of Iran and for the turbulence and worry that I created for them. BASHIR (voice-over):  The pro athlete's words reiterating an earlier apology shared on her Instagram page. Though some human rights organizations have expressed concern that Rekabi may have been speaking under duress and could still face repercussions at home. The International Federation of Sport Climbing, however, says it has received clear assurances that Rekabi will not suffer any consequences and will continue to train and compete. Rekabi's return from Seoul comes amid ongoing protests across the country, sparked by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died in the custody of Iran's notorious morality police after she was detained for allegedly wearing her hijab incorrectly. Women and young girls have been openly defying the regime's conservative dress code. The Iranian rock climber has so far refrained from publicly voicing her support for the movement. But she has become yet another symbol of defiance for those protesting for change, prompting fears that Rekabi could be used by the regime to set an example to other women.",

As you say, we're less than three weeks before an election in which the major issue is rising inflation, the cost of food. And gas prices are a visceral thing for voters. You ride along the street and you see that gas prices going up every day. That crystallizes the feeling of people about their economic situation. And although a lot of these issues -- gas prices, inflation, their global issues -- there is not a lot that Biden can do. Some people say that he didn't cause them. There are a lot of outside factors, including the war in Ukraine for example; supply chain problems in Asia. But presidents tend to get the blame in U.S. elections when the economy is going badly. We've seen that time and time again. So what you're seeing is a clear political effort by the White House to show that the president understands the problems that people are facing, that he's actually being aggressive and doing something about it. After he got rebuffed, after the trip to Saudi Arabia with the OPEC production cuts, the White House is clearly trying to make a political point even though the president acted quite angrily when he was asked if he was being political three weeks before the election. It's very debatable, however, this will have a big impact on how people are casting their votes.",

The parents put out a desperate plea for her. And it was because he was a guardian of the building that he was able to get the camera footage. The young girl had arrived exactly when she was meant to at the appointed time after school, was then seen entering the building with a woman. The woman was seen later exiting on that video footage carrying the suitcase. It's understood that big box in which Lola's body was then found. It is that particularly gruesome tale of what a family has been through that has, of course, fed into that narrative here in France about the insecurity of some of Paris' less well off neighborhoods but also the outskirts of Paris and the criminality there. The fact that people simply don't feel safe. And that was, of course, before any of the story of the name started to come out, what the far-right had begun to seize on. What then happened is very quickly, by Saturday, a hashtag came out, #forAlgerians. Now the prosecutor has not named the suspect that you speak of. But what the French press has been speculating on as a result of some of that reporting, some of the French press, is that she may be an Algerian woman who was under orders to leave France. And the reason that is particularly flammable right now as a political story is that these orders to have -- often people who have entered France legally but no longer have the right to be here, to get them out quickly, have been notoriously difficult to enforce. And the ones most likely to have trouble respecting them, apparently, are Algerians when you look at the figures. This is been a source of some contention between Paris and Algiers for about a year now. That is exactly why the far-right has jumped on this terribly sad story to begin with. But one that is gathering even greater legs as a result of what we now understand may be the origin of the woman who's in custody, Isa.",
