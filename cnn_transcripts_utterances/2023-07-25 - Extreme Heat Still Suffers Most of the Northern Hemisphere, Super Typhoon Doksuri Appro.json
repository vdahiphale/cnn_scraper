At the moment, what we've been hearing from the firefighters is this. They're saying that every day they're managing to contain the flames and every night there are rekindling. And with the strong winds and the temperatures, the sweltering heat that we are experiencing in Greece at the moment, they keep losing that battle.These fires in Rhodes have now been raging for the seventh day. It's a very long time. And evacuations have been ongoing. The main part of the island that has been affected is the center and the south. At least 20,000 people have been evacuated so far. Some of them, many of them tourists have left the island, some have been moved to other parts of the island. And we're hearing from the locals as well that are saying okay it's one thing that the tourists have gone home but for us it's the end of the tourist season because nobody's going to come back. It's the end of our business. So as you can understand, conditions there are very difficult. We've been hearing about evacuations overnight on the island of Corfu as well and these seem to be continuing as firefighters there trying to contain the flames with the help of international efforts as well. Teams are coming in from other countries as Greece has required for international assistance. And meanwhile here in Athens, today the temperatures are extremely hot. It is the third wave of this prolonged heat wave that the country is experiencing. Right behind me is the Acropolis of Athens that has been shutting down during the warmest part of the day for well over ten days now and it will continue to do so today and tomorrow. We expect temperatures to improve as of Thursday.

So good morning to you Jim. So what more did this report reveal about the role climate change has played in these heat waves across three continents and what big changes is it suggesting? JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think Rosemary, one of the things it does is it lays the blame squarely at world weather climate change, the human induced climate change, is the kind of thing they point to as making the conditions, the kind of conditions that we've seen this summer, the kind of extreme heat conditions that we've seen. And not only that, but that if things remain the way they are, the severity and the frequency of these kind of events will just continue. Right now they're expecting that they will go from once every 15 years in North America, once every 10 years in Europe and once every five years in China, but that could worsen if in fact the global climate changes further. The kind of thing that's induced by greenhouse gasses being put into the atmosphere, and they're suggesting in fact that what has to happen is there's an urgent need for this reduction and stopping of burning hydrocarbons basically as a way to combat this phenomenon. So it's a kind of thing that will only get worse if in fact it gets to the point where the world temperatures are averaging two degrees above the pre-industrial age. In fact that will mean that we'll see these kind of extreme weather events once every two to five years. That's something that a lot of people will have to prepare for and they're suggesting that there be ways to adapt that officials should think of the kind of things they have to do to safeguard humans and that's basically what they're aiming at and also this urgent need to stop burning hydrocarbons.
