We are deep into Super Tuesday with the biggest prize of the night on the line, and we can now make a major projection, and we are projecting that Donald Trump will win the Republican primary in California with its delegate-rich 169 delegates. Donald Trump will win the California Republican primary.Let's look at all the states that Donald Trump has won to date. This is from the beginning of the contests with Iowa. We're going to do them in alphabetical order. Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Maine. That's just the first column. Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina. That's the second column. Third column, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and the Commonwealth of Virginia. Quite a haul. We do have another projection for you right now, and this is Vermont, and we are going to call Vermont for Nikki Haley. The Republican primary in Vermont and its 17 delegates go to Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley picks up her very first state. She won the Washington, D.C. primary over the weekend, and Vermont is the very first state that she has won. Nikki Haley, again, projected to be the winner of the Vermont Republican primary. Let's look at the votes there. It is 50.4 percent for Nikki Haley, 33,684 votes. That is 3215 votes more than Donald Trump, 45.6 percent of the vote. That's with an estimated 89 percent of the vote in, but CNN is projecting that Nikki Haley will be the winner of the Vermont primary. Now, a Democratic projection. CNN is projecting that Joe Biden will be the winner of the California Democratic Party with its huge haul of 424 delegates. Joe Biden, again, the incumbent President will be the winner of the California Democratic primary CNN is projecting. Let's bring you a key race alert now.",

Nikki Haley has high hopes for Utah. We're going to be keeping an eye on Utah, but as of right now, the Republican caucus is in Utah. It is too early to call. You might remember, historically, Utah was a trouble spot for Donald Trump, theoretically, during the Republican primaries and caucuses in 2016.Let's turn now to David Chalian. This is obviously some delegates heading towards Nikki Haley. Not enough, but some. Give us the board.",

And again, what David just said. I mean, you know, the challenge, if you're Donald Trump tonight, you're getting 92 percent of the delegates.Remember in 2016 there was talk of would there be a contested convention. That's why he picked Mike Pence to satisfy Christian conservatives and evangelicals. He was fine. Donald Trump does not head to formally clinching, which will be next week, and then and beyond in a position of quote-unquote weakness when it comes to the Republican Party. This will be his convention unlike 2016, obviously 2020 was his convention. If you pull that up, you just look at the breadth of it. Now, the question just now is just when. You know, does he get over a thousand tonight? Most likely yes. And then he can clinch next week. So, you're looking through it. And that's just, that's the issue of it, right? Maine, a very different state than California, he's getting 71 percent of the vote, right? Vermont is his weak spot tonight. He's 50 percent of the vote for Governor Haley there. He loses this one. He almost lost that one in 2016 to John Kasich. So, it's never been a great state. You mentioned we're still waiting. Another state that's always been a little quirky when it comes to Donald Trump because of its own Republican traditions is here. Be interesting to see what happens here. But now that you've taken, you know, and then Alaska, as well. So, are there possibilities for Governor Haley to add a little bit to that? Yes, but it's game over. It just is. And so, that the challenge is if you're, A, trying to convince yourself, you know, she's a very smart politician. The math doesn't lie to you. And if you're trying to convince the donors, even donors who are never Trumpers, I believe he said the words himself, I am your retribution. He watches these things. And so, there's a conversation among anybody who still wants to fight him. You're tilting at windmills. The math tells you that. And is it worth it?",

And one of the things we're seeing here, I think, is Donald Trump has in many ways, he's a key part of it. I don't know that he's the only part of it, but he's a key part of changing the make-up of the Republican Party, which is why Nikki Haley, who last won an election in her home state in 2014, I think, when she ran for governor the second time, lost South Carolina, but was able to win Vermont because he has remade the Republican Party and Republican voters in his image. And, in fact, he has said publicly that if you're a Mitt Romney Republican or a Nikki Haley Republican, he doesn't want you in the party. That's a good way to make the party in your own image. I don't know it's a good way to win an election in November, but it's a good way to win a primary and remake the party in your own image. David Chalian, you have some new exit polls.",

The Senate race was really fascinating there, because Adam Schiff made a play in this campaign.He basically decided he had a better chance of beating Steve Garvey, the former baseball player who was running as a Republican, than he did Katie Porter, a Democratic rep who could have been the second contender. And he went after Garvey on television for weeks and weeks and weeks and said, you know, he's too conservative for California, and so on. Lifted Garvey in this primary.

Or worse, they think his policies have actually caused it.What I've been looking at and thinking about all night is, for him to win, for Biden to win, he's going to have to get a bunch of people who disapprove of his job, who believe his policies have fundamentally hurt them, to somehow put, set all that aside on core fundamental day- to-day, affect-my-life issues and say, you know what? I just can't do it. It is a hard argument to make, particularly when there is, to a point you made earlier, some nostalgia, some nostalgia for when Trump was in, I didn't feel like I was treading water. I felt like I was getting ahead. There didn't feel like chaos in the world. And until the pandemic came along, things seemed pretty good.

He will, I'm sure, talk about everything that he's done to bring costs down. But he will also, I would expect -- I know this from having worked for him for a long time -- he will talk about how he is growing the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. He will talk about how he is helping working people, how he's making sure the economy doesn't just work for the rich, but that it works for working people. And, you know, yes, is there a case that needs to be made? Yes. We've talked a lot tonight about, you know, the Democrats are happy the election's not tomorrow. But you know what?

Going with a more moderate platform, as you would expect in a statewide race in California. Notably, Garvey hasn't put a single ad up on the air. Most of his ads have come from Adam Schiff, as a matter of fact, who's been critical of him, calling him way too conservative. That's part of where the money has been spent. Millions of dollars by Schiff to promote Garvey in this race, partly because he's going up against two incumbent Democrats, as well. And Katie Porter and Barbara Lee right now. Porter and Lee, distant third and fourth place in this race. Again, as you mentioned, Jake, the top two vote getters here wind up on the general election ballot in November.

We have some of the highest voter turnouts. These are voters that are deeply concerned as we all are. The situation in Gaza is intolerable.
