He answered all the questions, but he said that his main news intake was MSNBC and Huffington Post. That might be something that Donald Trump's team takes issue with. They are going to go through each part of this questionnaire really with a fine-tooth comb to try and make sure that these people are not people who would necessarily want to rule against Donald Trump because of their political beliefs or because of what kind of news information that they take in. Again, when we talk about overarching, what are they trying to get out of this, there's not a lot of optimism, once again, that they are going to win this outright, but they are still trying to get at least one sympathetic juror to Donald Trump to try and aim for this potential hung jury.",

There's no court tomorrow. They'd have the weekend, but in order to build up their case of why Trump shouldn't be held in contempt for violating that gag order, because a lot of the focus of today is to select this jury. Like we have been talking about, this is the most important decision in this case for Donald Trump right now, is to feel that he has a jury that he can be comfortable with. You know, he sat through jury selection in the civil case, the E. Jean Carroll defamation case. That took a lot -- that was a lot quicker, different judge, different process. It was just one day, but Trump was very actively involved. He was leaning to look at the jurors as they were talking. As we have seen today and yesterday, he's following along at times in the questionnaire. It does get tedious in there. You're going through this. But you're also getting to know who these people are and trying to see how they react to him. If someone is acting hesitant or not willing to look around, that can give his team some clues that maybe this is someone they need to probe further on. But there's so much that you can glean just from being in the room and witnessing this.

And, already, two Republicans are now calling for his ouster, Thomas Massie joining Marjorie Taylor Greene, who initiated this call to push Mike Johnson out of the speakership. This initially started with some of Mike Johnson's deal-cutting, including to keep the government open last month. It has intensified over his dealing with a key surveillance law. And now, in the aftermath of Mike Johnson making his move on moving forward with aid to Ukraine, aid to Israel, aid to Taiwan, he's got a legislative strategy to try to essentially move all those issues out of the House by this week, after it stalled for more than two months in the Senate. His approach differs from the Senate's, but is still not -- is still causing major angst among conservatives, right-wing conservatives, in particular, who do not want another dime going to -- to help Ukraine in its war against Russia. Now, I caught up with Massie after a tense closed-door meeting in which Massie directly called on Mike Johnson to resign, and Johnson said he would not. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

At issue is a federal law that makes it a crime to obstruct an official proceeding. The court must now determine if that law can be used to prosecute people who stormed the U.S. Capitol, including this defendant, former Pennsylvania police officer Joseph Fischer. Trump is not involved in this case, but he has been charged with the same criminal offense for plotting to subvert the 2020 election.

So, of course, it ends up at the Supreme Court, the final word. A lot of questions about how this could impact former President Trump's case. It's not clear that it will, Wolf. He is charged -- obviously, he was not at the Capitol. He is charged with the same offense, but for different conduct related to January 6.

There have been, gosh, multiple hundred convictions so far of defendants relating to Department -- to January 6. There are a number of other cases pending. And this charge, this obstruction charge under Section 1512(c)(2) is one of the most common charges across all of those cases. So if the Supreme Court were to reverse the D.C. Circuit, if it were to narrow this statute, Wolf, that would require a whole bunch of certainly at least resentencings of defendants were convicted of multiple charges. It might even require the Justice Department to abandon some of these cases. I think that's why, for the whole sort of body of January 6 cases, we're watching this so carefully. But Paula is right. With regard to former President Trump, two of the four counts against him in the January 6 indictment are about this offense. But, Wolf, as the special counsel has already said, there are pretty good arguments in former President Trump's case specifically that, even under the narrower view of the statute, the one that the dissenters in the lower courts would have adopted, President Trump would still be covered because he actually was involved in efforts not just to obstruct the January 6 proceeding, but to change the evidence, to falsify electors. And so I think part of the interesting politics here is that this decision could have really big ramifications for the lower-level January 6 defendants, while perhaps not having the same ramifications for the most visible ones.",

And so she laid out for the justices what criteria the Justice Department applied, including the intent that the individuals had, the knowledge that they had about the proceeding that was going on in Congress itself, to be able to use this particular provision of law.
