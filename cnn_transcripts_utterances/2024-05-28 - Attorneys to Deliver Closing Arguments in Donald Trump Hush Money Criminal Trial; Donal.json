The former president charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. In just over an hour from now, Trump's defense attorneys will kick things off with their closing argument. They're expected to really focus in on savaging the credibility of Michael Cohen and continuing a clear pattern there, and also ask why other key figures in the telling of these alleged crimes were not called as witnesses?Prosecutors then go second and have the final word, if you will, expected to spend hours focusing on the evidence to prove that Trump broke the law regardless of Michael Cohen's credibility. They're also going to dig into the testimony from the 22 witnesses that took the stand, 20 of them called by the prosecution, two of them by the defense. In the end, the burden of proof remains on prosecutors. They need a unanimous verdict to convict Donald Trump. The defense needs just one juror they have enough doubt to block a conviction. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside court for us as she has kindly been all along the way. Brynn, this is the big moment. How are they approaching at all today?",

There is now a line that stretches all the way around this giant park outside this courthouse. People are anxious to see how this trial ends, how both sides wrap up their arguments.As you said, we start with the defense, who is going to really highlight Michael Cohen, saying he is the prosecution's star witness. He's the only one that the prosecution ties these allegations to Donald Trump. And how could he be trusted? They say he is a liar. They're also going to highlight the people that the jurors did not hear from but were mentioned by other witnesses in this case, people like Keith Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard, people like Dylan Howard who worked for AMI and helped broker those deals. And also, of course, the former CFO of the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg. When it's the prosecution's turn, they are saying, listen, Cohen is not our star witness. We have 20 witnesses that we brought forward that tied this whole story together. And oh, by the way, we also have the receipts. We have the 34 allegedly fraud, or what they say is fraud, documents. They have the business vouchers, they have the checks, and they have the invoices, all that evidence and witness testimony that they are going to highlight and sort of show the jurors their entire case because, of course, the burden is them. Now, we understand, it's possible that these closing arguments could last the entire day today and could even go into tomorrow. Once closing arguments are done, though, then there is another part of this case, of course, that's so crucial, and that is the jury instructions. We have not seen what those jury instructions look like. Remember, they are being debated at the end of the last time jurors, or rather, lawyers were inside the courtroom. And that'll take about an hour. And then once those are done, the deliberations begin to decide guilty or not guilty on these 34 counts for former president Donald Trump. Guys?",

John, the idea that this jail did not know that these inmates had escaped until someone gave them a phone call on Sunday, it's quite a head-scratcher at this point. From what we know, these Tangipahoa inmates were inside that facility, and on Saturday, two of them escaped. And then apparently, I guess the word spread throughout that facility, two more escape.Now, for their part, the jail saying that this is a lack of supervision, they didn't do a head count. The wire on the yard was actually weakened by corrosion. So at some point they were able to evade that, go under a fence line, and then jumped over two fences. And there was also a lack of razor wire, something that you normally don't see a lack of when you talk about a jail facility. But listen to one of these correctional officials talk about the problems that they're going through at this point. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now at this point, two of the men, Omarion Hookfin and Jamarcus Cyprian are still in the run. Police are looking for them as we speak. They're hoping that as we put these mug shots up that someone in that community might be able to focus on these two men's picture and help capture them, because obviously there was some time between Sunday and Monday before they realized that they were gone. Now, obviously, they'll probably make some changes at that jail, but at this point, four different men were able to escape. They weren't noticed until that phone call came in. Two have been captured so far, but a lot of questions to be answered at this point with all that facility issues in terms of not only the razor line and everything else.

And a fellow American, Ryan Watson, he is also going to be in court. He is expected to decide whether he is going to plead guilty to his charges or if he is going to go to trial. Now, both of these appearances come days after Hagerich was allowed to return home after a judge handed down that 52-week suspended sentence and issued him a fine. Now, the 40 year-old, he boarded a flight back to Pennsylvania on Friday just hours after that judge ruled in his case and found that there were \"exceptional circumstances.\" Now Hagerich maintained he told officials all along that he did not know that the hunting ammunition was in his luggage when he visited the country earlier this year. Now, here now is Hagerich and his wife on just all of the uncertainty that really played out on Friday. Remember, he was facing the possibility of spending 12 years in prison.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
