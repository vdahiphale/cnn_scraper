Both Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have been furiously working the phones over the past few days, meeting with members, trying to make their pitch. And I'm told that Scalise has really centered his argument on the idea that he has the leadership experience and the institutional knowledge to be able to govern with this unruly House Republican conference. And he's also pointed out in his conversations with members, I'm told,that he has campaigned for nearly every single vulnerable House Republican, which could go a long way in winning their support. And then with Jim Jordan, his argument has really centered on the idea that he is best positioned to unite the fructitious conference right now. And in part, that's because he has the ear of the House Freedom Caucus, a group that he once founded and a group that has been behind a lot of the chaos that we have seen on the House floor this year.

But also, just to give you a sense of how chaotic and messy things are right now, we were told this morning that the speaker candidates were gonna be on a Fox News joint televised appearance on Monday, but I started hearing a lot of concernfrom other members in the party about that idea.They said it was gonna be a circus and that this was a horrible idea and that they shouldn't be airing out their speaker drama on TV before they address members behind closed doors. So it wasn't long before after that that both candidates, Scalise and Jordan, decided to back out of that event. I'm told they had a conversation together and decided it wasn't a wise idea, so that forum is no longer on. But, House Republicans will hold their own speaker forum for all the candidates next Tuesday, and then they will hope to hold an internal leadership election on Wednesday.

And then the more moderates. Let's remember, there are 18 Republicans that are -- that have their their their are in districts that Biden won. And they are very concerned about what it is that they're going to have to do in order to elect the next speaker.I don't see how they thread that needle. And the way that they also have to, I assume, be talking about this, though it's a danger zone, is that in order to get anything done for the American people, they are at some point going to have to sit down with Democrats, negotiate with Democrats and in a bipartisan way, move forward, most notably in the few very short weeks in order to avoid another government shutdown. So I don't know how that needle is threaded. And from the looks of it, with just what happened and everybody kind of putting together their coalitions to run for speaker, it looks like a banana republic after a coup trying to get together.

Thirty two percent here. Thirty - thirty five percent there. So it's not determinative. The other is wherever you go in the Capitol, you see signs that say members only. You see people who wear pins. You can be a leadership staffer. You can work in the Capitol. If you're not a member, you don't get to vote. It's a club. And that's why whenever there's talk about it might not be a member.

Democrats tried to work with him, did work with him, back in May, with the White House, with Democrats. Kevin McCarthy came to an agreement in order to raise the debt ceiling, to focus on spending levels, in order to avoid exactly what just happened. And why did what just happened happen?Because he went back on his word. And when he started getting pressure from the Matt Gaetz and the MAGA extremists, he was like, oh, you're right, I'm not gonna do that anymore. And that's why he boxed himself in with the corrupt bargain that he went into to begin within order to get the speaker's gavel. You can't do that if you are going to actually lead with values and with trust and be able to goto the opposite party, which we know in divided government you have to do in order to get things done. And so if the next person who is up for speaker has the backbone to say, I am going to lead, no matter what it takes, I'm going to work with my coalition to figure out how do we move forward, and then I'm gonna work with the Democrats to get things done for the American people, then I think, yes, Democrats would be able to work with that person.",

The Biden administration yesterday announced that they are laying the legal groundwork to expand former President Trump's border wall by roughly 20 miles. To do that, the Department of Homeland Security is gonna waive some 26 laws, mostly about the environment, to build additional border barriers in the Rio Grande Valley, something that DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a filing was an immediate need.In fact, let's get into that specific portion of the filing. It says there is presently an acute and immediate need, acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to protect, or rather prevent, unlawful entries.

But these battery facilities are so important to be in our master agreement. When you look at electric vehicles, they don't take engines. And if they were to close an engine facility, where would those workers go if not to the new technology, which is batteries? Currently, right now, we have a Lordstown facility that makes batteries. In 2019, General Motors closed Lordstown, and those members were sprayed all across the country. But it would have been nice for them to be able to stay right there at home and work in that battery facility. So General Motors didn't want Arlington Assembly to go down today.
