And CNN has learned according U.S. officials, that the U.S. is preparing to send over a Patriot missile battery to help with Ukrainian air defenses.Air defense has been one of the U.S.'s top priorities to get to Ukraine and a key focus of the international meetings to see what systems are available. The U.S. making the decision to send one of its most advanced systems, the long range Patriot which will fit on top of the systems the U.S. has already provided. At the beginning of the war, it was the short range stinger systems. Then more recently the NASAMS, a medium range air defense system. And the Patriot will fit on top of that at a crucial time as Russia carries out missile strikes, drone strikes and rocket attacks on Ukraine civilian infrastructure and energy infrastructure. Causing widespread blackouts and water shortages across the country. And that seems to be part of what tipped the scales in favor of sending over the Patriot missiles. There was also a question of how long the training on these would take. Normally it takes months. But now that the U.S. sees this war as dragging on and as the U.S. is set to perhaps expand its training of the Ukrainian forces, the opportunity is there to provide the training to operate the Patriot missiles, so the Ukrainians can operate them, sustain them and maintain them effectively. That was one of the key decisions here. How quickly could they get into the country? Well, the U.S. has repeatedly shown be it can move systems very quickly when it comes to HIMARS and howitzers. The bigger challenges the training. Ukraine has shown repeatedly that it can compress the training timeline on some of these more advanced systems. Still, this training normally takes months. How much can that be compressed? Well, we're about to find out. Oren Liebermann, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What he says on Russian state TV seems to confirm much of the assessments from West, that Russians seem to be sort of stalling in their advance of the front lines. He also says that the West involvement in this war is what he describes as a redline. So, here's part of what he said exactly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)ALEXANDER KHODAKOVSKY, RUSSIAN MILITIA COMMANDER, DONETSK REGION (through translator): We realize that our resources, of course, have their limits and the next spiral of escalation can only be one, nuclear.

And this comes just as, you know, things seem to be escalating in this war. We have those drone strikes deep inside of Russian territory that Russia blamed the Ukrainians on. We have the U.S. -- as we saw from Oren Liebermann -- sending these Patriot missiles to Ukraine, this long-range missile defense system. And now we also have another barrage of Russian drones aimed at the Kyiv region. Now as you guys mentioned, none of them actually hit the targets according to the Ukrainians, but the fragments of these drones hit some things inside of the city. And one of those fragments -- at least according to the Ukrainian TV -- had an inscription on it which said, \"For Ryazan\" refers to one of the strikes inside of Russian territory. But again, the Ukrainians haven't officially credit for but they seem to have implied that they were behind none the least.",

But 10 years ago, Vice President Biden was the highest ranking federal government official, definitely the highest ranking Democrat to take a position that gay marriage should be legal. Now President Obama followed shortly thereafter. But it was a moment that was actually memorialized at an event with thousands of people celebrating the passage of a law that would serve as a backstop of sorts to the Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage. It would ensure every state, regardless of whether the state tried to ban gay marriage, would have to recognize gay marriage.

You got a majority of either conference but it does show that the issue that has moved so dramatically with the broader public over course of the last 2 to 3 decades, has certainly started to move that way inside the political sphere as well. It's something President Biden spoke about. But it's also something that underscored negotiations to get something across the finish line. It might not be something that LBGTQ advocates wanted.
