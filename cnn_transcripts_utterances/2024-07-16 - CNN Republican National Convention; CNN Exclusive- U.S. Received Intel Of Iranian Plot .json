      "sentences": "Welcome to THE LEAD. Day two of the Republican National Convention. I'm Jake Tapper, live here in Milwaukee, in battleground Wisconsin.Behind me last night, former President Donald Trump emerged in public for the very first time since that bullet came within an inch of ending his life, the image was striking. Mr. Trump wearing a bandage on his ear, emotion on his face. He is now officially the Republican presidential nominee for the third time. But this time was unlike any other, as the crowd cheered him with chants of \"fight, fight, fight\", the words that he mouthed after surviving that shooting. We still do not know how that 20-year-old gunman came so terrifyingly close to killing the former president, especially in light of brand new CNN reporting that the U.S. Secret Service had actually increased security in recent weeks after getting intelligence of an Iranian plot to assassinate former President Trump. We're going to have the latest on that investigation, which leaves many questions still glaringly unanswered. What we do know now is that Mr. Trump says his brush with death has been impactful. He told ABC last night that it is changed him. He said he rewrote his Thursday convention speech to try and, quote, unite our country. I'm learning that tonight at the convention, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will directly address those voters who are uncertain about voting for Trump. She, of course, was a Trump ally, then a Trump opponent. Now, again, a Trump ally. And speaking of former Trump opponents turned allies, Ohio Senator JD Vance is now Trump's running mate. The VP pick came down to the wire. We're told NBC is reporting that Trump's sons, Eric and Don Jr., talked him out of the more establishment pick, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. We'll ask Eric Trump about that reporting in just a second. Vance had a hill to climb to win the heart of Trump, given that he was once part of the never-Trump camp, once wondered in a private message if Trump was, quote/unquote, America's Hitler. And he told me this in August 2016. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that's the reason why the U.S. intelligence community and the Secret Service took him so seriously. They increased some of the protection around the former president, we are told.Now, we should make clear that this plot by the Iranians that was identified by the U.S. intelligence community, that he had nothing to do, at least as far as the investigation is concerned right now, anything to do with the shooter who was on that roof there in western Pennsylvania on Saturday and fired those shots that injured the former president. Nothing to do with that. And so what we have is a statement from a top national security official. I'll read you just part of what -- what they told us. They said: The National Security Council directly contacted the Secret Service at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continue to track the latest reporting, the Secret Service shared that information with the detail and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. We also heard from the Trump campaign saying that they don't comment on ongoing -- any ongoing threats or their security of the former prime president, the Iranian mission to the United Nations also responded to our reporting saying that these accusations are unsubstantiated and malicious. But, Jake, as you know, the idea of threats from Iran has been a long- running concern for the U.S. intelligence agencies, for law enforcement here in the United States. You've had people on your air dissidents who have been under threat from the Iranian intelligence services. We also know that they were trying to kill John Bolton, and we also know that Mike Pompeo and other people have been under on their target list all because of the 2020 assassination of the head of the IRGC, Qassam Soleimani. So that is part of what the picture here is for the former president, and, of course, for all of these officials -- Jake.",

And -- God, we've got to do better than this, Jake. I mean, you know, he's (ph) a pretty well-reasoned human being, but we've got to do better than this.

They continue to vote for Nikki Haley even after she dropped out. I've been in touch with these folks. They, for instance, until the very end were holding out hope that she would even be his vice president. They didn't really like the Vance pick, but they respect her, they respect her ideas, they respect her sort of establishment approach to politics, her more moderate stances on any number of issues. She really went after Donald Trump in very personal ways, basically saying he is too old to be president. He was unfit to be president, and those are the things that these voters believe. They think he -- his character is flawed. So she I think has a lot of work to do in trying to change these people's minds. But I think it is good that she is there. I think obviously some of these people are reachable. Some of the ones I talk to you say, you know, they might write her in.
