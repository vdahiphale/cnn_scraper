She says we must act -- and I'm quoting here -- \"to prevent a catastrophic nationwide rail strike which would grind our economy to a halt.\" Let's bring in CNN's chief business correspondent, Christine Romans, this morning.

So what you're seeing on your screen there is what would be affected by a rail strike: everything. Everything that touches America's rails. Gas, fertilizers, food.

That was always going to be the case when this draw was made, but given events in Iran over the last couple of months, here in Qatar over the last couple of weeks, it's impossible to extricate this sporting matchup from the international diplomatic landscape. Much like the last time these two sides met at a World Cup back at France '98. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVIES (voice-over): A winner-take-all match at the World Cup bringing politics center stage. The U.S. Men's Soccer Team will face off against Iran in a match that will determine which team proceeds to the knockout stages here in Qatar. GREGG BERHALTER, MANAGER, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: There's no real distractions. You know, I know there's a lot going on here, but the group is focused on how do we get a win? DAVIES (voice-over): This is the first time the two teams have played in a World Cup match since 1998 when Iran beat the U.S. In recent days, Iran's state media has called for Team USA to be disqualified from the games after the team changed Iran's flag on its social media accounts for 24 hours to show solidarity with protests for women's rights. MICHAEL KAMMARMAN, SPOKESMAN, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: It was meant to be a moment. We made the post at the time. All of the other representations of the flag remain consistent, and will continue to. DAVIES (voice-over): The players and their coach say they have no previous knowledge of the posts. TIM REAM, DEFENDER, U.S. MEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: We support the women's rights. We always have. We always will. That -- that message will -- will remain consistent. And -- and what we're doing as a team is -- is supporting that, while also trying to prepare for the biggest game that this squad has had to date. DAVIES (voice-over): At a press conference Monday, an Iranian reporter called for U.S. team captain Tyler Adams to correct his pronunciation of the country's name, and pushed him to address discrimination in the U.S. TYLER ADAMS, CAPTAIN, U.S. NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM: My apologies on the mispronunciation of your country. Yes, that being said, you know, there's discrimination everywhere you go. You know, one thing that I've learned, especially from living abroad in the past years and having to fit in in different cultures and kind of assimilate into different cultures, is that in the U.S., we're continuing to make progress every single day. DAVIES (voice-over): This comes as a source involved with the security of the games tells CNN that Iranian players' families were threatened with imprisonment and even torture if the players did not behave ahead of the match. These threats were made after the Iranian players did not sing the national anthem during one of their matches. The players sang during their following game against Wales just days later.",

We are considered essential, and it seems like when you look at a ticker tape, we're expendable, from essential to expendable in the snap of fingers. It's very frustrating.",
