Right now, the South Fork Fire remains 0 percent contained and has scorched more than 15,000 acres.And then just south of that, the Salt Fire is burning through tribal lands. Officials say the fast-spreading flames have destroyed more than 1,400 buildings and homes. And that has forced around 8,000 people to evacuate the city of Ruidoso. One man that we spoke to this morning says he and his wife did not receive a warning and they had to flee suddenly with a three-year-old and their newborn, leaving almost everything behind.

Forecasters say more than 200 million people in the United States will see temperatures at or above 90 degrees this week.Weather like this is why dozens of environmental, labor and health groups want FEMA to declare extreme heat and wildfire smoke as major disasters, the same way they treat floods and tornadoes.

It killed 2,200 folks in the United States alone last year. They say that number's vastly under counted. But FEMA is regulated by law called the Stafford Act, which has 19 separate designations: earthquake, hurricane. But it's designed to be very flexible. Covid-19, a pandemic was not originally on the Stafford Act, but they used it to help out states. States typically have been able to handle heat events. This is -- you know, FEMA's there for infrastructure, really be overwhelmed in a moment throughout through a disaster right now. That's harder to define with heat, which is usually slow motion. And it's regional. You know, if it's over 100 degrees for two weeks straight in Arizona or Florida, it's different than if it happens in Wisconsin, for example. But these groups very much want to start the conversation around how we think about heat events. Some are saying we should name them like hurricanes in a way to help the public -- educate them, help them understand these are not your parents' heatwaves anymore. Things are going steadily up, which moves us out of the threshold of health and survivability.",

Quite literally.While its CEO was answering tough questions on Capitol Hill yesterday, its engineers were grappling with issues dealing with their Starliner spacecraft. Since they launched on June 5th in its first crewed test flight, astronauts have navigated several issues, including malfunctioning thrusters and helium leaks. And it's turned their week-long mission into a three-week stay on the International Space Station. Retired NASA astronaut, Leroy Chiao, joins us now. Leroy, help us understand these problems and how much of a concern this is.",

As you pointed out, Boeing has had a lot of problems not only on the commercial airplane side, but also on the space side.Starliner way behind the original schedule, a lot of development problems. Finally got off the ground. Butch and Suni are aboard the station, but not before encountering several minor difficulties, helium leaks, thruster failures. These are kind of medium to light problems because it doesn't really threaten the mission at this point. It's just a little bit concerning that we're having these numerous small glitches. But the bottom line is the helium leaks are about -- pretty small. NASA says they can tolerate about 100 times what's currently leaking. Had five thrusters fail on the way to the station. Four of them have been reactivated. One remains disabled. Shouldn't keep them from coming home safely. NASA and Boeing just being extra conservative. Don't want to be complacent. Want to go through everything. And so just being a little bit extra cautious, that's why the mission is being extended.",

And so you can bet that the folks at NASA have been looking at, well, in the very worst case that we decide the Starliner cannot come back with Butch and Suni, what can we do?Well, of course, Butch and Suni can safe haven at the ISS for, well, basically, a number of months at least. And so that would be time to get a replacement spacecraft up, probably a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. They -- NASA would have to rejumble the traffic model. But certainly a SpaceX Dragon could be brought up to bring Butch and Sunny home. So in the very worst case, that would be what would happen. But as I said, the problems Starliner is experiencing are relatively minor. So I fully expect that, come the 26th, per the plan, current plan, Butch and Suni will make it back safely in the Starliner.",
