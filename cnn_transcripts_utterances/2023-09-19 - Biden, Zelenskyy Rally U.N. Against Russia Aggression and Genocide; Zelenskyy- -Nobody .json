I'm thankful to invitation. And I said just to general secretary that I'm thankful to all the people that you gave me possibility to fight against Russian propaganda because I had online messages during the war. I couldn't come, but I had this possibility. And I'm thankful. And the second reason I'm here to be thankful to all the people of America, to journalists, to people, to soldiers who trained, gave training missions for our soldiers. To -- yesterday, for example, from the airport, I went directly to the hospital. [18:05:04] It's not about some public meeting. It's not about this -- you know, it's not about politics. It's about these people. I saw our guys there without legs, arms, but with their brains, with their eyes, with their hearts, and they are ready to come back. The doctor told me that they are ready to come back to Ukraine, and they are really here. And that's why I'm also thankful to doctors. So, that is the reason of my visits. So, what can I say to American people in English? My English is poor to say all my messages and all my thanks to you. I'm sorry for just these poor words, but I think you can recognize and you can understand from my words, my attitude to you and my attitude -- the attitude of Ukrainians to American society. But don't lose the time. You gave us such huge support in difficult period, and this period, because of the Russian aggression, it didn't stop. We are on the finishing line. I'm sure that we hear their voices on the frontline, and we hear them, and they are de-motivated, the Russians de- motivated, they are afraid of us. And all Putin wants now, all things he wants, that's really to push United States, to change the minds of society, to push E.U. partners, to change the minds of the people of E.U. countries.

They understood -- they knew that soldiers will not go somewhere, that when we will occupy any villages, the farmers will come back to their houses, to their fields. They knew about it, but they mined it because they just wanted to kill people, that's it, to do people afraid of their terror. But, anyway, on the south, really totally mine fields. But we go slowly, but we go forward, very important information, that initiative in our arms, in all the direction. It shows how it's changed.

I just understand that there are some people dying. Of course, there will be a loss for us if we won't be able to get that type of weapon, which will protect us. But it's not a disappointment as such. It will be just a loss. But we will have more casualties on the battlefield and elsewhere. And I can say openly, we needed weaponry to liberate Kherson, a big city in the south. We did occupy Kherson. It's one of the biggest cities where we did occupy it. And before the war -- just one point, before the war, we had, I don't know, more than 300,000 people there. When we did occupy it during the war, in Kherson, we found about 90,000 people. So, yes, a huge number of losses and deported children, people, et cetera. But what we needed when we de-occupy it, we needed artillery, long distance missiles to save Kherson, which was de-occupied. What did Russia? They ran away because they've been afraid when they de-occupied on the other bench of river. They ran away on 80, 100 kilometers. And from that point, they began to attack people. And they attacked during one year all the civilians, schools, hospitals, universities, they attacked. And now we have there less than 80,000 people. Some have been killed, some of them draw away because they can't live there. Children can't go to school. That is the example where the weapon like a ATACMS can help. It's not only about the target and about the battlefield. It's mostly for today about how to save civilians. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that was a departure from the very general message that he had for the audience of world leaders at the U.N. earlier today, where he didn't make a direct plea for specific types of aid. He just said that he needed the support of the global community.But when you pressed him on that, he said, yes, they need the F-16s. He acknowledged that the training is being conducted, as we speak. But it's going to be months before they get delivered and that they need more Patriot missile defense systems. So, trying to distill down what that ask is before he goes to Washington later in the week, where there's going to be a question about specifics and a question about what the price tag ultimately is.",

But I think, Wolf, listening to your interview, Zelenskyy at one point was talking about Russian propaganda. And in addition to weapons, this really is propaganda war. And so, Zelenskyy is here with his own narrative, his own message. And I think the strongest message that I heard literally all day from him was that, this isn't just our fight, it's your fight. And you -- he's talking about not only the United States, but the developing world. If you think, you know, that we have problems in Ukraine, Russia can weaponize things against you, too. I think that could be, you know, a powerful message. He certainly drove it home in your interview in a very personal way. But I think all through the day, that's what he's saying.

The aid is going to weapons to defend the country, to air defense systems to stop drones from dropping on civilian areas, which is all part of the Russian war plan here.In terms of the plan for victory, you heard from Zelenskyy, and we heard from the podium and he said before they need more weapons for victory. But it's a harder question because U.S. officials I speak with, western officials I speak with, they're not certain that Ukraine can manage a victory in the next year just because it's such a tall order. Russia is willing to send many more soldiers to die, frankly, to defend the territory it has. That's a harder question for him to answer.

I think one of the things we have been seeing over the past couple weeks, past couple of months is the Ukrainians really trying to attack some of those Russian supply lines.And, of course, they have British-made storm shadow missiles that they're already using. There were some pretty big strikes today in the town called Melitopol, which is to the south where the Ukrainians said they hit a Russian control center. They want to be able to do more that so that they shot at less on the front lines. The Ukrainians are saying that they are still some areas on the frontlines where the ratio of what the Russians can fire, to what the Ukrainians can fire, the ratio is about ten to one. So Russians fire ten projectiles for one that the Ukrainians can fire. Certainly they believe they could attack them more in the rear echelon, those supply lines. That is certainly something that would help. ATACMS are very important. The F-16s also they say is very important, those powerful radars to try and offset some of those modern Russian jets as well. Both very important. I think the Ukrainians understand F-16s are going to take a little bit longer.",
