Now, that might just seem salacious or an odd thing to focus on. But remember, the battery charge is about that offensive conduct. Within minutes of filing this particular lawsuit, we had the New York State law change to allow for adult victims to be able to, even if their limitations period had lapsed, they could still bring the case based on sexual assault, of course.But the other aspect defamation has to do with one's reputational harm, that you had to assert something that was false, i.e., a lie, and it had to defame the person by lessening their perception of people's view of them in the community and their reputational harm. And so, she's trying to, essentially, assert that by saying that he wasn't -- she wasn't his type, he's calling her a liar. That's the core of the issue. Now, it's odd to go about this in his because Tacopina, the council for Trump, seemed to focus on this notion about who's type was who. But what does that suggest, Kate? On the one hand if she were his type, would he have been more likely to engage in the behavior that he was alleged to have done so? And on the second notion of it, every survivor of sexual assault will be very clear, rape is about power, not about the laws of attraction. So, we were talking about how the jury may perceive this. I'll be curious to how much they weigh that particular deposition testimony.",

It's called Opill and could allow women to access birth control as easily as getting Tylenol or Advil or any other over-the-counter medicine. The drugmaker says that it's safe and effective. And birth control pills have been approved by prescription since 1960.CNN's Elizabeth Cohen is looking at this, she joins us now.

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate. In a 130-page briefing document, the FDA said, look, we have a lot of concerns. One of them is that currently, about 60 percent of U.S. adults, including adult women are obese or overweight. They said, well, the test for this drug were done 50 years ago and we didn't have that kind of percentage of people being overweight. Secondly, they were concerned that women might misread the label because based on studies, some of the women did. And of course, the doctors weren't there to prescribe them and kind of walked them through it.So, what gynecologists say to that is, look, yes, there are more overweight women now than there were 50 years ago, but pill effect in this is the same. They don't see it as a problem, that more women are overweight. They also say that they trust women to read the label correctly. And that is why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association both support pills, birth control pills going over-the-counter. Now, let's take a look at a statement from Perrigo, that's the company that is going to be selling this if indeed it goes on the market. Data from our eight-year development program showed that consumers can use Opill safely and effectively as guided by the proposed labeling. So, the FDA advisors are meeting as we speak, Kate. They're going to meet again tomorrow. They'll make a recommendation about what they think. The FDA itself can listen to it or not listen to it. And it will likely be a matter of months before we hear from the FDA about whether or not they're going to let this pill go over-the-counter, you know, right next to shampoo and the toothpaste and the aspirin.

It was the land of deflation. Then we had COVID. We had this very unusual and unpleasant spike in prices, now we are getting some sense that that is starting to unwind.So, where are the prices dropping? I am sure you are wondering. Adobe says most categories are seeing prices fall, good news for parents seeing the toys and the sporting goods prices falls online by six percent, year over year. Not a bad time if you're in the market for a refrigerator, washing machine. Appliances are down by the most since Adobe started tracking in 2014. And electronics and computers, we're seeing double percentage drops. All of this is welcome news for consumers getting squeezed by the high cost of living. Also, good news for investors and the federal result ahead of tomorrow's big inflation report. The government is expected to say, consumer prices up by five percent year-over-year in April, That's not good. It's not healthy but it is moving in the right direction.",
