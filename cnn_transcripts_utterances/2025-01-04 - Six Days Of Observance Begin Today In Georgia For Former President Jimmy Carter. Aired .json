We're showing you some live pictures of the motorcade carrying President Carter's casket as it makes its way to the Georgia state capitol in downtown Atlanta. Once there, in just a few moments, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp will meet with members of the Carter family and lead a moment of silence.The funeral procession will then head to the Carter Center in Atlanta, where family, friends and staff will pay their respects to the former president of the United States at a special service. The motorcade started this morning in President Carter's hometown of Plains, Georgia, stopping at his childhood home. The National Park Service saluting Carter with a special ringing of the farm's historic bell. The bell ringing 39 times in honor of the 39th president. It's been an emotional day. Crowds of people gathered along the motorcade route to pay their respects for a president who became a symbol of community, kinship and service. Carter, a Democrat, served one term as the 39th president from 1977 to 1981. He became the oldest living former president when he surpassed the record held by the late George H.W. Bush back in 2019. Victor, as you and I well know, Georgia was such a very, very big part of the late president's life. And you can see that through the events happening here over the next couple of days, certainly over the next hours as well. Give us a sense of what's going on over there, because you've been there all day. You've been there for days.",

You can see over my shoulder, once we come back here live, the largest crowd we've seen yet of people who have come here to bring flowers, to bring notes outside the Carter Center. That's the sign you see over my shoulder. They've come here to bring messages of thanks, and also some bags and jars of Georgia peanuts here to the Carter Center as well.Of course, known to most as a peanut farmer, grew up on a small farm that included crops of peanuts, but we've seen this expression of gratitude across the metro Atlanta area. I was at dinner midweek here and looked out the window, and there was a big digital billboard that just said, \"Thank you, President Carter.\" And of course, as you showed, going through Plains, Georgia, we saw thanks there, some gratitude from people just coming out on the side of the road to watch the motorcade pass by as we're watching here. The motorcade is now in the metro Atlanta area, making its way to the capital, and then here for a ceremony at the Carter Center. And then his body will lie in repose for several days before heading to Washington.",

We're going to see even more of them at the service here in a little over an hour. The employees of the Carter Center, who really work around the globe, have been called back, and they will be participating in the service here before official Washington has its chance next week.And I think that is by design. The Carters, of course, planned this service from beginning to end, marking out the chapters of the former president's life. But as you said, the people who have gathered behind us, there are more than we've seen throughout the day. But I was just up there a moment ago, and one sign said, President Jimmy Carter, humanitarian, justice seeker, selfless farmer. So I think those are some of the words that are just being left by people. But we are going to see President Carter stop at the Atlanta capitol. I'm told his oldest son, Jack Carter, will step out and shake the hand of Republican Governor Brian Kemp. That is a sign that politics for the moment will be set aside today. Governor Kemp will be leading the greeting there, and then the motorcade will make its way here to a ceremony. Chip Carter, one of the other Carter's sons, and Jason Carter, the grandson, will be speaking at the service here later. But throughout the day, we've seen one chapter after another of this president's long life here. But this is his service, his legacy unfolding. Yes, frustration swept him into the White House, as you said, through Watergate and the Vietnam War, frustration with the economy swept him out. That was only one chapter of his life. The longer one was actually here, his post-presidency at the Carter Center.",

[15I went to see Governor Carter, then state senator Carter, and he came into a plain room with a folding table and two metal chairs and work boots and khakis. And I said to myself, what am I getting into? Why do I want to work for this guy? But it didn't take very long, Wolf, to see that he understood urban problems as a South Georgia person, he favored mass transit. He favored education reform. He was a moderate on civil rights, and after the second meeting, I said, I'd like to work with you. And I was his policy director when he ran for governor in 1970, then when he ran for president from '74 to '76, and then into the White House for eight years. And I thought that this kind of emotional appeal would be there, that people really did admire him.

And I think it goes to show you how for the people of Georgia, Jimmy Carter is not just a former president. He's not even just a former governor. He's considered their own. And we've noted that so many Georgians have their own personal stories about running into Jimmy Carter and how he treated everyone with grace and dignity no matter who they were. And so many people just have those stories to share or have passed down those stories over the years to maybe younger generations.

And he said in that book, I had taken a private oath never to say I love you to anyone other than the girl I intended to marry. And I kept this promise until I fell in love with Rosalynn.

And he, with that grin, said, I am running for president, but I am not going to be the vice presidential candidate. I'm going to be the presidential candidate. And he said, join my campaign.And I have to say, all of us had some doubts that we could go from zero, zero name recognition. He was on a program called \"What's My Line?\" We put him on as governor. Not one person guessed that he was even the governor of Georgia. So it was a remarkable path to the White House, but took this kind of steely determination and brains and vision, and he captured the moment, as you were saying. If he ran at another time, it wouldn't have worked. It was a Watergate era, and saying, I want a government as good as its people, I'll never lie to you, that resonated at that time where his other Democratic candidates were talking about new programs.

He realized that that would endanger Sadat's own life to come back empty handed after he had made the historic trip to Jerusalem and be a stain on his presidency.So he got Susan Clough to make eight copies of the original photo when they took it, got the names of each, walked it over to Begin's cabin. Begin read each one aloud while Carter was there. His eyes teared. His lips quivered. He put his suitcase down. He says, for my grandchildren, I'll make one last try.

He had gotten a pathway, the ground rules for Palestinian autonomy, which might eventually lead to a two-state solution.And he thought he had Menachem Begin's agreement on this.

Carter thought it was five years. Begin thought it was three months. I was in the Oval Office when Begin announced new settlements and he said he misled me. And I said, Mr. President, he couldn't have agreed to five years. His coalition would have fallen.So that was one. And the second was the human rights dimension. He saw the Palestinians as an effect, the blacks of the south. And he actually said to me, I didn't agree with him, but he said to me, the Israeli Defense Forces are mistreating the Palestinians in the same way and even worse than the white police mistreated blacks in the south. So he saw the Palestinian issue as a human rights and civil rights issue, not just as a political issue. And it's a shame that at Camp David, there were no Palestinians. And the reason there weren't is because Yasser Arafat, who was head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, refused to accept U.N. Resolution 242, land for peace. So the autonomy that Kai mentioned, the full autonomy, Begin agreed to but there were no Palestinians to fill it out. And after the administration, at the very end, the last six months, Sol Linowitz was negotiating that. But we didn't have any real interlocutors too negotiate it with.",
