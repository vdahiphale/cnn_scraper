The escalation in fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group is raising fears of a wider war in the region. And as a result, Turkey has joined a growing list of countries urging their citizens to get out of Lebanon. Iran has vowed revenge against Israel, blaming it for the assassination of political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran last week.

The first is to distance himself from October 7th, and to portray this or to, you know, fabricate this new narrative according to which this is not just a terror attack by Hamas on October 7th, but this is a regional war, this is an existential war, and this is an inter-civilizational war.

If we look in Japan, the Nikkei, the Benchmark Index, there, it was down by as much as 7 percent. In South Korea, the cost be down by 5 percent at one point.To give you some context, if we see drops of anywhere from 1 to 2 percent, that's significant to see these larger numbers, it is just breathtaking. So as far as what's happening in Japan, at least. The Japanese yen, which has been very weak over recent months, is starting to get a bit stronger. Yet, at the same time, Japan's central bank is talking about interest rate hikes. And that is not sitting so well with investors, who really got some good bargains to begin with. So, we are going to be watching Japan. We're going to be watching South Korea over the hours ahead. See how things close. But at this point, traders are looking for something to be excited about. And at this point, it is just very hard to find anything to be celebratory about at least looking into the near future. But these declines that we're seeing in Asia are also something that we're seeing in the U.S. In fact, as you mentioned, a very rough Friday as -- as -- as all three major indices in the U.S. closed downward. We had CNN have what's known as the fear and greed index. We look at all these different factors as to what motivates traders and people to invest their money. Is it agreed or is it fear? And right now, based off of all these different factors that we look at, fear is what's dominating the index right now at 27 just hovering over to this index, we call extreme fear and there are a lot of reasons for traders to be concerned, especially in the United States and worldwide. We talked about the not so hot jobs report. The disappointing jobs report. We're also hearing from corporate America. We saw Intel announced layoffs, Amazon, which has been having some success. Looked into the future and said it will see growth, but it's just not going to be as fast as we have seen in the past. So those are all reasons that are giving investors pause. And finally, Michael, I would be remiss if we didn't talk about the situation in the Middle East especially when it comes to oil prices, because we know they can be very volatile, especially when there is geopolitical tension. But I heard from one trader overnight who is a little bit more muted in his concern. He feels that if there is war or if there's retaliation taking place on Iranian -- Iranian soil, that is when there is reason to be concerned. As far as across the broader Middle East, OPEC has lots of oil in reserve, and it is in a very strong place. But Michael, as we look ahead to this week, not only do we have these geopolitical concerns to contend with, we also have bad weather, a potential hurricane in the United States. As this oil analyst told me, that is what could really have an impact on fuel prices, gas prices, in the week ahead, Michael.",

We know that we've had really the strongest recovery post covid recovery of -- of any rich nation. We've outperformed peers in Europe and in Asia. It's been kind of a Goldilocks economy for some time. But we also know that there's always a recession on the other side of a recovery cycle.And so, investors, policymakers, average people have been sort of waiting for the shoe to drop. The jobs numbers coming in as weak as they did, even though it's just one set of numbers. Coupled with the fact that earnings and some of the big tech companies disappointed the story about AI, which really void the markets over the last few months is -- is, you know, I won't say that there are holes being punched into it, but people are saying, you know, it's going to take a while for these gains to pay off. You've got Kamala Harris in the race, which me and -- and -- and polling quite well, which means that all right now you're in a scenario where maybe you're not going to see a Donald Trump too, maybe you're not going to see more tax cuts.

You want to see three a week jobs numbers before you start to say, OK, yes, there's a -- there's a real issue here.That said, there's a sense that the Fed has waited perhaps too long to cut rates and has gotten behind the -- the -- the trend behind the economy, and that's always a risky point, because when the Fed is struggling to keep up and maybe having to make bigger rate cuts than usual, that makes investors very worried. And that's where we are right now. I will also say, Michael, that just anecdotally, as I've been sort of traveling both in the U.S. and abroad this summer. I'm struck by two things. There is a feeling that there's a little bit of softening on Main Street. You can sort of feel it when you're in vacation spots. There's also, interestingly, the opposite. In Europe, you see a lot of Americans vacationing abroad, you know, pushing up inflation in some European and Asian countries at a time when those economies are weaker and all of it underscores the fact that while the global economy was moving in such a years since COVID, that's all changed. So, there is just -- there are a lot of chinks now where volatility can kind of work its way into the system and -- and have surprising results.

You probably want to build up cash reserves if you can, because if there's a slowdown on Main Street as well, that could mean job losses. And, you know, you want to have cash on hand.I've been arguing for some time that this is probably a good moment to start transitioning a little bit more away from stocks and into bonds. You can also look and say it's kind of a truism in investing that whatever does well in a certain decade, it's unlikely that that will be the story of the next decade. So, if you look at what's done really well in the last decade, it's been U.S. stocks, big tech, and the American recovery.

A Swiss triathlete who will now no longer be taking part in the Swiss team's relay race on Monday. The Belgian team withdrawing entirely after one of their triathletes fell ill. [00:40:16] No word yet on a direct link between the illnesses of the two triathletes and the conditions in the River Seine last week. We've been pressing Paris 2024 for more answers on the question. For now, no response has come. What Paris 2024 have announced is that they are giving green light to the event happening on Monday morning. In the past last week, they waited until the early hours the morning of the event itself to confirm that the water levels, the bacteria levels in the River Seine were sufficiently low. That the events could go ahead now after criticism (ph) they've announced this Sunday that that race will go ahead, even though the Swiss lineup will be different and the Belgians will now not be present. So, a lot of questions going forward about exactly what caused them to fall ill, even as the world prepares to watch the relay race go ahead. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
