Silicon Valley Bank shut down by California regulators after the stock crashed by 60 percent yesterday after the bank said it needed to rapidly raise cash.This is easily the biggest bank failure since Washington Mutual fell apart in 2008 during the financial crisis. Now, Silicon Valley Bank, if you haven't heard of it, it is a major lender to tech start-ups. The FDIC says that depositors that have $250,000 or less, they are insured here. They will get their money. They will get access to their money as soon as Monday morning. But we know that some people, some entities, some start-ups, they have more than $250,000, and it's less clear what's going to happen to them. How did this happen? Well, when the Fed spikes interest rates, things tend to break. We know that the Fed rate hikes have hurt the valuation of the tech companies that this bank catered to, also has hurt the value of the bonds that banks rely on to get cash. Erica, the good news is that experts that I'm talking to, they're hopeful this is more of an isolated event than a systemic one.",

Turning now to our national lead, federal investigators are looking into yet another train derailment, this just as we're learning about how widespread railroad issues across the country may, in fact, be. The latest derailment happened in Calhoun County, Alabama. It happened yesterday. It's in the northeast part of the state. Take a look at some of these images from CNN's drones. You see the cars there, about 30 cars went off the tracks. Now, fortunately here, no one was hurt. No reports of dangerous chemical leaks. The train, though, was operated by Norfolk Southern, and yes, that is the same company whose train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, last month. While that derailment is under investigation, today, already railroad officials said they were there are 700 railroad cars across the country that could be defective. We're joined now by CNN's Tom Foreman. So, Tom, these potentially defective cars, hundreds of them, what more do we know about them?",

That accident in West Central Ohio, about 20 cars went off the rails here. There were no particularly toxic chemicals involved here like there were in the wreck about a month ago that created so many problems, not terribly far away.But when the Norfolk Southern people started looking at this, one of the things they say they found was loose wheels that could cause a derailment. And they started inspecting about 200 other cars with the same types of wheels in their fleet to see if that might have something to do with this terrible accident here. The other thing they did was they sent an alarm to the association of American Railroads, which then basically let all railroad operators say, look, these are new specialty rail cars, and they are made specifically for a particular job, which is to carry large steel coils. They're about 675 that have been identified nationwide, and they believe there's this increased risk of an out-of-gauge derailment from these loose wheel sets. Now, the company that makes these wheel sets, we've contacted them. No response yet as to what they might have to say, and the Federal Railroad Administration says they're still evaluating to see if something else needs to be done about this, Erica.",

This looks like a wheel that detaches, and they might not have found it so suddenly but for the quick action and one of the persons who took a video of this accident. So, it was very fortunate that they found out, and they can issue national emergency recalls. They can take national action right away to get these defective cars off the rails, and I think they've already done that.

In 2021, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy officially declared Da Vinci a hero of Ukraine. On Friday, the president paid his respects to Da Vinci's surviving family members, accompanied by the prime minister of Finland. Mourners gathered on their knees around Da Vinci's coffin in the square in central Kyiv where, in 2014, Da Vinci, then just a teenager, joined thousands of demonstrators in a bloody battle against Ukrainian security forces. They ultimately sent the country's pro-Russian president fleeing to Russia. Soon after, Da Vinci joined a nationalist militia and fought for years against pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region before formally joining the Ukrainian armed forces.
