      "sentences": "Thanks for joining us here for CNN NEWSROOM.In the hours before a migrant boat capsized and sank off the coast of Greece, the Greek Coast Guard took this aerial photograph. What is clear to anyone is that the boat looks battered and dangerously overloaded with no one on the upper or lower outer decks appearing to be wearing a lifejacket. It's hard to see any women and children in this photo. Most are believed to have been traveling in the cargo hold. The U.N. says at least 40 children were on board. Either before or after that photo was taken, the captain abandoned ship, and then hours later, the engines are believed to have stalled in high seas. The boat capsized and sank. Before that, the Greek Coast Guard shadowed the boat for hours. Greek authorities say attempts to render assistance were rebuffed by those on board, and because they were in international waters, there was little they could do. But that just doesn't ring true to many maritime legal experts, who point out search and rescue does not require consent. Knowing the boat was unsafe, the Greek Coast Guard was legally required, under maritime law, to attempt a rescue, regardless of what the passengers did or did not want. As many as 750 people were on that boat; 104 survived. Right now, they're being kept in a dockside warehouse and will eventually transferred to a facility in Athens. Many are said to be in shock, deeply traumatized. They're asking about their children. The leader of the Greek opposition blamed Europe's immigration policies for causing so much needless heartache and death. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXIS TSIPRAS, GREEK OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): I want to say that, unfortunately, in this Europe, where great ideas and great values are the life that we're born (ph), human life does not have the same worth for everyone. I want to say there are huge political responsibilities with the migration policy that Europe has been following for years. A migration policy that turns Mediterranean, our seas, into watery graves. And I think that it is time to speak the truth, because this policy has to change. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The boat, here hours before it sank, the Greek Coast Guard says refused help. Greek authorities say that it took just 10 to 15 minutes for it to sink. Only 104 people survived. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): All women died, all children died. Because women stay all in one room, it was so impossible they would survive. Impossible. So difficult. All women and their children died. BELL (voice-over): Those who did make it out alive say the boat may have carried up to 750 people. Only 78 bodies so far have been found.

The storm is unleashing heavy rain and destructive wind after making landfall late Thursday evening, local time, in India's Gujarat state.But far from the border -- not far, though, from the border with Pakistan. Biparjoy has wind speeds equivalent to a strong Atlantic tropical storm and will continue to weaken as it moves further inland. The cyclone has already brought down power lines, uprooted trees in some coastal areas. Flooding remains the biggest threat for the next 48 hours. More than 180,000 people were evacuated across India and Pakistan ahead of the storm. Ukraine says its counteroffensive continues to liberate Russian- occupied villages and settlements and is moving forward, albeit slowly. Ukrainian commanders report more than 100,000 square kilometers -- 100 square kilometers, I should say -- in the Zaporizhzhia region has been re-taken over the last week. Russian forces were reportedly pushed back up to a kilometer near the city of Vuhledar. In Bakhmut, Ukraine says Russia is bringing in reinforcements after Ukrainian troops advanced three kilometers over the past ten days. And Russia is putting up stiff resistance across the front lines, according to the Ukrainians, even trying to go on the offensive in some parts. Meantime, Ukraine is getting hundreds more missiles for its air defenses from NATO allies who met in Brussels on Thursday. The U.S. defense secretary says helping Ukraine remains a long-term commitment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: Ukraine's fight is a marathon, and not a sprint. So we will continue to provide Ukraine with the urgent capabilities that it needs to meet this moment, as well as what it needs to keep itself secure for the long term from Russian aggression.

So I'm not quite sure what to compare it to, John. I would say this: that counteroffensive is across a pretty broad area. And we knew that the opening days and weeks of it would involve the Ukrainians testing to see where the Russians are weakest. And I think that we're seeing some of that. They're going to lose some equipment, as they did. The big risk, I think, for the Ukrainians is really a political one here, in addition to the risk of the lives, of course, not to be diminished at all, those who are fighting in all of this.

Now, while the Russian hackers were the first to exploit the vulnerability, experts say that other groups may now have access to software code that is needed to conduct attacks and are simply taking advantage of it.
