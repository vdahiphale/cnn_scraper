He said that that was incorrect information that had been put forward. It was actually a second grade teacher that had put out the call to 911. He also stressed that, as of right now, officials are still working to verify a manifesto that is alleged to have come from the shooter, though the chief says that they are still working to verify the authenticity of that document that was shared online. He's asking the media and the public to not share that document until further steps can be taken to directly tie it to the suspect. He also talked about investigators looking into the subject's social media activity. They are asking for people close to her, to this 15- year-old shooter to come forward if they have any thoughts, any idea, any reflection about their state of mind in the moments leading -- moments and days leading up to what happened yesterday. He said that identifying a motive is a top priority, but it could be a combination of factors and Chief Barnes there did not want to get into the details of the working theory that investigators have as of this time.",

Daniel, we heard from the chief there that identifying a motive is a top priority. What's clear is that they have some idea here, but they don't want to disclose it because he was saying it appears it's a combination of factors. They don't want to jeopardize -- I think it was they said the cooperation that they're getting. So what is your read on that? Is that the cooperation of -- of parents, of students?

And that a lot of these -- information won't be leaked.They -- a lot of people are nervous to be associated with her, obviously, because of the negative connotation surrounding her, her family and the community. So they want to make sure that they feel confident that information that's provided to the investigators remains confidential as part of the investigation. There was very little information regarding the details of the investigation, understandably. But what happens typically in the first 24 hours, there's a lot of confusion, obviously. Clearly, the second grade teacher versus the student dialing 911. This is the point where things are going to start to clarify, and the individuals will be identified. The social media aspect, you know, different databases, different platforms will be identified to see where those red flags were, to see where the investigation is conducting. And at this point, they don't want to obviously put out information that turns out to be incorrect because that is a lot worse to put out incorrect information. So they want to make sure that what information is provided by the witnesses, they are able to verify and ensure that the information is correct before they start providing it to the -- to the media.",

They're not the proprietor of those.I think a lot of folks might think that the school is going to, you know, immediately turn over things. Talk to us a little bit about that, because it's important to note that, in other school shootings, there's been a question of should schools be liable? We saw, in the Oxford School shooting, parents wanted to hold the school liable. And I have to be very clear, we do not know the specifics of this case. But just talk to us a little bit about how that works. Does the school turnover those to law enforcement? What are the concerns of the school in this case?",

I'm sure that there is going to have other names of other students, which if there was an incident that she may have been involved with.So clearly, I think legally in the law enforcement will have to get some sort of subpoena or search warrant to, you know, make ensure that the documents are acquired by law enforcement correctly and to protect the identity of any other students which may have had an incident with her. It's about protecting all the other students as well. But making sure that we understand, as part of the understanding where this all went and part of the investigation, everything that is connected to this young lady will be looked at, will be associated, will be interviewed. They want to find out everything. If there were other people who we're involved, may have facilitated in training with the weapons or in seeing red flags along the way. But getting these documents in any other documents, social media platforms, postings, everything to -- and to verify that that information is correct. And that's why the chief is careful to say that this manifesto has not been verified. They need to verify that it is actually her words before they put out anything publicly.",

That's the 26-year-old suspect accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson.Meantime, those who feel frustration with the state of health insurance in this country have further embraced Mangione, a suspected murderer, with some heralding him for allegedly killing the industry executive. I want to bring back in Elizabeth Benjamin. She's with the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit that advocates for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers on multiple fronts, including on health care. Elizabeth, we are very appreciative of you joining us. And I obviously want to differentiate between those folks who are celebrating a tragedy and a heinous act and those who are not radicals, who are not seeking to unravel the social fabric, but rather are concerned about the status of health care in this country and whether it is just or not. I'm curious whether you have an answer as to how frequently insurance claims for medical purposes are denied, and if it's something that is becoming more common.",

I wish we knew how many claims are denied.The sad fact is, is that the federal government and state governments, who often are charged with administering health insurance companies, some don't really report out how many claims are denied or how many are even processed. We have one report from a group called KFF that indicates around 17 percent of the claims that they looked at, and they looked at hundreds of millions, were denied. And that's what we know from CMS. But of those claims that we're analyzed, there were many states that didn't, including my own, New York, that do not participate and do not report the number of claims that are denied. So if I had one wish, it would be to see that government got a little more involved with having help -- helping us all understand how many claims are denied by carrier and for what reason. Because right now, and I think the frustration a lot of people feel is they have no idea why their claims are being denied. They just know they're getting the runaround.",

I know that it feels that way to consumers.And we hear that a lot on our helpline. We run a Consumer Assistance Program that helps over 30,000 people a year access care, deal with medical claims, resolve medical debt issues. When they reach us, we can -- you know, we prevail over 87 percent of the time. But we're experts. And regular lay people who are just patients that work other jobs or, you know, just aren't experts. And it shouldn't really take an expert to get support for appealing a claim denial or just understanding why your denial is being rejected or why your claim is being rejected.",

And one of the problems that I would say is because we have so many insurance companies and so many providers and absolutely zero interest in having standardized claims processing forms.That -- that because we don't have a level of standardization in how we submit claims, how claims are adjudicated, that that's part of the problem. If, you know, I was queen of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services for a day, I would be the first thing I would work on is saying, OK, enough of letting everybody do their own experimentation. This isn't working for patients. It's working for everybody in the industry. And so we really have to sort of rethink how we run insurance companies and the way claims are being submitted by providers, by patients, by pharmacies. I, myself, was on the phone for 45 minutes. I have a masters in public health and a law degree from Ivy League institutions. And it took me 40 minutes to work out with seven different representatives at CMS and another entity to get a claim resolved for my child. And I'm an expert. How do you think regular Americans are supposed to handle these problems? It's just people give up and that's not fair because that's what drives our country to have such an unheard of medical debt burden. We just don't see this level of medical debt anywhere else in -- you know, in -- in our peer countries.",
