I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Destruction everywhere, that's how one survivor describes the aftermath of a powerful 6.8 magnitude earthquake that struck Morocco Friday, killing more than 1,000 people. It was the strongest to hit the area in over a century. Rescuers are now struggling to access the hardest-hit areas after roads were damaged, and we're now seeing images of patients waiting outside hospitals. Residents have been sleeping on the streets, fearing for the intense aftershocks. I want to bring in CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman for more. Ben, these first few hours, you mentioned the first 72 hours are critical in trying to locate survivors. What are you learning about the kind of rescue efforts that actually can happen given so many roads and thoroughfares are impassable?",

The worst earthquake in the last century was in Agadir in 1960, and that left 12,000 people dead. So it's been a while since they've actually had to deal with earthquakes in that area. Now, the death toll at this point, the last we heard, which was a few hours ago on state television, was 1,037, 1,200 wounded, of whom 721, according to state television, were in critical condition. So the hospitals are also under a lot of pressure dealing with this number of wounded. We have seen that people have been lining up to donate blood. But there have been a series of aftershocks. Now night is beginning to settle down on Marrakesh, for instance, that's the main city, a tourist attraction, which is in the earthquake zone. Many people are sleeping outside again because of fear of more aftershocks. Now, we have heard from the royal palace put out a statement saying that Morocco will be observing three days of mourning, that flags will be flown at half-mast. We're waiting to find out whether Morocco is going to accept all the offers of assistance that have been put out. For instance, the United Arab Emirates has said it's ready to establish an air bridge to provide personnel and relief supplies and equipment, if needed. Israel has assembled medical teams, emergency teams as well. France, the United States, says it's willing to send teams to survey the damage and see what's needed. But at the moment, the real focus is on the relief effort, which is going on, of course, around the clock, Fredricka.",

They agreed on a joint statement laying out shared views on climate change and economic development, which showed divisions within the group by stopping short of condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Biden also announced the launch of a new economic corridor that will connect India, the Middle East, and Europe, a major challenge to Beijing's own efforts at expanding global trade. Noticeably absent from the summit are Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This is the first G20 summit that Xi has chosen not to attend since he took power.

And one of the key issues that was addressed there in the beginning of it was the war in Ukraine. However, the Ukrainians, who are not present at the summit, are unhappy that the criticism of Russia was watered down. In fact, Russia was not specifically mentioned. Instead, there was a statement that no country should be able to invade another country and annex its territory, that the threat of nuclear war in totally inadmissible, and that the war in Ukraine is having an effect, a negative effect on the global economy, particularly on poorer countries.Some of the fact that this is watered down has to be understood because Russia is one of the members of the G20, even though Vladimir Putin did not attend because he is wanted for alleged war crimes, so he doesn't leave Russia very much these days. President Biden was front and center, trying to follow up with the theme coming from the host government, India, which is trying to make itself a champion for the world's poorer countries. Biden came to New Delhi promising more investment into the World Bank to put more investment around the world, and promising this new economic corridor, an ambitious plan to link India to the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Israel, all the way to Europe, with pipelines carrying hydrogen, with trains and shipping by sea, and telecommunications lines, part of an effort that he says is trying to show that the U.S. does care about the world's poorer countries. A final announcement that was made here is that the African Union has been invited to join the G20, and technically that would make it the G21, though we have not heard a formal statement changing the name of this diplomatic club.

It's a big match for both of them, so I'm sure they're both going to be nervous. You said it. They're both very aggressive players, Sabalenka probably hitting the ball a little bit harder compared to Coco Gauff. So I think that Aryna Sabalenka will try to target the forehand of Coco Gauff. We know in the past that has been the wing which sometimes was falling apart.But then on the other hand, Coco Gauff has that variety. She can come to the net, she can throw in a drop shot, a slice. If she can manage the pace of Aryna Sabalenka, she definitely has a shot. And you know what, this is played in New York, so she will have the crowd totally behind her, which will help.",

She's got the experience on her side, right. But then Coco Gauff, we saw a few moments where emotionally she got flustered, and it showed in her game. And then you saw her mom at one point, toward the coaches, like stop the yelling, stop the talking. Even Coco herself said there was a moment where she had to pull it together and it was better if no one was talking to her.

And Coco Gauff, I think even though she showed a few emotions on the court and she a couple of times lost the first set, she won those matches. And I still think that she's mentally very tough, even though sometimes she might be a little bit vocal as well, telling Brad Gilbert, shut up, don't talk to me. And she found the way. And that's the most important thing.I think she has the confidence. I think she's learned a lot from that final she played against Iga Swiatek last year in the French Open, which was a complete disaster for her. She doesn't want this to happen again. She has this experience now and she will use it. She's a quick learner, she's like a sponge, Coco Gauff. Whatever she hears, she takes it in and experiences. And then on the other side, you have Aryna Sabalenka. She has won a Grand Slam title already. Of course, that's a big advantage, I think. She's been there, done that this year at the Australian open. And also that match against Madison Keys where she down six-luv, five three, she managed to turn it around. Also with a little bit of -- you know, she was outgoing and showing some frustration. But that would have given her so much self-confidence as well. So it will be tactics, it will be how stable they are mentally, how they will control their emotions.

Raffensperger has suggested that Graham pressured him to toss out legal mail-in ballots, and that made him uncomfortable. But Graham has denied that accusation. He said he was just inquiring about the mail- in ballot voting system, that he wanted to know how the signature verification system worked. And he also said that he wasn't even talking about the 2020 presidential election, that he was actually talking about a pair of Senate runoff races that occurred in Georgia in January of 2021.

Every single instance of supposed harassment by the church is false and has been debunked.\" Stephanie Elam, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

The church has no policy prohibiting or discouraging members from reporting criminal conduct of anyone, Scientologists or not, to law enforcement. Quite the opposite. Church policy explicitly demands Scientologists abide by all laws of the land. All allegations to the contrary are totally false.\"That a little more elaboration on a statement coming from the Church of Scientology. So when you first started to report on this some six years ago, talk to me about what kind of obstacles you had in trying to get information, versions of events, et cetera.",

But they can say that now because the civil lawsuit about harassment hasn't progressed enough to where they can bring the evidence in. I personally know about evidence that showed the Church of Scientology has tried to detail this case, and I expect it to come out during the civil lawsuit.The second thing they talk about is how there's no evidence of Scientology discouraging anyone from going to police. They say this day in and day out, but during the case their own written testimonies were put into testimony showing that that's exactly what Scientologists are told. So you have their written policies in court as testimony saying that Scientologists cannot turn themselves in, and then you have the spokesman saying we don't do that. As Mike Rinder told Jake Tapper yesterday, it's just a lie. Scientology lies, day in and day out. And that's what has made it so difficult for these women to get their day in court. But like Deputy D.A. Reinhold Mueller said, this court saw through that. This judge educated herself about Scientology. And I'm sure that's what the Masterson family will now focus their appeals on, are Judge Olmedo's ruling about how much Scientology she allowed into the case.",

They're going to complain about the fact that there were a lot more references to drugging in the second trial than in the first trial. She also allowed in some testimony about harassment.I am positive all of those things will come up on their appeal and they will argue to the appellate court that these were mistakes by the judge. The appeal will focus more on the judge than on the victims. And I'm told that when there's a jury involved and the jury believes this evidence that it's difficult for an appeals court to overturn that. But I'm sure the Masterson family is hoping that they find a judge that will see it their way.",

The family and supporters of the defendant will send in letters to try to sway the judge. I got ahold of those letters yesterday. I published them on my Substack, and I think people were absolutely shocked to see the language in the letters from people like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.

Players are no longer seen as replaceable pieces of meat. We even spent time with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, and Dany Garcia, co-owners of the XFL, which is a spring football league, and they've developed some outside-the-box ways to make the game safer. And the NFL told us they're considering some of these changes that they've made. So we've found, Fred, that not only is the game safer than it has ever been, it's constantly evolving, and it will likely keep getting safer.
