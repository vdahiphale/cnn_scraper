And what do we see? In fact, a majority of those likely voters in those sun belt battleground states that, in fact, Kamala Harris has flip-flop on those issues that matter. And yet she is doing significantly better in those states than Joe Biden was back in May. She's tied in the aggregate of these states. Joe Biden was actually down by nine points.Now, what I will note is that a near majority also say that Donald Trump has flip-flopped on issues that matter. So, I'm not quite sure that that talking point lands is strong when you have somebody like Donald Trump who has sort of been all over the map over the last 20 years. Yes, he has been a Republican nominee for president now three times in a row, but before that, I don't think a lot of Americans necessarily knew where he was. And I'm not sure Donald Trump necessarily knew where he was. So, the charges against Harris, I don't think, are sticking. I'm not sure they necessarily matter because as Donald Trump has kind of shown, you could say one thing 20 years ago, and another thing today, and the voters will believe what you say today.",

This is the third time we've done it. We don't necessarily want to do it again.So, I'm looking at, what are the messages that are meant to resonate with those more moderate voters, not just playing to the progressive left flank? And Kamala Harris has proved pretty apt at doing this in a way that I don't feel like Biden was quite as much. She's working in language deliberately targeting independents and how she frames things. So, I'm curious, I'm looking for that. I'm looking for, you know, you've got Congressman Adam Kinzinger speaking, a Republican, who is now supporting her. So, how is she trying to reach those folks. And by the way, she's going to be appearing here, but Donald Trump's on the campaign trail. So, there's going to be a lot to respond to and for her surrogate to be pushing back on. And as we've seen, when he's on the trail lately, it's not a disciplined message. It's not 2016 where it's build the wall, build the economy, you know, rebuild the middle class. It's all over the map. So, she's in a really strong position going into this.",

He's also - I've mentioned this before, he's used to kind of being the pop culture icon in the presidential race. He appeared on SNL in 2016. He's this larger than life cultural figure. But Kamala Harris has kind of consumed that in this race. You've got young people, you've got celebrity endorsements, and I don't think he knows how to navigate that.But there's also a factor, he is just not who he was in 2016. There is a lack of discipline - and, by the way, he's never been the most eloquent person out there, but there's a lack of message discipline. He goes on these side tangents. He's talking about her appearance. It's so unhelpful with the very voters he needs to target, women in the suburbs, independents and moderates.",

I think Joe Biden's going to talk today about, he beat Donald Trump in 2020 on the message of, you know, the battle for the soul of the nation, and he did preserve democracy. But it's about moving forward now, defeating him once again. And that's what Kamala Harris can do.I will just say, you know, no matter what Donald Trump does, if he is - if he is on the stump delivering his message and talking about policies, a lot of the policy that he's talking about is also extremely unpopular, talking about a 10 percent to 20 percent tariff hike that could lead to $4,000 in taxes on families. He talked - you know, he - his policy in the past has been to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And you have someone in J.D. Vance, a partner with him, who's not the most charismatic individual. I mean you talk about rolling out a VP candidate that has absolutely bombed. It's - it's him, right? He's talking about childless cat ladies. He was on a podcast where they were pontificating on the, quote, \"whole purpose of the postmenopausal women.\" They can't talk like normal people. And so that is, I think, the biggest liability for Trump right now is they just can't drive a message.",

It's historic for me personally. This is a book end from 1972.And so, you know, also, I think, the country is clear about the fact that we need new leadership and we need a new perspective. Vice President Harris brings a perspective. She brings a lens that has not been in the White House. And we know to solve these problems, we have to have new energy, new lens, new perspectives a new vision for where we go. But she has the experience. She is prepared. And she's ready.

That's the goal coming out of this convention so that we can make sure that we defeat Donald Trump, who's trying to take away our rights, the freedom to reproductive rights, our voting rights, you name it, and move forward and win.
