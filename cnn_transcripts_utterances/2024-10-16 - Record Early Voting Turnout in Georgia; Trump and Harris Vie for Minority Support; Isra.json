And I think it's the first time that we've really seen the U.S. publicly giving such a firm and stark warning to the Israeli government with regards to the potential for the U.S. to essentially cut off military aid to the state of Israel. Of course, this would all be in line with U.S. law, is how they framed it.So essentially, if we don't see aid getting into Gaza, or at least more efforts to allow aid into Gaza within the next 30 days, Israel could be in violation of U.S. laws, which would prevent foreign military assistance. Now, we've heard warnings from the U.S. in the past on a variety of matters in Gaza, from the incursion in Rafah, where, of course, so many were displaced from bombing Beirut. None of these warnings have been heeded. And of course, what we've also continued to see over the last year is the U.S. stepping up military support, allowing yet more military funding to be authorized for the Israeli government, despite those warnings. Whether we see any actual consequences if Israel does not step up aid or allow more aid to get into Gaza, that remains to be seen. But again, as you mentioned, this is a slight shift. We heard yesterday, of course, from the State Department's spokesperson, Matt Miller. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: What we want to see here is results. This isn't about making a rhetorical statement. It's not about making any kind of threats. It's about seeing the situation reversed, and so that the civilians in Gaza who are not getting adequate access to food and medicine and other humanitarian goods today actually see, as a result of our efforts, a change in their daily lives.

As you mentioned, the U.N. has warned that it has essentially been sealed off. We've been hearing from civilians on the ground who have been trying to evacuate as per the Israeli military's orders, some of whom have come under Israeli fire and have been killed while trying to evacuate. There is simply not enough aid getting into northern Gaza, almost no aid getting into northern Gaza at this stage. And, of course, as the U.N. has said, they believe this could amount to a war crime. So this is a very serious situation. This comes as the U.N. tries to, of course, carry out its second phase of the polio vaccine rollout in Gaza. And really what we're seeing is the situation just grow worse and worse and worse. You mentioned, of course, that the U.S. wants to see now 350 aid trucks getting in every day.

ROY COOPER, (D) NORTH CAROLINA: Over the years, we've seen social media get more and more extreme, filled with disinformation. This is happening in the middle of an election where candidates are using people's misery to sow chaos for their own political objectives, and it's wrong. And this is a time where we all need to pull together to help the people of western North Carolina, and it's disappointing when candidates, knowing full well what they're doing, are continuing this kind of disinformation filled with lies.

It hasn't really developed, but temperatures are significantly colder, 10 to 15 degrees colder than you should be for the morning low temperatures.Still a couple of rain showers across the Ohio Valley right now. And if you get into the upper elevations of West Virginia, there could be a snow flurry or two. Let's get to La Nina. This is when there is a cold pool of water in the Pacific Ocean that bumps up against South America. What it does is deflect the jet stream a little bit, and it affects the weather. So rather than having weather coming in from the west, like El Nino, now all of a sudden it's coming in from the northwest, keeping things cool, but as it makes a turn here in the Midwest and the Great Lakes, it gets fairly wet. There could be some tornado activity here in the spring as we get closer to that warm, cold clash. And I don't really see that with El Nino, but it's certainly possible with La Nina. So this is where we've been, warm, dry across the upper Midwest, cool across the deep south, and that's all about to change. Here's the forecast now that will officially come out on Thursday, but I'll give you a peek at what it's going to look like. Above average temperatures in the winter and then below average in the Pacific Northwest. Depending on where you are with the storm here in the Great Lakes, that's where the above normal precip will actually be. If it's 28, it's a snowstorm. If it's 34, 35, 36, it'll be a cold rain event. Now, it affects the United States and Canada more than it affects the rest of the world, but La Nina still has some global impacts, depending on where you are. From wet across parts of Indonesia, Micronesia, also into parts of Africa, to dry into parts of China. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
