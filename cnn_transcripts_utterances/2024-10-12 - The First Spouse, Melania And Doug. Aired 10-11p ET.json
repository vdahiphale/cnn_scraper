Part of the unusual nature of the campaign includes who will end up as the presidential spouse, traditionally known as the Office of the First Lady. If former president Donald Trump wins, Melania Trump will return to the East Wing for the second time after exiting four years ago. Now, this has only happened once before in the country's history. And then there's Vice President Harris's husband, Doug Emhoff, potentially the first man to ever serve in this role. Over the next hour, CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins, who covered the Trump White House as a reporter, takes a closer look at the history of the first spouse and how it may be redefined by the next person who will hold that title. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): As a White House reporter, it can be easy to overlook the first lady. But that role, and those who have occupied it, have long had a deep influence on the West Wing and the country. It can be part diplomat.",
