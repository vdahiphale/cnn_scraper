This bridge is a symbol of like upward mobility, connectivity to jobs, you know, as it relates to our port in the industries that have sprouted up around the Port of Baltimore. That's why this is just more than a bridge to Baltimoreans. Growing up in the city of Baltimore, you know, I've crossed this bridge thousands of times, many of us have.

And phase two will be more or less on trying to figure out a way of cleaning up, getting the port back to some level of normalcy because right now the port is completely shut down. And then the next effort of, you know, how do we rebuild from here.Baltimore is a resilient town. I know folks get a lot of information about our city nationally, it's not always in a positive light. But our city has always persevered through challenges like this. And I know that we will.

And CNN's Jason Carroll has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Investigators are still in the early stages of piecing together the events that led to the collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge. Already, comparisons being made to past deadly disasters involving America's bridges. I-40 Bridge, Webbers Falls, Oklahoma, May 2002. 14 people killed, nearly a dozen hurt after freight barges being transported on the Arkansas River struck a pier supporting the bridge. A 580-foot section of road collapsed, sending vehicles careening into the water. Queen Isabella Causeway, Port Isabel, Texas, September 2001. Eight people lost their lives when a tugboat and barge struck the Causeway. 11 people drove into the opening below. Only three survived. Big Bayou Canot near Mobile, Alabama, September 1993. 47 people died and more than one hundred injured in what was seen at the time as one of the worst disasters of its kind in the United States. It happened after barges being pushed by a towboat in dense fog hit the bridge, causing an Amtrak train carrying 220 people to derail minutes later. Rescue crews pulled victims from the partially submerged buckled train cars.",

At one point, purchase orders were coming in so fast that trading had to be stopped. But some investors are raising concerns about whether the stock price is a true measure of the company's success.CNN's Matt Egan joins us to explain that. So, Matt, the company last year recorded a loss of $49 million. Yesterday, it received an $11 billion valuation. How does that math add up?",

      "sentences": "Alisyn, there are times when stocks trade just purely on momentum and hype. This is one of those times, right? Trump Media is off to a gangbuster start as a public company. But it has almost nothing to do with the fundamentals.Now, look at this, up 18 percent this morning. This is after a surge yesterday. This is nothing new. This is part of a pattern. This company and the publicly traded shell company emerged with, they'd been on fire more than quadrupling over the past six months. The share price spikes -- look at that spike in January. That was around the time that Donald Trump had a landslide victory in the Iowa caucuses. And the higher the stock goes, the higher Donald Trump's net worth goes. Bloomberg estimates that his net worth went up by about four billion dollars on Monday alone. But look, experts are warning retail investors to be very careful with this stock. They say it's dangerous because the market is assigning a ridiculous valuation. I mean, remember Truth Social, it's tiny. We're talking about, about a half a million monthly active users. Compare that to the company formerly known as Twitter at 75 million, even Threads is 10 times bigger than Truth Social, and Truth Social is actually shrinking. Monthly active users down by 51 percent year over year. And it's also important to look at how this company stacks up with the last social media company to go public. That's Reddit. Just last week. Now, Reddit had about a six-billion-dollar valuation its IPO. That was based on pretty healthy revenue, $800 million. Compare that to Truth Social. It had about a nine-billion-dollar valuation, and that's based on just a tiny fraction of the revenue. But listen, Alisyn, history shows that stocks that are really just trading purely on momentum, they can keep going higher and higher and higher. And it's really hard to pinpoint exactly when they'll come back down to earth.",

We're talking about Trump's casino and Hotel Resorts Company that went public in 1995 to a lot of fanfare and it ended up never making any money, despite the fact that again, this was a casino company. It filed for bankruptcy in 2004. Renamed as Trump Entertainment Resorts and then it went on to lose more than two billion dollars over five years, and then filed for bankruptcy again in 2009.Trump media actually mentioned this in the SEC filings, saying that Donald Trump has a history of filing for bankruptcies, at least his businesses do, and that there could be no assurances that there won't be another bankruptcy here. This is just another reminder, though, of how much risk is tied in with just one person for this company, right? Donald Trump is not just the chairman. He's the top shareholder, he's the most popular user, and he's obviously facing a considerable amount of law enforcement and legal trouble right now, Alisyn.",
