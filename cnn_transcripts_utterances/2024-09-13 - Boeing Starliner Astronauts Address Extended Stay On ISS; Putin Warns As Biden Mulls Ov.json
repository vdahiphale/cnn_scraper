Tonight, U.S. President Joe Biden mulls easingrestrictions on long-range weapons for Ukraine as Vladimir Putin warns the West, that it risks war with Russia if it does. Also ahead this hour, we'll hear from two NASA astronauts who are stuck on the International Space Station. They're holding their first press conference since they left earth on June the 5th, we'll bring that to you, of course. And CNN gets access to the Philadelphi Corridor. More on the bitter dispute over who controls this tiny parcel of land along Gaza's border with Egypt. But first, tonight, Russia's war in Ukraine could be entering a dark chapter, one that might impact the U.S. and other NATO countries. Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to draw a red line, warning that if long-range missile restrictions are lifted for Ukraine, Russia will be quote, \"at war with the alliance\". Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT, RUSSIA (through translator):  This is their direct involvement. And this of course, would in a significant way change the very essence, the very nature of the conflict. It will mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries are at war with Russia. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

However, the White House says it does not plan on making an announcement over the missiles today. Well, the U.S. and the U.K. debate allowing Ukraine, of course, to launch long-range missiles into Russia. They're already in use inside Ukraine. Our Clare Sebastian takes a closer look at potential targets here if Ukraine gets the go-ahead, of course, to launch into Russian territory. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Now, Ukraine has been using western long-range missiles on occupied territory for months. This believed to be a British Storm Shadow, a long-range stealth cruise missile hitting Russia's Black Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea last year. Russian territory has been off limits. Now, a major reason for that is of course, western fears of Russian escalation. But recently, the U.S. has also been arguing that actually lifting those restrictions wouldn't make much difference on the battlefield because it claims many high-value targets, including aircraft that dropped those deadly glide bombs are out of range. But what exactly is in range? Well, this map from the Institute for the Study of War suggests that there are well over 200 targets still in reach of U.S. ATACMS. Those are the red dots you see there. Now, among them is also the headquarters of Russia's southern military district in Rostov and dozens of command centers, storage depots, weapons production facilities and military regiments including, for example, the 52nd Guards, heavy bomber regiment, believed to be responsible for a deadly cruise missile attack on an apartment block in Dnipro last January. President Zelenskyy warning that any further delay may mean the U.S. is proved right.",

There's many cases in the past where there have not been other options. We were very fortunate that we have the space station, and that we had the option to stay, and we had the option to come back a different way if that's what the data showed. I think the data could have gotten there. We could have gotten to the point, I believe, where we could have returned on Starliner, but we just simply ran out of time. Because there's other tests that need to be done, now there are assessments that need to be done, and had we had a little more time, then we could have done it. And why didn't we take the time? Well, it's the International Space Station, we've got seven people, seven U.S. OS crew on board, 12 total, and we've been six on board for quite some time. And to staff the space station with six people. We've done it, we've done it well, I think over the last couple of months, but it's not prepared for that long term. And so, we had to make some decisions on a timeline and the timeline came to the point where we had to decide is Starliner coming back with us or without us.

You know, when Butch and I were preparing for this flight, you know, we obviously hadtalked about it a lot and we had talked about it being a test flight. And knowing that it was scheduled for eight days, there could be other things that would keep us here a little bit longer. We've been training for not only Starliner but also the International Space Station for a number of years. Both of us had been up here before so we have a little bit of experience. And so we could dive right into the International Space Station training. So, we are fully qualified crew members, both qualified in spacewalking, EVAs and robotics for visiting vehicles. So, the transition was not that hard. You know, both of us are mechanically inclined, righty tidy, lefty loosey. There's a lot of things to do on the Space Station when it comes to you know maintenance and repair. Maybe we didn't get all of the science experiments you know training before we left because that was not really initially on the plate but we're getting some OJT, on the job training while we're up here, so we're blending right into the increment particularly this one, 72 -- this 70 -- increment 72 because we'll be two of the U.S. crew members that are involved there. So, I think the transition has been pretty smooth. It wasn't what we expected. However, we were prepared. And you know, the -- NASA, like Butch mentioned, has got us ready to go for that aspect. So, flying home on SpaceX on the Dragon -- you know, there's been a dragon here the whole time we've been here of course with Crew 8 that came up on the Dragon. So, we've had the opportunity to go in the spacecraft, look at it, and work with our other crew members to get it ready to be our, you know, emergency escape vehicle if we have to use it and then, you know, of course we're getting some training on the Crew 9 vehicle as it comes up. We're excited to -- actually, we're excited to fly in two different spacecraft. I mean, we're testers. That's what we do. You know, we look at different aircraft, spacecraft, whatever, evaluate it, and that's a pretty unique opportunity. I think like you know, this was not the very first option we wanted to take Starliner to the completion and land it back on land at home. But you know, you have to turn the page and look at the next opportunity, and you know, do good for the agency and the country. And will come back with some evaluations of most spacecraft and that I think we're pretty fortunate for that.",

He's up at like 4:30 in the morning to work out. I'm a little more about 6:00 a.m. But every day -- I mean, it's every day that you have to do that. Every day we're on a cardiovascular exercise either the bike or the treadmill. Every day we're on the advanced resistive exercise device called ARED which allows us to do deadlifts and squats and allows us to keep our bone density and our hips and our feet. But that means we're going to have to do this for a little bit longer time. I had seen Frank stay up here for a long time and some other folks and thought about like what I would want to do because I like -- I like mixing it up a little bit.

So, your mindset sort of changes. But then again, like I was just mentioning in the question beforehand, your perspective changes. And being able to be on the lifting device and looking right out the window above you and seeing our planet go by and then taking the moment to go and look in the window between sets or just to have that moment to be quiet on the, you know, treadmill or whatever, it takes you to a different place.
