CNN projects that Donald Trump has been elected president, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris and making a political comeback unlike any in modern American politics.Now, we can make this projection because CNN projects that Donald Trump has won Wisconsin. You can see right there currently ahead by 30,000 votes with 99 percent of the vote in. Mr. Trump is only the second former president in U.S. history to be re-elected to the White House. He will return to office after two impeachments in his first term followed by unprecedented criminal indictments and felony convictions. Mr. Trump scoring a landmark victory as he now heads back to power leading a politically divided nation. Again, CNN projects that Donald J. Trump is elected the 47th President of the United States. Let's go over -- actually, let's just take a quick look at the wall here. We can see with Wisconsin Donald Trump now has 276 electoral votes, Harris with 219. You need 270 to win. He is now over that mark. The 10 electoral votes in Wisconsin puts him over that threshold and CNN now considers him the President-elect of the United States of America. Let's go over to the magic wall. Phil Mattingly is there. Let's talk about Wisconsin because those votes from Milwaukee that we were promised came in and that's what made the difference. The number -- the margins actually a lot smaller for Trump than it had been but still enough.",

What we saw about five minutes ago, it was 109,000 votes that came in, in Milwaukee, the largest county in the state. Sixteen percent of the population, usually a Democratic stronghold.That vote broke down about 80 percent Harris to 20 percent Trump, roughly, based on -- as I was kind of doing the math on it. It changed the margin in Milwaukee by fairly a couple of points amount. Not a dramatic amount but a fairly couple of points amount. There is still some vote outstanding but obviously this was enough for our decision to estimate the calculation that Donald Trump's 30,000-plus vote lead right now was enough to call the state of Wisconsin and give Donald Trump -- project Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States. I think what this doesn't change, despite the fact that more than 100,000 votes came in in a Democratic county, that vote split 80-20 for Harris. That margin, while it is significant, is still beneath what Joe Biden was doing in 2020. And so it's the similar story. It's not as dramatic as it had been in terms of Harris underperforming Biden in Milwaukee County, like we've seen in some other urban areas. Wayne County, right now, still holding in that space. Philadelphia is still holding in that space as well. But underperforming in Milwaukee County by a point or around a point. At the same time, there's underperformance or matching margins in a place like Dane County, the second largest county in the state, a Democratic stronghold. Joe Biden, back in 2020, won this by 75 1/2 percent. Harris running about --",

What are people waiting for? What are the potential pathways?You're looking at the biggest blue bubble. That's where the most vote is outstanding in a Democrat-led district right now. This is Wayne County. It's the largest county in the state. Seventeen-plus percent of the population -- voting population lives right here. Home of Detroit. There is still 19 percent outstanding. We saw how the vote batch that just came in in Milwaukee County split so heavily towards Harris. What does that mean for Michigan? Is there a possible pathway here -- right here in Wayne? I think the big question right now is if you look at the margin in Wayne right now, 64 1/2 percent to 32.4, and you compare it back to 2020, underperforming by four-plus points.",

The history this morning -- 5And Geoff Duncan, as we mark this moment, I do want to take a second to reflect on that reality because there was a point in the wake of what happened on January 6 where the Republican Party had a choice about what to do. They could have decided to convict him in his impeachment trial, which would have prevented him from running again in the future. They didn't do that. Kevin McCarthy went down to Mar-a-Lago, posed with Donald Trump, and it was the beginning of what would become another run for him to the presidency. And, of course, now we know how that has turned out. Considering what you lived through and what the country lived through, what do you think it says about us as a country that we're here? GEOFF DUNCAN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (R) FORMER LT. GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA:  Well, I want to start by just a heartfelt congratulations -- or a sincere congratulations to Donald Trump. I've worked for four years to try to not elect him as a -- as a candidate for our party and also as president, but he's won the race, and he's won it the hard way. I never would have thought we'd have been here. I think tens of millions of Americans, including Republicans, never thought we would have been here. And you just add up all of the baggage along the way on his -- the time in office and the time out of office, it's uncomfortable for somebody like me who is a lifelong conservative to watch this happen. But it is what it is. I think the ball is in his court. What's he going to do with this? Is he going to wreck the car because he wants to and because he can? Is he going to sow chaos and confusion and build anger, or he is going to actually take the time to try to fix stuff? And he's that one personality that can actually do this.

When it looked -- there was the potential for COVID to come back in the form of Delta and Omicron, they held a celebration on the White House South Lawn and called it \"Independence From COVID Day.\" There was Afghanistan. There was the denial and dismissiveness about the border was not a crisis. And all of those governing issues -- you know, they treated it -- in some ways this is what -- I'm just reflecting the views of people within the administration as they're reflecting on tonight. They now feel that the administration sometimes treated it as a P.R. problem instead of an actual governing problem. KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND POLLSTER: Well, and it absolutely created that opening. What we saw in polling during the Republican primary was that the primary message being used against Trump by his opponents -- by Ron DeSantis, by Nikki Haley -- was Donald Trump's going to lose. He's a surefire loser. Go with me. I can be a winner. And yet, in every poll I saw when you asked Republican voters who do you think has the best chance to beat Joe Biden, they'd say Donald Trump. Do you think that Donald Trump will beat Joe Biden? Those numbers were through the roof. Republicans felt confident that in a Donald Trump versus Joe Biden matchup that Donald Trump was going to wipe the floor with Joe Biden. And that's why they felt confident saying I like Donald Trump.
