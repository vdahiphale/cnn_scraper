My exclusive interview with the Polish President, Andrzej Duda, as he hostsPresident Biden and other European leaders. Plus, from January 6th to police brutality. Pulitzer prize-winning author, Isabel Wilkerson talks to Michel Martin about how centuries old caste system is hurting American democracy. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. Where Ukraine is bracing and heading into a second year of war. President Joe Biden has spent three days here, and in neighboring Poland, shoring up America's support for this country. Meeting with NATO leaders from across Eastern Europe, and presenting a united front against Vladimir Putin's invasion. In Warsaw yesterday, Biden delivered a defiant and fiery speech, touting an alliance that is committed to protecting democracy. While in Brussels, the European Union discussed yet another round of sanctions against the Kremlin. In Moscow, thousands attended a concert to celebrate the Russian military, fatherland day. Putin described his war as, \"Our historical frontiers for our people\". And just ahead of that concert, Putin held talks with top Chinese diplomat, Wang Yi. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reports that President Xi Jinping will travel to Moscow himself in the coming months to meet with Putin in person. Now, as we said, Biden brought a loud and welcome message to Kyiv on Monday that there should not be a shadow of a doubt where America's support lies. After his walk about with President Zelenskyy, we get the latest on the route ahead with Igor Zhovka. He's the deputy head of President Zelenskyy's office, and he is joining me now here in Kyiv. Welcome to the program. Face to face, here in Kyiv, we've spoken many times over the 24 -- 12 months. First, I want to ask you, what did it mean for you? Were you at those meetings with Biden? What did it mean for you?",

It's been an incredible year.And for weeks now, Russian and Ukrainian forces have been locked in a fierce battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut. Towns across Ukraine know firsthand what it's like to fall into the hands of the enemy. And many are living in fear of being recaptured. Correspondent Sam Kiley has this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  A year into Russia's invasion, this monochrome misery is all too familiar. KILEY (on camera):  This is what happened just three days ago here in Antonivka (ph), an S-300 missile strike. Now, that's a missile used by the Russian for ground attack which actually designed for bringing down airplanes but it carries a massive warhead. It's pretty inaccurate. And that doesn't matter to the Russians because this is all about smashing up the villages and towns ahead of what the Ukrainians fear is going to be a major Russian push in this part of the country. KILEY (voiceover):  Captured on the second day of Vladimir Putin's invasion last February, this is no longer a town that scares easily. It was liberated by Ukraine in the fall and is within more range of Russian troops today. Yet these teenagers are taking a walk through what remains of their village. KILEY (on camera):  Why do your parents not insist that you all leave as a family? KILEY (voiceover):  My dad has a farm here. He's got land. And we can't just leave it all behind, she says. So, we just don't want to go yet. Well, if it gets serious, then we'll leave. KILEY (on camera):  And how would you define really serious? In most countries having a missile that big land in the middle of town is already really serious. KILEY (voiceover):  Very serious is probably when a lot of houses are destroyed and civilians suffer, she explains. It's the defiance of Ukrainian civilians that Russia is trying to crush. Putin's rockets and artillery have rained down on towns from Kherson to Kramatorsk, to Kupyansk and the northern border with Russia. Along a front line of 1,300 kilometers, that's 800 miles. This latest assault in Kherson, another example of the indiscriminate shelling of civilians. This isn't accidental, it's deliberate. The areas liberated by Ukraine bear the brunt of an ever-increasing level of attacks by Russia. Here in Kupyansk province, as in Kherson, civilians survive on aid rations. We don't know what to do, she says. Houses are shaking. Missiles are flying. We just don't know what to wait for. We are shaking like chickens. We don't know what to expect. Fighting has been most intense in and around Bakhmut with a surge in attacks by Russia on nearby villages in a foretaste of the anticipated offensive. Veterans like Alex, who captured this tank called Bunny from Russia last month, are running low on ammunition. He says that he, sometimes, in combat with only 10 shells a day.",

So, I remember everything vividly. I still recall the huge difference, the gigantic difference. Just imagine that the first time I went to western Europe was when I was 18. So, after 18, that was the first time I was able to travel to Western Europe because my family did not have any connections with the communists. My parents never belong to the communist party. My father was a member of the opposition. So, in fact, we didn't have an opportunity to Western Europe. And apart from that, we didn't have money.

As you know, you have some arguments with the E.U. over yourcommitment to E.U. principles and the judiciary, freedom of press and elsewhere. And I wonder whether this a war has changed some of your policies, has tempered some of your policies in that regard because they used to be accusations that Poland, and indeed, Hungary were proudly illiberal democracies. Is your aim to continue to be an illiberal democracy or has this war changed some of your attitudes about independent judiciary and the free press? DUDA (through translator):  The problem is as follows, either we believe in democracy or we do not. Either we approve the principles of democracy or not. If we approve the principle of democracy, we have got a very that is a simple matter. There is general election. People vote in the general election, and they make their choices. They vote on a program, people who are running in these elections. So, I have always been open about my program. In Poland, we have got full freedom of speech and the freedom to present your opinions. Myself and my political competitors have never had any problems with that. And our compatriots are making the choice. My compatriots cast their votes and make their choice in this way just like -- as I was chosen for the first time in 2015. Then I was elected for the second time to the office of the president in Poland, it was back in 2020. These were totally free choices and election. And the same goes for the current ruling party in Poland. The first time they were elected in 2016 and in 2019. As of today, they are doing their public service because they received a democratic mandate in free elections. So, a program was being implemented here which was announced during the election campaign. So, this government is not liked by those in Brussels, ruling in Brussels todays because we do not have those left and liberal views which are dominant in Brussels today. We are politicians of a conservative profile, I would put it in this way, therefore they don't agree with us in Brussels and they are doing everything to make sure that we are -- that our power is taken away. I believe this is not democratic, because we can compare it to somebody not agreeing in Brussels, with a choice made by the Polish people. I think this is not the task of Brussels or the European commission and other E.U. institutions. So, this is a very specific and a very complex situation. Of course, we are a member of the European Union. Of course, we are trying to implement all the treaty obligations. But unfortunately, very often, we can see that those treaty obligations are violated, vis-a-vis, Poland, the European Union. At these institutions firstly, the European Commission are interfering in the areas in Poland which is not in line with the treaties because the justice system is not regulated by the European treaties. This is an individual matter of each member state. And as a matter of fact, the European Union and its bodies have no right to interfere in the entire efforts of Poland. And the Polish citizens have, so far, been happy with the polish authorities and their decisions if they voted for them in the elections. This is my answer. I believe that the dispute with Brussels is simply, purely political dispute. Simply speaking, it is a dispute about who is in power in Poland. The current authorities dominating any institutions are not happy because their views are different from the views of those who are in power in Poland today and who are elected in general elections.",

And it has certain pillars,certain characteristics such as purity versus pollution, control endogamy, control of marriage, who can be with whom. And historically, our country has had or was built upon many of the characteristics of a caste system. It's hard for us to acknowledge that or think about it because we don't think ourselves as having a caste system. But our country was built on a system of hierarchy, graded ranking of human value which is what a caste system is. And in any caste system, you could choose any number of metrics to divide in the rank people. In our society, in our country, the metric that was used to divide and rank in our people was what people looked like which is what we now use as, you know, as the idea of race. And we can see the after effects of that in our current day. We -- you know, this book that I wrote, \"Caste\" came out in 2020 with the trajectory of the lifespan of this book. It came out just weeks after George Floyd had been killed, then six months later, there was January 6th which was, you know, historic, you know, inflection point in our country's history. We have to go back to the 19th century to find anything closely analogous to that. And then we have the overturning of Roe V. Wade, then -- you know, then just weeks before this book came out in paperback, which you referred to afterword of, we have the killing of Tyre Nichols.

But caste allowed us to see that this is an aspect of the dehumanization that happens within a caste system. Caste system is, you know, essentially positions of some people at the bottom and is focus on keeping certain people at the bottom so that others can remain secure in their place above them. And so, when you have a situation like Tyre Nichols who suffered unbelievable suffering in that situation, and we look at that and we realize that this -- that almost any -- in a caste system, almost any atrocity can be directed toward those who are identified and recognized as being at the very bottom of the hierarchy. And that means that these atrocities could go -- could be inflicted upon them by anyone, in any group, including their own group because the -- there are sentinels at everyone (ph) in a caste system.

That we learn and recognize that our country is like an old house. You are not the one who created the uneven pillars in choice and beings, and the freight (ph) wiring and bloated pipes. But once you take possession of that house, it is up to you. It is up to you to fix whatever is wrong. And we have many, many systems that are facing challenges and need overhaul, repair and overhaul, in our country and that means that we have a lot of work to do. The beauty of looking at our country as an old house, I describe myself as sort of the inspector of this old house in the column, is that it allows us to recognize that this is not -- we don't get anywhere by making this something about blame and shame and guilt. That we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work, to be -- to fix this. But you can't fix what you don't recognize and you can't heal from what you have not diagnosed. And the goal is to first understand, how did we get here? Caste allows us to see. Looking at the infrastructure of our country, whatever we call that, allows us to see the definite breadth of what we are up against. And so, we, I think, need to learn to recognize our country's history, to know how we got to where we are and to not be surprised when these things happen but to get ahead of it, and to recognize what we're facing as a country in order to make this the most egalitarian, open, and country with the most potential. This is -- what I've done is a prayer for our country. It is of prayer that we find a way to get ahead of this existential crisis so that we can make this a country that we want it to be, that's embracing of all people. We have a chance to create a country that embraces all, and that is a fair and more egalitarian one for all, and hopefully even a more successful one that's been.",
