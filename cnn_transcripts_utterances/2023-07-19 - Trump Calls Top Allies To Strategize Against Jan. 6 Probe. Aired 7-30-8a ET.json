We also know that they are leaning into this politically. We saw Donald Trump's campaign blast off a fundraising email last night. We've seen them do this in the previous two indictments against him. Of course, he's not been indicted in this case yet, but they're already seizing on the political momentum.And as for how Donald Trump is feeling. I think it's interesting to note that after his lawyers received this target letter on Sunday night, Donald Trump kept it unusually quiet. He did not share it widely within members, within his inner circle. And I think it shows that he's -- this is weighing on him. He recognizes how serious these charges are. And of course, as he said before, he does not want to be indicted. And he echoed this sentiment during a townhall with Sean Hannity last night. Let's listen to that exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, it bothers me. It bothers me for everybody in this incredible sold out audience. And it's -- it bothers you. I got the letter on Sunday night, think of it. I don't think they've ever sent a letter on Sunday night. And they're in a rush because they want to interfere -- it's interference with the election. It's election interference never been done like this in the history of our country and it's a disgrace. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And what he's going to do as we've seen already is trying to fundraise off of they're coming after me, it's an attack on you. It probably works in a primary, I don't see anyone standing up and challenging him in a major way with the exception of a few of the candidates that are pulling lower, but it's radioactive in a general election.

Well, Trump is counting on the same theory. So that that is what the theory is. But there's no doubt that among voters outside of the Republican base, this aggregation of charges is a very, very serious problem for him. And I don't know what the solution is. But in terms of his public -- what you say, call it a public relations strategy. I think part of what he's doing is a legal strategy. It's got a jury down in Florida. I'm sure they're hearing some of this. And you all he needs his one jury to say, I think they're being unfair to this guy. And he gets off. So, look, we heard that January 6 Committee hearings, a lot of what we've seen -- or we're seeing unfold here was revealed and disclosed in those hearings. I'm sure Jack Smith has more.

That's finally turned. You now have wages growing faster than consumer prices, inflation, and that is something that people will start to feel. So I think there are storm clouds on the horizon, no question. More fed rate hikes. You're going to have student loan bills are going to be coming due in a couple of months.

And the way that you actually get to the intent is either by direct evidence or statements that have been made, or circumstantial evidence or contextual clues, as in testimony from somebody else about what the person said.We've already seen the January 6 Investigation Committee witnesses that several have talked about his direct statements, about believing he had lost the election but wanting to have a different course of action in the public square nonetheless, and so all of that will be a part of the conversation. But David's right in terms of the possibilities here. The world kind of is the legal oyster, according to whatever evidence has come in from the grand jury. For someone like Jack Smith, a special counsel. You have not only the January 6 hearings but you also have as one of the charges that's laid out there potentially in a target letter tampering with a witness. That should be a red flag that tells you that somebody who has been meaningful to this investigation, had a kind of roadblock, where somebody tried to either interfere with their testimony, undermine it in some way, threaten or otherwise intimidate. And so for that to be outlined as a notice there suggests that there is likely somebody who is either cooperating or somebody who is a witness that they actually need, who is not able or was not able to fully have the opportunity to speak freely, and so that's a real concern. But as far as how you understand all of this, a lot of this, of course, that conspiracy statements, the defraud, all these little buzzwords, legally, what it comes down to are three real buckets. What happened before January 6 and post-election, what happened on January 6, and what happened following January 6 for the investigation. The theme and connective tissue here is the behavior, the planning and the intent. But Trump is not unlike many other defendants, where you have to prove one's intent and intent-based crime. It's not as if suddenly everybody else is able to have their mind read. You always have to use different evidence and the surrounding evidence to lead a jury to believe that you have proven beyond a reasonable doubt, that in spite of all common sense, all evidence available, all statements of a reasonable person, one's head was in this hand, nonetheless. That's really the course of action here. MATTINGLY: David, we've only got about a minute left, so we can't do statutes as much as I love them and impressed by them. But from a legal team perspective, do you feel like the president's legal team is going to have to get bigger? Are they set up to address something like this? Should it actually come to fruition?",

I'm not an expert on anything, frankly. But I think that if they were to bring the insurrection charge, I think that the political fallout is going to be huge on that. I don't say that should guide whether they bring it or not, although I think it should be a prudential factor considered in.But I don't think in any way, shape or form they fairly should be able to prove the Brandenburg factors under or the insurrection charge that's encouraging violence, intending to cause violence, knowing that it likely will produce violence that sort of thing. I think if you really parse his speech and other surroundings factors, that would not be a fair charge. The wildcard of course, is the jury.
