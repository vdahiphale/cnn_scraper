New mass protests, breaking out, today. And tonight, one of those Democrats has his seat again. Justin Jones has been sworn in, once again, returning his nameplate, to his desk, in the State House, just a few moments ago. But the big question, tonight, is for how long? This political drama all started, on Thursday, when Jones and Justin Pearson, both of whom are Black, were ousted, from their seats, by Republicans. A third lawmaker, who is a White woman, narrowly survived her expulsion vote. GOP lawmakers alleged that they broke decorum rules, by leading a gun control protest, on the House floor, following last month's school massacre, in Nashville. But the City's Metropolitan Council had a special meeting, earlier, and voted unanimously, to send Jones, back to his seat. This was his reaction after that vote. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) J.

He wasn't expelled, right? Like the action that was taken, in Tennessee kind of was rightly exposed as an overstep.

It suspended the FDA's 23-year-old approval, of the abortion drug Mifepristone. Without a freeze, that ruling would go into effect, Friday, this Friday, at midnight.

He was sworn in, on the Capitol steps, where just days ago, he and another fellow Democrat, were expelled, by the Republican-dominated house. That other lawmaker, Justin Pearson, watched, from the gallery, today, as Jones addressed the chamber. And Justin Jones is with us now. And good evening, and thank you for being here. I know that you have had quite a day, and we were watching it all play out. Tell me what it was like to be back in that same room, where you were expelled, just a few days ago. J. JONES: Well, good evening, and thank you for having me. [21:55:00] Today was a powerful day, and a testament to people power. We went from the Council meeting, with thousands of people, marching down the street, right in front of me, to the People's House. I got sworn in, immediately outside, by one of our judges here, in Nashville, and walked into the People's House. And it was a very emotional day, and an exhausting day, but also a hopeful day. What we saw today was the people saying that \"We're not going to allow the attacks on democracy, led in this building, by Speaker Cameron Sexton, and his leadership group, to happen in the comfort of silence, but that, we will respond, with a mass movement.\" And so, I got my Easter suit on, because their attempt, to crucify democracy, has really resurrected a movement here, in Tennessee, a movement that is multi-racial, and inter-generational, and that's really going to transform Tennessee, and the South.",

And so, we need bold leadership. We need to fight for our communities. These young people are demanding that we take action for commonsense gun laws? We need to respond to them. And we need to respond to these assaults on democracy, with progressive bold voices. And so, I'm honored to stand here, as a Representative of the District 52, once again, a few days later, because what - that's what it's about, is that the people in my district, 78,000 (ph) people, in our community, one of the most diverse district, in Tennessee, we must represent them. We must speak for them, in these halls of power, and not allow these attacks, on their rights, and on our communities, this proliferation of weapons of war, on our streets, to happen, without voices dissenting, saying that \"No, this is not good for our people,\" and that we cannot consent, or agree to any of this, that we must challenge it.

And there was, really, I don't know if there was anything more said, besides that. But you could see that there is a point of reflection happening here that they thought their attacks on democracy, would just happen, without any type of resistance, without any type of accountability. But the opposite is happening. And it's put a spotlight, on what's happening, in this building. And so, the Republicans, who are in our leadership group, again, we must continue to push, so that the voices of all people, in Tennessee, are heard. That's all we were asking for, is that let us speak for our district, these young people, who are saying we want to live. These mass shootings keep happening. We had another one here today, in Louisville. I mean, we must act on this issue, this proliferation of guns, in our community. That's what we're going to do. And so, they told me today I can file 15 bills, because I'm now technically a new member. Every one of those bills is going to have to do with commonsense gun laws. Every single one of those bill is going to have to do with that, because that's what these young people are begging us to do.

And my message to the young people, here in America, is that if your voice did not matter, they will not be trying so hard to silence us. They will not be trying to suppress our votes, and stop us, from having a voice in our democracy.
