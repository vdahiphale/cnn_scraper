And with that would come concerns about courthouse security, for example, with the potential for demonstrations or rallies by Trump supporters that could possibly be galvanized by what we heard over the weekend from the former commander in chief calling for protests.Of course, the concern is any sort of assemblies would make it beyond peaceful protests and maybe lead to violence and counter demonstrations. And that is why at this hour local, state and federal law enforcement certainly talking about the potential there. Also another just fascinating angle in all this is what one federal law enforcement official told our colleague John Miller that the Secret Service detail in charge of the former president's security is actively engaged in conversations of their own with some of their New York counterparts about the logistics involved in transporting Donald Trump here to the Manhattan district attorney's office to face any potential charges. Sources telling Miller that certainly would likely be away from the crowds, away from the cameras given the publicity.

It was the language where he said, you know, get -- take America back. That's the language of January 6th.So, I think there is concern that in the way that we know Trump does this, he sort of says words that his listeners know exactly what he means. I think the difference here and why the threat level is reduced from January 6th is for a number of reasons. One is we have notice. I mean, as John Miller and other CNN reporters are stating there is, you know, considerable prep for what to anticipate. Second, the Trump's lawyers have said that if there is an arrest, we don't know if it's Tuesday or whenever, that they will comply so that, hopefully, there is not too much drama. And third, what we've seen over the last couple of years, just those of us who monitor sort of the violent wing of Trump supporters, is that it will be harder for him to get people animated. He doesn't have the platforms. He doesn't have the apparatus of government. And many of them saw what happened to those who went on the Hill on January 6th, arrested, losing jobs, losing their reputations and are likely unwilling to essentially, you know, sort of charge the Hill for him if he is unable to protect them.",

This is as a constitutional matter a big deal as well.The United States, unlike many democracies has never done this before. This has never occurred before. Trump is unique in that regard as well. Most high-profile white, you know, white collar defendants, this is not a murder trial, would prefer and choose and be given the option to do this without a perp walk. They would be brought in behind so Trump certainly has the apparatus to do that, and that was what we would expect. Unfortunately -- or fortunately we are talking about Donald Trump who is going to view this moment as one in which, you know, he can raise money, essentially, and may choose for it to be public. In that regard, there will just be what we call perimeter security to ensure that people can't get close. There will be images that everyone will be watching and -- on TV and live. And so, it just depends how his lawyers want this -- he and his lawyers want this to play out.

The White House will be watching this meeting very closely and they will be watching it with a sense of deep skepticism, especially when it comes to the intentions of Chinese President Xi Jinping, specifically for the fact that China has not condemned the war and it continues to support Russia.So as my colleague Kevin Liptak has reported, the White House has been out early trying to reframe this meeting pitched by the Chinese as a peace mission saying that anything that comes from this peace mission meeting is going to be tilted towards Russia and, therefore, bad for Ukraine. For instance, John Kirby, the national security spokesperson here, he said very clearly that something that could come out of this meeting would be a ceasefire, but that that ceasefire would only be beneficial to Russia to allow it to regroup. So, that's some of the things that we're hearing from the White House. Now, of course, this meeting will come after U.S. officials have in recent weeks warned that China is considering providing lethal and military aid to Russia really an escalation of what they are already doing in terms of this confrontation, in terms of this war. And, of course, the White House now will be watching very closely to see if there are any developments on that front. U.S. officials have been very clear to say that they have not seen that Russia -- that China has made a decision on that front and they have not seen that China has provided any of that aid, but, of course, they are considering it.

Get back in the vehicle.WEDEMAN (voice-over): The U.S. never found Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, the original rationale for the war. And blunder after blunder poured fuel on a fire of resentment. Every U.S. operation like this one I covered in the summer of 2003 left behind a trail of bitterness. By midweek, U.S. troops had detained nearly 400 men. None from their most wanted list. They also managed, however, to arouse a fair amount of resentment. The Americans are occupiers, says this man. They have no manners or ethics. One of them grabbed a Quran and threw it to the ground. The U.S. cobbled together a political order based on sectarian divisions. Disbanded the Iraqi army and the once ruling Ba'ath Party throwing hundreds of thousands out of the job. And was mired in Abu Ghraib prison scandal where Iraqis were tortured, humiliated and photographed. Eleven U.S. soldiers were convicted of crimes. Less than a year after the invasion, large parts of Iraq were in chaos. Saddam Hussein was captured, tried and executed but the insurgency went on. The Abu Musab al Zarqawi, a Jordanian born leader of al Qaeda in Iraq was killed but the insurgency went on. Two years after the invasion, sectarian tensions between the Shia majority and the once dominant Sunni, Arab minority, erupted into civil war and the killing intensified. The violence only subsided after the U.S. surged more troops into Iraq in 2007. In August, 2010, the last U.S. combat troops left Iraq leaving behind a brittle, corrupt, deeply flawed democratic regime riven by sectarian tensions, which provided fertile ground for the rampage of the Islamic State, or ISIS, spilling over from the war in Syria into Iraq. ISIS seized control of the northern city of Mosul and then captured city after city, reaching the outskirts of Baghdad. It took more than three years of bitter combat and foreign military assistance to defeat the group. That enemy vanquished, old discontents resurfaced. In 2019 Baghdad was gripped by massive protests against corruption, sectarianism and poor living conditions. But like protest movements across the region, it, too, was crushed. As the U.S. invasion and occupation fade into history, neighboring Iran plays an ever greater role in the country's affairs. Old problems, corruption, dysfunctional infrastructure and unemployment remain unresolved. Yet, despite it all, today Baghdad is more peaceful than it has been in years. Ben Wedeman, CNN.
