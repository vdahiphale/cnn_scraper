When you talk to Democrats on the Hill about this, they don't dismiss it as an issue, as might happen on some other channels. They don't say that it shouldn't be tackled or anything like that, but they say Republicans are constantly trying to use this as an issue. And it never works. It never works. This is what Democrats say, this is not my opinion. They say Trump tried in 2018, it didn't work. You tried in 2020, it didn't work. Glenn Youngkin tried it when he tried to change the legislature in Virginia, it didn't work. They tried it in the special election in New York with a crowd that you would think would appeal -- it would appeal to, a lot of cops live in that district, et cetera, and it didn't work out.

And as Republicans continue to paint the picture that an open border leads to more immigration or more crime, not just by the way, in a place like I live in Texas, but all the way up to places like Minnesota, and as we've seen in Georgia, it's a very personal issue, because it's a one based on fear and emotion right now.

You've known your fellow Delawarean, President Biden, for quite some time. Is it fair to say that this is the most important speech of his career? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE), FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: It's certainly one of the most important speeches of his career. I thought one of the greatest contributions Joe Biden has ever made to our nation and our democracy was defeating Donald Trump in 2020. I didn't think we'd be back here and he'd have to do it again. But he has an incredible record to run on. And in the years since the 2020 election, the character and the challenges and the conduct of these two men have only made the distinction between them sharper and clearer. Ninety-one criminal counts are in Donald Trump's future. And Joe Biden is running on an incredible record of bringing us together, getting bipartisan bills passed into law, and then investing in American infrastructure and manufacturing, lowering prescription drug prices, and protecting our veterans. So he's got a lot to talk about tonight. Yes, it's an incredibly important speech. And I'm hopeful that the American people will be watching and listening, because he's got a great case to make.",

Joe Biden, our president will show tonight energy and engagement, a mastery of the issues going on around the world and leadership here at home.I do think he needs to be optimistic about our future. He is a fundamentally positive and optimistic person who believes in America, believes in the possibility of innovation and growth and opportunity for all of us. But he's also going to have to draw a sharp contrast so that the American people understand what's at stake, if they make the error of reelecting the former president rather than giving Joe Biden and his incredible and talented team in his cabinet and his very capable vice president a second term to deal with some of the issues not yet fully addressed.",

What is lacking is the connection. The average American isn't clear whether or not those things happened because of Joe Biden. That's the point of a campaign is to point out to folks what Donald Trump promised but never delivered on and what Joe Biden promised and actually delivered on and the difference between the two of them.So, we're really just beginning the campaign between here in November in earnest across the country on the ground. And I am confident that those numbers will steadily change as our economy continues to strengthen, as people see and feel the impact of everything from a cap on the price of insulin to new manufacturing job announcements, and as they focus more on the difference.

She escapes any official House Republican disciplinary measures.And the same day Congresswoman Greene was behaving like that this week, North Carolina Republicans went to the polls, and they nominated this man to be their gubernatorial nominee, Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. Now Robinson has long publicly engaged in Holocaust denial including calling the Holocaust, hogwash. He has a provably sighted and Adolf Hitler quote about, quote, \"pride in one's own race.\" And he agreed with a fringe pastor who called the Jewish bankers, the Rothschild, one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The Republican Jewish Coalition, called Robinson's past comments, quote, \"clearly antisemitic.\" And the Republican Party rallying around the lieutenant governor of North Carolina. CNN's Dianne Gallagher now takes a deep dive into the controversial, offensive, extremist and deeply disturbing comments that Robinson has made in the past about Jews and other groups and how that might weigh on the minds of North Carolina's voters as they head to the polls this November.
