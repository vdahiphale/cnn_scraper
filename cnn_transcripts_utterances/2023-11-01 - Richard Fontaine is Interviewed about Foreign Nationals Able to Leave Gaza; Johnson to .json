Sources say that this was a deal brokered by Qatar, the gulf nation over there, as well as Egypt, Israel and Hamas, all involved in this.This will ultimately allow up to 500 foreign nationals to cross into Egypt, along with Palestinian patients, some of whom are critically injured. The United States says American are not part of this first group crossing today, but they are expected to be able to leave as early as tomorrow. One thing we should note, this does not include the some 240 hostages that Israel says are now being held by Hamas inside Gaza. Kate.",

Let's start where John was just -- what John was just talking about, getting Americans and other foreign nationals out of Gaza has been a real priority for the Biden administration as it supports Israel's retaliation against Hamas in Gaza. If the crossing is now opening up more, Palestinians able to get out, how does that impact the strategy for Israel, do you think, and the view from the White House of this war against Hamas?",

It's good to have some of the foreign nationals come out, but, of course, there's 240 or so hostages, including Americans, that are resident now in the Gaza Strip.

That number really caught my attention when I saw it. And overnight, as we've seen the pictures and seen the reporting, we just had Mark Regev on to talk about it, there was this strike against the -- on the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza. The IDF and Mark Regev saying that they took out a top Hamas commander and other Hamas militants, but it also has led to an unknown number of civilian casualties.

But Israel hasn't gotten all of what it seeks, and that's why you're seeing the ground operations proceed step by step and currently appears to be surrounding Gaza City where there's many tunnels and outposts of Hamas there.

We have U.S. troops deployed both in Iraq and in Syria, both of which have been subject to attacks by Iranian proxies. The United States has already bombed Iranian proxies in Syria in retaliation. I think the secretary of defense is saying that if these kind of attacks on Americans continue, then the United States will take further military action against them to make it stop. That, of course, is separate from the sort of Damocles (ph), so tospeak, that is hanging over northern Israel, which is Hezbollah's potential involvement. The president has spoken to this in generalities at least to try to warn Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies to stay out of the war in Israel. Hasn't said specifically what the United States would do if Hezbollah did enter the war, but I think part of the deterrent message is that the United States might not stay on the sidelines if Hezbollah made the ill-advised decision to try to take advantage with Israel while it's tied up in the south with Hamas.",

A source tells CNN that Speaker Johnson is set to meet for the first time with the full Republican Senate conference today during their weekly lunch, which could prove critical as there's a real party divide right now over how to move forward on some much discussed, much debated aid packages for Israel and Ukraine. Johnson wants to move a stand-alone bill offering $14.3 billion in aid for Israel, not moving that together with any funding for Ukraine, however.CNN's Sunlen Serfaty is on The Hill for us and joining us now. Sunlen, this seems an important moment for Speaker Johnson to lay out his strategy when he meets for the first time with Senate Republicans. What are you hearing?",

In essence into the lion's den for the new speaker who comes over to the Senate to meet with Senate Republicans today, many of whom are deeply dissatisfied with his new proposal for aid to Israel. Of course, there are deep divisions already with his new bill, his $14 billion proposal, that provides aid to Ukraine but does not provide any -- excuse me, it provides aid to Israel but does not provide any aid to Ukraine. It's paid for by deep cuts to the IRS spending.Now, that has caused a lot of consternation among members of his own party and over here in the Senate, too, which is why he's coming to the lunch today to in essence sell this plan, talk to them about what he intended, as he's met with many people, many Republicans, saying this would be a deep mistake to decouple the funding for Ukraine and Israel. The White House even coming out with a very strongly worded veto threat about this bill. They said, quote, \"the bill inserts partisanship into support for Israel, making our ally a pawn in our politics, at a moment we must stand together.\" And issuing a veto threat if it were to go forward up here on Capitol Hill. Now, all of these big ticket items, of course, must be attended to. This is what the speaker wants to focus on. But today the reality of this moment is the House, as they return to Washington today, they will be dealing with a flurry of these side issues. They have three resolutions that they need to deal with on the floor today. These are privileged resolutions, meaning they need to get quick action. That's on the censure resolution of Rashida Tlaib, censure resolution for Marjorie Taylor Greene and the effort to expel George Santos from Congress. So, the reality of this moment is a lot of these side issues are eating up precious floor time that the new speaker needs for these bigger ticket items. Kate.",

Nearly twice the support of Ron DeSantis. Granted, Nikki Haley was governor of South Carolina. But this still tells you where things are headed.With us now to look much deeper, much, much deeper than merely these top line numbers, our senior data reporter, Harry Enten.

Donald Trump led among Republicans in South Carolina, but all the others added up to about 60 percent of the vote. So, at this particular point, Donald Trump is much further ahead than he was at this point in the 2016 cycle. And the fact is, that this idea that, oh, my God, all these candidates are going to come together, that was much more of an argument for 2015 than today.",
