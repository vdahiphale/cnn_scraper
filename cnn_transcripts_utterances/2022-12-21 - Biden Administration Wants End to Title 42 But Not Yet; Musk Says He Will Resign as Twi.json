And they're losing patience.Take a look at this video that we obtained from one of the migrants. It shows migrants using inflatable rafts to cross the Rio Grande. And if you look closely, you can see, I mean this is broad daylight. There's a group of migrants that are congregating on the Mexican side and they're also providing commentary. You can hear them say that they're tired of waiting. And also they point out that across the river they can see U.S. immigration authorities watching all of this unfold. And so, Kaitlan and Don, I've got - I've got to share. Like, a lot of these migrants are saying that they were really hoping that today, the day that Title 42 was expect to lift, that they were going to be able to walk to a port of entry, like the one that you see behind me, and turn themselves into authorities, and they wanted to enter the U.S. legally.

Sources say that Stefan Passantino urged Cassidy Hutchinson to tell the committee she did not recall details that she did recall. Details like her testimony that former President Trump insisted on being taken to the Capitol despite knowing there were armed protesters there. Passantino told her to avoid topics that would cast a bad light on Trump, urging her, quote, no, no, no, no, no, we don't want to go there.Here with the exclusive reporting is CNN's Paula Reid. Paula, we saw this in the summary that the committee released and there was some speculation about who this person was and now we've learned more about it.",

The committee did not identify these people, but CNN has learned that Stefan Passantino, the top ethics attorney in the Trump White House, is the lawyer who allegedly advised his then client, former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, to tell the committee that she did not recall details that she actually did.And, interestingly, Trump's Save America political action committee funded Passantino and his law firm, including paying for his representation of Hutchinson. Now, in a statement to CNN, Passantino said he didn't advice Hutchinson to mislead the committee. He said, quote, I represented Ms. Hutchinson honorably, ethically and fully consistent with her sole interests as she communicated them to me. Now, before her public testimony, Hutchinson dropped him and got a new lawyer. But, Kaitlan, this is just one of several instances in which the committee has accused members of Trump's orbit of trying to obstruct the panel's investigation.",

And a source tells CNN that the Justice Department's special council, Jack Smith, he sent a letter to the committee earlier this month requesting all of the information from this investigation. We've learned the committee has been sending documents and transcripts in the last week focusing on evidence related to former Trump attorney John Eastman and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Interestingly, the Justice Department also has Mark Meadows' text messages that, you may remember, those provided some of the most significant evidence released to this investigation so far. But in talking with the former president's legal team, they also want to see these transcripts. They believe there have been witnesses who have given testimony that undercuts the committee's narrative and that was excluded from public hearings. Now, the committee chairman tells CNN they will release hundreds of transcripts, but some witnesses with sensitive material the panel has vowed to protect.",

And, again, this is part of a larger pattern that the committee is trying to set up, arguing that people in Trump's orbit were trying to obstruct this investigation. Now, there's no indication there will be charges or anything like that, but ethically, no, if I client tells you, I remember this, to tell them, you'd be like, no, no, you don't.

And that is part of the major issue here, why the administration is so concerned and has launched this really expansive task force, spanning across several administration agencies, to try to figure out how to stop that because the micro components, these microelectronics, things like chips for example that are going into these Iranian drones, are available online. I mean these are things that are being sold by resellers. That companies in the United States don't necessarily have full visibility into at all times.And just to really drive home the scale of the problem here, last month this U.K.-based investigative firm called Conflict Armament Research, which tracks these kinds of issues, examined some of the downed Iranian drones that have been found in Ukraine and found that 82 percent of the components in those drones were actually manufactured in the United States.

According to multiple reports, 42-year-old mortgage lending tycoon Mat Ishbia will sell out $4 billion to buy a majority stake in the team, almost doubling the previous record for an NBA franchise when the Brooklyn Nets sold for more than $2.3 billion in 2019. The WNBA's Phoenix Mercury will also be included in the deal. And Ishbia played basketball in college, winning a national title for Tom Izzo and Michigan State in 2000, as you remember. The current Sun's owner, Robert Sarver, put the team up for sale in September after a damning reporting into the racist and sexist behavior during his time as the owner.We also have shocking news in baseball overnight. In a stunning turn of events, the shortstop Carlos Correa now appears to be heading to the New York Mets. On Tuesday the San Francisco Giants postponed his introductory press conference. Reports were that there was a difference of opinion over his physical. Well, the Mets swooped in and are now reportedly signing him to a 12 year $315 million deal. He's agreed to this with the Giants last week, we are told. The Mets already had the highest payroll in baseball history before this. Now it is way up there.",
