A short time ago, Russia's state media showed the US basketball star leaving jail and boarding a plane. That's after Washington and the Kremlin agreed on a prisoner swap. The US released the Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout and held the exchange at Abu Dhabi's Airport. The White House says it made the difficult decision to accept Russia's offer of one or none, to secure Griner's release for the man known as the Merchant of Death. Meanwhile, American, Paul Whelan remains in Russian custody. Joe Biden vowing to keep working on his release while announcing Griner's release. Isabel Rosales reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Well, US trade regulators have sued to block Microsoft's purchase of the video game maker, Activision. In its complaint, the FTC claims that the deal would give Microsoft the \"means and motive\" to hurt competitors. It also claims the $69 billion takeover would affect game pricing and quality. Microsoft shares are slightly lower. They are off about 1.5 percent. Activision Blizzard off about 1.3 percent. Matt Egan joins me from New York. So Matt, what more can you tell us about what the FTC was saying about this proposed deal?

Now, to your point, this isn't just the largest ever video game deal. This would be one of the biggest tech acquisitions in history. It would give Microsoft control over a leading video game publisher, the maker of \"Call of Duty,\" \"World of Warcraft,\" and other video game titles, and the FTC is alleging that it would give Microsoft the mean and the motive to be anti- competitive. Let me read you a key line from the statement out from the FTC. They say that: \"Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals. Today, we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio, using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast growing gaming markets.\" Essentially, they are saying that this would hurt consumers. Now, in the last few minutes, Activision Blizzard has put out its own response. The CEO of Activision, Bobby Kotick, sending a note to employees pushing back on these allegations from Federal regulators, he says that: \"The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we'll win this challenge.\" So certainly, signaling that from their side, they expect this to play out in Court, and we'll see what happens. But Rahel, this is another example of how the Biden administration is trying to crack down on what they see as anti-competitive behavior, particularly when they think consumers could be harmed.",

And right now, given the gridlock we're seeing in Congress, with Republicans taking over the House, we can expect to see more enforcement action from the DOJ, from the FTC, SEC, and other regulators. And so I think that when they see instances, we saw recently, there was a publishing deal that was blocked by regulators from the Biden administration, when they see instances of potential anti-competitive behavior, they are not going to be shy about acting, and you wonder, Rahel, if this makes some companies who are thinking about doing deals, maybe they hold off because they don't want to see it get tied up in Court.",

It is really going to be a problem, in addition to you know, that they're not going to have the supplies that they need. I mean, the key here is that they really need to get some of those antivirals that are out there, and are they going to have enough? I mean, that could be a real problem.

In fact, scientists did an analysis of what would happen if basically, this were to happen, if you were to all of a sudden say, okay, we're basically lifting, you know, almost all of these restrictions.

But make no mistake, Tesla stock has just been eviscerated this year. Part of it due to concerns about electric vehicle sales in a slowing economy, perhaps a recession, heading into 2023. Also, the Twitter distractions. it's not just that Musk had to sell shares in order to fund the Twitter deal, it's the sideshow. Let's be brutally honest here, Elon Musk's handling of Twitter does not exactly lend much confidence to investors on Wall Street about his ability to continue running Tesla at a time where he also has SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. He is so distracted. I think it's doing a disservice to Tesla investors, not to mention his own net worth, by having Twitter as this sideshow to the rest of his more legitimate businesses like Tesla.",

I would like to think that any self-respecting person at Twitter, that is a talentedindividual, would probably scoff at the notion that they should stay at the Elon Musk Twitter hotel when they can get a job elsewhere where they are treated like an actual human being.

Or do you think this is the first signs of business is pulling back because of macro headwinds? PEREZ-ALVARADO:  That's a great question, I think businesses are being smart about the way their employees and executives travel. Of course, there is no substitute for in-person meetings when it has to do with B to C or B to B. But of course, we can be very efficient in using Zoom to connect for internal meetings. So we have not felt the frequency of travel go down; I think we are being more purposeful and there is a lot of conversation as to the evolution of travel.

We have other countries that are also catching up and doing very well; for example, Dubai. Now that the rest of the world is opening up, we are definitely seeing an uptick in hotel recovery.",

Number one, we are finally seeing the world reopen. We heard signs of China reopening starting last week. That is very encouraging. The second world's biggest economy, which has, in essence, been shut down since the pandemic. International travel is one leg of this stool that we have not seen back. And the other one, in terms of what hotel owners learned during the pandemic, they need to cater to the local guests. They need to be relevant to the community they serve, make sure they are catering not just to those paying for the hotel room but also patrons coming to use the rest of the hotel facilities, such as restaurants.",

We are seeing more and more blurring of the lines. We are seeing the combination of residential hospitality, I think they're on to something. They are offering a product that is quite distinct up to the traditional hotel industry. I'm not sure what growth looks like going forward to the extent that we go into an economic recession.
