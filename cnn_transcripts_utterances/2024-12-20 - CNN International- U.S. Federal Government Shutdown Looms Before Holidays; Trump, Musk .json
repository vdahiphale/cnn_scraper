      "sentences": "Well, we are now just a little bit over 12 hours until this government shutdown deadline. And I will tell you, Fred, that one thing that is emerging is that there is now an open line of communications between Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader, and House Speaker Mike Johnson. Jeffries told his caucus this behind closed doors just a couple of minutes ago. Democrats have been meeting for about the last hour, as they are trying to chart their path forward, trying to decide what exactly they could support from Republicans.What we are hearing from the GOP side at the moment is that they are really still all over the map in terms of where they may go next. One of the ideas that had been floated is their potential to drop this debt ceiling demand that was so crucial for Donald Trump from these negotiations. They were injected at the 11th hour. They're causing issues. Democrats say that they will not vote for a spending bill that includes a debt ceiling hike because they believe that that should be a separate negotiation. So, right now, the question is, what will Republicans put on the floor next? And will Democrats, even if it looks different than the deal that was announced on Tuesday night, will they be willing to vote on it? I do think it's a promising sign that Jeffries told his caucus that those lines of communication with the Speaker's office have now been reopened. I will tell you that yesterday, the vibes from Democrats were just really bad when it came to how they were perceiving Johnson. And this comes after Jeffries and Johnson have had a really copasetic, tight relationship over the course of the last several months. Remember, Democrats helped bail out Johnson from losing his Speaker's gavel in May, and Democrats believe that they have been able to trust Johnson, even though they haven't always agreed with him, and now they are in this position where they feel like he backed out of a negotiation that they thought that they had settled on. So, there is just a lot of mending fences that has to happen and in short order, because, like we said, this deadline coming at midnight tonight, that gives them a lot of time where they're going to have to work together in short order.",

Vance to really be his eyes and ears on the Hill and be the one in the room with Mike Johnson getting down to the nitty-gritty details and communicating the priorities that Donald Trump wants in this.Now, one thing I want to touch on that Lauren discussed is kind of the Johnson relationship of all this, because one thing that I was told was that surprising this week when Donald Trump really threw this 11th-hour wrench in their plans and blew up the deal that Johnson closely negotiated with Congressional lawmakers, is that Trump has long been very supportive of Johnson. He has backed him. He has praised him throughout his time as Speaker. But, that did change this week when he said that he was fully against this bill, that Johnson really was the key architect of. Now, what I'm told as well is that Donald Trump and Mike Johnson last weekend were at the Army-Navy football game. I am told that some of the discussion over this came up then, as well as Donald Trump having lightly floated this idea of wanting to insert the debt ceiling flight into all of this right now. But, I was also told, in my conversations with Trump's advisors and those working closely with him, that before this week, before we actually saw the text of this spending bill, Donald Trump was still weighing the pros and cons of whether he wanted a long term or a short-term bill, and what would benefit him and his incoming administration. Once that text dropped, though, that is when he really became angered by this bill and wanted to insert himself. Now, of course, you mentioned Elon Musk. He has been kind of looming over all of this as well, even before Donald Trump had weighed in, saying that he was against that original spending bill, Musk was kind of blowing things up on X, going after members who were supporting it, specifically Republicans. So, again, I think this really shows just how influential Donald Trump is. He is not in office yet. This is not the Congress that he is going to have once he is in his administration, but he is already pulling a lot of the strings on Capitol Hill. Now, to keep in mind about why Donald Trump is saying all of this and why he cares so much, one key thing that I'm hearing repeatedly as well in my conversations is that he doesn't want this spending fight to be his problem. One source who spoke with Trump about this said that he wants the decks cleared before he takes office. Essentially, that means that he wants any sort of unsavory spending fight or even a debt ceiling fight and a shutdown to be on Joe Biden's watch. He wants Biden to be the one to take the blame for this, and he also wants really all of this to be done with by the time he takes office, so that he can have Congress focus on passing his agenda.

Ukraine says at least one person has been killed, 12 others wounded after an intense Russian missile strike on the capital of Kyiv. Ukrainian officials say five ballistic missiles were shot down with falling debris causing damage and injuries. Foreign embassies also damaged in that attack. It comes a day after Russian leader Vladimir Putin challenged Ukraine to a duel in his end of year conference, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call the Russian leader, quote, \"dumb ass\". I'm joined now by CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel, Cedric Leighton. Colonel, great to see you. So, the strikes in Kyiv, I mean, it seems to be coming more frequently. How much is this rattling Ukraine's confidence about this war, now despite getting that new surge of weapons from the outgoing Biden administration? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, &amp; U.S. AIR FORCE (RET.): Yeah. Fredricka, good to be with you. There are several factors at play here, but one of them is clearly the Russian attempt to undermine Ukrainians' confidence in their own capabilities. So, clearly, the idea of the Russians is to wear down the Ukrainian population, attacking Kyiv and several other major cities is part of the Russian playbook. And it's pretty clear, from what Putin said in his conference yesterday -- at his news conference yesterday, that he intends to pursue these kinds of tactics as long as he possibly can. But, the Ukrainians do have the ability to shoot down those missiles. The problem is, what goes up must come down, and debris from the strikes of the anti-aircraft batteries is a lot of what causes some of the damage in places like Kyiv and some of the other major cities.",

The Russians clearly have advantages there. But, the Ukrainians are trying to achieve as much as they possibly canon the battlefield before any negotiations start. And one of the things that they're doing is they're trying to broaden the conflict to impact more areas of Russia, to include Moscow. They are able to do some of that.

Here are some international headlines that we're watching today.U.S. lawmakers have less than 13 hours to pass a funding bill or face a government shutdown. It comes after the Republican-led House failed to pass a funding plan backed by President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday. So, what would a shutdown mean? Well, it would delay paychecks for many federal workers, including active duty members of the military and federal law enforcement, who would keep working despite not getting paid, and national parks would likely close, and certain government services like environmental and food inspections would be put on hold. But, the U.S. postal service would continue to deliver mail, and post offices would stay open. I want to bring in now Farnoush Amiri, congressional reporter for AP.org. She is joining me now from Washington. Good to see you. So, House Speaker Johnson says he has another plan beside no debt ceiling changes. What would be in it? FARNOUSH AMIRI, U.S. CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, AP.ORG: Yeah. So, I think we've been seeing Republicans, including the Speaker of the House, go through varying situations of how this would work, right? They're trying to figure out where they can have the majority of the support, where they don't turn off Democrats who they're going to need in a slim margin of majority that they have in the House right now. And what we're looking at right now is likely a short-term government funding plan that would go until mid-March. We would look at disaster aid, because that is really a requirement for many of the Congressmen and women who represent states and districts where the several hurricanes and natural disasters have happened in the last few months. So, that is definitely something that they want, and including agriculture. So, farm subsidies and money to farmers will also be included into it. Now, how this gets done, whether this will have support, especially since it's looking like there is no debt limit increase, which is what the President-elect had wanted in it as of right now. But, we are going to see in the next hour, as they take this up through the committee that would begin this process.",

So, the fact that the two men are now talking means there is actual momentum. I think the fact that we are 12 hours away from a shutdown helps increase the pressure on both sides of the aisle.But, I think what we're going to see right now is that they're going to have to make -- Republicans are going to have to make some good faith compromises to Democrats, give them a reason to want to support them. I mean, what's happened in the last 48 hours has not boded well for the bipartisan negotiations they had initially done.

It was over spending.So, it's not hard to imagine that in a few weeks Mike Johnson could face a pickle, especially now that he has the looming powerhouse, that is President-elect Donald Trump, and his ally, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who are tweeting, who are going and calling members specifically and forcing them to put pressure on the Speaker to do things that would not get Democratic support, which is really required in a divided government which we find ourselves in. I think many people have forgotten that Democrats control the Senate, and they would need to also pass this bill and send it to the Democratic President, which is Joe Biden. So, there is a sense of Johnson really having to appease so many different factions, Democrats on the other side, and it will be really interesting to see how that bodes well for his Speaker race in January.",

And I think in a lot of ways, Vance is operating as an interlocutor for President-elect Donald Trump, and I think members are really wanting to impress the President, wanting to give him a win.As you mentioned, the loss yesterday, the failure on the House floor was devastating for President-elect Donald Trump and for his allies, because it was the first big loss for him after he put down an edict, and said, you guys should pass this. I approve of this message, and I approve of this mandate, and we'll see what happens next.

The company says it won't affect holiday deliveries, arguing that the strikers are not official Amazon employees. Members of the Teamsters union are striking at seven facilities in four states. The drivers are contractors who sell their services to Amazon. So, Amazon says it's not required to negotiate with them over pay. The striking workers want better working conditions and higher rates.Meantime, the union representing thousands Starbucks workers has also hit the picket lines. It's their first strike in 13 months. The union, Starbucks United, says strikes are taking place in three cities, Los Angeles, Chicago and Seattle, and more cities will be added through Christmas Eve, they say. The union said Starbucks has failed to meet its demand for immediate and future pay raises.
