And a handshake between -- and a hug between two dictators that we are seeing here. New images that are coming in from President Putin in North Korea. We're also expecting to get new details from the summit of these two nuclear-armed strongmen. And a behind-the-scenes look at Donald Trump and his time on \"The Apprentice.\" The author, who sat with Donald Trump, for hours after he left the White House, is here tonight. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. As we come on the air, tonight, right now, the results are still coming in from several high-stakes primary races that are playing out across America tonight. And the big test is whether revenge is resonating with Republican voters. There is one race in particular that is exposing divisions, serious ones, within the MAGA movement. That would be the race in Virginia's 5th Congressional District. And Congressman Bob Good that you see here, he's the Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. He's an ultra-conservative, who has supported Donald Trump's policies. And you might recall seeing him here, in New York, when he showed up to support Trump, during his criminal trial. But unfortunately, for the gentleman from Virginia, Trump is very, very angry at him, despite how he rode in his motorcade, when he was here in New York. And it's all because Bob Good committed the cardinal sin of initially backing Ron DeSantis, in the GOP presidential primary, earlier this year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bob Good, who is actually bad for Virginia and who will stab you in the back like he did me.

This race pits Good up against the Trump-backed state senator in Virginia, John McGuire. Those polls closed at 7 PM Eastern. And here's where the results stand right now. 66 percent of the vote is in. So, we still have more to come. But look how close this race is. You can see John McGuire, right now, has 50.6 percent of the vote. Bob Good is at 49.4 percent. Look how close those margins are. It is incredibly close. As we were watching all of this tonight, this test of Donald Trump, who has endorsed the name you see there at the top, John McGuire, against Bob Good, the Chairman of the very influential House Freedom Caucus.

Adam Kinzinger, let me start with you, though. Because in this race, in Virginia, Bob Good and John McGuire are both pitching themselves as the one who's in lockstep with Donald Trump.

Seven years later, Mays had one of his best seasons, clubbing 52 homeruns, winning his second MVP award. During the 1972 season, the 41-year-old was dealt back to New York, to play for the Mets. And what became the last at-bat of his career, Mays hit a game-winning single in the 12th inning of game two of the 1973 World Series, putting an exclamation point on a one-of-a-kind career. But perhaps even greater than his performance, on the field, was the legacy he left off it.

And a major parade could begin at any moment, in North Korea, to honor that historic visit. We are tracking it all closely, here tonight, with Sue Mi Terry, a former CIA analyst on North Korea. And just right off the bat. I was there when Donald Trump met with Kim Jong Un, both times. So, I was watching the North Korean leader, because we don't always see him out in public often. What did you make of that initial appearance from him? [21:25:00] SUE MI TERRY, FORMER CIA NORTH KOREA ANALYST: My first reaction, looking at Kim Jong Un, was oof, he doesn't look too great to me. There was a time, when he lost a little weight, and he looked better. So, my initial reaction was that he didn't look in terms of being healthy, because, his health is something that we always track anyway, because it's always a wildcard for North Korea. So, I don't know. But he didn't look that great to me.",

As a border resident, as a representative from the border, no one has felt the impact of our broken immigration system more than my constituents, and those of us who live on the U.S.-Mexico border.

      "sentences": "Tonight, Justin Timberlake has been arrested, booked, and we now have seen his mug shot. The pop star was charged with driving while intoxicated in the Hamptons.And this morning, we saw pictures of him, leaving the courthouse there, as police say that Timberlake failed to stop at a stop sign, and stay in his lane. The police report, tonight, describes his eyes as, quote, \"Bloodshot\" and \"Glassy\" with a \"Strong odor of an alcoholic beverage\" on his breath. Timberlake reportedly told the police that he had one martini, and followed his friends home. He also rejected a sobriety test, three times, saying, quote, \"No, I'm not doing a chemical test.\" We do know now, tonight, we are learning he's expected to have his next court appearance, virtually, on July 26th. My source on this, tonight, Van Lathan, the media buff and co-host of the podcast, \"Higher Learning.\" And it's great to have you. I should note. This is the first time Justin Timberlake has ever been arrested. I just wonder what you made of this news today. VAN LATHAN, CO-HOST, \"HIGHER LEARNING\" PODCAST: Oh, no, for some reason, it was predictable. I mean, Justin hadn't had any real scandals in his career, like big scandals. But he's always had just this air of impropriety, in so many different situations. Go back to the Janet Jackson thing, to where a lot of people think he weaseled out of that, and left her holding the bag. You got that extramarital stuff that went on in New Orleans. And just some other things. It seemed as if he was almost due for something really significant to go wrong. Things just haven't been going his way lately.",

Because I mean, I think, typically, lately at least, he hasn't really been in the headlines, except the fact that he's on his first tour in five years.And I wonder what you make of the timing of this happening right now. And whether, you know, how they're viewing something like this happening, while he's on his first tour in five years?",

Happened for someone who has a type of image that he has? Father, husband, pop star. Probably not great.But at the same time, the thing about Justin Timberlake and where he is right now is that the story gas just kind of gotten boring with him. People are a little bit over him. There might be a new spin on his life, if people think that he's actually in trouble and they need him, they might go back to the Justin Timberlake that they used to remember, and think maybe it's time to cut the guy a break. COLLINS: Can we talk about like what the celebrity kind of playbook is, for a moment, like this, where they are caught in something, where he is? I mean, obviously, he's been charged with this. We'll see what he says publicly about it. He hasn't actually weighed in on it so far. But kind of what the celebrity playbook is when an arrest like this does happen.",

      "sentences": "Kaitlan, you can tell by the mug shot, the way they're going to play it. When the mug shot comes out, sometimes, celebrities take that opportunity to make a little PR moment out of it. They smile. They give a sexy look. They do whatever. They try to show it's not bothering them, whatever.His mug shot was interesting. He looked like himself. But then again, not. He looked noticeably older, which I hadn't really realized that he'd gotten 43-years-old. And then he looked as if there was something missing from him. So, I think with Justin, the playbook for him is going to be, to take a step back, to take accountability for it, to talk about what it means to be a husband, to be a father, and really tap back into the people that have been supporting them for like the last 20 years. I think he's going to play it really close to the vest, and use it as an opportunity, to say he needs to get sober and reassess some things.",
