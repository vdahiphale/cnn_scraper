We can't let it get out of the headlines.This race is going to be neck and neck, which I can't believe I'm saying, but I still do expect, I mean, Governor Kemp and the gubernatorial race is outperforming Stacey Abrams. And Stacey Abrams has run more on abortion in these issues. Warnock has been prudent in really focusing on the economy, on Democrats accomplishments as he would and he was frame -- would frame them like the Inflation Reduction Act.

You know, I'm really trying to find a piece to put it. But she is raising money and she is widening the fundraising gap, which is important in the final weeks because she can spend that money on television. She can spend that money to turn out voters.
