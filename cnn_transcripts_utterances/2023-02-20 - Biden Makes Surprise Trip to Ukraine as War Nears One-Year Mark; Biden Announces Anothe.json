      "sentences": "Top of the hour. I'm Jim Sciutto.This Monday morning, an unprecedented visit to a war zone, President Biden made a surprise trip to Kyiv in a significant show support for Ukraine entering an active war zone without a large U.S. military presence. Without that military presence, it's, of course, different from other presidential visits to Afghanistan, Iraq, for instance. Air raid sirens you hear there sounding as Biden is walking side by side with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. It is the first trip to the country since the Russian invaded. We're coming on the one year anniversary in just a few days. CNN has learned that Biden the final decision just on Friday to make this visit to Kyiv. Ukrainian president had invited him prior. Officials say the U.S. informed Russia about the visits hours ahead of his arrival there, that intended to de-conflict, to make sure that Russia would not fire on Kyiv as the U.S. president was there. During a news conference earlier this morning, President Biden announced a new round of sanctions against Russia, as well as another $500 million in military assistance to Ukraine, including weapons. The Ukrainian president says Biden's trip leaves, Ukraine, quote, closer to victory. He called it the most important visit in the history of U.S.-Ukraine relations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Freedom is priceless. It is worth fighting for, for as long as it takes, and that is how long we are going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is quite a decision by the U.S. president to visit the war zone. Tell us how it came about.",

      "sentences": "Yes, they did alert the Russians that the president was going to be in Ukraine. That is because, of course, there are many Russian forces on the ground, they did not want there to be any safety issues there with President Biden's trip. But, overall, it was a risk for President Biden to go to Ukraine. It's reason he has not gone so far in the nearly almost a year that this invasion has been under way.But what his national security adviser told reporters that, essentially, the message that they were able to send with this visit was worth the risk that President Biden took to go there, because they wanted to show U.S. solidarity with Ukraine, not a celebration, they said, of U.S. support of Ukraine but an affirmation of it, and that that U.S. support is still there, and as President Biden said, as long as it takes. Of course, that's a big question of how long they do believe it's going to take, what that could look like in the meanwhile, and big questions still remain about what else the U.S. may send to Ukraine to help them to fight this war, as they have been doing so far. But in the visit, in and of itself, President Biden went. He was strolling through the sunshine with President Zelenskyy, as you were hearing those air raid sirens going off in the background. But a notable moment to see President Biden there as he was announcing that half a billion dollars in aid that the U.S. is sending to Ukraine, that is half a billion that includes other types of weaponry that the U.S. has sent in the past. It did not include anything new from o what we have seen and heard from the reports of what President Biden said while he was there on the ground, none of those F-16 fighter jets, like the longer range missiles that Ukraine has been seeking, saying that they need them to help them fight this battle. But, really, it was the trip in and of itself that the White House says is notable. The fact that they did weigh the security risk, they have been planning it for months, and President Biden made the final call last Friday as he was huddled with aides in the Oval Office to actually make that trip and then, of course, later boarded Air Force One at about 4:00 in the morning in Washington on Sunday before heading to Kyiv and then eventually heading here to Warsaw. It is a ten-hour train drive from the border with Poland. Jim, as you well know, and Clarissa well knows, it's a very long drive, a very long drive and trip for the president to make. But it is one that they felt was worth making this close to the anniversary.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. We have been seeing Ukrainians coming out all afternoon as soon as they'd heard that President Biden had been here. They were pouring into the square behind me, St. Michael's Square and St. Michael's Church, that you can see, actually, it's probably on that of, sorry, for you, to take photographs, to look at the wreath that was laid with the American flag on it.For them, for ordinary people here and, frankly, the leadership as well, this was a big deal. This was something that they had hoped for, for a long time. We know that President Zelenskyy had invited President Biden a number of times to come and visit. And he said himself today, as the two presidents were meeting, he said, with this conversation, Ukraine is one step closer to victory. And I think that really speaks to the effect or at least the anticipated effect that this visit will have had on morale. It has been a tough winter here, Jim. The fighting in the east is grim, some of the highest rates of the Ukrainian casualties, much higher on the Russian side, but still very high Ukrainian casualty rates as well. People have been living often in the cold without power, without running water, because of Russia's ruthless campaign, targeting the infrastructure. And so to see the president of the United States come on this unannounced trip at this very tense moment and make this hugely symbolic tour of St. Michael's I think really spoke to people, it gave them a morale boost, and it made them feel that Ukraine can win this war with one major caveat, of course, which President Zelenskyy also mentioned himself, which was the discussion of heavier weaponry, long range artillery, fighter jets. In the short-term, the focus right now is on getting Ukraine more ammunition, which President Biden did say will be forthcoming. That has been a huge issue for the Ukrainians. It's actually, according CNN's reporting as well, an issue for NATO and the U.S. in terms of the volume of ammunition that they require and the ability to produce it at that kind of that pace. So, definitely, a significant moment here, and definitely a day that I think people will be talking about for quite some time. Extremely heavy security. We were up here as it was happening. We were visited multiple times by soldiers who told us we could not be near this balcony, we could not be near this window, we could not have our camera pointing out in this direction. At one stage, they were using lasers to point in the faces of some other journalists who had tried to peak out of their windows as well to see what was going on. We ended pretty much crouching on the floor in the distance to get a decent view, because it is a wide open space. And you imagine for the security services just how difficult it was even with that foray at de-confliction, speaking to the Russians, to make sure that President Biden would be able to get in and out fairly quickly and also without any incident. SCIUTTO:  They would not want to be taking any chances on what was already quite a chance to take to visit a capital in a war. Kaitlan Collins in Poland, Clarissa Ward there in Kyiv, thanks so much to both of you. Here now to discuss, CNN Presidential Historian Doug Brinkley, retired Army Brigadier General Peter Zwack, and CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Jonathan Wackrow, he used to be in the Secret Service himself. Thanks to all of you. Doug Brinkley, I want to speak to you as our resident historian here. Place this in the context and the pantheon of presidential visits to war zones. Presidents have visited Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years, but those were U.S. wars. This is a Ukrainian war, no U.S. military presence on the ground. How significant?",

I go back to history and think about Roosevelt and Churchill when FDR had to sneak off in the dead of night, even had a body double at one point, to first meet Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland. And then, of course, you had all those World War 22 the meetings between Churchill.It's worth mentioning Churchill because Zelenskyy has been called the Churchill of our generation. And Biden going there today, I think it is going to be a moment for the history books. It is like when John F. Kennedy went to Berlin in 1961 and gave a speech at the height of the cold war. Ukraine is the new Berlin. It's the rally point for NATO and the western allies and I think Biden did something really heroic.",

This is a very difficult point in the war between Russia and Ukraine. The losses on that eastern front are just horrific for both sides, frankly. What does it mean, in your view, for Ukrainian soldiers fighting this war right now to see the U.S. president come visit? BRIG. GEN. PETER ZWACK (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  It is enormous. If I could just quickly add on to my colleague's statement about Churchill and that era, President Biden's visit harkens back to Edward R. Murrow's statement, this is London during the blitz, the air-raid sirens going on in the background and it is surreal to see the president there with similar circumstances in a beleaguered wartime capital. The war, itself, it is going to be -- continue to be -- it's grinding out. While the Russians have mass, they don't have quality. But as the old line, quantity has a certain quality of its own. The Ukrainians are putting up a great fight. The Russians, I believe, Jim, there is brittleness in this mass and within the population, as resolved as they are. And this visit just adds to the determination and the will for the Ukrainians to fight that matters and adds in immense ways to the fight on the front, which is hard.",

For a while, there was a thought that maybe Turkey would come in and then be able to do something. So, we are in for a long haul.

And these are advanced Leopard German-made. And the focus immediately goes to the next category of weapons, the new one, F-16s. I mean, is that phenomenon overdone?
