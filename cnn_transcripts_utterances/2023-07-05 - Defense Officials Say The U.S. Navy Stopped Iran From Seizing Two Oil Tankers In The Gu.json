      "sentences": "It is. And that's what makes this more of a -- more of a warning and more concerning to the Defense Department as it watches what happened here. And this plays out in two separate incidents within a very short time span in the Gulf of Oman. As you point out, a critical waterway in the Middle East.One with the Strait of Hormuz lets out into as you're heading into the Arabian Sea where a large portion of the world's oil goes through. So, that gives you an idea of the significance of this waterway. At about 1:00 a.m. local time in the Gulf of Oman, the U.S. Navy says an Iranian navy ship approached a commercial oil tanker. And according to the U.S. Navy, approached in a way that led the Navy to believe it was attempting to seize this oil tanker, an action that Iran has done in the past. And that is perhaps why the U.S. Navy intervened here. A U.S. Navy-guided missile destroyer approached these two ships. And it was during that time as the U.S. Navy destroyer approached that the Iranian vessel changed course and headed away from the incident. But that wasn't the end of this. Only three hours later, according to the Navy, this plays out. The video you're seeing now. That is another Iranian Navy vessel approaching a separate oil tanker once again in international waters off the Gulf of Oman. This time, the Iranian Navy vessel draws closer, and according to the Navy opens fire with small arms fire hitting the tanker there in several points. Nobody was injured on the tanker according to the U.S. Navy, but those bullets struck close to the living quarters on board that tanker. Another one of the reasons the U.S. was very concerned about this. The same destroyer, the USS McFaul responded to this one as well. This time, there was a distress call coming from that oil tanker. And that's why the USS McFaul headed towards the scene as quickly as it could at full speed.",

And the U.S. Navy specifically has boosted its presence in the region for this very reason. Having seen in the past multiple attempts by Iran to either harass or seize commercial shipping vessels. According to the U.S. Navy, since 2021, Iranian Navy vessels and the IRGC have tried this about 20 times to either cease, harass, or in other way interact -- interfere with commercial shipping vessels.

Now previously, the head of Ukrainian intelligence had said that some of the cooling ponds to the reactors had been mined, and also that explosive-laden trucks had been deployed outside four of the plant's six reactors.Now, the Russians have said it's not true. That in fact, it's the Ukrainians who are planning some sort of skullduggery. But now, the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which said they have no -- have seen no proof of anything at the plant have said that they have requested additional access to those areas that the Ukrainians have mentioned as possibly the site of mines or explosives. So, the situation very unclear. Each side is exchanging accusations. The Ukrainians have for a long time warned of an impending disaster at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But certainly, the number of claims that something is about to happen there. That the Russians are planning something are really coming fast and furious. Now, the Ukrainians are conducting drills.

I spent a lot of time there. It would be really difficult sort of house-to-house, street-to-street fighting. They're trying to encircle the city to encourage perhaps the Russians to leave and avoid the same sort of bloody street battles that Bakhmut saw for the 10 months when the Russians tried and eventually succeeded in May to take over that city, Boris.",

And what we know now is that a law enforcement source is confirming to CNN that police investigators are holding in and looking at the suspect's Facebook account and social media history to try and see if there are any clues about a potential motive in there.So, as we've just been doing some reporting, we've been looking through this social media. There are a lot of posts, I can tell you about guns, God, freedom, safety, and the Second Amendment as well. We'll pull up a few of them if that's all right. The first one that I want to show you is from the actual morning of the shooting back on July 3. It appears to be a picture of a man in tactical gear holding a rifle. But then, there were other more political messages that were also shared as well. There was one from June, which is of an image of President Biden talking about the Queen of England at this particular moment. And the language here says this is your president. We said the Second Amendment defends our rights. Now, it's God Save the Queen while he attempts to take our arms. And then another thing and just -- it illustrates the variety of posts that we've been seeing in these social media accounts as there was criticism about the community patrols and more elder statesmen in the presumably local southwest Philadelphia community that Mr. Carriker lives. So, again, we know now that police are investigating and combing through a lot of these social media accounts, and a lot of these posts to see if there's any clue about the motive. But you know, Brianna, you began this segment by announcing that -- or rather emphasizing that the District Attorney, Larry Krasner, said as far as they know right now, this was essentially a random attack and someone who just woke up and said, I want to start killing people. That was you know, in his -- in his words. And killing and shooting at innocent people just on the street. There was a woman with two twins in the backseat of her car. And police allege that this gunman opened fire at this car shooting one of the young twin boys who were in the backseat. The others getting injuries from glass fragments. Earlier today, the suspect was in court. It was a short preliminary arraignment. But they read the charges that included murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, and other firearms- related charges. At this point, Mr. Carriker's federal prosecutor -- or rather, excuse me, federal defense attorney -- rather I'll say appointed defense attorney right in this local level, they're not commenting on this case at this point. They're not commenting one way or another. But his next court appearance is scheduled right now for July 24. And we'll bring you more updates as we have it, Brianna.",

And it was found right at the ground floor entrance to the West Wing. Now, one important piece of context on this is that this is typically where tour groups which can come in sometimes during the weekend would pass through in order to get a tour of the West Wing. And also near where there are cubbies where people are asked to leave their cell phones. So, that is an important piece of information. Of course, staffers as well with proper badges can also pass through this area. We don't know yet who brought this baggie of cocaine apparently, into the White House. A Secret Service investigation is still ongoing. But what we do know, Brianna, is that the president, he was nowhere near this. He was at Camp David over the weekend and only returned to the White House yesterday. So, we'll be pressing the White House press secretary during the briefing in just a few minutes time for more details on this.

They impeach Donald Trump when he tried to extort the government of Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Biden. And later when he tried to instigate insurrection. They didn't impeach him because they didn't like his policies, which, you know, largely -- this is largely based on the idea that Biden is failing at the southern border. You can believe that. You can message that. Do you -- do you impeach a president over that? And then, of course, this claim that they have -- the administration has impeded the investigation into Hunter Biden. They're a long way from having evidence to justify any action on that. So, I think this is just more to me, of what we have -- I -- we have really seen over the last 25 years, which is that in each party, but especially in the Republican Party, there's enormous pressure. Any tool that can be used against the other side has to be used against the other side. And we've seen all sorts of barriers broken, whether it was you know, Mitch McConnell holding open a Supreme Court seat for an entire year.

This may be a bridge too far for them.But I would not rule out that if the Republicans in more swing districts force the party to climb down from the idea of impeaching Biden on spurious grounds, they may feel pressure within the party to support the impeachment of someone else, which has obviously been enormously rare as well. And again, goes back to the question, is impeachment a tool for a policy disagreement? Is that the era of American politics that we are -- that we are moving into? It may be.
