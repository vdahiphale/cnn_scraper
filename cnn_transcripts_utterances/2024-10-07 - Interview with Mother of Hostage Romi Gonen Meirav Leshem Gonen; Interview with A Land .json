I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. One year ago, today at 6:29 a.m., Hamas invaded Israel and committed the most heinous of crimes, murdering more than a thousand people, mostly civilians, taking 250 hostages, scores of whom are still captive today. Across the country today, ceremonies began at that precise time to remember what has happened to them all and to their nation. There were also protests, even on this day, at the government's failure to uphold a unique contract with its people, to never leave anyone behind, to bring home every last hostage, no matter the cost. Some hostage families held their own event that criticized Prime Minister Netanyahu, while the government created its own pre-recorded tribute. The past year since Hamas invaded has been a catastrophic trauma for Israel and for Jews all over the world. The ensuing war has been a catastrophe for Palestinians and the wider regional war that was so feared back then is now underway with no end in sight. Tonight, we will hear again from four women who all spoke to us about a year ago, who each has suffered grievously, who nonetheless holds hope in their hearts. But first, we go back to October 7th, and we listen again to Sahar Ben- Sela. He described for us that terrible day. He's a young man who went to the Nova Music Festival to have fun, never imagining what would happen instead. He joined us back then from lifesaving treatment in hospital. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAHAR BEN-SELA, SURVIVOR OF MUSIC FESTIVAL MASSACRE:  And one of the producers of the festival just jump on the fence and scream that the terrorists are coming in legs and legs. Just they come in on land and not there for missile. And then, the panic began. It was a big panic. Everybody was jumping on the fence. Everybody ran to their cars. A lot of fire out there. Just even in the biggest, worst thing that we've seen in movies, I can't explain how much -- how many bullets and missiles were flying around us. I could never forget the face of it. It was smiling at us. It looks like the devil. It just looked at us, point the gun, the Carlo machine gun in front of the girl's face and just tried to spread everything around, all the people. I was in the second row. All the people in the first row and the second row shot dead. I just opened my eyes and opened my mouth and start to go down the wall because I got -- I understood that I got hit but didn't understand where yet because it was blood all over and screaming. I saw the kids that -- their bodies full of bullets. A girl that -- all her body parts on the floor and she was crawling to her boyfriend and dead boyfriend and start to kiss him until she got -- she died by herself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At a certain point, you have to say, that's enough, now we're stopping it. I'm not pro-war, I'm pro-peace. But this is not what the Hezbollah seeks. This is not what the Hamas seeks. They are seeking to eliminate us, the Israeli people. They are seeking to eliminate the free world, and we should not let them have that. I assume that all of this will be finished in an agreement, but an agreement which we, the strong world, will also have a say in that.

That's an organization working with former Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters, now searching for nonviolent solutions. I first spoke to them back in December. And since then, they've worked together in bridging the device. They join me and they join the program again today to reflect on this painful past year. May and Rana, welcome back to the program.

RANA SALMAN, CO-DIRECTOR, COMBATANTS FOR PEACE:  Yes. Thank you, Christiane, for having us. We actually woke up today with the same sense of feeling that something terrible might happen, which is like what we feel every day, because unexpected events are happening daily, violent images, the devastation, more violence, more destruction, more loss of life. Today, we are actually united in grief, but we are also united in hope, and we use this time not only for reflection, but for action.

And it's because -- we're on the verge of a regional war. And so, I think that it's so important to also be clear that we are not ending anything. We are really in the midst of the tragedy itself. The situation in Israel is also looking extremely dark. So, I want to start with that. I'll just say about how wonderful it's been to be working and talking to Rana. We've been talking a lot about how, you know, October 7th has been also an opportunity and a mark for the peace camp to -- in Israel and Palestine to awaken, but it not -- it hasn't only awakened, it has also chose a new direction. And that new direction is truly based on moving away from the paradigm of segregation and zero-sum game into the understanding of interdependency and future interest, shared interest, shared future and partnership. And Rana and I, I think, are one example and our relationship is one example, and our works, of our organizations, is a good example of this new direction that peace and hope and vision needs to go forward towards.

So, I know it's possible. And for the Palestinian government, I know the performance hasn't been as expected and -- or as the level that it should be. But I also agree that we need a new leadership.

No, Israel and Palestine are broken, the societies are broken and I feel really that the -- there's such despair and it's growing every, every, every day. And the only way to fight that despair is to create alternatives. And I'll turn it a vision political imagination, and that has to be based on equality, that has to be based on values, but it has to be based on pragmatism. We don't do it because we love peace and love, we do it because we're fighting for our future here, for ourselves, each of us, and we understand that the only way to achieve that is together. And so, these statistics, I have to say, that everyone is in such trauma that I wouldn't count on these numbers to say anything. You know, 30 days before the Berlin Wall fell, no one believed it will ever fall. And so, I really think that we should take these numbers and think about them carefully. And the other thing that we need to do is really create an alternative narrative. One that doesn't lead everyone to more despair and more violence and feeling that there's a zero-sum game that we have to win. In a way, both Rana and I, I want to say, are offering that alternative. And one of that -- those factors is that there is one homeland. You know, in Israel, Palestine, between the river and the sea, there are 7 million Palestinians and 7 million Israeli Jews, we're stuck together and no one's going anywhere. And now, it feels that we either -- and have a bloody future or we choose to live together and find a way to do that that is respectful and separate but also understanding that that's the only way out.

And I think that when I took this decision, it was the only choice that I had in order to save the lives of my children. I was forced to leave because I was left with no other choice to protect their lives. I was threatened more than once, I was displaced over six times, and life was getting incredibly more and more challenging every single day. It's not about the field, it's not about my work as a journalist only, but it was -- my most concern, my greatest fears were always that my children at home are not safe and I could lose them in any airstrike. Life after coming out of Gaza hasn't been easy at all. I have been struggling with a survival guilt that was eating me since I left at the end of December. And it has impacted me a lot physically and emotionally, mentally. And I found that the only way that I can actually overcome that survival guilt that was completely taking control of me and my life was that I go around the world and speak about Gaza, because I felt that the world wasn't listening enough to what we had to say and show them from inside Gaza. And I thought that this is how I can still contribute to Gaza without feeling that I have abandoned it and left.",

But in real-life, it has never presented one solid evidence for any of these accusations. In 2021, the Israeli army leveled Al Jazeera Bureau saying also other allegations that the building was used for Hamas activities and so on without one solid proof or evidence presented. We are used to these allegations and accusations by the Israeli army. The only problem with the Israeli army really is that Al Jazeera is completely is presenting the full spectrum of the story. When Al Jazeera is reporting about what is happening in the Israeli side, when its reporters are reporting about families of Israeli captives in Israel, or about the Palestinian attacks in Israeli towns, or the aftermath of these attacks, or how it's impacting the Israeli civilians, then there is no problem with Al Jazeera and what it's doing. It's doing a good job. But when it's showing the same facts and reality that are happening to the Palestinian population, whether in the Gaza Strip or in the West Bank, the confiscation of lands, the terror of the Israeli settlers, the ongoing violations and aggressions against the Palestinian residents, then it's inciting terror.",
