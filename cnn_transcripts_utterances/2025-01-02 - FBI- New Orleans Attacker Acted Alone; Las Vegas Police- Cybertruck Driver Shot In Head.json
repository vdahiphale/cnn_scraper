I'm Phil Mattingly, in for Jake Tapper.We begin with brand new video exclusively obtained by CNN showing the New Orleans terrorist attack suspect outside his Airbnb rental -- rental hours before officials say he drove a rented white pickup through a crowd on Bourbon Street, killing 14 people and injuring at least 35 more. This Ring camera footage captured the moment the suspect, Shamsud-Din Jabbar unloaded the truck around 10 p.m. local time Tuesday night. We have even more footage from this doorbell cam, which will show you this hour. But today, amid all of the grief and shock, we also want to show you this -- displays of resilience in true New Orleans style. A brass band marching down Bourbon Street to mark its official reopening just a few hours ago. And happening right now, less than a mile away from the attack site, a moment of silence and then kickoff for the Sugar Bowl matchup between the University of Georgia and Notre Dame, a game postponed yesterday because of the attack. Now, officials are insisting the Superdome and the rest of the city are now safe, though many residents and visitors remain shaken. We'll have more this hour on what we're learning about the 14 people who did not survive the attack, among them Drew Dauphin, a 2023 graduate of Auburn University. We are also learning new details about the suspect, his motivation and ties to ISIS, and how he carried out the attack. One major change from yesterday, while police initially believed he may have had accomplices. Now they say he acted alone. The FBI explains some of the confusion stemming from those IEDs that were found in coolers around the French Quarter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, you know, I think the key thing here that that Evan just said was, this is a man who wanted to massacre his family, then changed his mind and pledged allegiance to ISIS in a video posted to Facebook. I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest this guy does not have the greatest amount of emotional and psychological well-being to begin with, right? So the question is, was he genuinely converted to ISIS? Would he genuinely believe in their genocidal and obscurantist doctrine? Or was this a guy who just went nuts and was looking for an outlet and decided, let's align with an apocalyptic death cult that the United States is at war with? That's the question I have, and I'm sure the FBI is all over it and will know more as the reporting comes out. But the other point I would make, though, and this is very worrisome to me. This guy was in the military, right? The seemingly unrelated attack in with the Cybertruck also a tier one Special Forces operator. In October, another U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison for offering material support to ISIS to target and ambush U.S. forces in the Middle East. I don't know what's going on with members of our Armed Services, but there seems to be a real problem here of radicalization and recruitment, or lurching into all kinds of other extremist ideologies. I mean, I know a lot of people are talking about this, the southern border and the threat posed by migrants, these are American citizens who serve their country, some of them quite patriotically, according to their family members, and then suddenly, all of a sudden, or not so all of a sudden, they turn and they turn rather horrifically, as we've just seen in New Orleans.",

Earlier today, we were reporting that some of Johnson's allies were preparing for a scenario where perhaps they could go multiple rounds just to remind everyone. It was just two years ago that Kevin McCarthy went 15 rounds, took five days to clinch that speakers gavel.So there's just a lot of questions about what happens tomorrow, because some of these undecided members that he met with, they were pretty jolly as they came out of this meeting in terms of congressional readouts go. But they also were not yet committed to Johnson. I talked to Tim Burchett earlier today, and he was getting on a plane to come to D.C. He said he's going to pray about it tonight. He's going to think about it overnight and then he's going to decide tomorrow. Although he did say that Johnson gets a lot of credit because he's been having these one on one conversations with members. He's been reaching out. He said that's more attention than he's gotten in the past.",

And it took a lot of attention off of Donald Trump and what Donald Trump was doing. It also made the Republican Party, especially in the House, look completely chaotic.Those are two things that Donald Trump does not want to have to deal with as he's going into his inauguration. It is January 3rd. He is set to be inaugurated on the 20th. He is coming to Washington, I believe, on the 18th, to start that process. They don't want to be looking down the throat of a chaotic Republican Party. They don't want to be looking down a situation in which Donald Trump is not the center of attention. He wants this to be done. Now, when it comes to Johnson himself, we know they have had a number of conversations. Donald Trump privately has told people they just he just believes that Johnson is the guy who can get the votes. Maybe right now, he doesn't have all of the votes, but of the entire landscape in the House. The more people Donald Trump talks to, he believes Johnson can get the votes. On top of that, he believes Johnson is an ally. Johnson has proven that he has shown up at Mar-a-Lago. He's been by his side. He flew down on election night to say, I am one of a small group of people. Johnson has basically jumped through every single hoop that he has needed to jump through to appease Donald Trump and show him that he is loyal. Donald Trump wants somebody like that, the speaker of the House.",

It's very difficult because Johnson is going to have a narrow majority with each of these pieces of legislation.You also are hearing from conservatives that they want more buy in from individual members on legislation overall, this means the tax package. This means immigration package. They want to be negotiating these packages in real time. They don't want staff negotiating them, leadership negotiating them, then turning around very quickly and asking for their votes. Those are some of the structural changes. I think what's so difficult about making those promises now, it might get you votes, but it also can lead to disappointment later because you're going to have such a narrow majority if you're Mike Johnson.

So what they believe now is okay if we want to get this stuff done in the house, the first thing that has to happen, and we have to have a speaker of the House that everybody agrees on. So a lot of this is not just Donald Trump trying to strong-arm people because he believes he wants to get his way, but a lot of it is that he actually understands how Washington works now. And they're trying to get this done, hence why he believes that if Johnson can get the actually get the votes and no one else can, he's going to back Johnson.",

I want to bring in New Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas. Councilman, really appreciate your time. We have all been thinking and praying for your community. As we watch the activity return to the streets that the entire country knows so well. What have you heard from your constituents as they learn more about this attack, as they continue to grieve? OLIVER THOMAS, NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCILMAN:  Well, one of the things that we've been concerned about is a lot of misinformation, a unified message coming from law enforcement and our officials and trying to have some clarity about what were the issues, what this a lone wolf? Did this person have accomplices? Should we be concerned about a secondary explosives, or other locations? And hopefully, today's press conference, cleared that up with the young man from the FBI, our governor, our mayor and other officials. But just a combined message where we could at least count on the fact that the government was being transparent, law enforcement was being transparent, and we would know whether we were clear at least of this particular danger that we were in.",

So it's good to at least now that we have some confirmed, answers, some confirmation.
