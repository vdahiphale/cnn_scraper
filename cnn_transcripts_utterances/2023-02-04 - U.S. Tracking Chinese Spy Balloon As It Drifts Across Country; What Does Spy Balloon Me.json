      "sentences": "Is it time to pop that balloon? I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. That suspected Chinese surveillance balloon spotted in the skies of the continental U.S. has sparked concerns about national security and diplomacy regarding Beijing. Is it more about symbolism than substance?Secretary of State Anthony Blinken was due to travel to China this week and he postponed his trip calling the balloons infiltration of U.S. airspace a, quote, irresponsible act that created conditions that undermined the purpose of the trip. The public first learned of the balloons existence Thursday while it was over Montana, which is home to U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile silos and strategic bomber bases. China is saying that it's all innocent. On Friday, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said this, \"It's a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological purposes. Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course. The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into airspace due to force majeure.\" But the U.S. State Department called it a, quote, clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law. The Pentagon said on Friday the balloon currently does not pose a military or political threat. And a senior U.S. defense official told CNN that military officials had advised President Biden not to shoot the balloon down due to fear over the debris posing a safety threat. I tweeted out a quick take last night. I said the violation of our sovereign airspace should not be a partisan issue. Many are questioning why we aren't taking it out and they especially are coming from the right. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a member of Congress's so-called Gang of Eight who are briefed on national intelligence matters, he tweeted this. \"It was a mistake to not shoot down that Chinese spy balloon when it was over a sparsely populated area. This is not some hot air balloon. It has a large payload of sensors roughly the size of two city buses and the ability to maneuver independently.\" Utah Senator Mitt Romney wrote, \"A big Chinese balloon in the sky and millions of Chinese TikTok balloons on our phones. Let's shut them all down.\" Over on Truth Social, former President Trump much more succinct, \"Shoot down the balloon,\" he said. Today's New York Post cover agrees saying, pop this balloon, calling the spy craft impudent. When I posted the question yesterday on smerconish.com, should we shoot the balloon down? Well, here's the result with 21,637 votes cast, 64 percent said yes, we should. Democratic Senator Jon Tester of Montana where it was first spotted chairs the Senate Subcommittee that controls the Pentagon budget last night he told Anderson Cooper he plans to hold a hearing to investigate how the balloon was able to violate U.S. airspace and what went into the thinking about how it's been dealt with. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JON TESTER (D-MT): I think anytime you have China country that wants to replace us as the economic leader and the military leader in the world, doing this kind of garbage, it requires some explanations. And to make sure that if this happens again, we are very confident that there will be no good things that come out of it for China. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the short answer is no, you don't know with any degree of accuracy, because it depends upon just how large the hole or the damage done to the balloon, which will determine how fast it will come down. And then once you hit, I mean, you hit the balloon, and you can penetrate it, and it can come down at a certain rate.If it's all in one piece, probably no big deal, it's going to land in one place. But if you hit the payload package, and destroy that, now you have the debris that's going to be scattered. But the fact of the matter is, the doggone thing should have been shut down before it penetrated the territory of our sovereign airspace. Your introductory conclusion was a pretty good one. Because what's really more concern than the sensor package that this Chinese balloon is carrying, is why did we let a potential adversary air vehicle penetrate the sovereign territory of Canada, the United States. It should have been neutralized, as it entered our air defense identification zone.",

They were over Maelstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where we have intercontinental ballistic missiles. They went very near Whiteman Air Force Base, where we have our D2s (ph), which are strategic bombers. And this track could take it very close to Kings Bay, Georgia, where we have our boomers, ballistic missile submarines, that's all three legs of the triad. And so really risk is in your face up duration (ph) by the Chinese. Ad it really smacks of the very provocative and belligerent attitudes of the Chinese military right now.

You know, Jessica Chen Weiss, she believes that the United States should continue to engage China. That's a theory that has failed over five decades and created this dangerous situation. I think that we would have much better relations if we didn't talk to China, because that would scare them into actually trying to deal with us on a good faith basis.

Kennedy and future Washington Post Editor Ben Bradley. The study later incorporated a parallel one that was tracking 456 less privileged inner city Boston boys.

Every two years, the participants answer lengthy questionnaires. Every five years, they surrender their medical records. Every 15 years they are interviewed face to face. So what's the life lesson? Good relationships, keep us happier, healthier, and help us live longer.

The disbarred South Carolina lawyer claims he wasn't at his family home when his wife and 22-year-old son were murdered on June 7, 2021 and didn't come to the scene until an hour later.But this week a combination of cellphone records and a video found on his son's phone seem to put him at the scene in close proximity to when the murders were committed. Also, a video was introduced taken the day of the murders showing Murdaugh wearing different clothing than he was wearing when he was interviewed by the cops after he called 911. But the prosecution also hopes to bring in other evidence pertaining to what they contend is Murdaugh's motive. You don't need to prove motive to convict someone of murder. That's something of a TV fiction but of course we want to know and the jurors would want to know why would a man kill his wife and son in cold blood. Without the jury being present, the prosecution argued why it wants to bring in evidence of Murdaugh's financial crimes, stealing money from his law firm and his friend, and how his whole world was collapsing. He was disbarred. His life had just become a shamble. The defense contends all of that would be prejudicial and shouldn't come into play. Joining me now is Valerie Bauerlein, national reporter for the \"Wall Street Journal\" who has long been covering this case and has been in the courtroom every single day.

He had been confronted at his law firm that morning about a missing $792,000 fee. He was facing a hearing in a civil case in just a matter of days where he was going to be expected to be forced to turn over his financial information, which would reveal what prosecutors say is a decade-long fraud of stealing from his clients. And so they really want to show the jury that this was a man with a lot to lose, desperate to change the subject.",

Because it doesn't make logical sense to me and I'll tell you why. If there were a $10 million insurance policy that he was going to collect if his wife or son were dead then it would make sense.

There's no evidence of that, they say.You know, it's just also one of those things where they just say there's no -- you know, there's no text messages that show discord. There's no evidence that she -- that Maggie, his wife, was unhappy in any way. That has been introduced. So it just -- you know, there's just like -- this information should not come in.

We talked a little bit about the video where you can hear Alex's voice, but there was a very short Snapchat video that Paul had sent to a friend about an hour before the coroner says he was killed. And in it you just see Alex, you know, looking at a tree on the property but he's wearing a blue kind of dress shirt and pants and loafers as opposed to white t-shirt, shorts and tennis shoes that were clean and neat when police arrived. And that's been a big issue. It is another one of those things like, who are you going to believe, you know, what you see or what you're being told?",

And I also think we will likely hear from Curtis Edward Smith, a very close colleague, friend and associate of Alex who was kind of a linchpin of some of his actions.
