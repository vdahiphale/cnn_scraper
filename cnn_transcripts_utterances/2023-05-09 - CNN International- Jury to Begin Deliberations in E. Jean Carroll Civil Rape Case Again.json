Over two hours, attorneys for Carroll called out Trump for not appearing for his own civil rape trial, telling the jury that he never looked them in the eye and denied raping her.Her lawyers played for the jury parts of Trump's video deposition, saying Trump was in fact a witness against himself. They showed the jury the moment Trump mistook Carroll in a black and white photo taken years before the alleged assault for his second wife, Marla Maples, proving Carroll's lawyers argued that Carroll was Trump's type. They also played again for the jury the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, with Trump boasting, I just start kissing them. I don't even wait. Her lawyers argued, this is how he treats women. That video is a confession. Trump's attorney said Carroll's story was unbelievable. They want you to hate him enough to ignore the facts, his lawyer argued. He focused on Carroll's inability to provide an exact date of the alleged rape. Without a date, Trump's lawyer said he couldn't find witnesses or go through Trump's calendar for an alibi. Instead, he suggested Carroll colluded with the two friends she confided in at the time of the alleged assault because they were politically motivated and wanted Trump out of office. The jury will return Tuesday morning. That's when the judge will give them an instruction on the law and then deliberations will begin. Kara Scannell, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

After the MP sponsored a motion to condemn China's treatment of the Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.Now Chinese authorities of course, have repeatedly denied all of that allegation and calling this a smear and a total fabrication out of ideological bias. But once the allegation was revealed in a Canadian intelligence report, Prime Minister Trudeau has been under tremendous pressure to do something about it. And this later tit for tat really opens up another chapter of downward spiral in this barely thawing relationship. Remember for years this relationship was in a deep freeze over the saga of the arresting Canada of that Chinese tech exec Meng Wanzhou, and the subsequent arrest in China of two Canadian citizens. And that episode was finally over after years of wrangling. But the phenomenon, the allegation that Chinese influence campaign and election interference is not new. Remember last year, Trudeau himself actually got into a bit of back and forth with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Bali. Caught on camera actually with Xi being seen lecturing Trudeau for leaking a conversation on this topic to the press and warning of unspecified consequences. All of this of course is happening with a broader context of the Chinese so-called overseas police stations gaining more attention with some groups saying more than 100 overseas police stations around the world with their agents and officers targeting Chinese nationals, especially dissidents. And Max, as you remember, the FBI just arrested two agents and indicted dozens of other police officers in China not long ago -- Max.",

TODD (voice-over): The trade group representing the airlines is responding to the Biden proposal with a statement saying: U.S. airlines have no incentive to delay or cancel a flight and do everything in their control to ensure flights depart and arrive on time. But safety is always the top priority. The airlines also say quote: Carriers have taken responsibility for challenges within their control. Analysts point out that delays caused by weather and air traffic control or shortages, which the FAA has already warned could cause problems, wouldn't be seen as being the airline's fault, so passengers wouldn't be eligible for compensation in those situations.
