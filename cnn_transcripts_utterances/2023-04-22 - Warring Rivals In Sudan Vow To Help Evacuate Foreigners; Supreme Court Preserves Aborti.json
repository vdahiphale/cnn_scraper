In the past week, more than 400 people have died since two rival generals first led their forces into a battle for control of the country. That death toll includes at least one American.Both Sudan's army and its paramilitary rival, the RSF, say they will help evacuate foreign nationals. The U.S. is making preparations to get diplomatic personnel right -- out right now. But the White House says, private citizens should not expect an evacuation. We have correspondents and military expert here to help us tackle all of the angles of the story. Let's begin with CNN's Larry Madowo live in Nairobi, Kenya. Larry, I know things are very fluid at the moment, but what's the latest on these evacuations? LARRY MADOWO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Jim, right now, these evacuations are taking place out of Sudan after the two warring sides in this conflict both agreed, after pressure from several foreign nations, that the diplomats, their staff at the embassies and some nationals be evacuated out of the country, so the rapid support forces, the powerful paramilitary group that's been involved in this conflict, since last Saturday, with the Sudanese military, both agreed that they would reopen the airports and to pause fighting to allow nations like the U.S., the U.K., France, and China to evacuate their citizens. So far, we have seen several ships arrive in Jeddah, that's in Saudi Arabia, is a closest port from the port of Sudan, in the East of the country, where many convoys have been leading. It's a dangerous journey. And the U.S. is warning citizens not to make that journey on their own. If they do so, they are taking it at their own risk. The U.S. State Department has also warned in a new guidance from the Embassy in Khartoum today that it is too dangerous to coordinate any evacuation of private citizens. The only thing at this point is for diplomats and the U.S. embassy staff in Khartoum, Jim.",

That's where the arm [ph] is located. And this is also places where very close to residential areas where stray bullets and projections have been making their way into people's homes.

      "sentences": "Well, let's be frank that when U.S. citizens are living as private citizens, not part of the government apparatus overseas, they have an obligation to declare themselves. So at least the U.S. embassy is aware of their presence. But there is an obligation, the United States government has, to ensure the safe transit of U.S. citizens wherever they are. But bear in mind, they're not protected by any international bodies much like government personnel and military personnel, where you have a status and forces agreement with the host nation, you're there at the behest and -- at the behest of that government at their request. And so we remain there.But the U.S. reserves the right to provide those kinds of legal authorities, if you will, in their own hands and not defer to the host nation. So a situation like this is incredibly chaotic, as described. Look, Sudan is in the middle of a civil war right now. The ceasefire is probably very, very tenuous And the government is now -- our government is now trying to make a determination as to whether there will be a full evacuation of all government personnel that are a part of the embassy staff. And I think that's probably the extent of U.S. presence, authorized presence in the country. There may be other agencies, but they would be associated with the embassy. And then there are also all those family members associated, so you could see possibly a scaled or a phased departure where you have a noncombatant evacuation, where those folks are depart -- the family members depart under some type of military exercise, military control, U.S. military control, hopefully, with the support of a host nation, the U.S. military does not fight its way in, and then try to bring U.S. citizens out and fight their way out. That's horrible scenario. What we saw in Afghanistan was a far different one, because of the vast number of Afghan citizens that were waiting for visa type determinations. That's why those images and that -- those images are horrible. And that experience was incredibly tragic because of the vast numbers. I would hope that in Khartoum, it would be a far more precise number.",

So that becomes a challenge if you have these disparate pockets of U.S. citizens.That's what John Kirby was talking about in terms of the magnitude of that type of an evacuation. It would be phenomenal. Unless there's been a call to get everybody into a couple of very precise locations.

The court did not explain why it moved to block restrictions of the drug. Caroline Kitchener joins us now she's a national political reporter who covers abortion for The Washington Post.

I want you to look now, Jim, at the statements that her spokesperson released to CNN in saying, \"We stand in solidarity with American women standing up for their rights to access reproductive and sexual health care, including their access to abortion. We have discussed what Canada's support for American women in need might be. And those discussions are still ongoing.\" Now, the minister had made those comments. You were talking about to the media before the Supreme Court had made this ruling. But since then, nothing has changed in terms of how Canada comes at this issue. But, Jim, you brought such a good point up that she's saying that she really wants to be careful and thoughtful about how this is done. Why? Because they are concerned that they may land American women in legal jeopardy by trying to help. I'm not exactly sure, whether by mail, anything like that could ever be prosecuted, but they are continuing to discuss this. And again, the abortion debate here has been ignited again in Canada. We even had Justin Trudeau talking about it this week and saying his -- in his words that look, our government will always be unequivocally pro-choice. But at this point, you know, Jim, it's important to point out many people on both sides of this issue did not believe that Roe v. Wade would ever be struck down and it was.

AVLON: No. But and, look, it's not good when representatives from -- you know, when members of Congress from Florida, from his home state, are endorsing Donald Trump instead of Ron DeSantis. That's not a sign of strength. But the these -- folks who are backing Donald Trump at this point, let's be very clear, they are making a moral decision to back somebody who tried to overturn an election. And that speaks to the deeper problem of polarization, hyper- partisanship, exactly as you say. They're just terrified of a primary.
