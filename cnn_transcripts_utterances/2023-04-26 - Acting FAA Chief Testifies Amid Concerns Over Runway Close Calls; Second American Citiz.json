Biden and President Yoon Suk-yeol set to roll out a new plan to boost U.S. and South Korean cooperation amid North Korea's escalating threats.Our correspondents are covering this meeting from Washington to Korea. CNN's Arlette Saenz is joining us from the White House. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Washington, D.C. for us. And Paula Hancocks is live from Seoul, South Korea. Let us start with Arlette. Can you tell us what is happening at this hour? We heard the band playing, the last time we spoke to you not too long ago. What's going on there now?",

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, any minute now, we are expecting South Korean President Yoon arriving here at the White House setting off the pomp and circumstance of this second state visit that President Biden is holding for him.But it also comes as the two leaders are set to announce a significant agreement when it comes to efforts to try to deter North Korea's nuclear capabilities. This comes at a time when officials say North Korea has continued its nuclear provocations. And this agreement, which is called the Washington Declaration, the two leaders will unveil over the course of the day, and one key element of it includes deploying strategic assets to the region to try to amp up the visible efforts towards deterrence. That includes sending a U.S. nuclear ballistic submarine to South Korea, the first time that will be done since the 1980s. It's a move that could upset North Korea. But it also comes as efforts to try to engage in any diplomacy with North Korea over nuclear weapons appears to have gone unanswered. So, this is a time when South Koreans and the U.S. are trying to strengthen their cooperation when it comes to nuclear deterrents. There are a host of other issues that will be on the agenda today, including cyber initiatives and the economic agenda, as well. And this is also the first time that the two leaders will be holding formal meetings since those leaks of the classified Pentagon documents, some which related to South Korea. Now, to just run you through a little bit of the course of the day in just a short while, they will be kicking off the official arrival ceremony. As you can see right behind me, troops from various military branches are here. They will be part of that ceremony. We expect that the two leaders will also be speaking. The two presidents will then break off for a bilateral meeting, which will then be followed by a press conference, which has become a rarity here at the White House. Now, this will also be the first time President Biden has the full opportunity to answer questions from reporters since he launched his re-election bid just yesterday. And all of this state visit, the second that the White House is hosting, it caps off with that glitzy state dinner later this evening inside the White House that includes a celebrity chef who helped curate the menu as well as performance from a trio of Broadway stars. So, in just a short while, we expect the state visit to officially get under way with discussions about North Korea's nuclear capabilities very high on the agenda.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And, Paula Hancocks, Jeff Zeleny sets it up perfectly for you in Seoul. Donald Trump met with Kim Jong-un three times during his administration. It did not slow the North Korean nuclear plan. That plan actually accelerated substantially over the last four years into the last year. What does South Korea want or think it needs out of this meeting because they're actually, for the first time in a long time, have been serious discussions about the South Koreans saying, hey, maybe it's time to put nuclear weapons back in South Korea?",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right, John. I mean, when you have Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, saying he wants an exponential increase in the amount of nuclear weapons arsenal he has, it is unsurprising that here in Seoul there are raised concerns.I mean, President Yoon took power just under a year ago and he has consistently said that he wants more reassurances from Washington. He has said that the extended deterrence, the nuclear umbrella that the U.S. offers to its allies needed to be strengthened in this particular case because of the increasing threat and nuclear threat that Pyongyang was showing to the world and to its closest neighbor. So, what he has gone to Washington to get effectively is a reassurance, a reassurance that the United States will be there in a time of crisis, if necessary. Now, of course, many U.S. officials and experts would argue that they already have that deterrence, that they have 28,500 U.S. soldiers based here in South Korea, hundreds of thousands of Americans based here in South Korea. So, they are here for the long haul. But as you say, that has been an increasing call for South Korea to have its own nuclear weapons program. Ten years ago when I was here, this was a fringe argument. You never spoke about it with much credibility. I certainly wouldn't be talking about it on air. But now, it is a very real possibility. There is a majority of South Koreans in all recent polls who believe that the South Koreans should have their own nuclear weapons program. The argument effectively is if North Korea has nuclear weapons, so should South Korea have these weapons. And, of course, the hope after this particular summit from Washington would be that that that -- this Washington declaration, this increase, the strengthening of extended deterrence from Washington might actually silence some of those calls because the U.S., many in the region, many in the world do not want South Korea to go down that path.",

It all happened within 20 minutes of each other. At least one is suspected to have been a bird strike. All of this is happening as the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration is testifying now before a House committee. He's facing tough questions as the agency deals with all kinds of issues, including in-flight violence, scheduling woes at Southwest Airlines, staffing shortages and several near misses on runways.

And what is so interesting is that the FAA is making a little bit of news prior to this because there have been these high-profile runway incursions, what they are technically called, these close calls involving airliners at major airports near collision since the start of this year. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating six incidents.Very fitting here that the FAA, rather, is convening this new safety review board of six different members, they will meet next month, over the next six months, to try and find the risk factors in the aviation system. This is a shared onus between the airlines, between operators, pilots, air traffic controllers, and this follows a first ever FAA safety summit. We've not seen one in the last decade. The last time they had one was back in 2009 after these incidents, JFK, Austin, Boston, Burbank, Sarasota, Honolulu. So, these are coast to coast and it's a really big problem. And the FAA now wants to convene this independent review board to try and figure out really what is the problem here. They're bringing folks together from former NASA administrators, former airline pilots, even the former head of the National Transportation Safety Board, John. So, we'll see here what they figure out and try and make it not just talk but try and put some action into place here, too.",
