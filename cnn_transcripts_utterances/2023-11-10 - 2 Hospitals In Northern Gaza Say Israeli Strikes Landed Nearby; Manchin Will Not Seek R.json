Workers finding fentanyl in at least one envelope, the new threat to 2024. I'm Kate Bolduan with Omar Jimenez. John and Sara are off today. This is CNN News Central.This morning, Secretary of State Tony Blinken says Israel must do more to protect Palestinian civilians. This is really seen as one of his most direct condemnations yet of the civilian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war. This is also as we're hearing new reports of explosions at or near hospitals in northern Gaza. Watch this. So explosions were seen near two hospitals, where you will remember Israel says that Hamas has placed some of their headquarters underneath and tunnels just a few miles away. Apparent shelling was heard and felt at Gaza's largest hospital. And then a fourth hospital, this one for children has been surrounded by tanks, as Israel pushes further in. Let's go to CNN's Oren Liebermann in Tel Aviv, Nada Bashir standing by for us as well in Jerusalem. Omar -- Oren, let's start with you. These comments from Secretary Blinken, are you hearing any response from Israeli officials yet?",

But this is as you pointed out, some of the most vocal criticism we have seen of Israeli operations in northern Gaza and the broader coastal enclave as the IDF says it's deepening its operations with Gaza City surrounded. Now it is worth noting that President Joe Biden made clear that Israel still has full U.S. backing and Biden doesn't believe that now is the time for a ceasefire. The U.S. also lauded or praised the opening of humanitarian corridors and the effort to make those regular and continuous on a daily basis. Still, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was very critical here of the number of civilians that have died in Gaza now since October 7th. Here he is.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We have been hearing those warnings from health officials from medics on the ground across Gaza's hospitals, that these air strikes or strikes have been edging closer and closer to Gaza's hospitals. Now a spokesperson for the World Health Organization has described the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, the largest hospital in Gaza, as coming under bombardment.And what we have seen overnight into the early hours of the morning is more video emerging showing the impact of this apparent strike on the ground. Several injured and what it says has been the outpatient clinic at the Al-Shifa Hospital, many clearly injured in this latest strike, eyewitnesses on the ground accusing Israel of carrying out, an airstrike on the vicinity of the Al-Shifa Hospital. They're seen and has put that question to the IDF, no response just yet. But as you laid out, Kate, we have seen other hospitals also facing bombardment. We've heard from the officials at the Al Awda Hospital. They say that some infrastructure and including two ambulances were struck again accusing Israel of carrying out airstrikes there, at least 10 people are said to have been injured today. And of course, we have had those warnings from a further two hospitals. Officials at the Al-Nasr and the Al-Rantisi Pediatric Hospital have said that they are around and surrounded by on the ground fighting. They've described the hospital as being completely surrounded and are appealing to the Red Cross to facilitate and avert an urgent evacuation of medical teams of patients and civilians there. Of course, it is important to underscore here that we are not just talking about patients and medical teams, there are thousands of Palestinian civilians who have flocked to these hospitals, in the hopes that they will remain a safe haven, in the hopes that they can take shelter there, some 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza are displaced. And of course, when it comes to the humanitarian situation, we know that the majority of Gaza's hospitals are now out of service. And this humanitarian, situation the crisis facing hospitals, particularly with no fuel getting in is deteriorating by the hour. Kate?",

And, you know, he told me he has been in an office for 41 years in public office, whether it's the House of Delegates, the State Senate. He was the Secretary of State, two term governor. And he's been in, you know, now in the U.S. Senate.And when he completes his term, I'll be 42 years of public service. And he expressed the interest in spending time with his family and his grandchildren. So I definitely thanked him for his years of public service. And it's true. He is a larger than life figure in the Senate. And West Virginia being such a small state, we've really benefited from having a legacy of senators who were larger than life, whether it was Jennings Randolph or Robert C. Byrd, or Jay Rockefeller. And Senator Manchin, who also got a lot done for the state of West Virginia, in most recently with the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that he was able to work with President Biden on and that we've seen unprecedented investment in West Virginia due to this. And I think it goes without saying that these accomplishments occurred during the first two years of the Biden administration, with the Democrats had control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate to work with President Biden in order to pass these monumental pieces of legislation.

And people like and trust Andy Beshear.If you look next door in Virginia, where the Democrats both held on to the State Senate and flipped the Virginia House of Delegates back to the Democratic column pushing back against some of the extremist policies that have been coming from the Republican Party and then across the river in Ohio, where you saw a landslide election in support of protecting a woman's right to choose, push back against the extremist taking of rights that we say right that women have almost taken for granted for 50 years now in this country has been taken away by extremism in the Republican Party. And you can talk about Governor Justice. Governor Justice when he ran for governor back in 2016, as a Democrat claimed to be pro-choice while he signed complete abortion ban and recently in West Virginia. I mean, talk about Florida, where they're talking about six-week ban. West Virginia has a zero week ban. We have a complete ban in West Virginia.
