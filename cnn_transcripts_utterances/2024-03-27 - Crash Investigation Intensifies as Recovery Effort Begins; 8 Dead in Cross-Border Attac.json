Also happening in the next few hours attorneys for Hunter Biden and Special Counsel David Weiss are set for courtroom showdowns in Los Angeles over the future of his felony tax indictment. And in this region, Israel and Lebanon trade rocket fire leading to several dead and injured on both sides of the border. Well, we begin this hour with new developments in Baltimore. We are just learning that recovery teams have recovered the critical data recorder from the ship. Divers are in the water they're looking for the victims of the Baltimore Bridge collapse after the operation moved from the search phase to recovery. Official say the construction workers were on the bridge Tuesday when a cargo ship lost power, veered off course and crashed into the bridge plunging the workers into the river below and six people are presumed dead after the collapse of the Key Bridge in Baltimore. We've got CNN's Gabe Cohen in Baltimore with much more on the victim's background and the investigation into the crash. And he spoke with my CNN colleagues just a short time ago. Take a look.",

He was a married father of two an 18-year-old son, and a five year old daughter. His brother told CNN describing him as a really beloved, a member of their family. We've also learned about Miguel Luna, he's a father of three from El Salvador who had lived in Maryland for more than 19 years. You can feel Fred the heartbreak as you talk to people here in the Baltimore community about the lives that have been lost. And as John mentioned before, this investigation into what went wrong is really kicking into high gear this afternoon. The NTSB has said they have boarded the dolly their investigators, they have close to two dozen of them here at the scene. And they've started collecting electronics including that data recorder, which is essentially the black box of the ship to try to piece together a timeline that we're expecting to get a little bit later today. They're processing it in their lab right now. But that could tell us what caused this total blackout on the ship. The reason the pilot might have lost controls lost the ability to operate the ship as he tried to slow it down tried to drop anchor couldn't pull that off right before colliding with the column of the bridge causing that collapse. A lot of questions but it is promising that the NTSB has said they are hoping to have a much better timeline by later this afternoon.",

And it's going to take a while for us to really understand what happened on that ship. I understand, for example, that before it had blacked out before it systems went dark. It was traveling about eight and a half knots, which is roughly 10 miles an hour. And we don't know what the speed of the shipping container was when it impacted the bridge.
