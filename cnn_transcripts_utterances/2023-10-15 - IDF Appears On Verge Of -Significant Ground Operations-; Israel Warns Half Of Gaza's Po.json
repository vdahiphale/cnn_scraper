I'm Kim Brunhuber. It's 5 a.m. here in Atlanta, noon in Gaza City, where an incursion by Israeli ground forces now appears imminent.On Saturday, Israel declared it's ready to open a new phase in its war against Hamas with a focus on significant ground operations. The IDF says it struck more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the front lines, offering words of support and telling them to be prepared. The U.S. is now sending a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean as a deterrent to Hezbollah to stay out of the conflict. And the U.S. embassy says Americans who want to leave Israel will be evacuated by sea on Monday out of Haifa. Palestinian authorities in Gaza say the death toll from Israeli airstrikes is now more than 2,300 people, including 300 in the past 24 hours. It follows the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel last Saturday, which killed more than 1,300 people. Earlier, I spoke with Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, Spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, and he reveals how the IDF killed a Hamas commander overnight who allegedly led one of the attacks last week. Here he is. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: I cannot be unimpressed by how Israel goes around investing in life and saving lives. And this iron dome defense mechanism is just one of those examples of the extent we go. Moving over to what you asked, the IDF is continuing its activities and expanding our strikes against Hamas from their leaders. I can report that over the night, we killed Bilal al-Kedra. He was a Khan Younis Special Forces commando from the Noh'ba Force. He was one of the commanders that broke the penetrated defense and conducted the massacre in Kibbutz Nirim. We are very, very determined to take out the terrorists that conducted the attack, take out the organization that orchestrated it. And -- and even take out the leader who -- who is the mastermind of the massacre. Yehia Sinwar who is Orchestrated and governs the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for terrorism and utilized all the forces of Hamas government to do so.",

The Israeli Defense Forces Israel saying that you know they that Hamas is actively trying to prevent people from moving south as well but the fact of the matter is that the humanitarian situation has been deteriorating for some days let's not forget that Israel has imposed a -- in its words, a complete siege on the Gaza Strip not allowing food, water, fuel or electricity into the Strip. And as far as the water situation is concerned we've all -- we've heard from example from the United Nations saying that Palestine, Palestine is now being forced to drink brackish water which could result in severe health issues coming about and we've also heard for example from the World Health Organization saying that orders for hospitals in the northern part of the Gaza Strip to evacuate is effectively a death sentence for some people in those hospitals. But as I say Kim what we've seen now I'm sorry to say may not be anything really compared with what we are likely to see in the coming days and weeks once this ground invasion this expected ground invasion takes place.

Foreign nationals are gathered at the Rafah Crossing, waiting for the chance to cross into Egypt. The U.S. has been in talks with Egypt about creating a humanitarian corridor through which civilians can evacuate Gaza, but Egypt has been reluctant to allow them in.And joining me now from Cairo, Egypt is Mustapha Kamel Al-Sayyid, Director of the Center for the Study of Developing Countries at Cairo University. Thank you so much for being here with us. So those in northern Gaza that have been told to leave a logical place for many would be the border with Egypt, but that hasn't been possible for many reasons. Why not? MUSTAPHA KAMEL AL-SAYYID, CTR. FOR THE STUDY OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, CAIRO UNIVERSITY: I think as a matter of principle, Egypt does not want to be engaged in what some Israeli politicians call a transfer. I think this has been the plan of some Israeli politicians that the right home for Palestinians is probably Jordan or Sinai and this would be for them the final solution of the Palestinian problem. So I think Egypt would like Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians how to achieve their settlement that would guarantee for them a state of their own and would ensure also normal relations between a Palestinian state and Israel. And so forcing the Palestinians to leave Gaza and to go to Egypt, this runs against the commitments by Israel, runs also against the commitments under international law, not to attack civilian populations, not to impose collective punishment on them. So Egypt is I think completely opposed to any attempt by Israel to evacuate, to force the Palestinians in Gaza to go to Sinai. Sinai is not an alternative homeland for the Palestinians. This is the basic Egyptian position.",

      "sentences": "Well, I guess the point I'm making is that the Egyptian government itself hasn't been necessarily all that friendly with Hamas. It's -- you know, it's worked withIsrael, for example, to block tunnels and so on and so forth, so it might be not disposed to helping Hamas at all, even though they may want to help the Palestinian people. I want to ask you in terms of diplomatically, what role is Egypt playing in sort of de-escalating the crisis and are they playing any role in helping to get the hostages back? AL-SAYYID: Yeah, I think the Egyptian government has been involved in contacts, you know, with many foreign governments. I think they have been in contact with the British government, the Italian government. Now, also the Turkish Foreign Minister was in Cairo. I think they have been contacts also with the Italian government, with the Saudi government, the Jordanian, the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas in order to find ways of dealing with this situation. In the past, Egypt had also good relations with Hamas and Egypt tried to promote a sort of reconciliation between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. And in the past, when Israel attacked Gaza, the Egyptian government tried to reach a sort of ceasefire between the two. So I think, well, I don't talk -- I'm not a government official, but I think Egypt did all it could in order to ensure peace on its eastern borders. And also, you know, it did its best in order to achieve a peaceful settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The problem is that the Israeli government, you know, continues to build settlements and continues also to send its troops to, you know, attack Palestinian camps, et cetera. So I don't think the Egyptian government is responsible for this complicated situation. I think the blame should be addressed to the Israelis who continue military occupation, often seen in territories against international law. And the U.S. government should be blamed also because it has much influence over the Israeli government, but it does not like your form. Of course, the well-known domestic considerations does not like to persuade the Israeli government to do something which is in the best interest of Israel.",

Palestinians say about 300 people were killed in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours alone with 800 others wounded. That brings the death toll since the crisis began to more than 2300 people. Meanwhile, the U.S. will start helping its citizens leave Israel by sea. Officials say an evacuation ship will leave the city of Haifa on Monday and take U.S. nationals to Cyprus.

The presence of one aircraft carrier, soon to be two aircraft carriers in the eastern Mediterranean, is simply aimed to be a deterrent to Iranian-backed groups or militant groups in the area like Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed military and political group, which effectively controls a large swath of southern Lebanon.And of course, we have already seen and continue to see exchanges across the border between southern Lebanon and northern Israel. But look, compared to what's happening in and around Gaza, obviously this is relatively minor despite the fact that there are casualties on both sides. Obviously, the fear, as always, is that these more minor incidents will snowball into a much wider conflict, which everyone has said they want to avoid, including Israel, and for good reason. In 2006, it fought essentially to a draw with Hezbollah in a war that lasted more than a month. And Hezbollah has only gotten stronger since then. It now has precision, guided missiles. It says that it has reservists up to 100,000 of them, many of them battle hardened already from fighting inside of Syria and the Israelis also believe that there are hundreds maybe even thousands of rockets stored in private homes in southern Lebanon near the border region. So that is simply a fight that they don't want to get into especially at this stage of the game. After nine days since all of this blew up, Kim, we have not though heard directly from the Hezbollah Leader, Hassan Nasrallah. We do know that he met with the Iranian Foreign Minister recently to talk about all of this and from Iran, well, the Foreign Minister has warned of far-reaching consequences and also saying that, look, if Israel's continues what it's doing in Gaza that no one can \"guarantee\" that the situation in the region will remain the same.

That quake was centered northwest of the city of Herat and came one week after another quake of the exact same magnitude hit the same area. Authorities say at least 50 people were injured in Sunday's quakes. And, of course, scores of people were displaced by last week's earthquake which Taliban officials say killed more than 2,000 people. Our Anna Coren shows us the aftermath and the chilling reason why 90% of the victims were women and children. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (VOICES OVER): Beneath crystal blue skies on the outskirts of Herat in western Afghanistan, the sound of vanished hope fills the air. Under mounds of earth lie countless bodies, there are no survivors here. Only evidence of mother nature's wrath and fury, unleashing further misery on a traumatized country. Last Saturday, around 11 a.m., a 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck the district of Zenda Jan, completely flattening 11 villages. You can see the state of my home. It's now in ruins says 56-year-old Zahir. There is no need for words. Zahir wasn't home when the earth violently shook for only a few seconds. But when he returned, he found 13 family members crushed to death, including his daughters, sons and multiple grandchildren. Simple mud brick structures supported by wooden poles with the homes of villages on these dusty plains. They've all been reduced to rubble. Aid agency tents are now their new homes. 32-year-old Shah Bibi last two daughters when her house collapsed. The only reason she survived was because she was standing under the doorframe.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE DAVIDSON, ACTOR, COMEDIAN, GUEST HOST \"SNL\": This week we saw the horrible images and stories from Israel and Gaza. And I know what you're thinking, who better to comment on it than Pete Davidson? Well, in a lot of ways, I am a good person to talk about it because when I was seven years old, my dad was killed in a terrorist attack. So I know something about what that's like. But I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering, Israeli children and Palestinian children. And it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place. And, you know, no one in this world deserves to suffer like that, you know, especially not kids. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
