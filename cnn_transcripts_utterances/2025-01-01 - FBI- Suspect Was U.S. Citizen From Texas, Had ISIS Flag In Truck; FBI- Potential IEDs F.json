I think one of the big questions is what Evan was just talking about, any associates he was talking to, not just anybody who could potentially be involved, but the kind of information you can get.Particularly, any association to ISIS. Because was this someone who was just infatuated or inspired, or is this someone who is trying to or had successfully develop an association with that group? I think there's also going to be a lot of tough questions, not just about the suspect, but also about law enforcement and how they prepared for last night, the security preparations, or lack thereof. Because this is exactly the type of incident that law enforcement is worried about on a big holiday. So there are going to be a lot of questions about that. I think a lot of follow ups to the reporting, Evan was just sharing about these explosive devices. And then, you know, taking this even further away from even the briefings, I think this is something the incoming Trump administration is really going to have to contend with, because we haven't heard a lot about ISIS-affiliated or ISIS-inspired attacks. Certainly not as much as we did at the end of the Obama administration. But as this new administration comes in, it's an important reminder that, you know, the terrorist threat, both domestic and foreign, still exists, and it's something they're going to have to contend with.",

We are just learning, obviously, the identity of the attacker. First, though, I want to I want to talk to you about these barriers that we were just talking about here with Evan and Paula. Because that's one of the reasons that New Orleans had them was because of an attack in France. We just saw one in Germany. We covered it extensively -- it was horrific -- here on this show. Were those barriers that are capable of keeping cars out of the area, were they up at the time of this attack? JEAN-PAUL MORRELL, (D), NEW ORLEANS CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: Well, actually, the barriers were in the midst of being repaired and replaced. But in actuality, in this instance, the individual circumvented the barriers by going on the sidewalk and getting past the area where they had police vehicles, where the barrier where the repair barriers were at. So in this instance, even had the bollard barriers been up, the circumvention by riding on the sidewalk would have defeated them. There is absolutely an after-action report going on to the New Orleans Police Department to see what other things should have been in place, were in place, were circumvented, whatever. They're looking at that right now. But right now, the city is just still reeling from this horrific terrorist attack.",

Bourbon Street, which is like the -- the signature street of New Orleans, will not be available for people to use. Whether the Sugar Bowl goes on or not, because law enforcement has a lot to get off of Bourbon Street. So the city plans on supporting the BCS, supporting our federal partners. If they believe it's safe to go on with the Sugar Bowl, we're going to go with the Sugar Bowl, because we're not going to let terrorists define what we do with our freedoms. But on that token, it is an active crime scene in the French Quarter.

ANDY SCHOLES, CNN SPORTS ANCHOR: Well, Brianna, they're certainly beefing up security around that area. And according to the A.P., the Superdome has been on lockdown this entire morning as they continue to do more security sweeps in and around the stadium. You know, if you've ever been to a big event in New Orleans, you know, everyone stays in and around the French Quarter by the water. And then, you know, most of the fans -- the stadium holds 83,000 people -- they walk down Poydras Street to get to the Superdome. So as you can imagine, its, you know, a very uneasy feeling walking around the city today.
