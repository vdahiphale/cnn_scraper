Theworld's attention gripped by extraordinary scenes as Wagner group mercenaries staged their short lived rebellion against the Kremlin. Claiming control of Russian Military facilities in two cities and making an abortive march on Moscow, Russian President Putin making his first appearance since the mutiny in a recorded video address and not acknowledging the weekend's turmoil. We have no certainty about precisely when that video was made. EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Luxembourg today thing the insurrection has undermined Putin's grip on power and weakened Russian Military readiness overall, the Foreign Minister of Latvia and the country's President elect is attending those meetings and we will hear from him later on this hour. Latvia of course borders Belarus, while Wagner group Head Yevgeny Prigozhin has reportedly agreed to live in exile. We'll also hear from retired U.S. Lieutenant General and CNN Military analyst Mark Hertling who says the Wagner revolt reflects, \"The Incredible dysfunction and corruption of all those involved in this weekend's extraordinary showdown\". In the meantime, Ukraine's Foreign Minister today urging EU nations to accelerate Russia's defeat \"by stepping up support for his nation\". Ukraine today, claiming fresh gains in the Southeast and advances in areas around Bakhmut the town that Wagner claimed to have retaken last month but then of course it left. In the meantime on global markets caution as you would expect as investors monitor the latest events. U.S. futures little changed at this stage taking back some early a weakness in Europe, relatively mixed to after a weaker Asia handover. We're seeing more pronounced reactions though across the commodities complex. Natural gas prices rallying in Europe gold, silver as well as wheat as perhaps you would expect also remaining higher. A busy hour of mutiny scrutiny ahead, so let me give you a look at that video of President Putin released by the Kremlin. He appears to be giving a short speech to a youth industrial forum as I mentioned without mentioning the aborted mutiny this weekend. Again, it's not clear when or where it was filmed. And the Russian Military also released this video showing the Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visiting troops. It's also not known when this took place either. In the meantime, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg speaking about the Wagner rebellion while visiting Lithuania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It kicked off on Friday, with allegations of a deadly strike on a Wagner Military camp in Ukraine, the leader of the Russian mercenary group Yevgeny Prigozhin, accusing his rivals in the Defense Ministry of ordering the attack.

This is essentially the firststeps of the dismantling of the Russian regime. That's according to the Senior National Security Official Oleksiy Danilov here speaking yesterday. Now, of course, there'll be champagne corks popping. I've seen gleeful Ukrainians myself, but it's important to remember that stability and a nuclear power like Russia is often useful. And whoever comes to replace Putin, indeed, if Prigozhin had been successful, that wouldn't suddenly have meant a passive Russia, looking for a peace deal on Ukrainian terms. So a lot that could still go wrong here. But ultimately, the instability here, the distraction of the Russian Military having to deal with an insurrection by its own will probably work in Ukraine's favor. The question, of course, is do they seize upon that immediately, as the turmoil continues, develop the turmoil play out in case it worsens, and makes matters yet more complex for Putin? There is a risk to of course, that to seismic change on the front line could indeed rally the Russian elite around Putin if they see the potential for an existential loss in Ukraine and of course, to for Ukraine to adjust its position on the battlefield that can take time that can take days to move thousands of troops to exploit what they perceive to be a weakness. So I'm sure Ukraine and its Western allies, still assessing what this means who and Russia's forces had been moved. Were here why and indeed have the frontlines changed much I suspect, we'll see some kind of motion in the weeks ahead. But really, still, the ultimate question is who was running Russia's Military campaign? We haven't seen Shoigu live today. We haven't seen Putin live today. We've not even seen Prigozhin live today and that you think, must have some Russians wondering what is going on, particularly those in the trenches, but in their lives on the line for Putin's war of choice, Julia.",

I think you estimated somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of those Russian forces that were and are fighting in Ukraine. You can't just integrate that number of people, even if they were wheeling into the Russian forces, you also I'm sure can't expect them suddenly to just switch allegiance not knowing where their boss, the Wagner Chief Prigozhin is at this moment, or what it means for them or him.

In my view, Julia, you've asked it very succinctly, how do you integrate a group of people who were different, thatwere fighting as part of a clan or a tribe, for a charismatic leader who thought he had connections that no other military commanders had? How do you now take that organization and either insert them in different locations on the battlefield under a new commander, or integrate them into other forces that have been depleted through combat, you don't. It's very difficult to take someone who thinks they are special and put them in with just the normal troops in an infantry battalion. There's hatred on both sides, or there's a lack of trust on both sides. And you add to that the fact that Prigozhin's troops were firing on Russian units, not just the aircraft, and they shot down allegedly somewhere between six and eight Russian aircraft and killed pilots in the process. But they also fired on Russian ground troops. And in addition to that, they surrounded the Russian southern headquarters in Rostov-on-Don. These are not things that generate camaraderie and cohesion within a Military.

There was noteven a hiccup or a speed bump along the road to Rostov and then along the road to -- on the road to Moscow. There were no active units attempting to stop them. They were not stopped by the Russian border Police, just like some of the other Russian insurgents that attacked in Belgorod and Kursk and Smolensk earlier in the month. So it tells me first of all, that Russia is very weak along their border. Secondly, commanders along the way don't know how Russian commanders, don't know what to do, unless they are given precise orders to stop either an Insurrection, a mutiny or a potential coup, whatever we want to call this thing. So it just it boggles the imagination to have Military commanders working for the government not doing anything against again, a mutineer who the President got on TV and said this guy is a criminal, and he should be stopped and other commanders were saying don't do this. And oh, by the way, at the same time Prigozhin is killing fellow Russians. It just doesn't make sense. As Nick so eloquently said, there are so many questions to this. We can't we in the West can't wrap our hands around it, because it is such a description of a dysfunctional military.

And I think that was an important directive from the White House from Washington to ensure that this doesn't become something that Putin is able to claim was orchestrated by the West, which is a playbook that he has used over and over again.

And I think that when you talk to American officials, really the overriding message is that they don't think that this is over. And certainly you heard that from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, over the weekend, when he did that round of interviews on Sunday shows, really the view among American officials is that the Wagner Chief Prigozhin has not gone away. He is not going to go to Belarus and start selling hotdogs again. They do believe that this is an ongoing situation. They don't necessarily know how it's going to end. They did have intelligence leading up to this event that he was making preparations to take these steps. They had been monitoring this power struggle between the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Wagner Group dating back months. And so certainly they do have some insight into what is happening there. But I do think that there are a lot of open questions that the National Security Council and that American intelligence officials are still trying to work through today, so they can have a better handle on what is happening going forward, Julia.",

Investors clearly now grappling with freshgeopolitical uncertainties after this weekend's dramatic events in Russia, after a cautious pre-market the firmer session to start the week at least for now, all this after a losing week in fact for the major averages in the past week. The NASDAQ is now posting its first weekly loss in some two months. In the currency markets, the Russian ruble fell to its lowest level in 15 months against the U.S. dollar earlier. It's now recovered much of those losses, but as you can see still under a bit of pressure. This hour volatility too in the energy markets and this is where we really need to focus. Oil prices rising more than 1 percent earlier on Russian uncertainties, it since pulled back from those levels, but remains higher at this hour. Natural gas, wheat prices also on the rise as Investors assess the demand outlook. Anna Stewart joins us now with all the details, Anna, good to have you with us.
