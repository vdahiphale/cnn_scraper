A live look at Capitol Hill. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. Wonderful to have you with us today. We begin with two major events that could alter the landscape of the November election. First, the testimony of Robert Hur. Republicans hoping to inflict damage on Biden when the controversial special counsel appears before the House Judiciary Committee in just a matter of hours. Hur released an explosive report last month, characterizing the president as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\" who mishandled classified documents. Hur's testimony serves as a backdrop for today's primary elections in Georgia, Mississippi, Washington, and the Mariana Islands, as well as the GOP caucus in -- out in Hawaii. By the end of the night, President Biden and former President Trump could officially clinch their respective nominations. It's not exactly a Super Tuesday with Nikki Haley out of the race. But there it is. All right. Our panel's here to discuss. Let's bring in Republican strategist Doug Heye. Democratic Congresswoman Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania is with us. Karen Finney, former senior spokesperson for Hillary Clinton. And Sasha Issenberg. He is the author of \"The Lie: Detectives\" and a long-time political journalist. Good morning to all of you.

So I wonder if his statement will be revised.But it's a relatively brief statement. In it, he immediately speaks to the issue, and almost offensively, as to why he included what seemed a little gratuitous when he was declining to prosecute, to say he's a sympathetic older man with a poor memory. And so that's not the big takeaway of this report, this multi-hundred- page, several-hundred-page report. The big takeaway is that President Biden did nothing criminally wrong in terms of classified documents. He has declined to prosecute. And he says it over and over again. But the throwing in immediately and early of the -- a statement as to the president's mental condition, as I say, was gratuitous. It's not the big takeaway. The big takeaway is no criminality here. And in his report, he contrasts dramatically what Donald Trump did with documents, as -- as you're about to tease there.",

I hope they see that this was a special counsel report that he knew would be made public, so he knew when he put those kinds of statements as to memory in there that it would become known during a political season, which I think is rather strange, that he would have done that.

So I think I agree with Doug that timing is everything, and the fact that this comes the day both after the State of the Union and the day after we have that interview, and we've learned what I think is explosive new information about just hurling boxes, you know, willy- nilly from a car to an Escalade to a plane.

And certainly, Donald Trump's strategy all the way along has been to make legal problems look the same, right?That all this mess with Hunter means that, you know, Joe Biden has just as many legal issues as, you know, et cetera. Like muddy the waters, right? And certainly, President Biden having old classified documents in his garage, you know, from his time as vice president doesn't necessarily help their case in terms of making it look very clear-cut, as in President Biden does it all correctly; President Trump does it all incorrectly. That said, there are critical differences. For voters, what do they see here, do you think? SASHA ISSENBERG, AUTHOR/JOURNALIST: Yes. I mean, I think we need to anticipate how different the environment will be when there are actually criminal trials underway. You know, I mean, there's a reason, like, half of prime-time TV is based around what happens in courtrooms, because it's dramatic. There are surprises. And I think the reporting that CNN has is that a pretty good early look at the types of disclosures that will come out when people are called to testify, if -- especially if this goes to trial before -- before November, and how much that will dominate the news on any given day when you start to get these kind of vivid, colorful details that don't always come through in charging documents. But when people are testifying, they're being elicited. And you know, we have a small share of persuadable voters in this country, and they tend to be people who are, you know, low-information voters, people who aren't paying close attention, who aren't following the details of indictments. But I suspect that the drama that's attached to some of these episodes when it comes out in court will -- will break through in a way that wouldn't otherwise.",

One of Jack Smith's central witnesses in Donald Trump's classified documents case going public for the first time.Brian Butler, the man known as Trump Employee No. 5, speaking exclusively to Kaitlan Collins about his 20 years working for the Trump family and the day he unknowingly helped load boxes of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago to the former president's personal airplane. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has been working on this reporting. She is live in West Palm Beach for us. Katelyn, good morning. Always good to see you. This is just an absolute bombshell. What do we need to know? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kasie, it's not just that this man was moving the boxes unwittingly on the day of June 3rd, when the FBI came to pick up everything Trump had and couldn't find everything at that time. He also is privy to a part of the investigation that is what makes this case so serious for the Justice Department. He's part of the -- the piece of the investigation, he's part of the witnesses that were hearing information about obstruction. The part of the indictment against Donald Trump, Walt Nauta, and Carlos de Oliveira that outlines the alleged cover-up of Trump keeping these boxes after he was mishandling them at Mar-a-Lago. We know that because he's best friends with Carlos de Oliveira, now one of the co-defendants; has split from him. They don't talk anymore. Carlos de Oliveira is using a lawyer within Trump's world. Brian Butler, Trump Employee 5, is not and is speaking to prosecutors about what he was hearing from Carlos de Oliveira after all of those documents were supposed to be turned over. Things like Walt Nauta is secretly coming down to Mar-a-Lago. Don't tell anyone. He's interested in learning how long surveillance footage at the club is kept for. And then after that, Brian Butler was witness to a conversation where Trump reached out to Carlos de Oliveira directly and assured him that he would have a lawyer, that he would be taken care of. Now one of the things, too, he talks about is the day of that search. And on the interview with Kaitlan Collins, he initially says it was a raid. But then he corrects himself and says it was a lawfully executed search. And he has learned that from prosecutors. That is the facts of the case. Here's a little bit more about Brian Butler talking about August of 2022. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the fact that there's just boxes and boxes sitting around, strewn around. And -- and also the boxes that show, like news articles kind of thrown in, just shows the kind of willy-nilly way in which they were handled. And again, as part of both the reporting that we've heard and -- and some of the other accounts, the fact that the president was also discussing information that was in, for example, the conversations we know he had around the submarine program that he had with the Australian businessman. And that is not information that you should be sharing with, you know, just your buddy who happens to be, you know, a top businessman in a country that is interested in what's going on with our submarine program.
