And obviously, do it in a peaceful manner. In our city, A., we obviously believe in the Constitution and believe that people should have the right to express themselves. But we also believe in law and order. And we know that. And we hope that tomorrow will be peaceful. We encourage people to be peaceful in them demonstrating how they're -- how they feel. And we're going to have the adequate forces necessary to ensure that. There may be, depending on the crowd size, some road closures. So, people who live in the downtown area should expect additional traffic and should prepare for that. It's not in our initial plan. Initially, we're going to sort of take it step by step and I'll let the chief explain how he will make that determination as to what roads are closed, how they're closed, and when they're closed. But the commuter should expect the possibility of some disruption. We are prepared for a variety of different size crowds. And obviously, crowd size is dependent on a variety of issues, including but not limited to the weather. And so, we have the ability to increase our capacity if necessary. Our fire department fire chief, I spoke to him right before this press conference. And he has assured me also that there will be an increased fire rescue level of preparedness, including EMS services and what he would consider a number of on-duty personnel that are both at the task and command levels. We're happy to be joined by our partners from Miami-Dade County, thank you so much for being here. Obviously, we have at some level, overlapping jurisdiction. And we're working not just with them, but I think it's safe to say we're working with partners -- our law enforcement partners at all levels to make sure that we're communicating, to make sure that we're prepared, to make sure we're sharing information and ultimately to ensure that tomorrow goes off without any hitch. And so, we wanted to assure that -- ensure to the public that we are ready. Thank you. And now I'm going to turn it over -- yes, for sure. (INAUDIBLE) (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Presumably, they're trying to figure out a way to have a perimeter.But one of the concerns that they have -- one of the concerns that you hear from officials who are watching some of the threat briefings that they are getting is that there might be thousands of people will be drawn here, in part because the former president and his allies are asking for them to come and show up here. And so, the question is, you know, are the local police ready? Are the resources here ready for what could turn ugly at any moment, right? It is -- you can't predict it. But it's certainly you want to be ready for it if it turns that way. And so that's one of the concerns I hear from talking to people. Shimon Prokupecz has been talking to his sources as well.

If you remember, the former president left town hours before Joe Biden was sworn in as president. And that meant that certainly these documents, when he went back to Mar-a-Lago, he was still president, and was still authorized to have it.And so, that key law, the 793, that Espionage Act, which is the biggest charge here, the -- what prosecutors determined they had to do was bring the case here, which is where Mar-a-Lago -- Mar-a-Lago is located. And, of course, that brings some challenges for prosecutors. This is a -- probably a friendlier venue for the former president, certainly more friendly than the venue of Washington, DC where most of the grand jury testimony was being taken.

And while you have his team and while you have Republicans encouraging him to continue running, and himself saying he's going to, it is very clear that these legal problems are mounting around him and they are weighing on him. In Georgia over the weekend, he spoke for about 80 minutes. 40 minutes of that at the Georgia convention, a Republican Convention, was focused just on his legal problems. I was just going through his social media page. He has one post about DeSantis and the Oklahoma governor endorsing him. Everything else is about his legal issues. So, even if again, they are trying to push him to run or he wants to run, this is consuming to him. And the other question here is how Republicans feel -- Republican voters. I spoke to a source who really likes the former president, wanted him to be president, and wants him to be president again, who just texted me and said, this is all just so exhausting. And this has been a fear among some of the advisors that this is going to be some sort of Trump fatigue as these legal problems continue to grow. But as we have noted, he will land in Miami. He's staying at his Doral Resort. He is meeting with attorneys. They are trying to beef up their Florida-based legal team. It is unclear who they're reaching out to.
