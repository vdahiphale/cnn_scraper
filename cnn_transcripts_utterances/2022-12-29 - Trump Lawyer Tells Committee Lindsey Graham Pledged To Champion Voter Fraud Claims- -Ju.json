There are new intriguing details, from the January 6th committee transcripts, tonight. You'll hear how Senator Lindsey Graham vowed to champion Donald Trump's election lies, if only the White House could find him, quote, \"Five dead voters.\" We'll explain. You'll also hear what Donald Trump thought about the appearance of the January 6th rioters. Spoiler alert! They were not his type! And you'll hear about the texts that Don Jr. sent to Mark Meadows, the day after his father lost the election. There was basically a roadmap, for how to unconstitutionally keep Trump in office. Don Jr. says, he cannot remember who sent him that text. But see, if you recognize some of the unique language, in that text, as a clue. And, as predicted, there are new developments, tonight, and new lies, from Congressman-elect George Santos. You know the one. He's the guy, who lied about his high school. He lied about going to college. He lied about working on Wall Street. He lied about being Jewish. Tonight, more of his lies are being exposed, and you'll hear him in his own words, lie about his own mother's death. But first, let's start with the newly-released portions, of the January 6th transcripts. Let's bring in CNN's Sara Murray. Sara, what have you learned?",

It's, of course, interesting, because he's the former President's son.And, you mentioned, there was this text message that he sent to Mark Meadows, sort of laid out a plan, for Donald Trump, to stay in power that was pretty similar to what played out. So, congressional investigators ask him, \"Why did you send this text to Meadows?\" And, Don Jr. says, \"Look, this looks like a copy and paste job. I wasn't the real author.\" But he said, \"Perhaps in reading it, it was the sophisticated, you know, and detailed, about things I don't necessarily, know too much about, it sounded plausible, and I wanted to make sure that we were looking into the issues brought up in the text.\" And this was a text that Don Jr. had sent Mark Meadows, on November 5th. And in part of the text, at the time, it said \"We have operational control, Total leverage\" \"Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.\" There's more of that there, very similar to what actually played out. And again, CNN reported on this earlier, when we reported on the Meadows texts, Donald Trump Jr.'s lawyer said essentially the same thing that he said in that deposition that \"Look, Donald Trump, Jr. was not the author of this text,\" and all of a sudden they don't remember where it came from.",

She felt like he wasn't getting good advice. Here's part of what Stephanie Grisham said. \"There didn't seem to be anybody pushing back. And that was one of her concerns, at least push back, at least look at another side. And it didn't seem at that time that anybody - Mark Meadows included - who would have offered him other advice. She really was always the pragmatic, more realistic, 'give us the worst case scenario' type of person, and nobody did that for him.\" And Grisham said that Melania Trump had sort of soured on Donald Trump Jr.'s advice, Kimberly Guilfoyle's advice. Sidney Powell, and Rudy Giuliani, were other folks that she was very skeptical of. So, she sort of felt, again, according to Stephanie Grisham, like her husband, at that time, was not getting good advice, and not getting the kind of pushback, he should have gotten.",

I think that's one of the most plausible things that he's ever said. And so, maybe it did seem plausible to him. But one of the things that, really sticks out, in this is, when Melania Trump complains about the bad advice Trump was getting. Well, Trump had the advisers he wanted. He was listening to the people he wanted to listen to. There was no shortage of people, even in the White House, who would have told him that this made no sense, and was unconstitutional. As the January 6th committee has pointed out, lots of people had serious reservations, about all of this, even close to the President.

The Constitution doesn't say that the Speaker of the House has to be elected, doesn't have to come from the membership even.And so, we know that under the circumstances, McCarthy, who desires to become Speaker, is cutting, or prepared to cut, as many deals as he has to, to get the numbers. There are at least a dozen or more members of Congress, who have indicated they don't want to support him. So then the question becomes, what does he have to do to get the votes? Santos coming in will be one example. But he needs to pledge some sort of an agenda, to the more extremist elements of the Congress. If anything the Middle actions showed was, the country wants Congress to work. They want to get away from the fringes. They want to have some kind of bipartisan support, on key issues. They're obviously going to differ, on a multiple levels, and issues, but not the key issues, dealing with our security, our economy, our energy, et cetera. And so, I think the answer would be appoint someone, recommended by the Democrats, because this is something the Democrats could go to the Republicans, say, \"Look, we want to work with you. We're prepared to recommend and support a Republican, who would be someone, who could reach across the aisle,\" for the next two years, because everything will change in two years. \"For the next two years, can't we work together, to get some things done, before the 2024 elections come?\" That's the purpose of it, to say that, \"Can't we find a way?\" Yes, we can nominate someone that the Democrats can support, and five Republicans, by secret ballot, could also support, and you'd have a Speaker, who could work with both sides.",

And he responded by saying \"9/11 claimed my mother's life... so I'm blocking so I don't ever have to read this again.\" But just five months later, Santos said, \"December 23rd this year marks five years I lost my best friend and mentor. Mom, you will live forever in my heart.\" So, definitely, some discrepancies here. Now, of course, there are some first responders, who developed health conditions, and cancer, after 9/11.

That's in a different category than patting your resume. And when you're lying about your own mother's death? This is different - this is different than somebody, who's trying to just sort of make himself appear more qualified than he was.

And some of this was known to New York Democrats, in advance of the election. There is a lot of blame, I think, to go around, when we start taking stock of how this guy got elected, because some of it is just so unbelievably outrageous. His financial issues are also one part of the picture. It's not just that he - we have lots of questions about how he lent his own campaign, apparently, $600,000 to $700,000, which is, of course, a violation of campaign finance law. There's questions about where that money came from, and how it's possible that he was evicted from his home, just a year before, owing $10,000 in back rent, on an apartment that was apparently $2,500.

What I was told is that actually his campaign advisers, meaning Zimmerman's, did have some of this information. It was in a briefing book that came from the DNC. One of the issues was that A, they couldn't - they claimed that they could not get Long Island media, to cover it. But I think the bigger issue is that they believed that his implication - his association with the January 6th riots, he claimed - one of his many claims was that he was at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally, on the 6th, and that he financed the legal - he covered the legal bills, of some of the protesters, and rioters, who were charged with crimes. So, we'll see if any of those things are true. But the Democrats on Long Island that were supporting Zimmerman believed that that enough was - that was disqualifying enough. And they focused on that in the campaign, and ignored all of this other stuff that they actually did know, about his background. They apparently didn't check on his degrees. But they knew that his financial dealings were shady. There were questions about his work experience. So, this has exposed a huge problem, in New York State Democratic politics. He's not the only race that won. This is the worst of it. But Democrats suffered huge losses, across New York, and across Long Island.

Nothing, no one issue is disqualifying enough. If you got a lot, go for it.

But Kevin McCarthy has got a problem, not just with this guy, but he's got a major problem with George Santos. And I think that it's incumbent upon Republicans to speak out more than they're doing, right now. It seems to me that they'd really need to call for his resignation. Five years ago, five years ago, this year, I ran against a guy named Roy Moore. And Republicans, when all the issues came out, about Roy Moore, there were actually Republicans saying, \"I'm not sure we're going to seat him. I'm not sure he should be elected.\" Senator Shelby said, \"I'm not going to vote for him. I'm going to write in a good Republicans.\" Those days are over, Alisyn. We don't see that in the parties, these more - especially, with the Republican Party, where things are, right now. They need the vote. They need the gavel.

So, I take the Senator's point, about polarization, having increased. But I don't think that we're quite as far gone as that. And, I think, actually, the voters were pretty sensible, in a lot of respects and, are, making some distinctions. The problem here was not withstanding some local media, I just think most voters were not aware of the - of just how much deception there was, and how abnormal it was, right?

He'd been hospitalized, for the last month, with complications. He was 82-years-old.Players and fans, at a French league match honored him, with a standing ovation. And tributes are pouring in. Pele electrified crowds, playing in four World Cups, and the only soccer star in history to win three. His first World Cup was at the age of 17, in 1958. And he joined the Santos Futebol Clube, at 15, and went on to score more than 1,200 goals in his professional career. Pele was a literal national treasure. When European clubs tried to sign him, Brazil declared him a treasure, to keep him from playing elsewhere. And he knew he had a great gift. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I think if you read so much of what has been said about him, in these last few hours, there is this use of language that you just don't hear about other players. I saw one quote that was \"There is one player in the world. Who is the best player? I'd refuse to classify Pele as a player.\" He sort of transcended what had come before him.And the Brazilians have this term for how they play soccer. It's called \"Jogo Bonito,\" \"Played beautifully.\" And it really kind of began with him. He was able to conjure a way of playing the game that had been not seen before. And you have to remember that at this time, soccer was not really a sport that was televised, worldwide. And so, every four years, a lot of the world gathered to see what was going on, in other countries. And when you see the yellow and blue, of the Brazil jersey, of the Brazil kit, it just stuck out how incredible this player was. He, again, announced his arrival in the 1958 World Cup final. If you go back and watch the goals that he scored, they would stand the - they stand the test of time. They look like goals that will be scored now better than some of the goals that are scored now. It's kind of remarkable. Normally, when you see black-and-white footage, it doesn't hold up. But, for this player, it does.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Soccer is not really a game that's defined by athleticism as such. It's defined, as you say, by that skill, the ability to control, with every part of the body that is not the arm, right?So, incredible skill with his feet, incredible skill, controlling with his chest, with his head, with his thighs. Any means of controlling the soccer ball, he was well capable of doing so. And so, you see this player that just sort of transcended. That goal that I mentioned, the 1958 World Cup final, he sort of controls it off his chest, loops it over a defender, and you see almost all the defenders like, \"Wait, what just happened? What is going on here?\" And that was sort of the quality that he played with. And like you showed in that packages now, he sort of was aware of it. And most importantly, opponents were aware of it. If you go back, and look at his history, in the 1966 World Cup, in England, he was basically kicked out of the tournament. Not kicked out, because of a ban, but because opposition were intent on kicking him, because they did not allow him to play the beautiful game. He actually almost threatened to quit ahead of the 1970 World Cup, which Brazil won, because of how violently he was being treated by opponents. Everyone was sort of aware of this unstoppable skill.",
