      "sentences": "And I'm Jake Tapper.A little over an hour from now, the nation's highest court will review this landmark case. The division by Colorado's Supreme Court to disqualify former President Trump from the state's 2024 ballot based on what some call the insurrectionist ban in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Today, the nine justices, three of them nominated by Trump, are poised to have the most direct impact on a presidential election since the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore nearly a quarter sentry ago. Now, among the questions before the highest court in the land today, did Trump incite an insurrection on January 6th as Colorado's courts, including the state supreme court, determined he did? Does the rarely invoked insurrectionist ban apply to a president, to any president? And if so, should Trump then be barred from the presidential ballot, not only in Colorado but potentially in states across the country? We're going to begin today at the U.S. Supreme Court, just steps away from the U.S. Capitol, where that January 6th riot played out. CNN's senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic is there. Joan, set the scene for us on the gravity of this case and the stakes for the United States of America.",

And you cannot overstate the weight of this because this case could determine who is the next president of the United States. What it will come down to, is Donald Trump going to remain on the Colorado ballot and on ballots across the country, which will determine who our next president will be likely.So, what will I be watching for when I finally get to cross the threshold here? Two categories of things. The issues. How -- the justices are taking on a wide array of questions here, as you and Kaitlan just laid them out. And, typically, they already start with a particular question presented. They didn't this time. They opened it all up. So, we are going have to hear, for the first time, where do they put their focus? If they put their focus on discreet words like \"officer of the United States,\" or \"hold\" versus \"for running for office,\" we will know that they might not even get to whether Donald Trump engaged in an insurrection. If they go narrowly during their questioning toward these kind of discreet issues, this would favor Donald Trump. If they start asking more questions about January 6th, more questions about what constitutes an insurrection under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, that will favor the Colorado voters because the lawyer for Colorado, Jason Murray, is really going to try to keep the focus on this. I'll be watching also Chief Justice John Roberts, at the center of the bench, the strategic center, who will probably try to steer his colleagues towards some potential options and we'll know whether he has any takers by the questions we hear from his colleagues.

I actually do not think, as Joan said, the justices are going to focus much on this. Of course, Colorado found that he did. Trump maintains he did not. But that's a fact issue, Jake. The Supreme Court is not a trial court. They don't usually make factual determinations.Instead, I expect them to be looking at the specific legal issues. First of all, who decides whether and how the 14th Amendment applies? Is it Congress, as Donald Trump will argue, it has to be Congress, or is it up to the states? And then the third main issue that I think we're going to see is, does the president even count under the 14th Amendment? The 14th Amendment actually does not specifically list the president, but it does say that it applies to a, quote, \"officer of the United States.\" So, we're going to hear a lot of back and forth about whether the president counts as a, quote, \"officer of the United States.\" Those are three big issues to watch for.",

If the court tries to wade into these waters of whether he engaged in an insurrection, that would be a very telling moment in American history. You already have a Colorado Supreme Court and a Colorado district court talking about this. You had an impeachment process about this very thing. But you don't have a criminal charge against Trump for insurrection. You don't have four - of the cases - or the cases that are -- Jack Smith is looking at right now a part of it.

Do we see Justice Kagan trying to pick up on questions asked by Chief Justice Roberts or Justice Kavanaugh? Do we see Justice Gorsuch try to pick up on questions asked by Justice Sotomayor?

But here the legal off ramps aren't particularly strong. They -- the - the argument that the president isn't an officer of the United States is not particularly strong, nor is the argument that the 14th Amendment cannot be enforced without a act of Congress. And so I think the court may find itself in the uncomfortable position of focusing on the words \"engage in an insurrection.\"I don't think there's any question that this is an insurrection because an insurrection is basically any use of force against the government to prevent it from exercising its authority or doing its business. But the question is, what does it take to engage? Is incitement engagement? Did Donald Trump incite? These are questions they don't really want to get into because they're factual.

You had conservative appointees of President Nixon, who was the person at issue in that case. You had the, you know, lions of the liberal Warren court. And they found a way to reach a unanimous decision, which was so important to having it accepted by both halves of the country. President Nixon himself, right, there was some discussion that they might defy a decision that was 5-3 with one justice recused. So, Jake, I think part of what's going on here is, the reason whywe're fixated on, are there coalitions, is there a possibility of consensus, is because I think that Kasey's exactly right, a 5-4 ruling here is not going to help anybody. But is there some way, do we get some clue from today's oral argument that maybe there's some kind of compromise, much like the court reached in the Watergate tapes case that get the court all together.",

And that will be so important here.And what I'm listening for specifically as well though is, this is about Colorado, that's true, but you know there are 50 states who are leaning in to figure out, if this court says they can take him off the ballot, well, there's a lot of hands that are going to raise all of a sudden and try to use plaintiff actions to sue to get him off the ballot.

Now, there's also the fact that this is different. This is the SupremeCourt. Though I will note that the D.C. Circuit is just one rung down and he still showed up to those arguments. He understands, the sources tells me, that the stakes are high. There's really no upside to him showing up today.
