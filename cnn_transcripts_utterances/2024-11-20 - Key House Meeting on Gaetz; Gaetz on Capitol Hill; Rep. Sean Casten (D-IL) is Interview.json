We are told that they are going to have a slew of meetings, having conversations with senators. Obviously, the fact that two colleagues are up here today with Gaetz says a lot about potentially the relationships that those two men have in the Senate, the depth of those relationships, and the kind of argument that they may be able to make to their colleagues about why they think Gaetz should have this job. Now, we also know that the House Ethics Committee, across the Capitol, is going to be meeting today, and we expect that they are going to have some discussions about how to proceed on this ethics report into Matt Gaetz. We do not know whether they will vote to release this report. We don't know if they will have a vote today to release this report.

SEAN CASTEN (D-IL): Thank you. This letter could not be more important, and the issue couldn't be more important. We have the entire country in the world looking at the United States and saying, are you a country of laws? Are you a country of equal protection of the law? And they're asking those questions because the incoming president of the United States is a convicted felon. The incoming president of the United States is currently challenging almost $200 million in civil penalties, including one for an adjudicated rape. We in Congress have an obligation to say we are a country of laws, and that has come to a crux in the question of, are we going to allow the attorney general, the enforcer of our laws in the country, to get a pass into the Senate without even acknowledging that he is currently under an Ethics investigation specifically for trafficking young women across state lines, allegedly, and statutory rape of a minor. These are -- these are really important questions. The Ethics Committee has that report. They have taken witness testimony.

So this is not violating a precedent.But largely, the precedent that's here, let's be very clear, is that someone charged with statutory rape and trafficking a minor across state lines has been nominated for Attorney General.

And it's very possible that the family and many friends of Laken Riley, who have attended every day of court, will find out the fate of the man that stands accused of her murder. Jose Ibarra's defense team, Sara, has said that they only needed abouthalf a day to present their testimony, and that's what actually happened. And let's remember, this is a bench trial. As you mentioned before, not a trial by jury, which means many of the normal procedures don't apply and won't delay the trial because it's ultimately the judge who will decide whether the defendant is guilty or not. Among the most compelling evidence presented here in court yesterday was a college security camera video showing Laken Riley's last run the morning of February 22nd, before she was murdered. The video also showed Jose Ibarra, the defendant, lurking near the crime scene. We also heard testimony about frantic texts and missed calls from Laken Riley's mother that the prosecution used to illustrate a timeline. And, in what's perhaps the most damning piece of evidence, a forensic expert testified how Ibarra's DNA was found under Riley's fingernails.
