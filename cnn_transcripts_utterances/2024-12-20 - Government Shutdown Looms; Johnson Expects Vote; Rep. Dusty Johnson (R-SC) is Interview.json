Vance and Russ Vought, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget. What they're trying to do is to break the ice on the breakdown that has occurred among Republicans over how to avoid a government shutdown tonight. Conservatives voted against the Republican plan last night, in big part because Donald Trump added into the mix a new ask, suspending the federal debt limit for another two years as part of this deal. That's been a no-go for a long time among conservative Republicans. So, this morning, the president-elect is also putting out more of his thoughts. This just in the last hour, saying on social media, that if the government is going to shut down, do it now under the Biden administration, while Joe Biden's still in the White House.

That meeting is breaking up behind me. As you can see, lawmakers are leaving.And one of them came out and said they think that Republicans could vote as early as 10:00 a.m. this morning. But the question is, on what are they going to be voting on? Because Republicans clearly still do not have consensus on what specifically to do about debt limit suspension. That wasn't a part of the government funding conversation for weeks until Donald Trump and Elon Musk inserted it. And then Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team put a new plan on the floor. Last night we saw 38 Republicans vote against it. And they're going to need a lot of Democrats to get on board to get this to pass before government funding runs out tonight. Last night we didn't see nearly - we only saw two Democrats support it. Not nearly enough. So there's a lot of discussion about what could happen - what they could put on the floor today that could maybe get more Democratic consensus. And, you know, it's - there's no question of just the role that Donald Trump has played here, looming large over all of this. Listen to one senator, what he thinks the president should do. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I think one of the ways that this could get fixed fairly quickly would be if President Trump would come up to Washington tomorrow or spend the weekend here and talk to people face to face.

So, that's the - as I said, the reality that he is well aware of, which is different from what Elon Musk sees, what Donald Trump sees, what they are trying to play here. And what this has done, and I'm not really sure, Sara, if Donald Trump realized that this would be a consequence. But what that vote last night did is expose, even before Donald Trump is in the White House, that he doesn't have the grip on the house Republican conference that he thought he did. Thirty-eight Republicans openly defied him. They'd said, no, we're not going to support this package that you support for lots of reasons, primarily because he wants to increase the debt ceiling, and that's anathema to so many of his fellow Republicans who serve in the House. And so, politically, again, this has done, I think a little bit of damage, not permanent damage. He's very popular. He is, you know, going to have a lot of capital when he comes in.

And this has exposed that reality and really should have made it hit home to Donald Trump.And it's also a reminder, Sara, that a lot of the basis for the Trump coalition started with the Tea Party. Remember the Tea Party back in - coming into the 2010 election. That was based on too much government spending. And a lot of the people who supported the Tea Party and became Tea Party members were angry at another fellow Republican, George W. Bush, for spending too much. And so that sensibility is still very much a driver, a main point of philosophy for some, if not all of the 38 Republicans who said, no, Mr. President-elect, even though you say you support raising the debt ceiling, we're not going to do it because we don't think that's the right thing to do.",

They have never gone along with it. They do not like it. No matter your feelings about it, you should know that they know -- you know that that's their position. So if it's not, if you're not -- if government funding is not going to lapse, it seems the options might be cut a deal with the right flank of the party, the holdouts, and strip out any debt ceiling increase, which goes directly against the president-elect, or go back to the table with Democrats that might include a debt ceiling increase, but then you really definitely lose those Republicans and maybe some more, which sounds more likely right now?",
