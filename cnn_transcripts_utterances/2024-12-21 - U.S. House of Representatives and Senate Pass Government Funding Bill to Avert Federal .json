Federal workers will be getting their paychecks after a late-night vote in the U.S. Senate averting a U.S. government shutdown. Just moments after the deadline passed at midnight, the Senate approved a bill to keep the government funded through mid-March. The House had approved the bill just hours earlier, ending a week of last-minute wrangling between Republicans, Democrats, and President-elect Donald Trump. President Biden is expected to sign the bill at any moment. CNN's Betsy Klein is at the White House. Betsy, good morning to you. So, all right, what do people have to say from the White House to Capitol Hill about this late night save?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fredricka, I think what's a holiday season without a little bit of holiday spending drama on Capitol Hill? But a shutdown has been averted as the House voted overwhelmingly just a few hours before that midnight deadline to fund the government, and the Senate following suit just a few hours later. It now goes to President Biden's desk, where we do expect him to sign that any moment now. But it really came after a lot of drama and handwringing on the Hill after President-elect Trump said he did not support the bill and, frankly, threatened Republicans who voted for it with primary challenges.But let's talk about what's in it. It has funding. It's what's called a stopgap funding through March. That means that lawmakers under Trump's watch will have to do this all over again in just a few short months. It has $100 billion in funding for disaster relief for those still recovering from those devastating storms and wildfires across the country. It also includes $10 billion in aid for American farmers. But lawmakers on both sides of the aisle feel like they have taken a victory lap, and it's also -- what's important is what's not in it. And that's what got Democrats to say yes. And that is a debt ceiling suspension. That was something Trump had called for but did not come through in the final iteration of this bill. Trump telling one GOP lawmaker he is frustrated but resigned to that outcome, Fredricka.",

So we'll be watching that quite carefully.But looking at the big picture, Fredricka, so much averted by this government funding deal, including those shutdown related holiday delays at airports across the country that were expected. Museums and national parks will stay open. And so, critically, for the 1.4 million federal workers who were expected to work without pay, so many of them living and working across the country far from Washington's drama, will have a little bit of a reprieve and get their paychecks, Fredricka.",

And he was telling lawmakers that he really wanted them to fight for getting the debt ceiling extension part of this package. He wanted to see, in fact, the debt ceiling go away entirely and had encouraged Democrats to get on board with that idea. And in fact, Republicans, and it was his own Republican Party that wouldn't go along with it. And ultimately, 38 Republicans voted on Thursday against a bill that would have extended the debt ceiling through 2027.So Trump, frustrated by the process, but ultimately came to the conclusion yesterday when talking with advisers and allies on Capitol Hill that a shutdown would have been inevitable if he would have really put his foot down for this and forced Republicans and Congress to get behind this plan, and ultimately went along with what passed yesterday. [10:05:08] And we also saw a bit of face saving from one of the other co-allies in forcing this drama, Elon Musk. If you look back to what he posted on social media on Wednesday, he said no bills should be passed by Congress until January 20th when Donald Trump takes office. Well, on Friday, as this unfolded and the House was inching closer to a vote to fund the government through March, Musk posted, quote, \"The Speaker did a good job here given the circumstances. It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces. The bill should now be in the Democrats' court.\" So clearly attempting to put a positive spin on an otherwise episode where Donald Trump and Elon Musk threw a real big wrench in this process that had been buttoned up for several weeks now.",

You look at, as well, Matt Gaetz losing his -- stepping away from his nomination for attorney general. That was a major blow to Trump, who views the leader of the Justice Department as his most important pick in the cabinet. And now he will be forced to turn to a fallback.And even just this last week, Donald Trump appeared to abandon an effort to get his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, appointed to the U.S. Senate to replace Marco Rubio in Florida. Well, the governor there was quietly telling him behind the scenes that he wasn't going to go along with that plan, sources told CNN, and therefore, he had to back away from it.

But, like, that should be the floor, not the ceiling. Or maybe I said that the other way around. I think most Americans are really frustrated with the process. Like, guys, you have one job. It's keeping the government open.There are so many things that Americans want to see more, actually bipartisan movement on and resolution on everything from climate change issues to A.I. regulation. And when the huge, huge conundrum is, can we find any way to keep the government open over the holidays so that air traffic controllers aren't working unpaid and there aren't problems with the transition of the inauguration, like, that's a pretty low bar. So I think in this case, the reason that there almost was a shutdown was primarily triggered by the president-elect and some of his external allies like Elon Musk. There's plenty of blame to go around for both parties, but in this case, I think the president-elect is going to have to decide, does he want smooth governance and no drama in Congress so he can focus on his priorities? Or does he want to try to do everything at once with the potential to really blow things up and grind things to a halt? I think Americans are just like they don't, most Americans don't understand the inner workings of the debt ceiling or the shutdown, and don't think that they should have to. They elect people to Congress to keep things running smoothly. And then every year, right before the holidays, everybody has to watch the spectacle unfold. And then it miraculously gets resolved when everybody realizes that it has to get resolved. And that's what's happened again.",

We've seen no real stressed out travelers just yet. I spoke to someone just a short while ago who told me that all of the stress and sort of the chaos around traveling at this time is worthwhile because he knows at the end he'll be getting home to his family, his grandchildren, who are all excited to see him. So it is worth it to him. But as you mentioned, this is expected to be a record-breaking year. More than 40 million people are expected to travel from the 19th, so two days ago, all the way through the new year on January 2nd, when people will be heading back to home and back to work. And the majority of those people, Fred, will be driving, at least 107 million of them. That's according to AAA. But people also will be taking to the skies to get to wherever they're going, at least 7.8 million people expected to travel. And actually, that gentleman I spoke to a short while ago told me that he actually opted to fly because he felt there were too many variables when it came to driving, too many, too much potential for error and getting delayed and getting stuck. So he decided to fly. He's only going a short distance from New York to North Carolina, so he figured that was the better way to go. He's doing it today, Saturday, actually much better than Sunday, or, say, next Monday when people will be rushing to make Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. So if you are planning to travel today, it might actually be the best day to do it. Pack your patience. Pack your Christmas joy.

And you can see the one in the east, this is mostly going to be a snow event. You can see we've still got some snow in portions of Maine, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, areas of Connecticut. Now the heavy snow that was in and around New York has now since started to make its way back out over the water. But we do have a lot of lake effect snow impacting Buffalo, Rochester, even around Binghamton because of the Finger Lakes. So you're likely to see some travel impacts there, especially in the air for places like Cleveland and Syracuse, but also New York, not necessarily for the snow, because that is over, but really the wind. They have sustained winds of 20 to 35 miles per hour, gusting even higher than that. We know it doesn't take much for wind to cause some delays at some of these airports. Also, look at the snow that's already come down in several of these areas. New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey all looking at at least four to seven inches of snow. Now, I note, I'm very aware people in these states know how to drive in this. Keep in mind, though, you have people traveling from Florida, Texas, other southern states to these areas that do not know how to drive in these conditions, so that in turn could end up causing some travel snafus. So do keep that in mind to give yourself some extra time. When that snow comes down. It's not going anywhere for a while. New York is going to remain below average for at least the next several days before those temperatures rebound. Other areas may start to see the rebound as early as Monday. But New York, for example, look at this. You're not going to get back to average until the very end of the upcoming week. So a very bitter cold start to the upcoming week. Out to the west. The opposite. Most of these areas are 10 to 20 degrees above average. So if you are planning to head to, say, southern California, portions of Arizona, you're not only going to get sunshine, you're going to get some nice warm temperatures into the mix.

And one of the things that the authorities say they're grappling with right now, or trying to find out, is what exactly this man's motivation could be. The German interior minister came out and said that they were, that he was an Islamophobe. However, so far the authorities have done very little to explain what exactly that means and what exactly the motivations might be. Of course, at this point in time, this man no doubt will be being interrogated. One of the interesting things that we picked up on is that there was a lot of carnage caused in this ramming incident, but apparently it went down in a very quick period of time. The authorities are saying that the first 911 call that they got was around two minutes past 7:00 p.m., and that they had the man in custody by five minutes past 7:00 p.m. So a very short time to cause a lot of damage, Fredricka.",

But again, they're still finding in Syrian intelligence buildings of prisoners, folks who have still not been freed. So I think that search is going to go on.The longer it takes, however, without finding Austin Tice, I think the greater the chances that he will not be found.",

Now, it's unclear how long this strike will last, but Amazon says holiday deliveries won't be disrupted.But there's another strike underway at Starbucks. Workers striking in three major metro areas Chicago, L.A., and Seattle. The Workers United union says they will expand to more locations by December 24th. There are more than 500 unionized Starbucks stores, and the two sides have been negotiating for months. But the union says they had asked for an agreement by the end of this year, but the company's offer fell short. Starbucks says the strike has caused small disruptions, and according to a source familiar with the impact, 10 stores out of 10,000 did not open as planned. The holidays are a very profitable time for both Amazon and Starbucks, and the unions know that. So while the companies deny any sizable impact, the strikes may raise awareness among consumers about the issues that these workers are fighting for. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

On Christmas Eve, one lottery ticket holder could be celebrating with a mega-millions jackpot just shy of $1 billion. Boy, that would be a Christmas delight, right? No one won last night, so the grand prize in Tuesday's mega millions drawing ballooned to $944 million. That's the largest prize ever offered in the month of December. But if the winner chooses to take the jackpot all at once, the take home portion won't be as large. It will shrink to a mere $429 million. Good luck anyway.

And the Notre Dame players, they sent a message from the start. They went out for warmups not wearing any shirts, saying that those frigid temperatures were not going to bother them one bit.And despite being less than 200 miles apart, this is actually the first matchup between these two schools since 1991. It was dominated by Notre Dame. The teams traded interceptions early, and then it was Jeremiyah Love, the play of the game, a 98-yard touchdown run just sent the whole stadium into a frenzy. That run tied a school record, and the Irish would end up winning that one easily, 27-17, to get their first ever playoff victory. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
