Gaetz has denied all of the allegations, calling this probe a witch-hunt. Let's get the latest from CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "This came as a major surprise, the decision by the House Ethics Committee to essentially reversed a decision it made in November to release the findings of this bipartisan yearslong investigation into allegations of misconduct involving Matt Gaetz, a former Florida congressman, someone who was picked as Donald Trump's choice initially to be attorney general of the United States.When he was made -- when Trump made that selection, that's when Gaetz abruptly resigned from the House. And that put the committee in a bit of a pickle. What do they do with this investigation? Well, the speaker of the House had said -- he said that former members should not see Ethics reports released. And that's one big reason why the House Ethics Committee back in November decided not to release this report. It said as a final -- he is no longer a member of Congress, they should let it go. But there was a reversal that occurred. Perhaps one reason why, some of the members said the report at the time of November was not completely done yet. It was completed by the time they met in December and that's when they privately voted to release it. And our reporting suggests that perhaps some Republicans supported this effort with Democrats to release this report. Now, in the aftermath of our breaking this news this morning, Matt Gaetz put out a statement saying that -- talking -- saying that he has been exonerated by the Justice Department, which had investigated some of these allegations as well, but also saying this. He said: \"My 30s were an era of working very hard and playing hard too. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank, and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\" He also went on to deny that he had any sexual encounters with anyone under the age of 18. We know that's been an issue which this committee has investigated. So, ultimately, we will get a sense of what this report is when it is released. The timing is a bit unclear. What we know from our reporting is that they voted to release this after the final day of votes in this congressional session. It's unclear when that will be could be. Could be as early as tonight if they finish work in the House or maybe later in the week. That's something we will have to watch in the days ahead. But one thing is clear. Matt Gaetz has long maintained icy relations with many Republicans on Capitol Hill, in large part stemming from his effort to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House, which was successful last year, which angered Republicans, sent them into a period of disarray, a lot of finger-pointing, a lot of anger directed back at Matt Gaetz. We will see ultimately if that was one of the reasons why for this change of course, but a significant development, nonetheless, of a player in GOP politics and someone who still has the ear of Donald Trump.

Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\" He went on to say what he did there about: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated, even some I never dated, but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. I never had sexual contact with someone under 18. Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court, which is why no such claim was ever made in court.

      "sentences": "Boris and Brianna, another interest rate cut from the Fed looks imminent. The market is widely expecting a quarter- point cut today.Now, this would be the third straight interest rate cut from the Fed. And it would mean that interest rates have come down by a full percentage point since September. The market is pricing this in at this point. So the Fed almost has to cut rates, because, if they don't, they would risk unnerving investors, and they don't want to do that. Now, the fact that borrowing costs have come down, of course, is good news for consumers. Everyone who's trying to pay off credit card debt or get a mortgage or a car loan, they should catch a bit of a break. But the real key today is what the Fed signals about the road ahead, because officials are set to issue new projections. And the thinking is that the Fed is going to signal fewer interest rate cuts in 2025. Now, back in September, the Fed was penciling in four rate cuts for next year. Now the Fed could be signaling three cuts or even two. And in some ways, it is an awkward time for the Fed to be cutting. It's not like the economy needs to be rescued. The unemployment rate has come up, but it's still pretty low. Economy is growing at a solid pace. And the war on inflation has stalled a bit in recent months. There's also just so much uncertainty about the Trump agenda, whether or not tariffs will go sharply higher and other countries retaliate. What will that do to prices? And whether or not there's going to be mass deportations. That could cause a shortage of workers and also lift prices. We have also heard from a number of former Fed officials in recent days, who've said that they don't think the Fed should be cutting right now. So, for all those reasons, it is possible that today's very likely interest rate cut could be the last one we see for a bit. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Rates are coming down, but they're coming in very, very slowly. So credit card interest rates, for example, remain extraordinarily high, 23, 24 percent.

And I think UnitedHealthcare, which is obviously in the news and under a lot of pressure, is the main contributor for the weakness in the Dow. So I wouldn't read too much into it.
