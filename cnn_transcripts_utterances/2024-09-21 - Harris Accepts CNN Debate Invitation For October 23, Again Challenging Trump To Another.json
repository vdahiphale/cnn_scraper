      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Saturday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, we begin this hour with our breaking news. Vice President Kamala Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN to debate former President Trump on October 23rd. This would be their second meeting on a public debate stage and would take place in the final few weeks of the campaign. After initially rejecting a second debate with Harris following his September 10th showdown -- with her in Philadelphia last week, Trump suggested he might be open to another debate, saying, I'm quoting him, \"Maybe if I got in the right mood,\" end quote. The CNN debate would mirror the June debate between Biden and Trump with a similar format, in which Trump, and this time Harris, would field moderators' questions for 90 minutes without a live studio audience, and it would take place at the network's studios in Atlanta. We've got a team of correspondents and analysts joining us to break it all down. Let's get to Brian Stelter, our chief media analyst, in a moment. But first, let's begin with Steve Contorno at a Trump rally in North Carolina. So, Steve, any word whether Trump has heard that Harris has accepted CNN's invitation and if he's willing to follow suit?",

We are monitoring his Truth Social minute by minute. He will address this crowd behind me in about an hour, so we'll see if he perhaps make some news when he gets on this stage. He has gone back and forth over whether or not he wants to have another debate. At first, he said that he would accept multiple debates with Vice President Harris immediately. After that debate, though, he said there won't be a third debate. And then a week later, he has another appearance where he said that, you know, if I was in the right mood, but we don't know what that means exactly for him.So we will be watching closely to see whether or not Donald Trump makes some news today and announces whether or not he will be participating in our debate. Right now, though, we have not heard from the campaign.",

And I think we can all agree that that is the case. Think about the two debates we've seen so far this year. Both were hugely successful in terms of informing the American people.We learned a lot about Biden and Trump in June, and we learned a lot about Trump and Harris just a few weeks ago. So, here now we look forward to the next few weeks. The only debate currently scheduled is the vice presidential debate. That's between Walz and J.D. Vance, Tim Walz and J.D. Vance, October 1st. We knew the Harris campaign didn't want to debate again until the VP debate. But I think here's the interesting thing, Fred, is the VP debate really going to be the last word? It probably shouldn't be the last word. Historically, it never has been. Historically, there's been a VP debate and then another presidential debate. So I think that might be the logic or the calculus that does that play here. I think that might be the logic or the calculus that does that play here as CNN formally proposes this debate and as Harris accepts it. Furthermore, Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Harris campaign chair, as she said in a statement a few minutes ago, it would be unprecedented in modern history for there to just be one general election debate between the two candidates. She said Trump should have no problem participating because, quote, \"it's the same format and setup\" --",

He still cares deeply today about television ratings. And he knows that both of the debates he's been in this year have been huge smash successes.

In terms of Trump, because as you and Brian were just saying, she laid down the gauntlet first, it'll be hard for him to turn it down and not seem like he's shying away from it. And he, too, would like that opportunity to talk to millions of people. So I don't expect that there will be a problem actually getting this thing off the ground. I think that there's opportunity for Harris, but also peril, right? She already won the first debate handily. She passed that threshold test of beating a former president one on one.Now you have to assume that Trump's staff is going to make him buckle down and prepare much better.

Look, I've been on air enough times with you, Fred, to know that you anchors like people to answer the questions they're asked.Harris was smart. When she didn't like a question, she answered the question she wanted to answer. Trump, on the other hand, stayed on topics that didn't favor him. He knows whether he'll admit it or not that he did poorly. And so now I think what's in it for him to answer your original question is to show that he can be at least as good, if not better than Vice President Harris. Ultimately, though, let's remind ourselves and your viewers, the goal is to win the election. There's no trophy for debating. This isn't the debate society.

If he were to do that, if that's the case, then you can imagine him really cooking himself politically, even beyond what's already happened.Let's remember about the dynamics here where I am in North Carolina. It's neck and neck between Trump and Harris. That was the case before this story. That's the case after it's less than a point difference between them in the polling averages. In terms of the governor's race, there was already a wide margin. Attorney General Josh Stein, the Democrat, was already up by high single digits. Before this story, he's up by high single digits now. So this does -- it's a disaster for the Robinson campaign, but this really doesn't fundamentally change the race here in this state.",

And President Biden is gathering the leaders of Australia, India and Japan here in his home state of Delaware, really trying to put a final imprint on this alliance that has been central to his strategy in the Indo-Pacific.The president is hosting each of the leaders at his home for a personal meeting. He is currently sitting down right now with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi before having them gathered here at Archway Academy a bit later this afternoon. This is actually where President Biden went to high school himself. So he's trying to put these personal touches on this summit. Now, it comes at a time when the presidents really trying to burnish his foreign policy legacy in these final months that he is in office. One thing that is expected to be high on the agenda for these leaders today is discussions about China, and also, they're aggressive moves within the South China Sea. Now, White House officials contends that this alliance, this summit is not focused on any one country. But the issue of China is expected to come up throughout. We are also expecting the four leaders to make some significant announcements in the Indo-Pacific region. That will include the first ever Coast Guard missions with all four countries. The U.S. will actually host that first mission, inviting the members of the Coast Guard from the other countries on board for a period of time. Those types of missions will rotate as a case-by-case basis. They also will be making new announcements on trying to ramp up and preposition resources to respond in humanitarian and disaster relief operations. And then there's a very personal element of this for President Biden being announced today. The four leaders will announce a new collaboration called the Quad Cancer Moonshot. The Cancer Moonshot is a domestic initiative they have here at home that Biden actually started back when he was vice president to try to eradicate cancer around the world. The president and these other three leaders will be teaming up, making some new announcements to try to lower cervical cancer rates within the Indo-Pacific. So that is just one of the elements being announced today. A very personal element for President Biden himself. But really this is just another instance where the president is trying to map out his final months in office, map out how he can continue to make a forum in policy imprint even as he is preparing to hand off to the next administration.",

As of Friday, the city of Springfield has received more than 35 threats of violence, including bomb threats stemming from false statements made by former President Donald Trump during the September 10th debate. This is according to Springfield Mayor Rob Rue. Those threats have prompted evacuations of elementary schools and supermarkets, lockdowns of hospitals, and transition to remote learning at several local colleges. Now, as you said, Fred, two of those colleges have announced that they plan to resume in-person learning this coming Monday after classes were held remotely as law enforcement investigated threats to their campuses. Clark State College closed its campuses and moved to virtual learning last week. Wittenberg University canceled in-person classes since Monday after receiving two emails last weekend, including one containing a bomb threat. As you can imagine, the levels of fear and anxiety are very high, especially in the Haitian immigrant community. As one of its leaders told us this morning.
