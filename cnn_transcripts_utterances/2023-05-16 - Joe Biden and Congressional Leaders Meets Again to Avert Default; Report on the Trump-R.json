John Durham criticized the agency and concluded the FBI should never have launched a full-blown investigation into connections between Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. But the report failed to fulfill the former president's expectations that it would say he was the victim of a political witch-hunt. CNN's Evan Perez has all the details from Washington.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. U.S. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Special counsel John Durham released his final report casting doubt about the FBI's decision to launch a full investigation into connections between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. The 300- plus page report sharply criticized the FBI and the Justice Department throughout, but does not recommend any new charges against anyone or any wholesale changes to the way politically sensitive investigations are being handled. Well, the report falls well short of expectations that were set by former President Trump and his allies, who have long claimed that it would prove that the FBI's investigation was a political witch hunt. Nonetheless, Donald Trump claimed vindication, posting on his social media platform that it was evidence of a scam. Durham's report finds many mistakes by the FBI, including what he calls confirmation bias. He concludes that the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia. Republicans in Congress have already called for Durham to come up to the Capitol for a hearing to discuss more about his investigation. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And that's probably why we didn't see Merrick Garland. He didn't make any changes. He didn't make any redactions. He just released this report.

The Democratic representative Gerry Connolly told CNN that the attack happened at his district office in Northern Virginia. He says the suspect entered the building and assaulted a senior aide as well as an intern on her first day on the job. Both staff members were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police arrested a 49-year-old man, but they have not determined a motive.

He was engaged in an altercation, apparently, with the police and had to be tasered, and one of the police had a minor injury in the course of trying to subdue it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They call it the Nakba, or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands were forced to flee their homes once Israel was founded in 1948.Thousands of Palestinians marched in the West Bank Monday, demanding recognition of their right to return. And this year, for the first time, the U.N. officially commemorated the day at its headquarters in New York. The Nakba anniversary comes just days after fighting between Israel and Islamic Jihad killed 33 Palestinians in Gaza as well as two people in Israel last week. And for more, let's go to CNN's Ben Wedeman who joins us live from Gaza City. So Ben, what more can you tell us about this somber anniversary for Palestinians? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Rosemary, for the people of Gaza, the Nakba never really ended. Behind the headlines, there are ordinary people who continue to suffer from the catastrophe that is this conflict. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WEDEMAN (voice-over): Another father in Gaza has lost a son. As always happens here when calm returns, mourners come to pay respects for those who are killed. But 34-year-old Abdullah Hasnain wasn't killed in an Israeli airstrike. Rather shrapnel from a missile fired by Islamic Jihad from his native Gaza into Israel ripped through his chest and abdomen. Abdullah was one of around 18,000 Gazans to receive a permit to work in Israel. His father, Jibril, also working in Israel, rushed to the hospital. It was too late. Human kindness triumphed over the passions of war. I found it made no difference to the doctors if we were Arabs or Jews, recalls Jibril. I asked them to help me with the procedures to take my son home and bury him. And they did. Abdullah leaves behind a wife, four daughters and two sons. His children, his family, a whole family of seven people is now destitute, a relative Mohammed tells me. These Bedouins are pious people. They prefer not to place blame. Abdullah's death, they say, was God's will. A spokesman for Islamic Jihad denied any responsibility. A short drive away, residents survey the ruins of a large house bombed by Israeli aircraft. Inspectors from the Ministry of Public Works gather information on the destruction. (on-camera): The neighbors say it wasn't a secret. This building belonged to somebody who was in Islamic Jihad's missile unit. The building was destroyed on Friday evening. In the process, however, all the homes in this area were severely damaged.

The longtime leader fell just short of topping the 50 percent threshold needed to win re- election outright in Sunday's vote. The leading opposition candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, is vowing to fight until the end. He represents a coalition of six political parties and is promising to move Turkey in a more secular direction if elected. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Supporters of Recep Tayyip Erdogan took to the streets of Istanbul. First, a show of solidarity with their leader, facing the toughest election of his 20 years in office. That soon turned into a celebration. For his diehard supporters, there is one man, one cause and one Turkey, that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And in the early hours of Monday morning, Erdogan doing what he does best, rallying his supporters. In the capital Ankara, their man emerged to address his voters from the balcony of his ruling party's headquarters, where he traditionally delivers his rousing victory speeches. This is no victory for the Turkish president, but certainly a win for now. He failed to secure the 50 percent plus one vote majority to clinch a third term, but emerged with a clear lead over the main opposition candidate. RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENT (through translator): Currently, the majority in parliament is in our people's alliance. Therefore, we do not doubt that the choice of our nation, which gave the majority in the parliament to our alliance, will be in favor of trust and stability in the presidential election. KARADSHEH (voice-over): And the wind is behind Erdogan as Turkey now heads for a runoff. But the opposition insisting, they still can do this. KEMAL KILICDAROGLU, TURKISH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): I am here, I am here. You are here, too. I will fight until the end. I swear. And I know I will fight until the end. I am here. KARADSHEH (voice-over): A diverse opposition, more united and more galvanized than ever, thought this time would be different. They believed they could unseat Erdogan, that they could deliver change and deliver the promise of a return to a real democracy, a promise so many in this country so desperately wanted. In two weeks' time, Erdogan and opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu will face off again. And this man, Sinan Ogan, could be the tiebreaker. SINAN OGAN, TURKISH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (through translator): We have certain red lines, such as fighting against terrorism and sending refugees back. We have voiced these conditions before. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Ogan's 5 percent of the electorate is a combination of disenchanted nationalists and protest votes of those who didn't like the opposition's choice of candidate, but irked enough about Erdogan to deny him their support, at least in the first round. No election in this country's history has meant more for this divided nation, where the two competing visions of Turkey are locked in a duel. And it will be the Turkish people who will ultimately decide which leader and which vision will prevail. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, Istanbul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
