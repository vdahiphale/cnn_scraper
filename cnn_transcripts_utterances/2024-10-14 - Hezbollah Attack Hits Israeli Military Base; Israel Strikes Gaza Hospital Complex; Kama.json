      "sentences": "Hello, and thanks so much for joining me tonight, I'm Erica Hill in for Isa Soares. Tonight, a deadly droneattack by Hezbollah hits an Israeli military base. And the U.S. announces it is sending one of its most powerful anti-missile systems to the country. Plus, Israeli strikes at a Gaza hospital complex engulfing tents in flames as the U.N. warns the IDF appears to be cutting off within Gaza. And a new CNN poll of polls shows the U.S. presidential race too close to call as Kamala Harris prepares to sit down for her first interview with \"Fox News\". We begin this hour with the deadly violence across the Israel-Lebanon border as both the IDF and Hezbollah strike new targets in their escalating war. The Lebanese Red Cross says an Israeli strike killed at least 19 people in northern Lebanon today, destroying an entire residential building in a Christian majority village far from Hezbollah strongholds in the south. This was the scene as you see here earlier in Tel Aviv, people running -- some even abandoning their cars to take shelter as the sirens blared. The IDF says three projectiles fired from Lebanon towards central Israel were intercepted. Those interceptions coming just one day after a Hezbollah drone hit an Israeli army base near Haifa killing four soldiers. The IDF, it says it is now investigating just how that drone managed to fly undetected. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the base today and has vowed to continue striking Hezbollah across Lebanon, including in Beirut. Joining me now from Lebanon, Nic Robertson. Nic, as we look at this escalating conflict, we have not only between Israel and Lebanon, but of course, these additional strikes in Gaza, there is no sign any of this is letting up.",

Was with that strike, I believe it's 100 kilometers from Beirut, and that Christian majority town where we also saw a number of issues there. Moving into that territory, is Israel being any more transparent about what the planning is behind that, and just how much further this campaign could in fact reach?",

And they spoke about what they called a target factory. A group of officers and soldiers dedicated to watching Lebanon, figuring out where Hezbollah was storing weapons, figuring out their movements, figuring out where their leadership was, planning long lead-time operations such as the walkie-talkies, such as the pagers, all of that. So, if we take them at what they said previously in this village, these villages that are in a Christian majority neighborhood who are no friends to Hezbollah at all, Hezbollah being Shia Muslim, it is odd that the IDF would strike there, however, it would be in keeping if they believe that targets are there that pertain to Hezbollah weapons storage or whatever it is. It's -- but specifically know, we don't know why this village has been targeted. But this, I think undermines partially when Israeli officials like the Prime Minister tell the Lebanese people as they have done. We're not targeting you, we're targeting Hezbollah, those Christian villagers in that village and thereabout, who will not be Hezbollah would find that washing a bit thin.",

As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, the U.S. is now deepening its involvement, thePentagon says it's sending one of its most powerful anti-missile systems to Israel along with about 100 troops who will be there to help operate that system. The THAAD defense system can intercept ballistic missiles at a range of up to 200 kilometers. The Pentagon says it will help to bolster Israel's security following these two unprecedented attacks by Iran. My colleague Oren Liebermann joining us now from the Pentagon with more details. So, as both the system, a lot of focus on this system and just what it can do in terms of capabilities. Also, what's the timeline for this, Oren?",

      "sentences": "Well, depending on, won't be specific on how soon the THAAD system will get there. THAAD stands forterminal high-altitude area defense, and as you pointed out, it's one of the most capable interception systems, specifically built for intercepting short, medium and long-range ballistic missiles. Although, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did tell his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant that it should be there quote, \"in the coming days\". So, it's a system that can be moved quickly, that's part of its design here, and it looks like it will be moved quickly. That being said, the U.S. doesn't have many of them. So, every time you see one of the THAAD systems deployed, it is a significant statement on where the U.S. sees the threat and where the Pentagon sees its own priorities. Right now, that priority is the defense of Israel against a potential Iranian ballistic missile-launch. And to some extent, that is what's expected here, Israel has vowed to retaliate against Iran for the October 1st barrage that was fired at Israel, and Iran has vowed to respond to any attack on its territory. So, that raises the possibility of more ballistic missiles launched at Israel, which is where you see the U.S. deploying this THAAD system there, in case it's needed to intercept Iranian launches. It is worth noting that Israel has its own very capable aerial defense system, although we have seen it fail just like it did with this drone launch. The THAAD system adds not only quality to that system, it is a very capable platform, but also quantity. At some point, Iran can simply fire enough missiles, ballistic missiles to overwhelm Israel's air defenses, and that's when THAAD can play a critical role there, and simply having more interceptor missiles there that are capable at being launched at these attacks. So, that's also the military capability, but also a statement in where the U.S. prioritizes its own valuable systems, and that's in Israel's air defense. So, we expect it to be set up soon, and then it's purely a question of the timing on when and how does Israel carry out its attack on Iran? How does Iran respond? The U.S. watching all of that closely and making sure the THAAD system is there on the ground and Israel to participate in that defense.",

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump taking swipes at each other during their campaign stops over the weekend. Harris warning that Trump would weaponize the Justice Department against his political enemies, while Trump made a baseless claim that the entire country would be turned into a migrant camp if Harris is elected. Later this week, the Vice President will sit down with \"Fox News\" for her first interview with the network. The race itself, it is tight. There is no clear leader at this point. A new CNN poll of polls shows that very clearly, an average of 50 percent of likely voters supporting Kamala Harris, 47 percent backing Donald Trump. There are even smaller margins though separating the two when it comes to battleground states, as you can see here, like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. So, what does this all mean for the next 22 days? I'm joined now by CNN's senior White House reporter Kevin Liptak. Kevin, as we look at this, perhaps not surprising that the race is still so tight. It's tight in a number of those key states as well, and the percentage of movable voters remains also very small.",

You know, people keep saying, I want more information about those. I want more information about that. Donald Trump has had nine years and he still has fuzzy positions on many issues. So, the point is, for Kamala Harris, she has been if anything -- I hate to say this, too positive. She has had too many positive ads about her and Oprah's joy and -- I understand why they took that approach at first. But the euphoria is gone. She has stalled out. She's not losing altitude, but she isn't gaining anymore either. So, what do you do? You do what Donald Trump is doing. Three-quarters of his ads have been incredibly negative, vicious even.

You see some of the flooding pictures there which continue to pose a flooding threat and are also continuing to need rescue efforts. In North Carolina meantime, FEMA has been forced to pause aid in some parts of the state because of threats against its disaster response workers. Authorities say, now that this man, 44-year-old, William Jacob Parsons, has been arrested on related charges.

And listen, Erica, this frankly just comes amid a backdrop of misinformation that is really frustrating and angering so many local officials I spoke with in North Carolina and in Florida. Information that really can slow down their abilities to render aid. Instead, a lot of these officials are having to spend the time going on social media and busting these myths.

We're prepared for any kind of circumstances, he said. We're ready for war, but we're also ready for peace. This is the definitive stance of the Islamic Republic. A stance they want to show that also involves mobilizing resources from Iran's population.

And this one has a whole bunch of them on board. It's looking at the cameras. It's got things that are better than cameras that are looking beyond what the human eye can see. But it's also got a couple sensors that are sticking out. And as it flies right by this icy moon of Jupiter, it's actually going to be picking up the little pieces that get shed off of it. It's like licking and smelling them. You know, it's going to actually get in and analyze them. The gases that come off of them to see if maybe that's indications of life. And it's going to look back at the stuff that squirts out of this planet. It's like little like puffs of water, almost like steam that come off of it. And by looking back through those puffs at the sun, you can use the light to analyze what's in them. So, even though, you know, it's going to go by at least 49 times, maybe more if the life lasts longer, then with all of those things, we'll have a lot better understanding of Europa then. And maybe, if we get lucky, we'll find some pretty alluring indications that there's life somewhere besides Earth.",

That's why it's such an interesting destination. But it'll be very primitive, early single celled or basic microbial kind of life. Nothing -- you know, not little green men or anything like that. But if we can find life, some even primitive life somewhere besides Earth, that means there's life everywhere, and we just need to find better ways to look.

Those are the ones that can maybe fly through the plumes and pick up the little bits of Europa. That's really, we're going to learn some stuff.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We've traveled here to Sichuan, China for a rare look at preparing these pandas for their very long journey. We're in and around the city of Chengdu. It's known for spicy hot pot, its mountainous landscape, and giant pandas. We're actually going to go meet now with some of the folks from the Smithsonian National Zoo from D.C. who have flown here and are part of the transition team to bring Bao Li and Qing Bao back to the U.S. We can't go back there, but that's where Bao Li and Qing Bao are. They're in quarantine. And those you saw there were the zookeepers from the National Zoo, as well as some caretakers from China.",
