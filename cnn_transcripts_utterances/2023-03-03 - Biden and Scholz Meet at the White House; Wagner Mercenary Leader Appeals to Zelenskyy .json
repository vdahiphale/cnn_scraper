      "sentences": "Hello, and a very warm welcome, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, it's all eyes on Washington as two of Ukraine'sstaunchest allies meet this very hour. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will sit down with President Joe Biden in just a few moments. Ukraine, as you can imagine, is top of the agenda as Russian forces appear to be closing in on the besieged city of Bakhmut in the east of the country. And that is where in fact, we start this hour. The boss of the Wagner mercenary group says his forces have all but surrounded the city of Bakhmut. He is calling on Ukraine's president to order a mass withdrawal of the eastern city. Earlier, Russian forces destroyed this vital bridge running into the city. Ukrainians used it to get supplies in, and get civilians out. Officials have ordered a mandatory evacuation of the nearly 5,000 people still living there. So far, Ukraine has not commanded all of its forces to leave. And they say there is intense fighting happening in and around the city. However, one Ukrainian reconnaissance group says they've just got new orders. Have a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROBERT BROVDI, UKRAINIAN UNIT COMMANDER (through translator): In the middle of the night, the Madia(ph) Birds unit received a combat order to immediately leave Bakhmut for a new place of combat operations. We are following the order. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We were actually supposed to go with a team trying to evacuate civilians from Bakhmut earlier today. There's some 4,000 to 5,000 civilians who are under an evacuation order in the city. That mission getting called off because a bridge was bombed on a major artery on the way out of the city. This bridge, bombed according to a soldier in Bakhmut by a large Russian missile. On the main supply route that Ukrainian forces are using to get to and from the frontline. That supply route leaving the town of Chasiv Yar, we were just there on Thursday. We saw all kinds of military vehicles bombing to and from the front. That is the only road that Ukrainian forces have left to get to the frontline. Now, if they want to pull back or evacuate people or supply those troops, they are going to have to use dirt roads, cross muddy fields, that is very difficult, only certain types of vehicles can do it, and they leave themselves extremely exposed. Ukrainian forces are surrounded in Bakhmut on three sides. To the south, to the east, and to the north. They are being encircled by those Russian forces. We did hear from the head of the Wagner forces on the Russian side. They're the ones who have been leading that fight for Russia. The head of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, calling on President Zelenskyy to pull his troops out, saying that they are encircling the Ukrainian troops, and that will be complete in the next one or two days. At the same time, we have seen the head of Ukrainian military forces in the eastern part of the country visiting those troops in Bakhmut in the frontline. A sign that Ukraine intends to keep fighting for the city of Bakhmut, knowing that if it falls, it will be a major victory for the Russian side after months of very bloody fighting. And that Russia would try to use the city as a jumping-off point to drive deeper into eastern Ukraine. Alex Marquardt, CNN in eastern Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Oh, it's very hard to tell, Isa. The Ukrainians telling us that they stand firm in the town center. And all theimages that we've seen of Yevgeny Prigozhin; the ahead of Wagner, claiming to speak from the town center. His men claiming also to speak from the town center. Geo-location shows that they're in fact just outside. But clearly, it is the sheer number of men that they are sending to try and take that town center. That tells us it is just a matter of time. The Ukrainians explained that they have stayed, intend to stay, until the order comes to go. Because they are determined that, that much Ukrainian blood needs to be spent because once they retreat, it will be further west that the Russian forces go, and so on and so forth. It has also been, Isa, about trying to gain time. The Ukrainians know that there is a counteroffensive being prepared perhaps to the north of Luhansk. Every single day that they can gain by holding on to Bakhmut and obliging Russian forces to concentrate their efforts there, is a day saved, a day gained in that battle. And -- but of course, it is, even as we see that town circled slowly, encircled and with that main supply route gone. It is just a few tracks that are left. So it isn't just a resupply of the military, it is also of course the fate of the 4,500 civilians that are inside, entirely trapped we're told. They can no longer leave until about mid February, they could make their way out. They could try and get into cars that were leaving the city. That's no longer possible. There are no cars going in and out, only armored vehicles can function. And so, they're now trapped in a town in which they're obliged to live entirely underground. Imagine, Isa, a siege that has lasted for seven months. There's no electricity, there's no water. And they're living in basements because of the heat, seeking equipment on the Russian side that allows the Russian forces to target the civilian buildings in which they find themselves. It is actually a picture of hell, Isa.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, that's a discussion that's been ongoing, and it certainly could arise in these talks today. Of course, President Biden saidabout a month ago that he was not going to be supporting sending American fighter jets to Ukraine. But that was then. That's certainly not something that they've ruled out completely for the duration of this war. But I think it's interesting when you talk about Bakhmut, because what you constantly hear from American officials is that, of course, this is a symbolic city. It would be a symbolic victory for the Russians. But it's not necessarily a great strategic importance. And I think there has been some quiet frustration, certainly not spilling out into public, that President Zelenskyy has spent so many resources in trying to protect Bakhmut over the course of the last several weeks because of where this war is entering. Because these resources are so important for him to maintain the territory that he has. He has placed such a symbolic importance on the city. I don't know that, that is necessarily the battlefield decision that the Americans or the Europeans would have made if they were running this war. But of course, they're not. And they are delegating these decisions to President Zelenskyy even as they are providing him with massive amounts of armor, ammunition, weapons. It's not necessarily their decision to make. And so, that will be something I think that the president and the chancellor will discuss in the Oval Office today is, what should the battlefield tactics look like going ahead, as these resources potentially are limited, as you know, the American Congress talks about what it can sustain going forward. Now, the Republicans are in control, I think that there is more of an attention being paid to how these resources are being used on the ground there in Ukraine. But we do have a readout, a little bit of a readout of that Oval Office meeting. President Biden talking about how Chancellor Scholz was here just a year ago, and how things have changed in that year since. And I do think that that's important to know. Just the transformation that you've seen in Germany's foreign and military policy over the last year, that's something that White House officials really talk about a lot as just how transformative this year has been for Germany in particular. Of course, they took the pacifist approach to foreign policy, post-World War II, that has really changed their investing in their military. They're sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine. And that is something that is certainly been welcomed at the White House. It's not something necessarily that has gained Chancellor Scholz a lot of plodding over the last year. Some people saying that he needs to move more quickly, some people saying he needs to sort of occupy more of a leadership role in Europe, akin to his predecessor Angela Merkel. But certainly, at the White House, there is a lot of satisfaction and how he has handled all of this. They do think that he is stepping up to the moment, and that is certainly reflective in the decision to welcome him to the White House a year after this invasion. So, we'll see the two men sitting down shortly, but I do think the future of resources to Ukraine is really the topic of conversation that is -- that is really looming over these conversations. How much of it can be sustained?",

So they have plenty to discuss, not just how they can continue that support, a financial support, and keep the allies united. But also, how they can continue the money and the pressure, the financial help for President Zelenskyy. As you well know, President Zelenskyy has been calling for more support, more weapons, more tanks, jets even. We're seeing a lot of that support coming from the United States. In fact, we've seen today, Ukraine aid package. A new Ukraine aid package totaling $400 million. And just to put it into context for you, we're just doing the Math.

And the reason why that's important to keep in mind officials say that you need to use distilled water. Or if you use tap water, make sure you boil it for a minute if you use it for rinsing out your sinuses. Now what we know about the brain-eating amoeba infection, we do know that symptoms typically start with headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and they can progress to stiff neck, seizures, or hallucinations. And we do know that these are rare but deadly. Here in the United States alone, between the years of 1962 and 2021, only four people out of 154 known infections survived the disease that these infections cause.
