      "sentences": "Pressures are growing about the political endgame in Gaza more than a month into Israel's war against Hamas. Israel says its troops are now in the heart of Gaza City, targeting Hamas infrastructure and commanders. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will be in charge of Gaza's overall security indefinitely after the war.But on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pushed back against that. He said Gaza should not be occupied by Israel or be a staging ground for terrorism. Blinken also said the Palestinian Authority should eventually run both Gaza and the West Bank. Now as Israel pounds Gaza, with unrelenting airstrikes. It says much of it isn't aimed at buildings and fighters on the ground, rather is turning a massive network of tunnels that Hamas uses to maneuver, hide, store weapons and maybe hold its hostages. Israel said Wednesday it's already destroyed 130 tunnel shafts. Pentagon correspondent Oren Liebermann shows us the subterranean war. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ORN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Israeli military controls the air and says they've encircled Gaza City on the ground. But underneath the surface, Hamas still has the advantage. Israel is going after Hamas' underground infrastructure. This soldier shows an electrical system, he says, is used to circulate air underground. The IDF says it has destroyed 130 tunnel shafts since the start of the war. That's just a small fraction of what's known as Gaza's metro.

The barrier worked, sort of. Instead of digging into Israel, militants focused on the tunnels in Gaza, a complex the IDF is now trying to destroy. The U.S. has dealt with tunnels on a different battlefield in the Middle East. ISIS dug elaborate tunnels in Mosul, Iraq, forcing the local population to help create the underground passageways. Tunnels can pose problems for even advanced militaries. But Israel faces an even greater challenge. Hamas is believed to be holding many of the approximately 240 hostages underground, possibly in different groups.

What perhaps might be the likeliest scenario, in its very early days because, of course, this war is still very much ongoing, is something akin to what we see in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority administers part of the West Bank and Israeli forces kind of come and go, they have, in the jargon, operational flexibility to take out specific security threats. Of course, the problem with having that scenario in the Gaza Strip is that the Palestinian Authority, having seen what's been going on in the West Bank since it's been partly administering the Israeli- occupied territory there, is they may not want to find themselves in the same position again. But on top of that, the Palestinian Authority is unpopular. It is weak. It is widely viewed as corrupt; its leader Mahmoud Abbas is in the 19th year of a four-year term and so lacks legitimacy. And they're hardly going to want to add to that laundry list of criticisms by being seen to be some kind of puppet government of the Israelis or the United States in the Gaza Strip. Now what Abbas did say to Secretary Blinken when they met the other day is that he would consider going back into Gaza retaking control because the Palestinian Authority was in control from 2005 till 2007. Hamas ejected it violently from the Gaza Strip then. The P.A. would go back in, but only as part of some broader political process which would have clear roadmaps towards an independent Palestinian state on land occupied by Israel in 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital. And given where we are now, given the mistrust that there is between the Israelis and the Palestinian Authority, and given that certainly the current government says that it intends to have some kind of security control or overall security responsibility for the Gaza Strip. Having the Palestinian Authority, certainly in the short term, in control of Gaza seems somewhat wishful thinking right now. As I say, we're very much still seeing the war rumble on. Israel is very much focused on that. And I don't think they spent a huge amount of time thinking about what happens the day after. The only thing that they are sure of and which the U.S. agrees on is that Hamas cannot remain in control. And of course, the other big question, what about those 240 or so hostages that Hamas abducted on October the 7th? Even if there is some kind of military decision or some kind of agreement or possibility of the Palestinian Authority or another authority coming in to administer the Gaza Strip, how is that going to be possible unless all of those hostages are released?

      "sentences": "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights is accusing both Israel and Hamas of committing war crimes. He accuses Israel of carrying out collective punishment on civilians in Gaza, which he says amounts to a war crime, and so does the forcible evacuation of civilians.The U.N. Human Rights Chief says the atrocities committed by Hamas during its terror attack on Israel last month are also war crimes, along with the continued holding of hostages. In response, Israel says its attacks on military targets are subject to international law, out assessments on whether the potential damage to civilians is excessive compared to the expected military gains. Meanwhile, as Israeli troops tighten their grip on Hamas in Gaza City, Palestinian civilians are fleeing south. The UN says at least 40,000 of them have made the harrowing journey since Saturday using temporary evacuation routes created by the IDF. But as Salma Abdelaziz reports, what they describe seeing along the way is nothing short of horrific. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza City. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocents. Now we're supposed to be in the safe area, but you can hear the bombs behind us, he says. All of our houses are gone, nothing is left. The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the strip to move southwards, most recently opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time, pushing thousands here to Salah al-Din street where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. We saw along the road destruction, dead bodies everywhere and the Israeli tanks would demand to search the youth. She says, we saw one young man stripped naked. We witnessed unbearable scenes. The only way to reach the route is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood, and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there's no fuel, he says. They cut everything off to force us out of our homes. Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza City, as Israel's defense minister apparently declared the entire city, the whole of the enclave's largest population center, a legitimate target. YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): Gaza is biggest heavy stronghold, a mankind desert built. This whole city is one big terror base. Underground, they have kilometers of tunnels connecting to hospitals and schools. ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): The U.N. calls this exodus forcible displacement and accuses Israel of the collective punishment of some two million people. And many fear they will never be allowed to return home. Some here say this is reminiscent of the Nakba, the Arabic term for the expulsion of Palestinians from their towns during the founding of Israel. We walked a very long way. It felt like the Nakba of 2023, she says. We walked by dead people who were ripped to shreds. Children were very tired because there was no water. People were dying and there were elderly who couldn't walk. And for those who do make it, bombardment and siege await them in the South too. There is no true escape. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London.

Zoo staff call this a hiatus in their five decade wildly popular panda program. But Chinese officials will not say for sure if the pandas will be back. You might wonder why this even matters. There are of course far more pressing issues between the U.S. and China. But as we look deeper, tracking where pandas are leaving, and where they're going, you get a better sense of the new world order China's hoping to craft. These cuddly creatures used for China's major political and diplomatic needs, especially in places where it hopes to gain. But China says its focus is on conservation and research. Beijing's Panda Diplomacy with Washington, as it's called, kicked off in 1972, following President Nixon's historic visit to China. Chairman Mao Zedong gifted two pandas to the U.S. Seeing their popularity rise amongst Americans, China sent more pandas to other zoos across the U.S., eventually loaning instead of gifting them, sometimes for up to half a million dollars per year. At its height, there were 15 pandas in the United States, but in the last decade the numbers have dropped, coinciding with worsening U.S.- China relations, with the three pandas having now left the National Zoo. That only leaves four pandas in the U.S., currently at Atlanta Zoo. The contracts for those pandas expire next year. No word on any extension.",
