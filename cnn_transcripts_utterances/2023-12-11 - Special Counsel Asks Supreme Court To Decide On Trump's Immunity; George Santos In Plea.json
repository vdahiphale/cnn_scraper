      "sentences": "Well, Jake, that's exactly what the special counsel is trying to do. They're trying to make sure that this trial remains on track to get started in March because they know that eventually this case was going to come to the Supreme Court. They know that Donald Trump was going to and his lawyers were going to use the next couple of months to make filings to the courts to try to delay this trial. That has been the game all along.And so, what they're asking for is for the court to take on head on the question of whether Trump is immune from prosecution for things that happened while he was in office, and then secondly, whether he essentially is barred from being tried in this case because of double jeopardy because he was obviously impeached by the Congress, but he was not convicted. So that is one of the central questions that Jack Smith and his team is now asking. I'll read you just a part of this filing, which says in part, \"A cornerstone of our constitutional order is that no person is above the law. The force of that principle is that it's zenith here, whereas here a grand jury has accused a former president of committing federal crimes to subvert the peaceful transfer of power to his lawfully elected successor. Nothing could be more vital to our democracy than a president who abuses the electoral system to remain in office is held accountable for criminal conduct.\" Jake, this is obviously now the goal here is to try to expedite this. They're asking for the court to do this, to get the briefs going by December 18th. The goal is obviously to try to get this going before that March trial date comes near.",

In that case, which they cite in this brief, they point out that the Supreme Court rendered a decision within 16 days of hearing an argument and within two months of the first petition being made. And also, one of the things that if you read this brief, one of the things that Jack Smith does here, Jake, is they point out that this, this court, this current Supreme Court has kind of had a habit of expediting appeals.For instance, in a Texas case involving student loans against the Biden administration, it's something that the Biden administration has not been happy about, certainly some of the critics of the court. So, they're pointing out that this court has been very willing to expedite other appeals and this one of course is of great importance.",

She doesn't think that the prosecution is bound to any sort of agreement, and that they retain the freedom to charge him as they did.Don't fault him for making the argument. He doesn't have a lot of cards to play, and so it doesn't surprise me they're making this argument, but I guess I wouldn't count on him winning the day on this one.",

Of course, all the walls have been crumbling for George Santos, too, of his former campaign staff members, his treasurer, his chief fundraiser, those guys have both pleaded guilty to federal charges that they were facing and then of course he was recently kicked out of Congress as you also just mentioned. We also know in the paperwork that prosecutors are going to be asking for his trial which was expected to begin next September to be actually pushed up to a May or June date.

And we have been waiting all weekend long and into today for a ruling from the Supreme Court. That came just a day after an Austin judge granted Kate Cox the ability to have a legal abortion through a temporary restraining order on the state's abortion law. Her lawyers said in a statement this afternoon or today saying that her health is on the line. She's been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn't wait any longer. This is why judges and politicians should not be making health care decisions for pregnant people. They are not doctors. Over the weekend, Jake, Ken Paxton filed another motion with the Texas Supreme Court saying that in their view, Kate Cox had not proven that this pregnancy threatened her life and her future fertility shouldn't be considered in this particular case as a reason for why she would meet the medical exemption.

Among other humanitarian needs pay Gaza civil servants and pictures in 2018 showed workers lining up to receive $100 bills. Israel approved the deal in a security Cabinet meeting in August 2018. During a previous Netanyahu tenure as prime minister and Israeli official defended Netanyahu's decision telling CNN, successive Israeli government enabled money to go to Gaza. Not in order to strengthen Hamas, but to prevent a humanitarian crisis. That's true. But no one else approved it in cash. Former Prime Minister Bennett says that Netanyahu underestimated Hamas.",

And the goal of these organizations and organizations that we work with is to give survivors a voice. And what I've seen in the last few months is that many organizations whose core value it is to stand with survivors, aren't.They're demanding proof and evidence beyond a standard that we do even for prosecutions in this country. They are erasing the experience of these women and girls that were brutalized by Hamas on October 7th. And by doing that they're compounding the trauma. They are empowering the perpetrators who prey on vulnerable women and girls and that nobody will believe them. It's a tactic to use by perpetrators to get their victims to not speak up. And sadly, these women can't speak up because many of them were murdered and don't even have a voice. So it's so important that people with platforms that organizations with platforms stand up for survivors of the sexual assault on October 7th, whether you believe in I -- you know, it's not a two sides situation, when you're talking about sexual violence and rape. It's just astounding to me that there's any silence when we're talking about the sexual violence committed.",

And something that I've been thinking about a lot these last two months is a phrase that my grandfather said all the time. He was also survived the concentration camps. And he would say all the time, the Nazis were evil monsters. But by far, the bystanders were the worse. He just felt so betrayed by those who didn't stand up for him. He was a dentist.

Down on the edge of the Dnipro River on who's isolated right bank, lone groups of Ukrainians are making rare advances into Russian occupied land. But it's tiny tools. Hand rigged donated drones and small gains. The U.S. is stalling on the big money Ukraine needs to make the breakthrough the West wants and you can feel the anger at that here. It is relentless work. I think it'll be very difficult without American help, he says. Our supplies are also ending, so we need theirs. We've had days so busy we launched 15 to 20.

Another price target emerges their Russian equivalent drone unit hiding in a red roofed house worth sending two drones at. The first as it closes in, taken out by jamming. The second picks it up. At night, another unit elsewhere near the city takes over. Thermal imaging help them find Russians hiding in the woods across the river near Krynki, a village where Ukraine has a valuable foothold. This unit, too, were hunted and use a cheap device to spot the frequency used by a Russian drone passing above. This operator dons a new cloak as he launches a drone off the roof.
