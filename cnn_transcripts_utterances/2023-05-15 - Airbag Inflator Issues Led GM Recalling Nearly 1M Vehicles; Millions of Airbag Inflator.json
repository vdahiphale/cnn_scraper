Important new developments out of North Carolina this morning. The Democratic governor has vetoed a Republican batch 12-week abortion bill in his -- I think, it's a 12-week abortion ban. A ban after 12 weeks, but Republicans hold a super majority in the state legislature and could block the governor's veto, override that veto. CNN's Dianne Gallagher is in North Carolina, in Charlotte for us this morning. Dianne, explain what happens now. DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  So, essentially the Democratic governor of North Carolina has vetoed this bill. He has the most-narrow path to sustain that veto, and that because there is just a one Republican, essentially, that would need to break with their party when it comes to an override vote. That is expected, according to party leaders this week, it could happen as early as tomorrow in North Carolina to begin that override vote. The governor has essentially gone across the state trying this high- pressure campaign on specific lawmakers whose past platforms maybe don't gel with what this bill has. Now, there are four particular lawmakers that he is focused on. One of them being a senator, Michael Lee, and three members of the House, John Bradford, Tricia Cotham and Ted Davis. Two of those members have come out against the governor saying they don't believe that their past positions conflict with this bill. But we have not heard back from Representative Tricia Cotham who, of course, infamously switched parties from Democrat to Republican last month. She has long been a proponent of abortion access for more than a decade in the state house. And, look, as far as her current beliefs, no one is quite sure. She did vote for this bill, but she was also listed as a sponsor of a bill earlier this session, just a few months ago, that would have codified Roe V. Wade into law in North Carolina. The other lawmaker, Representative Ted Davis, told CNN he wasn't going to comment when we reached out to him. He is the only other Republican who did not vote for this bill about a week and a half ago when it was jammed through the legislature in 48 hours. He was absent. And an absence could give the governor the number of votes he needs to sustain that veto. Now, party leaders have said that they are not worried about this. They say they have the votes. That Republicans are unified. They've tried to spin this bill as a compromise bill, something that they call mainstream. But the governor, Democrats, as well as abortion rights activists have said that's not the case. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ROY COOPER, (D) CAROLINA:  Now, we need people all over this state to learn how bad this bill is. And maybe it'll be a friend, a family member, a minister or even a doctor of one of these Republican legislators who convinces them to step up and do the right thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
