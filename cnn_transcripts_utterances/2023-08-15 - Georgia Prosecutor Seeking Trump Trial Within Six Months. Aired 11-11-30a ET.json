It encompasses not only the allegations here in Georgia, which Sara, Jason and our colleagues have been reporting on, but also allegations of this effort to overturn the election in Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. And in addition to being this really broad conspiracy that they're alleging, he's also charged alongside 18 co-defendants, including some of his closest advisers, like former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadow and Rudy Giuliani. Now, Rudy Giuliani is referenced in the federal January 6 indictment. He is Co-Conspirator 1, but he wasn't charged. And, of course, Mark Meadows, who the January 6 Committee concluded was at the center of all of this, he is conspicuously absent from the federal indictment. So, seeing him here charge for his alleged role in this conspiracy, it was significant. It's part of what makes this case is different from the special counsel's probe. Now, former President Trump has, of course, denied all wrongdoing. But I expect one of the first things we're going to see after he gets through surrender, initial appearance at his arraignment is that he and his attorneys are probably going to try to move this from heavily Democratic Fulton County to the federal level, so we can have that much more broad jury pool.",

I wouldn't even recognize Jack Smith, if I saw him. So we have definitely seen a change in that rhetoric. It's unclear what that means behind the scenes.

      "sentences": "Yes, I'd really say that the breadth of this Georgia indictment much more extensive. I mean, you saw it.It charges 19 defendants. The special counsel's case, in terms of the election subversion case, that, for now, only charges Donald Trump, even though it does mention those other -- unindicted, unnamed co- conspirator. So, in that case, the special counsel has brought four charges just against Trump. This Georgia indictment, it lays out 161 separate acts that span all the way from November 2020 through 2022, prosecutors in Fulton County saying all of these acts were in furtherance of this broad conspiracy to flip -- flip the election, subvert it for Trump nationwide. So, this indictment really does lay out the acts that were taken not only in Georgia, but also in other states. And what's interesting here is, because the district attorney, Fani Willis, is charging this under this racketeering statute, she said it. She can really paint this broad picture, tell this overarching story of what they're calling an enterprise and criminal scheme. What's notable, guys, is that Fani Willis has repeatedly gone to this racketeering statute in Georgia in other high-profile cases in the state. In fact, just recently, she won convictions against 11 educators in the Atlanta public school system. They were accused of this broad cheating scandal, where they inflated test scores. So she's used this statute before successfully. And, also, this statute if convicted, it mandates a minimum five-year prison term, maximum of 20 years. So the penalties for this are very severe. And Fani Willis has tried and tested this statute in other realms, now looking to try it against these 19 defendants, guys.",

They're going to lean heavily into what he faces here in, again, heavily Democratic Fulton County. And there's a larger argument that they make in the court of public opinion. They argue that there should perhaps be limits on the ability of elected prosecutors to bring charges against former presidents. I mean, they will argue that what goes around comes around. We could be opening a Pandora's box here. This is -- again, is a theoretical argument. I don't think they're going to succeed on that legally. But as part of that, they're going to argue that he can't get a fair trial here in Fulton County. Now, if they are able to move this to federal court, two things happen. Not only does the jury pool broaden out, and perhaps become somewhat more favorable to the former president, but if he or anyone else is convicted, then they are potentially eligible for a pardon from a current or future president.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Sara.This is the third time now that Donald Trump and his team have gone through and -- gone through something like this. And they have a playbook that they think is working. And so they're going to continue to use it, his advisers tell me. And that's really to label these charges as a political persecution against Donald Trump and also argue that the district attorney in Fulton County, Fani Willis, is trying to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. And Donald Trump personally has been responding to this, as you said, Sara, over last night and also this morning, railing against these charges. In one TRUTH Social post, he wrote -- quote -- \"So the witch-hunt continues, 19 people indicated tonight \"-- he, I think, meant indicted -- \"including the former president of the United States, me, by an out-of-control and very corrupt district attorney who campaigned and raised money on -- quote -- 'I will get Trump.'\" The post goes on to say: \"Why didn't they indict 2.5 years ago? Because they wanted to do it right in the middle of my political campaign. Witch-hunt,\" Donald Trump said. Of course, there are questions of whether the district attorney is actually campaigning on this and false allegations about that. But, anyways, this is Donald Trump's strategy. He wants to get ahead of the charges. He wants to frame this on his own terms, just as we have seen him do with the previous three indictments. And I know from my reporting as well that his team was pretty prepared for this. They had spent most of Monday lining up their surrogates and their allies, again, as they have done with past indictments and readying them with talking points, so that, immediately, once an indictment was dropped, that they would come to his defense. And we saw them do that last night. We saw people like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy posts on TRUTH Social, same thing with Jim Jordan, arguing that Trump did nothing wrong. And so this is really the playbook that they have cultivated over the past several months, and we're going to continue to see them use exactly that over the next couple of weeks -- Sara.",

There's also judicial efficiency and economy. Why are we trying a case five different times when you could try it once?

It prejudices his or her rights in moving forward in this way.The other issue is, you have to look at whether or not there will be people who get dispositions. What does that mean? People who perhaps might plead because the evidence is just so overwhelmingly compelling. You then ask the question of whether there will be people who may cooperate and therefore get out, right? So it could whittle away. But, look, I look at this, and I don't even know that the prosecution needs people who they're trying to flip, et cetera, because it's so precise, it's so factually detailed. Doesn't mean, right, that it's provable. We will wait and see. That's for another day. But with respect to the specificity of the indictment, Kate, it looks like they have the goods and then some here.

He may get a broader jury pool than just in that county.And, of course, theoretically, maybe he thinks, were he to win the presidency, that having been in federal court would give him greater control over trying to pardon himself or something of that nature. I don't think that's going to succeed here. A somewhat similar move failed in New York. And I think this is something that is squarely within the jurisdiction of the state prosecutor. And that's where it's brought. So I don't think he's going to have much success on trying to move it out of there, although I see why he would want to try to do that, because, as Joey was saying, with this level of specificity in the indictment, it's not looking that great for other defenses at the moment.",
