I'm Laila Harrak.Escalating tensions in the Middle East, Israel's military carries out attacks in Syrian territory, casting a shadow over a weekend of religious celebrations, we're live in Jerusalem with the latest. Abortion pill controversy, we will examine the contradictory rulings that led to a legal standoff over an established medication to induce abortion. And the cultural war debate over transgender athletes, we will speak to a 13-year-old transgender cross country runner and his mother on their experience with discrimination. One of the holiest times of the year is now underway in Jerusalem. Religious events of different faiths are being observed from Easter Sunday mass to prayers during Ramadan, to the Passover priestly blessing happening right now, with thousands of worshippers gathering at Jerusalem's western wall. Earlier, Muslim worshippers were seen praying peacefully at the Al- Aqsa Mosque. It was in stark contrast to the scene from last week when Israeli forces violently raided the compound. Jordan has warned that if worshippers are attacked again, there would be more catastrophic consequences for everyone. That's on top of all the violence we've seen since last week's raid. In the latest escalation, Israel has carried out a new wave of attacks in Syrian territory. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz joins us now from Jerusalem with more. Salma, the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, say they have struck targets in Syrian territory. What more can you tell us yes?",

      "sentences": "Look, Laila, the state of Lebanon may not be firing the rockets towards Israel but they undoubtedly have a role to play here. The Lebanese Army has been busy trying to prevent the next potential attack, trying to find the rockets and rocket launchers that may be used. In fact, they found a rocket in an orchard in Southern Lebanon just yesterday afternoon in the area that we actually traveled to as well.But their task is a lot easier said than done. Things here, especially in Southern Lebanon, are complicated, especially given the factions, given the militant groups and given the simple fact that when it comes to especially the Palestinian refugee camps, the Lebanese authorities don't have a real effective way to actually police these areas and this is -- these are the places where the Lebanese foreign minister at least believes that some of these rockets are actually originating from. And even outside the camps, if you just look at the landscape, and we saw it for ourselves, there's plenty of good spots to hide weapons if you wanted to do that, in the hillsides, in the orchards there as well, and there's plenty of people that you run into that have an axe to grind with Israel. And when we went to the first bombing site, we found some of them. This was a bridge that had been built over an irrigation channel that took a direct hit. Presumably this could have been a spot where you could hide weapons, though the locals there told us that there weren't any there, and this would not have been a great hiding place. But they also -- some of them made no apologies for the barrage of rockets from Lebanon, the most since 2006 that were fired in the direction of Israel. One man said that, look, the Lebanese firing of rockets should be a message that the Lebanese people stand for resistance. And when I asked him whether he wanted peace with Israel, the answer was pretty blunt. Of course, not. But keep in mind that this man really had nothing to lose. He wasn't that close a few miles to where these bombs actually came down. It's a different story when you talk to the farmer whose children were sleeping when the roof of their farmhouse caved in due to the force of the blast. One other points, Laila, and that is that we also went to the area where the Lebanese military says that the rockets actually were launched from, we couldn't find anyone who was real keen to talk to us on camera, but we did find one man who spoke to us off camera and he said that, look, he doesn't support this kind of escalation, he said. When his kid gets scared, he also gets scared, and this, frankly, is not the time. If there's good news, it's that the Israelis have indicated that unless there is new rocket fire from Lebanon, they're not going to strike back again. Laila?",

And U.S. officials did confirm that those documents appeared to be authentic. Now, in addition to the Department of Justice opening this investigation, the Pentagon says they are looking into the matter and looking at these documents is pretty surreal because they are photos of crumpled up pieces of paper that have classified markings on them, some holding top secret markings, which is the highest level of classification, some holding markings of the office at the Pentagon that advises President Biden, so obviously creating quite a bit of alarm among us officials, particularly at the Pentagon.
