It has been much lower, so we'vegot a bit of a recovery going on, but I still think it's going to take quite a bit to turn that around. It seems to sort of settle around about half a percentage point down. All sorts of reasons why the Dow is lower. I'm going to be talking about them. For instance, new concerns about the health of US banks. Moody's put six banks under review for possible credit downgrade. Staying with banks, the Italian government hits its banks with a surprise windfall tax, and that sent banking shares in Italy was much lower. And how high for how long? The impact on your portfolio. With me tonight, the chief investment officer at Vanguard gives some direction and guidance thoughts. We are live in New York. It is Tuesday. It is August the 8th. I am Richard Quest, and yes, I mean business. Good evening. There are new signs of financial distress in the US economy. Moody's has downgraded 10 small and midsize banks, and its notice warning, higher funding pressures and commercial real estate risks is the reason, or one of them, there's several of them. We are showing you the share price of some of the lenders and they are all -- no, not dramatically -- because perhaps the market have priced in risk, but they are all down. And the rating agencies warned it is reviewing the credit of these six larger banks particularly BNY Mellon and Bancorp, which the largest, and State Street. The markets are down amid the news. In addition, Bank of America says more Americans are tapping into their retirement accounts, so 401 (k)s because of hardship, and the New York Fed says credit card debt has now surpassed a trillion dollars, a new record. Matt Egan is with me. Matt, I sort of feel that we have -- particularly with those last two bits of news, the Bank of America and the Fed. We've put our head under the water of the economy and we're seeing the undercurrents and they are not good.",

We're dealing with a high inflation situation, and a Federal Reserve that is more aggressive in trying to get inflation back down, more aggressive than we've seen in at least 40 years. So of course, there's going to be consequences. Some people are being squeezed, consumers, and they're being forced to tap their 401(k) accounts and others are being forced to rely on credit cards, with credit card debt topping a trillion dollars. This Moody's warning though, I think that's the one that really set off the selloff in the stock market. Moody's is concerned here. they say that they could downgrade six larger US banks, BNY Mellon, State Street, US Bancorp, Northern Trust, Truist and Cullen/Frost. All of those stocks are down in the day. The whole regional banking sector is down, and Moody's is setting three particular concerns. One is lower profits, two is higher funding costs, and then also looming commercial real estate losses. And Richard, I would note that all three of those are all tied to the Fed's war on inflation, this spike in interest rates.",

Mass generalization, but in recent years, both went down, and that was somewhat different.

You look at money markets today that are producing a yield of about five- and-a-quarter percent, which is way better than when they were flattened down to zero percent because of Fed policy. So investors are being compensated for saving and investing in money markets, and the same thing is happening on the bond side as well, where you're actually earning a yield that's greater than the level of inflation, which is not something that we've seen over the last 10 years. So investors can start to feel much more comfortable having exposure to cash, having exposure to bond funds, because the yields are much greater than what we've seen and our expectations for the next 10 years are that folks who are investing in highly diversified bond portfolios are going to produce returns in the four to four-and-a-half percent type range.",

But they only began receiving regular payments for their work, when these goods started lining the shelves of the world's biggest brands. EUNICE AZUMA, ARTISAN, ALL ACROSS AFRICA (through translator): When there is a steady order, we are very happy because it makes us financially stable. It means the children under the age of 18 don't have to be working with us. STEWART (voice-over): Eunice works for a cooperative that sells home goods to a company called All Across Africa, which says it's one of the continent's biggest artisan networks. The artisan sector is the world's second largest employer and can be key to lifting millions out of poverty. But accessing markets is among the biggest challenges artisans face, according to one small survey.",
