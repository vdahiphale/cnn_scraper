Next up, we head to New York City where Columbia University is canceling its school-wide commencement ceremony planned for next week. It instead will hold smaller events due to security concerns. Columbia is where pro- Palestinian encampments started a few weeks ago and then spread to colleges and universities all across the country before police shut them down. Pro-Palestinian protests already interrupted some graduation ceremonies last weekend. As we`ve discussed, many colleges and universities have endowments, which are basically big sums of money acquired largely through donations. And pro-Palestinian protesters want their schools to divest those endowments or take money away from Israeli companies, from companies that work with Israel or create weapons for Israel. Next, we head to Iran, a country that is currently sanctioned by the U.S. and its allies. So what is a sanction? It`s when a country punishes another country financially. In this case, the United States and several other countries don`t buy products from Iran or sell products to them. That`s because Iran supports Islamic terrorist organizations and has violated nuclear agreements. CNN`s Fred Pleitgen shows us how Iran is trying to work around these sanctions, working with countries willing to defy the U.S. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice- over): An international trade fair in one of the most sanctioned countries in the world. It`s called the Iran Expo and it`s the Islamic Republic`s attempt to market its products to businesses willing to defy U.S.-led sanctions. (On camera): Iran`s leadership has said that in order to try and beat the sanctions, what they want to do is develop their own homegrown industries, like the automobile industry, and then hopefully export items like these around the world. (Voice-over): Tehran showcasing everything from heavy machinery to food products, hoping for international buyers. It seems like a tall task. But as large economies like Russia and China increasingly find themselves under Western economic pressure, the Iranians hope they`ll be more open to doing business with Tehran. We even met a parliamentarian from Mali, saying he`d do an interview but only in Russian. Right now we have dynamic growth in the medical sector in the first place, he says, and we`re also interested in widening cooperation in the oil sector and also general trade. Iran`s economy has been ravaged by what the U.S. called maximum pressure, design that the U.S. claims to compel it to stop its support for extremism, halt its crackdown on protesters and agree to a tougher nuclear deal. Unemployment and inflation are high while Iran`s currency continues to devalue. Iran is working with other adversaries of the West like Russia. The cooperation we have in the energy sector and agriculture, education and development, and the contact between our scientists, in all these directions, we can take further steps, Iran`s president said at a recent meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. And Iran wants to rely not only on oil and gas but also on manufacturing. The country`s deputy industries minister tells me. The reality is that sanctions have two faces, he says, the damaging side but the other side is that it makes you believe in your capabilities and become independent. But the Iranians acknowledge Western sanctions are a major hurdle not only when it comes to making their products but also trying to sell them abroad. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Tehran. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

An ice flow forms from ocean water. An iceberg forms on land, then breaks off from a glacier into the ocean. Arctic sea ice has been shrinking for 46 straight years. In fact, NASA says we`ve lost enough Arctic ice to fill the entire state of Alaska. One big question is, can anything be done? Well, an ambitious group of problem solvers have an idea, create new ice by pumping water from below. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Can you refreeze melting Arctic ice? This startup says it`s developing a way to do so. ANDREA CECCOLINI, CO-CEO, REAL ICE: We were in Alaska, we did a submersible pump, we made a hole in the ice, we pumped water. Within hours, it was solid frozen. It is as simple as that.",
