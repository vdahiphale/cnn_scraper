Wagner, which has been repeatedly accused of committing atrocities, has played a pivotal role in Russia's foreign military campaigns, including and especially in Ukraine where it stands on the front lines.In Africa, the group has helped prop up Russia's influence and seized resources. CNN chief international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir joins us now with more on the group's role in Sudan. Hello, Nima. What do you know?",

Because CNN can reveal that the fight in Khartoum is being influenced by what was happening at that garrison. A Russian resupply campaign, backed by a key regional players, aimed at turning the tide in Sudan's war in favor of the RSF, who have been a key recipient of Russian training and military aid. In collaboration with all eyes on Wagner, a research group focusing on Russian proxy Wagner, CNN investigated the group's current presence in Libya. You can see here, on April 16th, one day after the fighting began in Khartoum, a Russian Ilyushin 76 transport plane at the Al Jufra base in Libya, previously identified by American intelligence as a Wagner base. Three days later, this same plane is spotted by flight tracker aviation expert Gourgeon (ph) coming back from the Russian airbase in Latakia, Syria, before returning to the Libyan air base in Khadim. Images of that same plane began circulating online April 17th, heading in the direction of Sudan. Sudanese and regional sources tell CNN that weaponry was air dropped to the RSF within that time frame. April 15th to April 18th, to the Chevrolet Garrison, during a period of fierce fighting, boosting the RSF. ELBAGIR (on camera): The al Khadim and Al Jufra bases, where the Wagner planes departed from in Libya, are under the control of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who commands territory in the east of Libya. Haftar, and the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, aka Hemedti, have in common strategic alliances, one with Wagner, who Haftar is hosting in his territory in Libya, and whom a previous CNN investigation exposed as working with Hemedti to extract Sudanese gold, a second with the United Arab Emirates, who tapped Hemedti to send forces to the conflict in Yemen and backed Haftar in the fighting in Libya. ELBAGIR (voice over): What does it all mean for the ongoing misery and conflict in Sudan? It means that both a regional Libyan General Haftar and a global player, Russia, are putting their thumbs on the scale, which raises the stakes for the region, for the global balance of power and for the people of Sudan caught in the crossfire.

The decision comes just two weeks after the state's attorney general recommended that Glossip get a new trial. He was convicted of murder in 1998, accused of ordering the killing of his boss, but he has maintained his innocence the whole time and the attorney general of the state even said there's new evidence in this case and that's why he deserves a new trial. But he's not getting one.Brynn Gingras is here to explain why. Good morning.",

It was a box of evidence who -- which basically had paperwork that included the fact that the person who actually did the killing admitted to it, and in exchange for his testimony against Glossip in these trials essentially wanted to recanted his statement. That was what was among the evidence. And what we talked about, Poppy, was - has - as we've continued to follow this case. But the justices in a 5-0 decisions said it wasn't enough evidence to bring this case to the lower courts and have another trial.An, as Poppy said, it's devastating.
