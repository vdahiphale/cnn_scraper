How to navigate what are unsettling times in terms of geopolitics and economics, with what are, I would argue, these unprecedented times in terms of rapid technological advancements which are transforming industries, disrupting our old ways of doing things and driving a new era of innovation. And many of the discussions that I've had here in Riyadh are very focused on how these business leaders, these global titans from the financial world, navigate these uncertain times and the U.S. election and wars both here and in Europe, here being the wider Middle East and in Europe, very much at the heart of that. Lots of talk about how things look very different, Erica, from what, two years ago when we were living in a very high inflation environment. That's come down. Two years ago was the beginning of the Russian war on Ukraine and only a year ago, of course, we saw the beginning of the conflict. So some of the picture is slightly better with regard inflation and interest rates. Some of it's still very, very complicated with regard to these conflicts. But at the heart of many of these discussions, as I say, is the forthcoming U.S. election. What kind of U.S. economic policy and political sort of dynamics are we likely to see post this election and going forward? And that really is certainly at the forefront of so many people's conversations here in Riyadh. Erica?",

So we are all waiting globally at this point as we are in this final week until Election Day. Becky, we'll continue to check in with you throughout the hour. Speaking of the election here in the U.S., Kamala Harris preparing to deliver what her team has called her closing argument to voters today. It is looked at as what could be in many ways the most important speech of her campaign in this final week. She is set to speak at the Ellipse in Washington later today. That is the same park where Donald Trump addressed his supporters on January 6th, 2021, just before the insurrection, the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Harris' advisers say her goal here is to drive home the point that a victory for her would turn the page on which she sees as Trump's divisiveness. Harris herself previewing a bit of that message just a short time ago in a radio interview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), U.S. VICE PRESIDENT &amp; DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: There is going to be a new president on January 20th of next year, and it's either going to be Donald Trump or it's going to be me. And I would ask people to imagine the Oval Office. People have seen it on TV. You know what it looks like. It's either going to be Donald Trump sitting behind that desk writing out his enemies list of who he's going to seek revenge and retribution on, or it's going to be me working on behalf of the American people, as I always have done, working on my to-do list to see through these policies that are about homeownership, lifting up our small businesses, lifting up families with children, and lifting up the discourse in a way that it is not about trashing people all the time.

They've been trying to get the video of those remarks in front of those voters. I think it's probably too early to tell whether or not it has swayed any votes in particular among the Latino community. I think probably the better question is whether it has convinced voters who are otherwise going to sit out this election, who didn't necessarily feel like they had a stake in this contest, to actually register and to go to the voting stations and to actually cast their vote for Kamala Harris. And certainly the hope among Harris advisers is that this would move the needle. And certainly this speech that Kamala Harris is delivering tonight, it's been in the works for weeks. They didn't time it around the former president's remarks at Madison Square Garden, but her advisers really do view that speech that he gave as the perfect counterpoint to what she will be speaking about tonight. And I don't think it would be a surprise if she necessarily raised those comments, at least obscurely in that speech that she's trying to make as she tries to drive home this question of contrast with her and the former president.",

The fact that we are still talking about these comments from one of his opening acts, essentially, on Sunday night, the campaign quickly distanced itself, saying that those comments about Puerto Rico don't reflect, I'm paraphrasing here right, but do not reflect the feelings of either the candidate or the campaign. But you still have a number of people, including the archbishop of San Juan saying, we need more. We need a personal apology from Donald Trump himself. There is a push from the head of the Republican Party in Puerto Rico, right, for a little bit more here.

We are also following a number of different developments when it comes to the election here in the United States, including a series of ballot box fires in the Northwest. Authorities say they've now identified a suspect vehicle. You see it in the photo here. That vehicle was seen leaving the scene of a fire on Monday at the ballot box in Portland, Oregon. Officials believe the vehicle may also be tied to two fires in nearby Vancouver, Washington. One of those fires destroyed hundreds of ballots in Washington state, seen as Natasha Chen is following this story. So there is a suspect vehicle.

Yes, you're talking about these fire suppressants. They are actually utilized in the ballot drop boxes in both Clark County, where Vancouver, Washington, is, and Multnomah County, where Portland is. This is actually a pretty popular thing to have in drop boxes in both Washington state and Oregon, because these two states are largely vote-by- mail. I used to be a local reporter in Seattle, so I knew that everybody would drop their ballots off or mail them in. There were very few polling places to speak of, and if you're using an example of Seattle or Portland, both those counties where those huge populations are, those election officials told me that less than 1% of voters actually vote in person at a polling place. So you can imagine, most everyone drops these off, and so they're very used to having to secure these. They're bolted into the ground. A lot of them are made by the same company, Vote Armor. So there are a lot of protective features to these drop boxes. Of course, authorities are very concerned about what more could potentially happen around this election, Erica.",

Ending them is a principled decision, and it's the right one.\" Well, the decision itself has outraged journalists across the country, as well as scores of \"Post\" readers.

He's doing this as a principled decision, but he's doing it on the eve of an election. And that's really the issue at the heart of this. He acknowledges maybe he had some poor timing, maybe he should have announced this earlier, but he's doing it because he wants to win back people's trust over time. In the short term, though, he's lost a lot of his audience's trust. There's hard pressure, a quid pro quo, a deal with Trump, and then there's a form of soft pressure. And the real concern I'm hearing from \"Post\" reporters, from editors, from columnists, is that there's a form of soft pressure being applied here. The author of \"On Tyranny,\" Timothy Snyder, has talked for years about the idea of obeying in advance, that in democracies that are sliding toward autocracies, people try to obey in advance, that wealthy businessmen, the media leaders, the powerful people, start to give in to the aspiring authoritarian whims in advance.
