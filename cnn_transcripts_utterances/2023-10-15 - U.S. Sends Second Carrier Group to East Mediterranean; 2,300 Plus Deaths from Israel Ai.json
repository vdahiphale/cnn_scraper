The IDF says, it struck more than 100 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met soldiers on the front lines, offering words of support, and telling them to be prepared.The U.S. is now sending a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as additional fighter jets. The move is intended to deter Iran, Hezbollah and others from entering the conflict. Palestinian authorities in Gaza say, the death toll from Israeli airstrikes is now more than 2,300 people, including 300 in the past 24 hours. It follows the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel last Saturday which killed more than 1,300 people. Now, we have CNN's Sara Sidner, who's joining us live this hour from Southern Israel. So, tell us exactly, Sara, where you are right now. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  I cannot give you an exact location because this -- if I were to do so, there is the possibility that Hamas would fire rockets in this direction and then the communities around us would be in danger. Where I am though, and where I'm standing is a very significant place because of the equipment that is here. It is the Iron Dome that you see behind me. That is a lifesaving technology that has taken out at about 90 percent of the rockets or more that have come over Israel of being shot by Hamas from Gaza. It is a pretty incredible technology. In 2011, it was the first time that the technology was used to see just how accurate it was. It worked. And since then, it has been used ever since in any incursion in any time there is a rocket fired from Gaza. So, you look at it, it actually -- when you get here, it doesn't look like much. It looks, you know, sort of, just -- you see there, it's just, sort of, a rectangle shaped piece of equipment, but it saved lives. And truthfully, yesterday when we were on the air and there were rockets flying over more than 10 flew over us while we were live on television, we watched right above our heads, the intercept happened. I mean, literally above our heads, it saved our behinds to be fair. And keeps the rockets from damaging things, from killing people, maiming people. And so, this technology has been used over and over and over again. It was developed here. The United States, of course, has given its monies so that they can keep building them, and there are quite a few of them. We can only show you one. We don't want to give away where we are. These are in many different parts of the country here in Israel. But it is such an incredible piece of technology that truly, truly saves lives. Also, you may notice it is raining here and has been for a bit which does not complicate things at all for the Iron Dome. It can operate in any kind of weather.",

So first, just give us an update on the ongoing raids in Gaza.LT. COL. PETER LERNER, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  Yes, I was just listening to Sara there. And, you know, you cannot be unimpressed by how Israel goes around investing in life and saving lives. And this Iron Dome defense mechanism is just one of those examples of the extent we go. Moving on to what you asked, yes, the IDF is continuing its activities and expanding our strikes against Hamas from their leaders. I can report that over the night, we killed Bilal El-Kidra. He, he was a Khan Yunis special forces commando from the Nukhba Force. He was one of the commanders that broke the -- that penetrated defense and conducted the massacre in Kibbutz near Re'im. We are very, very determined to take out the terrorists that conducted the attack, take out the organization that orchestrated it, and even take out the leader who is the mastermind of the massacre, Yahya Sinwar, who is orchestrated and governs the Gaza Strip as a staging ground for terrorism and utilized all the forces of Hamas's government to do so.",

So, to the people, I would say, listen to our announcements. Evacuate areas what -- when we tell you to move south.And I'm very happy to see that people are actually listening to us and not listening to Hamas because they understand that Hamas has failed them. They understand that Hamas has not been a good representative, a good government for their interests. You know, Hamas, over the course of the last 15, 16 years, could have made Gaza flourish, could have made the people of Gaza benefit from being our neighbors. But they chose to take all of their institutions. The whole system of the Hamas government was a cyphering off machine in order to build the death machine that Yahya Sinwar has developed in order to conduct that massacre on Friday of the 7th of October. So, ultimately, people of Gaza need to listen to what we're saying. They are not our enemy. Hamas is our enemy, and we are determined to destroy them and their capabilities.",

As we see the U.S. military here bolster up its forces in the Middle East as Israel's war prepares to enter what officials there have called a bigger stage, the next stage here.So, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group, which is the carrier, several destroyers and a cruiser, is already in the Eastern Med and arrived there earlier this week. That will now be joined by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group. Elements of that group, including the carrier, left Naval Station Norfolk on Friday, so that will arrive in the region in a couple of weeks. It is a very significant statement for the U.S. to send two carrier strike groups all the force and power that entails to the Eastern Med. Now, in doing so, the White House and the Pentagon have made clear it is not the role of the aircraft on this deck or the warships here to get involved in the fighting with Israel. Israel doesn't want that, and the U.S. doesn't want that. But the Biden administration, Israel and the region are watching this very closely and watching the fight play out in Gaza, and trying to make sure it doesn't spread beyond Israel's borders to other areas. And the key message there is to Iran, and that's who the point is of sending these forces to the region. A warning to Iran not to get involved. A warning to Iranian proxies not to get involved. Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iranian backed Shiite proxies in Syria that could open fire on Israel. So, that's who the recipient of this message is. The U.S. also has other forces in the region. It has plussed up some fighter squadrons, F-15s arriving just a couple of days ago here, and perhaps more fighters expected. And there's also the USS Bataan, part of an amphibious ready group that's also in the region, and could be ordered closer to Israel in case -- essentially as a message to Iran, and in case this escalates.

So, they're fearful in their homes.And imagine going through that process in those final stages, in your last trimester, before giving birth, with possible complications, without clothing, without hygiene support, and not sure about what the next day, next hour, next minute will bring for themselves and for their unborn child.",
