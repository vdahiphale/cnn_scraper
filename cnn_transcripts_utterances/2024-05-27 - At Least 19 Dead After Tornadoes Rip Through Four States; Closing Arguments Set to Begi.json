      "sentences": "Yes, Rahel. Well, the same storms that struck Kentucky yesterday have advanced a little further to the south and east. This is our severe weather threat for the day, which, by the way, encompasses over 120 million Americans. The reason for that is because of these large population densities across the mid- Atlantic, including our nation's capital, New York, Philadelphia, stretching all the way to the southeast, and that's inclusive of Atlanta under this slight risk of storms. The threats today, a few tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail, all possible within these locations.Here's a tornado that struck the Hopkins County region. This is Dawson Springs, Kentucky. And if you recall, back in December of 2021, this area was ravaged by an EF-4 tornado. To see yet another tornado come through the same exact location is truly heartbreaking. Now, Kentucky has the highest number of customers without power, but look at how many states are impacted, over 600,000 customers without power this morning. They wake up on this holiday Memorial Day and they are just, of course, having to deal with that. Now, we're considering a watch box, a tornado or severe thunderstorm watch box across Central Georgia. More on that to come, getting bits of information from the Storm Prediction Center. But we still do have severe thunderstorm and tornado watches across portions of Mississippi and Alabama, a few severe thunderstorm watches, but no tornado warnings at the moment across the area. But look at this, we've had over 1,000 reports of severe weather through the course of this weekend, an extended holiday weekend, and many people outdoors being caught off guard with these storms that are advancing eastward. And then we recycle that severe weather threat tomorrow into the state of Texas, where, of course, we have a heat wave that is still ongoing. Look at these heat indexes. This is what it'll feel like as you step outside on your skin, Rahel, over 115 degrees Fahrenheit. So, all kinds of threats facing the nation this morning.",

In this area alone, seven people were killed, four of those victims, young children. And we spent a yesterday in the neighborhoods that were so ravaged by the storm and we spoke with many residents who said, you know, they had they had some time of warning, preparing for what was coming.

That effort will continue today. The debris cleanup here at this gas station will continue. And it was widespread. This tornado spent a considerable amount of time along the ground here in North Texas. Also, a few miles from where we are, Marina at a popular lake, was destroyed with boats overturned and all the extensive damage there as well. So, you know, terrifying moments.
