I'm Jessica Dean alongside Boris Sanchez today, and we are witnessing a domino effect in Alabama after the state Supreme Court ruled frozen embryos are children. That means today, two more health centers announced that they are pausing, some types of IVF treatment, bringing the total number of clinics putting a hold there to three.Advocates for reproductive rights warn that this ruling would have devastating consequences. And now the Biden campaign is calling Alabama's decision, quote, a blueprint for Republicans extreme MAGA reproductive agenda. This hour, we're expecting to hear from Vice President Kamala Harris as she attends a reproductive rights event in Michigan. Let's start with CNN health reporter Meg Tirrell on more about the fallout in Alabama. Meg, what are these two additional providers saying about their decision?",

They are concerned about potential criminal prosecution for essentially carrying out IVF in the wake of that state Supreme Court decision that found that frozen embryos legally are considered people. Now, the University of Alabama at Birmingham was the first yesterday to announce it was pausing IVF services. They've been joined today by Alabama fertility specialists and the Center for Reproductive Medicine, Infirmary Health in Mobile.Now, the clinics say that they are advocating for their patients. Alabama fertility specialists say that they're working hard to alert their legislators to the far-reaching impacts here. But they really are concerned about the legal ramifications. And there's so much uncertainty going on right now, not just for performing IVF, but also about the current, currently stored frozen embryos that these clinics have. What will be the future of those? We've reached out to Alabama's Attorney General's office to try to get any legal clarity. And they said as of now, they have not put out anything on this in terms of guidance, even though we imagine there must be a huge outreach from clinics trying to get guidance as to how to go forward here, guys.",

They say they've seen state legislatures replicate one and other's reproductive healthcare policies in an ill-advised attempt to compete for the most restrictive and harmful laws.They say the outcome of this case will certainly affect access to fertility treatment across the country. So, I think that's a big question concern among fertility care providers. And, of course, patients who are desperately trying to have children using IVF about what this will mean.",

That doesn't defend it, but it does suggest that they have some sense of what happened.My service was down, it's back up now and they're able to fix it. My biggest concern now from a security and safety perspective is not the vulnerabilities which we always knew, it's first net. First net, people are probably hearing about first net today, is a dedicated system available for first responders, firefighters, emergency managers, police officers that was created in the wake of 9-11 when all those systems went down. And it's a dedicated way for first responders to communicate with each other. That also went down. AT&amp;T and the other services have always made representations that that service is unlikely to go down. And we see the consequences of it.

Russia never accepted that definition of its lessening of power, especially through the last 12 years of his more-than-two-decade rule. Vladimir Putin has gone about trying to reverse that perception to show Russian influence in the old Soviet bloc and across the world. So, you've seen the invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, Russian military dispatched to Syria, mercenaries in Africa, and you've seen the meddling in U.S. elections, constantly trying to test the U.S. to compromise U.S. power.I think what people miss is it's not necessarily whether Putin wants President Biden in office or Donald Trump in office. It's he wants chaos. He wants to sow divisions between Americans to exacerbate existing divisions to make it more difficult for the U.S. to wield power across the world. And we're seeing that right now in Congress. The fact that there's a stalemate over the $60 billion for Ukraine, which, you know, is very important to Russia, obviously, and Putin's meddling has in some ways enabled all this.",

There's great concern in Europe, for example, particularly fostered by former President Trump's remarks about NATO recently, that a second Trump term would be even more disruptive than the first. It's not necessarily ideological. You know, for 70, 80 years, you've had liberal Democratic presidents and conservative Republican presidents.And Europe and everyone else has been able to live with that. The point here, though, is that what allies want is stability. And what Donald Trump deals in is volatility. People can't guarantee what he's going to do next. That, in many ways, is the source of his political strength. But that's very unsettling if you're a U.S. ally, especially when you have leaders like former President Trump cozying up to Putin.

What we've seen is a lot of governors come out, Governor Brian Kemp in Georgia, a good example, making clear that he was going to protect this. I think that's the smart place for Republicans to be.We've seen in election after election, we could talk about Todd Akin and Richard Murdoch in past Senate cycles, that cost the Senate seats, where Republicans have been really penalized for extreme and, frankly, crazy rhetoric when it comes to abortion. And rape and things like that, to where it not only hurts those candidates, it hurts other candidates because they now have to talk about it as well. This puts them,  some Republicans, in an opportunity to talk about sane policies, as opposed to being defined by the most insane things that we've seen coming from certain states. The farther any state goes, whether it's a six-week ban or something like this, the more it tends to define the national agenda. It's up to Republicans individually and then collectively to say, this is what we're for. And this is where the American people are. If you can get to that safe space, you can be okay. And, Jamal, quickly, before we let you go, in that vein, the Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan today, a key swing state, she's on this reproductive freedoms tour. The White House, or rather the campaign, has made a big push to use her in this way. They feel like she's very effective in this way. Do you expect that this will be effective in moving some of these more independent voters that they're going to need to win a place like Michigan, or even turnout.",

She went all over the country and talked about it. And people said, stop talking about it. Talk about the economy instead. The Vice President continued to talk about it. The President talked about democracy. And Democrats did pretty well in the 2022 midterms.So what I think the White House is banking on is that this is going to happen again. And that when Americans hear what happens in Alabama where IVF may be taken away from so many families, where in Texas a woman who clearly needs to have abortion services because she has a fetus that won't survive is told no, she can't do that. And, you know, 10-year-old girls who have been raped by family members can't get the reproductive care they need.  When that happens, that puts uncertainty under everybody's skin.
