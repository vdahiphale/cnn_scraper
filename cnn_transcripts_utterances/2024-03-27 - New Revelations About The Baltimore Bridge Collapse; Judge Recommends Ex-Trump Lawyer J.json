Baltimore native Mike Rowe is here to talk about the underappreciated migrant bridge workers doing a dangerous job in the middle of the night. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"We're learning much more tonight about the devastating and deadly bridge crash in Baltimore. Now, the headlines from the NTSB press conference tonight, 21 crew members and two pilots were on board the Dali cargo ship when it crashed into the Key Bridge. Six construction workers on the bridge presumed dead. The NTSB interviewed the ship's captain, his mate, the chief engineer, and one other engineer today. The ship's cargo, well, it included 764 tons of hazardous materials. Some of the hazmat containers were breached, others seen in the water. The bridge did not have any redundancy, which is the preferred method for building bridges today, and that means that one point of failure could take down a portion or the entire bridge. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy says the investigation could take up to two years. But the human cost of all of this, frankly, it's almost incalculable. In a moment, Mike Rowe joins me to talk about what this means for a Baltimore community and the families who depended on tough jobs on the bridge. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Investigators were on board the MV Dali today, and they say that they have been able to determine that there was some sort of power outage on board the ship, although they do not yet know the cause.The big stumbling block right now is the voyage data recorder, the ship's black box. It only records limited parameters, a few things like the engine RPM, the position of the ship's rudder, and the heading of the ship's bow.

There are three spans of the bridge, one on each side, and then a center truss portion with two pylons at each end of that center truss portion. It's almost like domino effect, and the ship took down one of those pylons, and because that pylon got taken out, the rest of the bridge came down.It is a sad reality, Homendy says, that the Key Bridge is not alone in the United States. There are 17,000 more bridges like this in the U.S. It is the norm now to make bridges redundant. So, this is sort of an older style when this bridge came to be about 47 years ago. Right now, the NTSB is looking at the records of this bridge. They say it was last inspected May of 2023, so not all that long ago, and it was in satisfactory condition then.",

They're just trying to raise as much money as possible to make sure that Biden is in good position and that his campaign has what it needs because, you know, the message that Obama in particular has been sending when people ask him about this is it's going to be really tough. The overall message that they're trying to send, though, by all appearing together is one of unity and one of really trying to say the entire Democratic Party, all of these past presidents, you know, are here with Biden, it's really important to support him, and there is, of course, an implied message. It's, you know, certainly not lost on them that previous Republican presidents, even his own vice president, are not with the alternative, and that's Donald Trump. So, there's a little bit of, you know, multilayering here. But again, the primary goal, raise a lot of money, and it's pretty clear that they're going to do that.",

I mean, he really is. He was when he was president and also still is, especially among Black and Latino voters, and younger voters as well. I'm wondering, though, I was talking to Chris Wallace earlier this evening, and his statement was something like, well, the popularity he has is necessarily translated, he can't bestow it on somebody else. Can he send some of that to Biden? Will it stick? ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, when you're building a campaign, you want to have surrogates and trusted messengers. And like it or not, President Obama is still one of the most famous individuals in the world and definitely in American politics. And so, I do think there are voters, some who voted for the first time for Obama and never came back, back to the Democratic Party or back to democracy and cast a vote. And he could potentially be the person to reach out and say, listen, folks, not just the president, President Obama, but the first lady as well, listen, folks, we have a job to do, let me explain to you why this is just as important as voting for me as it is to vote for Joe Biden. And so, to the point of being all-hands-on deck, that's what the president is doing because he knows the stakes of this election if Joe Biden does not win, not just because of Donald Trump, but also because of third party candidates. So, the Democratic Party, it's great that they have these past presidents and are able to continue to build their robust coalition with this diverse set of formers, but it's also important that they can talk to various communities, Bill Clinton being some and President Obama.",

I mean, we can't forget that in 2008, they actually briefly ran against each other before they, of course, spent eight years together in the White House. They didn't always see together, see eye to eye together. You know, in 2016, Biden was quite hurt that President Obama quite clearly preferred Hillary Clinton over him for a number of personal and political reasons that were going on at the time.But then you look at 2020 and Obama was skeptical of the idea that Biden was the right person for the party and for the country at the moment. He did not endorse him during the primary, though he was keeping in touch with Biden, he was willing to be helpful. He only came out and fully endorsed Biden once that primary was over, and he did help him get over the line there at the end. But what was not publicly appreciated at the time was just how much work Obama was doing for Biden behind the scenes once Biden did become the nominee in 2020, partially because he likes Biden and partially because he thinks that's the responsibility of someone like himself and all of his, you know, fame and influence, but also because of the threat that he perceives in Donald Trump. He really thinks that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy and a threat to the country. So, it's important to remember that there are a lot of people around Biden who are also former Obama people. The two of them certainly keep in touch. But even more than that, Obama and those around Obama still do talk to the people who are running the Biden operation just to make sure that they're all on the same page, that they're seeing everything eye to eye strategically, and I expect that that's going to be the same now. So why now? Because Obama does perceive that this is the time that is needed. You need a lot of time to build up credibility with a lot of these voters who are questioning whether Biden is ready for this election.",

Some people who could be put back on the right path after committing an individual first or second offense may have benefited from that, but those who have those certain crimes that they commit as their profession have benefited from it a great deal. Take two numbers into stride here. Last year, there were 64 assaults on transit workers in the subway system. Thirty-eight of those cases resulted in arrests. And when you take those suspects and you run their records, they have a collective 1,100 prior arrests together. These are people who go into the subways to commit crimes on a regular basis, and the system is not dealing with them in a way that makes them less of a danger to the community. The second one is a more benign crime but very concerning to business, which is shoplifting. You've got 543 people who have been arrested and charged with shoplifting 7,500 times, and their universe of arrests when taken together is 31,000. That's like 57 per person.

And the answer was a shocking 40%. Now, the important caveat here, Laura, and I know you know this, people suffering from mental health issues are no more likely or prone to violence than anyone else in society. But in a city of 8.6 million with a serious homeless problem or the subset of people who suffer from mental illness has been a struggle for the city, the mayor has been fighting with Albany for two years now to get them to pass legislation that makes it more effective to get people committed to hospitals for treatment, and then to mandate treatment and after care on an outpatient basis, and still fighting to get that passed.

He says that it's so bad that he is -- quote -- \"losing the will to play.\" Now, you're probably thinking, all right, well, that's just Europe. All right, well, let's go to Idaho. The University of Utah's women's basketball team is on the road for the NCAA tournament in Idaho, and they're just trying to go out for a team dinner when they say a truck flying a confederate flag pulls up alongside them and people start shouting racist language, the N-word. And then after dinner, they say it happens again. This time, the driver brought reinforcement, engines revving, people shouting and threatening the team. So, what, then they're supposed to go back to the hotel and just say it's all fine? Wake up in the morning to play and then win, and not be afraid of retaliation if they do? But how, when they're afraid that they could be harmed by the people they say threaten them, all while they're what, 18, 19 years old? These are students in college to learn and to grow and to excel at their sport while under a tremendous microscope. They're just kids, and they just want to play. And their head coach was visibly upset when she addressed it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LYNNE ROBERTS, HEAD COACH, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: Racism is real. And it happens. And it's awful. It was really upsetting. And for our players and staff to not feel safe in an NCAA tournament environment, it's messed up. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You couldn't travel to other countries because everything is the same.That's the beauty of the world we live in, is that there's different races, different cultures. I love going to different countries traveling because I can see something different and learn something new.
