Russia is accusing Ukraine of strikes on two airfields. What is your government's response to this allegation? YURIY SAK, ADVISER TO UKRAINE'S DEFENSE MINISTER:  Good evening, and thank you for having me. The general staff of the Ukrainian armed forces which is exclusively and solely responsible for planning and executing all military operations on the frontlines has not yet provided any official comments. So, we will have to wait and see, you know, what is their official position. But what you have rightly said in the report earlier is the fact that, regardless of the origin of these incidents, what is important to note is the weakness of Russian air defense systems, that's number one. And number two, actually I watched a report on CNN just yesterday in which Russian soldiers who are fighting Russian nationals that were fighting in Ukraine against Russia, they were trying to protect and helping Ukrainians protect ourselves from the Russian enemy. So we could imagine that there are a lot of Russians inside Russia who are also discontent with what is happening there. And you know, I'm not saying that we know this for a fact.

That was Pablo Sarabia, then Carlos Soler was saved. That was a pretty tamed penalty though, easy high for the goalkeeper to save. And then their third pen, Sergio Busquets, easy to save as well. Which meant that it all came down to Achraf Hakimi who won it with the most audacious thing, right down the middle. That's a Panenka. That's what that penalty is described as. And he is just an extraordinary story. He was actually born in Spain. He spent his childhood in Madrid. And here he is stepping up with the opportunity to knock the country of his birth out of the World Cup. Achraf Hakimi has done it.

No living together for unmarried couples and no criticizing the government. Those are just some of the provisions of a new criminal law in Indonesia, which can get you thrown in prison. Human rights groups are calling it appalling. CNN's Anna Coren has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN REPORTER (on camera):  The Indonesian parliament has made sweeping changes to its criminal code which critics fear could harm democratic freedoms and police morality in the world's third largest democracy. Offenses that will now be criminalized in what has been a predominantly moderate Islamic country include sex outside of marriage, the law will apply not only to Indonesian citizens, but also foreigners living in the country as well as tourists. Those found guilty could face a year in prison. Other jailable offences under these new penal code are cohabitation among unmarried and LGBTQ couples, blasphemy, apostasy as well as criticizing the president, the government or other state institutions. Human rights groups say they are very concerned about the direction that Indonesia is heading, with the rise of ultra-conservative Islam in the nation's politics as it adopts what they say are Sharia-inspired laws, fearing that minority groups will be targeted. Critics are calling these new laws troublesome and counterproductive, and say they could impact tourism especially for the island of Bali, which relies heavily on western tourists for its economy. Well, it's unknown how this new criminal code will be enforced, the Indonesian justice minister says, there will be intensive outreach to police, prosecutors, lawyers and advocates. And that the laws will come into place in 3 years time. Anna Coren, CNN, Hong Kong. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

A new study finds that, if you are getting more than a quarter of your daily calories from ultraprocessed foods like those found in fast food meals, you've got a higher risk of developing dementia. Let's bring in CNN medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula to discuss how to sever this link. I have to say, at some point in our, lives we start worrying about cognitive decline. It's not great news for people who do enjoy fast food in terms of the link. But it's about processed food. What is defined as processed? DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right, it's actually about ultraprocessed foods. When you think about unprocessed, we're talking about vegetables, fruits, legumes, beans, fish, certain types of meat, eggs. So that's unprocessed, that's really the healthiest. Ultraprocessed are going to be things like pizza, ice cream, candy, soda, burgers, French fries, processed meat. So all the things, as you, mentioned that so many of us love to eat. Our kids love to eat. Unfortunately, in general, these types of food tend to be loaded with saturated fat, trans fats, sugar and salt, really low on nutrient value. They make up a large proportion of the calories consumed in the Western world. So for example, 58 percent of calories in the American diet come from ultraprocessed food. That's about 57 percent for those who live in Britain. So this is a big part of our consumption. Really, it's problematic. We know there's a link in general with cardiovascular disease, obesity and cancer. What we haven't looked at yet is cognitive decline. This is the first study, as you, mentioned to look at that.

Really what researchers, did they took about 10,000 adults living in Brazil. They gave them a food questionnaire and then they followed them for an average of about eight years. These adults were about 50 years old. They gave them cognitive tests. They found as you mentioned in the beginning, that if their diet had a daily consumption of over 20 percent of calories coming from ultraprocessed foods, they had a faster rate of global cognitive function decline and also what we call executive function, the part of our brains that is so important for processing information and making decisions.

The family of an officer who died after responding to the riot was there. But as they went up to accept his gold medal, they refused to shake hands with White House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and CNN Republican leader Mitch McConnell.. CNN asked the officer's mother why and she accused the two leaders of being two-faced and being too close to former president Donald Trump. Now in the U.S. state of Georgia, it's Election Day. And at stake is outright control of the U.S. Senate. Democratic incumbent senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker are facing off in the high stakes runoff. If. Warnock wins it will give Democrats an outright majority and end the power sharing agreement that is currently in place. But Walker is a revered former Georgia football player. And all indications are, the race will be very tight. CNN's Amara Walker joins us now from a polling station just outside of Atlanta. Always good to see. You this is a pivotal election for control of the U.S. Senate. What are you seeing on the ground?",

This is a county that was oncesolidly Republican and now it's slightly leaning Democratic. When you saw what happened in November, there was a lot of ticket splitting. You had a lot of Republicans or independents voting for the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, not casting their vote for the Republican Senate challenger, Herschel Walker. The question will be, for this runoff, if he will be able to pick up ground from Kemp's voters today.",
