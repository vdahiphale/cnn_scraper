Earlier this morning during a news conference wrapping his trip to the G7 summit in Japan, President Biden called, once again, for Republicans to move toward a debt limit deal.

It's legal, go for it. The president acknowledging that he doesn't think necessarily on the legal grounds, they're wrong.

The state Senate could pass it as early as this week, which means that abortion will be banned or severely limited in the entire southeast region of the country. This is a story that keeps on going.

And so the party spoke with one consistent voice for half a century on this. And then the Roe gets overturned by the Supreme Court. It goes back to the states. We see all these legislatures and governors trying different things here and it's why you see a Republican presidential field not all singing from the same hymn book now. They are now trying to navigate how you run as a federal candidate for president in a post-Roe world, which was supposed to return this issue to and you see it's sort of a cacophony of ideas right now.",

A lot of judicial decisions still to come down. Florida, one of many states where courts are considering whether some of these bans that have passed are legal according to state constitutions or other legal challenges to them. So it just means this issue and then, of course, you have the tragic horror stories that continue to come out from women who've been denied abortions and been in really horrible situations. So this is just going to be an issue that continues to be in the news that the candidates continue to answer for. And so far, even Republicans have tried to make an argument that Democrats are the ones in an extreme position, tried to make them answer for some of the controversy surrounding late term abortion.
