And tonight, CNN puts a voice and a face to the key facts that you can read on paper in that case against Donald Trump. Meet Brian Butler, he's also known as employee number 5 in the criminal indictment from special counsel Jack Smith. Butler is not a random person who Trump can suddenly claim he doesn't know. He knows Trump and has known him for 21 years since he took a job as a seasonal valet at Mar-a-Lago. He has years of pictures and messages with everyone important in the Trump orbit. He worked hundreds of feet away from Carlos de Oliveira, the other Mar-a-Lago employee who was indicted alongside Trump, and they took nightly walks together. They were friends. But their paths now look very different. De Oliveira is alleged to have lied to investigators. Meanwhile, Butler has cooperated, and he is helping prosecutors to fill in these gaps about how Trump and his co-conspirators mishandled classified materials and how Trump and his employees lied to federal investigators about those documents, about how Trump sought out loyalty from all of his people. Butler corroborates two important episodes that are told in that indictment. First, how Trump told an Australian billionaire classified submarine secrets, and also how boxes were moved the very same day that attorneys for the former president swore in documents that they had turned them all over, all of the documents that bore classified markings, back to the government. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN BUTLER, TRUMP EMPLOYEE 5: And then what happened is Walt left before me, and he never goes directly to the plane. He's either in the motorcade when he goes there with the boss, which the former president. And I remember telling him he left the club with -- I didn't know what he had in his vehicle, but he waited for me at a nearby business, and I told him I would tell him when I was leaving Mar-a-Lago. So, I left Mar-a-Lago, I texted him, hey, I'm on my way. He followed me, he pulled out and got behind me. We got to the airport, I ended up loading all the luggage I had, and he had a bunch of boxes.",

Here is a person that was in Donald Trump's orbit for years and years, decades, in fact, and puts people at the scene, at these critical junctures. This is not someone who's got second-hand or third-hand information. He's there on the ground, and that's what's going to make it really tough for Trump and his allies to disavow Butler. Now, their typical order of operations here is when someone close to them turns against them, they do everything possible to paint that person as an outsider, someone who wasn't privy to sensitive information and sensitive places, but it's clear that Butler was privy to those things. He was privy to those things for years and, in fact, was literally the man with his hands on the boxes. When this case first broke open, that was the thing we were saying would be the closest we might get to a smoking gun is someone who saw the boxes moved or security camera footage, and it does seem like Brian Butler really has compelling testimony to that effect.",

Not just me, but a lot of other people I know who've done this have lost homes and jobs and life savings and their families have been threatened for doing this. And in this case, a very, very significant case of national security, Brian Butler has turned against his former boss and he can expect those types of repercussions.And I'm sure that Donald Trump and his allies will try to do the same thing in mob boss-like fashion, as they've done to other people. So, I would commend him. But I also think there's a bigger lesson here, Abby, and that's for people who are still in the ex-president's orbit that it's never too late to do the right thing and that it's possible to come forward and have a clear conscience instead of a criminal conviction, which is the choice that Brian Butler has made is to try to avoid going down with some of those folks around Donald Trump who appear to have engaged in potentially unlawful behavior and instead come forward with that information.

Trump's budgets in office did not want to leave Social Security and Medicare alone. In 2020, his budget spelled out in black and white that he wanted to spend trillions of dollars less on both programs. Now, today was not an aberration.

      "sentences": "In what would truly be an extraordinary move, one of America's most popular apps may be banned by the United States government. The House set to pass a bill banning the use of TikTok unless the app's parent company severs ties with China.Security officials have been warning that TikTok poses a national security threat. But this legislation is making for some strange bedfellows in Washington. For instance, Donald Trump and some of the so-called squad members, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are against the ban. Others include Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. Now, it's worth noting that Trump has actually flip-flopped on this issue since he was the one who initially tried to ban the app when he was President through an executive order that would later be struck down. Now, on the other side of it is Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the House, the bipartisan group of lawmakers who introduced the bill and several conservative groups who are all for the ban. So, stuck in the middle? Some senators who want to water down the legislation and what about President Biden? Well, he says that he's going to sign the bill if Congress ends up passing it. That contradicts his own campaign, which just recently launched a TikTok channel last month. Joining me now is Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz of Florida. Congressman, thanks for being here. You've had an interesting evolution on the issue of TikTok. You are now in favor of a ban, but previously you were not. Why the change of opinion? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): No, thanks, Abby. Thanks for having me. Yeah, I mean, look, I think the evidence has come out that it's -- and we're going to be briefed on it. And you saw the vote come out of Committee in a bipartisan fashion last week, 50 to zero. I can tell you 50 to zero votes that on a bipartisan basis out of Committee happened so far and few between. And then all of Congress is going to get a briefing from intelligence officials next week. And so, you know, look, this bill is not a ban of TikTok. But what it will do is it will force the sale to a U.S. company to get Chinese influence out from underneath of TikTok. One of the things that convinced me is, you know, talking to parents of kids that are on this like digital fentanyl. And another thing that convinced me was after the October 7th war to see all of the misinformation that was being spread on TikTok intentionally meant to divide the American public and cause more dissension here at home.",

I think if the United States does do this, we should expect China could retaliate with U.S. companies doing business in China. But look, I look forward to the briefing. I am leaning towards voting for the bill. I do think it's come time to start putting our foot down with how these algorithms are feeding, whether it's information or misinformation, but with an intent, I think, to cause problems here at home, to try to divide the American people, to try to get us fighting amongst ourselves so that we have less time to deal with adversaries.

I mean, look, he ultimately concluded President Biden did not do anything wrong with the classified documents, instead decided to put the President on a couch and become America's psychologist.And so, I imagine what Republicans are going to do tomorrow and they are going to use Robert Hur and you know what? He may go along with it. He may want to be used of this idea of trying to show that President Biden is too old or at times has had, you know, gas that they're going to try to exploit. I think the State of the Union, you know, put a pump to pick the big hole in in that theory that Republicans want to kind of continue to push out there that the President's not with it or he's too old. I mean, every day we see President Trump have the same sort of gaffe, whether he calls his wife Mercedes or he says President Biden is going to start World War Two, which happened in the 40s, or he misses up, you know, the leaders of Hungary and Turkey. So look, both of these gentlemen are old. Both of these guys have made gaffes before verbally. And so, you know, but that's what Republicans are going to try to do here with Robert Hur. He's not going to give them anything on these classified documents. And in fact, we just heard that employee number five, you know, in the Trump classified documents issue, has just come out and talked about how they intentionally tried to keep those documents away from the Justice Department. And so, the evidence on Trump is overwhelming. But my guess is tomorrow Herr is just going to try to tell the American people the same thing that Republicans are trying to do is say that President Biden doesn't have the mental acuity.
