And when we did, we spent the money necessary so we wouldn't end up in a Great Depression, the likes of which we had in 1929.  By the time we finished -- so we did a great job.  We got a lot of credit for the economy, a lot of credit for the military, and no wars and so many other things.  Everything was rocking good. But the thing we never got the credit for and we should have is getting us out of that COVID mess.  He created mandates that was a disaster for our country.  But other than that, we had -- we had given them back a -- a country where the stock market actually was higher than pre-COVID.  And nobody thought that was even possible.

And so he's got no love lost. But he should have fired those generals. No general got fired for the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, Afghanistan, where we left billions of dollars of equipment behind.

If he thought they were good people coming out of that all -- that for us, carrying those -- those woods, carrying those torches, then he didn't deserve to be president, didn't deserve to be president at all. And the idea that he's talking about all of this being fabricated, we saw it with our own eyes. We saw what happened on January 6. We saw the people breaking to the windows. We saw people occupying there. His own vice president -- look, there's a reason why 40 of his 44 top cabinet officers refused endorsing this time. His vice president hasn't endorsed him this time. So, why? Why? They know him well. They serve with them. Why are they not endorsing him?",

President Biden, while black unemployment dropped to a record low under your presidency, black families still earn far less than white families. Black mothers are still three times more likely to die for pregnancy related causes. And black Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans. What do you say to black voters who are disappointed that you haven't made more progress?",

Number two, the wages of black -- black unemployment is the lowest level of spend in a long, long time. Number three, we find them -- they're trying to provide housing for black Americans and dealing with segregation that exists among these corporate -- these corporate operations that collude to keep people out of their houses.And in addition to that, we find that the impact of, on the -- the choice that black families have to make relative to childcare is incredibly difficult. When we did the first major piece of legislation in the past, I was able to reduce black childcare costs. I cut them in half, in half. We've got to make sure we provide for childcare costs. We've got to make sure -- because when you provide that childcare protections, you increase economic growth because more people can be in the -- in the job market. So there's more to be done, considerably more to be done, but we've done a great deal so far and I'm not letting up and they know it.",

I gave him a country with no, essentially no inflation. It was perfect. It was so good. All he had to do is leave it alone. He destroyed it with his green news scam and all of the other -- all this money that's being thrown out the window. He caused inflation. As sure as you're sitting there, the fact is that his big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking black jobs now and it could be 18. It could be 19 and even 20 million people.
