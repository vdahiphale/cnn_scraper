(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LEE ZELDIN, (R), FORMER CONGRESSMAN &amp; TRUMP PICK TO LEAD THE EPA: I think it would be very productive if -- you know, if we could just get to exactly what is real and what is not real. Because I think both sides of the climate change debate are filled with people that are stretching truths. I'm not sold yet on the whole argument that we have as serious a problem with climate change as other people are. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, they are trying to Trump-proof it as fast as they can in these waning days of their presidency.Last night, trying to button down rules around methane emissions. This is the by-product of natural gas, a very common fuel. But when it leaks, it's 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of capturing gas in the short-term. It's about a third of the global warming problem right now, and the easiest to catch, capture and store underground or use in other ways. So he's trying to stick that in. It would take an act of Congress to roll it back. If the Republicans win the House, they could do that eventually anyway. But interesting news out of Baku today, as the environmentalists and those climate activists who are trying to manage this huge problem got an interesting ally in the CEO of ExxonMobil, the biggest oil company in the country. Dan Woods is one of the rare experts in Baku expressly trying to make the point to Donald Trump not to pull out of the Paris Accords. He did this unsuccessfully back in 2017, thinking that more fair regulations and less of a Wild West would benefit everybody. And ExxonMobil told CNN that a second U.S. exit from the Paris agreement would have profound implications for the U.S.'s efforts to reduce its own emissions and for international efforts to combat climate change, which Lee Zeldin isn't sure is happening. \"We advocate for policy that accounts for security, reliability and environmental stewardship -- not drastic changes that could hinder the progress being made today.\" So there are sort of practical, pragmatic arguments being made towards the Trump administration. But so far, he is indicating that he's stuck in the ideology that all oil is good, all renewables are bad, and everything the Biden administration did must be clawed back. The practical realities of that may be more difficult than Trump anticipates.",

RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE &amp; CNN ANCHOR, \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\": Well, if we take a rough number, I would say he's made just roughly $70 to $80 billion. If you look at the valuation of stock at, say, Tesla, and his other investments and the way the market has risen overall, he's worth now more than $330-odd billion. You've got one particular number there. You pay your money, you take your choice. He also shows $20 billion in a particular method, or particular methodology, but overall, it's probably essentially more than that. It's $50 billion, $60 billion, $70 billion.

That's going to boost corporate profitability. You're going to see an administration that is far more business friendly, and therefore creating an environment where companies will make more money. That will boost the stock market. Now, those warnings about the economy could go down. They are much longer term. They are going to be seen when tariffs, if and when they come in, they're going to be seen as a tit for tat from other countries. They're going to be seen in a much slower environment. There's no question that, in the short-term, the next administration is going to be far more business friendly, far more goosing up the economy, if you will.
