Employers added 253,000 jobs last month. That is significantly more than analysts had expected. And it shows the labor market is heating back up when other indicators pointed to a slowdown. The unemployment rate dropped from 3.5 percent to 3.4 percent, and that's tied for the lowest level since 1969. There are also signs of growing dissension in Russia's military ranks. The head of the Wagner group, the private military company leading the Russian siege in Bakhmut, has been criticizing the Kremlin for failing to give his fighters enough supplies. And now, he's threatening to pull of that battle entirely just as Ukraine is ready to start a potential counter-offensive. Jim?",

First of all, when they executed the searches at Bryan Kohberger'sapartment in Pullman, Washington, they tested over 60 reddish brown stains in that apartment, presumptive blood testing. This is preliminary testing. They actually found two stains that tested positive preliminarily for blood. And one was a reddish-brown stain on an uncased pillow -- in other words a pillow without a pillowcase -- and then a brown, irregular drip found on a mattress cover. Those stains were collected and then taken to the Idaho State Crime Lab for further testing. We don't know the results of that. They also said that when they were searching that apartment, that it was very sparse. It was as though it was empty of belongings. There wasn't a shower curtain in the bathroom. Nothing was in any trash can. But they did collect what was there. Also of note, in January, the defense team asked two times to go to that apartment with law enforcement. Kohberger had written -- given them authority to go in those two times. And they collected things -- they did, the defense -- such as a receipt inside a medicine cabinet. There was a box that had papers in it, a flat-screen television, a computer, also a small book of miscellaneous papers. So they have their items also, which is interesting.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, it is very early to figure out exactly why most of the oceanographers and climatologists that we talk to are befuddled by exactly why what is happening.But it's off-the-chart warm surface temperatures around the globe. We saw the results in Antarctica at the very bottom of the globe a few months ago, which has huge implications in terms of taking us more mass. Warmer water expands. That means more sea level rise on the coast. It's means more coral bleaching events. Reefs are the cradle of sea life. It means fish stocks moving, the way the cod left the Gulf of Maine because it got too warm for them. And of course, it means stronger hurricanes and cyclones as we head into those seasons as well. Among the causes, could it be El Nino starting early? La Nina cooled us off in the Pacific for the last couple of years, which, again, shows just how warm the oceans are. Either with La Nina where we were still hitting records, now off-the- chart records, and El Nino which will make things much warmer is just beginning. But one interesting possible culprit is the shipping industry, a cleaner shipping industry. In 2020, they changed the fuel mix of these big ocean liners, which means there's less sulfur coming out of the smokestacks of these ships. That sulfur was reflecting enough sunlight it was serving as sort of an accidental sunscreen. It might have been masking more global warming than we were aware of. Whether it is a half a degree, a full degree, nobody knows for sure. NOAA just went up in February to start taking the very first samples of the upper stratosphere to see whether wildfire, ash and smoke, volcanic eruptions, even space junk and rocket launches are affecting the top of the sky, which is affecting the temperature for the rest of us.",
