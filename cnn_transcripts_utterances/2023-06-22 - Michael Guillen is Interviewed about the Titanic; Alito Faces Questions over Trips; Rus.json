The Titan began its nearly 13,000-foot descent on Sunday morning, but the vessel and its five person crew vanished in less than two hours.This is not the first time that a mission to the Titanic shipwreck has gone awry. More than 20 years ago, then ABC News science editor Dr. Michael Guillen was sent on assignment all the way down to the Titanic in a submersible when he got stuck. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They've done -- they would know what to do in a situation like this. But you make a great point, there's nothing you can really do to some degree. When you are watching the captain of your ship operate, are there things that he was prepared for, are there protocols that you can go through, or is it really just try and make noise and pray?",

When we were prepping for the dive, up on - on the ship, the captain put us through a lot of orientation sessions and told us what might go wrong, told us stories about people in that situation when they panic and immediately they want to go to the escape hatch, which is, of course, a death sentence, because when you panic you're not thinking. So, I knew that when we collided, that's the thing I didn't want to do. I didn't wanted to go to that escape hatch. I wanted to make sure nobody else in that sub was. I was ready to gang tackle anybody who even looked at the escape hatch, right.But, no. I mean, and I think that's the hardest thing, ,especially for an intellectual like me who lives by the model, for every problem there is an optimal solution. I mean I've drummed that into my son's head. For every problem there's an optimal solution. And it is the most terrifying thing to experience coming to the conclusion, no, there ain't a solution. There's no optimal solution. There is not solution period. There's just no one around. And I - I imagine that at some point in these five folks who are in the Titan, they came to that realization. Even though you could have all the experience in the world, but at the end of the day, there's only so much you can do. And - and the idea that no amount of technology, no number of planes, ROVs, sonars, nothing, nothing can come to your rescue. If you're at the bottom of the ocean, two and a half miles down, you don't just go down there and reach in, even with a cable or a grappling hook. It's not that easy. The pressures are enormous. They're bone crushing. It's cold down there. And so I just feel that -- I've just been feeling for the last 72 hours this kinship with those people down there. And it's almost like I'm down there with them because I know what it's like down there. It's utterly dark. There's no light. You don't certainly want to light a candle or anything in there, you'd use up the oxygen. Whether they have flashlights or not, who knows. But this had to have been a catastrophic failure of some kind. And I'm not sure we'll ever, ever know because I'm not sure we'll ever recover that vessel.",

A trip that was paid for by a religious liberty group that has submitted briefs before the court in support of significant cases. This comes after \"ProPublica\" reported yesterday that Alito went on a luxury fishing trip with conservative hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who's repeatedly asked the court to intervene on his behalf. Alito did not disclose this trip on his annual financial disclosures and he did also not recuse himself from Singer's case before the court. Joining us now is CNN Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic.

      "sentences": "That's right, Poppy. Good morning to you and Phil.You know, travel is basically good. Especially when they go speak to groups, you know, it can have a very, you know, educational element to it. And even social travel, you know, up to Alaska is not in and of itself bad. It's who's footing the bill and whether the expense ends up getting reimbursed and disclosed on the annual financial forms that the justices disclose. You know, there's no such thing as a free lunch, and there's probably no such thing as a free trip to an Alaska fishing resort. And that was what was reported by \"ProPublica\" that you noted. And our colleagues today have new reporting about a trip that Samuel Alito took last year to Rome in which the Notre Dame Religious Liberty Initiative paid for that. And that's a group that, as you say, when you refer to groups filing briefs, they submitted an amicus brief in the Dobbs anti-abortion rights case and other. An amicus isn't a main party to the case, but someone who has a vested interest in it. And the Notre Dame Religious Liberty group has been submitting more and more briefs. And they acknowledge paying for Justice Alito's trip to Rome. Now, he may end up disclosing that one. He has gotten an extension to file on his current financial disclosure report. But this is what he said when my colleague, Devan Cole, reached out to the Supreme Court to find out, you know, why he took this trip and, you know, if - if there was any kind of conflict taking the trip on the Religious Liberty Initiative's dime. And what he said is, my understanding is that the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative has a number of components, only one of which is the clinic. And the clinic is the group that submitted the brief. And he said, like legal clinics at many law schools, this amicus -- it files amicus briefs at the Supreme Court and I was not invited to speak in Rome by the clinic. He's drawing a line between the overall umbrella group and the clinic itself. But, Poppy, the reason we're even talking about it today is just because there have been incident after incident where it's been disclosed that, you know, first Clarence Thomas and now Samuel Alito taking trips and undermining public confidence in the court because of the lack of full disclosure.",

The target, Alexander Potia (ph). According to the book, he is a former high-ranking Russian intelligence official who, in 2010, helped the FBI arrest 11 Russian spies who were living under deep cover right here in America.

And he is reported to have said chilling, quote, traitors will kick the bucket, trust me.Joining us now is the author Calder Walton. He is the author of this book \"Spies: The Epic Intelligence War Between East and West,\" which is out now in the U.S. This new reporting is revealed in the British edition of the book due out later in a month. But this is fascinating. \"The New York Times\" did a big piece on this as well. Those reporters triple checked what you had found, confirmed all of it. Take us inside this story. CALDER WALTON, AUTHOR, \"SPIES: THE EPIC INTELLIGENCE WAR BETWEEN EAST AND WEST\": Well, thanks very much for having me on. I really appreciate it. So, this story came to me as I was finishing the book. And it was a big gamble. I'm not an investigative journalist. I'm a historian. It was a big gamble to put it in there.
