Like, six days after the presidential debate and the Democrat's dam of support for President Biden showing real cracks. There are calls for more transparency around his health, calls for him to step aside and calls for his VP, Kamala Harris, to step in. And those calls are growing louder. In hours, President Biden will have lunch with the vice president. We also know the White House will soon holding all staff phone call. And there's also potentially a watershed moment today when Biden is meeting with a group of Democratic governors, some already expressing real concern. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. J.B.

Just yesterday, we're told, he spoke with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, as well as a top ally, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware. And as you mentioned, he will have that meeting with governors a bit later today.And publicly, the campaign has laid out a few travel items for the president. He'll go to Wisconsin Friday, and Sunday he'll be in Philadelphia to try to speak directly to voters, in addition to participating in an interview with ABC News on Friday, something that many of his allies have called on him to do to face tougher questions amid concerns about his debate performance. But it comes as you're starting to see some cracks in the Democratic coalition. Congressman Lloyd Doggett becoming the first Democratic lawmaker to call on the president to step aside. And some other Democrats have openly suggested they believe Biden would lose if he were to remain at the top of the Democratic ticket. Now, a lot of discussion has also focused in the past 24 hours on Vice President Kamala Harris. You had former Congressman Tim Ryan on our air just moments ago say he believes that Biden should step aside and that Harris should be at the top of the Democratic ticket.

They really want to keep the attention right now on the hand-wringing from Democrats and people within their own party over Biden's performance and the questions around whether he is fit to serve for another four years.And look, we kind of saw this play out earlier this week. And I'm going to give you just an anecdote to sharpen my point here. So, last week, in the days before the debate, Donald Trump's team, we've learned, was actually planning a potential vice presidential rollout for July 9th. We know from my reporting with our colleagues Kristen Holmes and Steve Contorno that Trump aides, as well as people on their planning team, had traveled to Miami, where Trump's Doral resort is, to begin preparations for a rally. That rally is still slated to continue on July 9th. But we had been told that that was the potential setting for where Trump might make an announcement. Now, of course, I will also add the heavy dose of skepticism that we continue to get from Trump's top advisers, which is, when Donald Trump is ready to make this announcement, he will make it. Until them, it's still very unclear. And to, you know, hone in on that even further, they had said, even if we were to have this announcement and we were planning for some of this, there were no signs being made hidden in war - in warehouses. There were no branding or merchandise with Donald Trump's name and the top three contenders we know that are on his shortlist. That includes Senator Marco Rubio, Senator JD Vance, as well as North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. But, in the aftermath of what happened with Biden's debate performance, that is shifting. I will also point out that they had also been looking at his potential sentencing on July 11th. Now we know that after the Supreme Court's decision on Monday, that he is immune for official acts while president. And now that's been pushed to September. That has also changed the dynamic around this. There were discussions over whether, you know, announcing his vice presidential pick could be a distraction from that sentencing date. That's no longer an issue. And so, it's very unclear now when this announcement will come. But, of course, a lot of calculation behind the scenes about wanting to keep the attention on Joe Biden and his campaign at this moment, Sara.",
