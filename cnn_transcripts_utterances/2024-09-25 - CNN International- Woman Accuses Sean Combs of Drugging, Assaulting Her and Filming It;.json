JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTWe have since received more reports of airstrikes. The Israeli military saying that they have begun more airstrikes on the city of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon. And we are also getting these reports confirmed as well from Lebanese authorities, saying that there have been many devastating strikes in the southern part of the country, as well as the eastern Beqaa region, but also reporting a rare airstrike in the Mount Lebanon region. This is a predominantly Christian area, but you also have some Shia villages there. And you know, Amara over the past few hours, I have really struggled to keep track of the number of casualties that keep coming in, updates coming in from the Lebanese ministry of health. Right now, they say at least 23 people have been killed in these airstrikes, with dozens more injured. It is unclear how many of those who were killed are civilians and how many of them are Hezbollah fighters. But as we have seen over the past week, with these Israeli attacks and strikes, many of the casualties are women and children as well, as we saw on Monday, Lebanon's deadliest day in decades, with more than 500 people who were killed in the airstrikes, many of them were women and children as well. And we have to emphasize, Amara, this is a country that is really struggling to deal with these sort of mass casualty events, that their hospitals, the health sector that was already on its knees is having to deal with right now, when we talk about thousands of injured over the past week or so. And then, you also have the mass displacement that they are having to deal with, which literally this country cannot afford. According to the country's foreign minister, he says that they are approaching 500,000 people displaced across the country. These are people who have had to flee their homes. These are people who have had to heed the warnings from the Israeli military to leave their homes mostly in the south, but as well in the southern suburbs as well of Beirut, and other parts of the country as well. And you know, people have nowhere to go, many of them. We have even seen thousands of people crossing the border, those are Lebanese and Syrians crossing the border to neighboring war-torn Syria. It is a really desperate and devastating situation for this country that has gone through so much over recent years especially, and with both sides still not really calling this a war, but when you speak to the people here, they tell you it certainly is starting to feel like one, and people are absolutely terrified and bracing themselves for what might be coming next.",

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, Israel's fresh assault on Hezbollah in Lebanon are certainly adding another complicated layer to these efforts to try to reach a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, really making it all the more difficult to do so in the near term. Now, sources tell CNN that senior U.S. officials in recent days have not really been vigorously pushing in those ceasefire negotiations, determining at this point that they don't see there being any political will between each side to try to get this across the finish line.Now, President Biden and his top advisers, senior U.S. officials really have not abandoned efforts to reach a ceasefire deal entirely, but they are acknowledging the complicated dynamics at play. A senior Democrat in close touch with the White House said that the sentiment among some of those officials who are involved in the discussions is essentially, \"We can't want this more than they want it.\" So the big question is -- here, is whether the U.S. can get any political buy-in from Israel or Hamas to reach a ceasefire deal. Now, ending the conflict in Gaza really is the president's top foreign policy goal as his time in office winds down. But it is increasingly becoming unclear whether he will actually be able to achieve that before he leaves the White House. Of course, there are other issues in the Middle East that the president had been working towards. Before this conflict between Israel and Hamas, he had been working towards trying to strike some type of normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel. That entirely remains on the backburner. So, a lot of questions about what the approach will be to the Middle East in these coming months and when President Biden leaves office, if either Vice President Harris takes over or Former President Donald Trump. Now, in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly yesterday, President Biden really just made a perfunctory call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He was expected to meet with foreign leaders over the course of the week to try to game out the next steps. But at the same time, the Administration is also watching this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon incredibly, incredibly closely as was just being discussed, the U.S. is still trying to assess the increasingly volatile situation, trying to assess what exactly Israel's end goals will be with this war. So at this time, the U.S. is really facing these two dynamics that they really don't see as being all that separate. So for President Biden, it is really the key challenge for him going forward, trying to reach some type of diplomatic solution to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas, but also prevent this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah from spreading into a wider regional war.",

So we may hear some specifics concerning weapons, particularly that elusive permissions to use Western provided long-range missiles on Russian territory. We may hear specifics on the diplomatic side as it relates to a concrete invitation perhaps to join NATO.And obviously, both of those things are red lines for Russia. But Zelenskyy has been arguing over the past weeks and months that those red lines are looking increasingly fragile for Russia, particularly after the Kursk incursion, Ukraine having actually invaded Russian soil and Ukraine using its own drones to hit critical military targets, ammunition stores and the like inside Russia already. So, I think we'll hear that. We'll also potentially hear a global picture -- this is, of course, a global audience -- and Zelenskyy argued on Tuesday in front of the Security Council that if all of these countries back the U.N. Charter and Russia is violating the U.N. Charter, then they should all get behind a peace for Ukraine on its terms. So, those could be some of the themes that come up today.",

And specifically, as you mentioned, this report really hones in on the fact that a number of secret service agents that were responsible for the planning and security of that July 13th rally were not able to actually identify a single person who was in charge of the decision-making process. And that led to lapses on a number of fronts, including a failure to prevent a clear line of sight from that building, the shooter ultimately was personally on top of and had a clear line of sight at the rally stage, at Donald Trump himself, not blocking that line of sight despite concerns ahead of time that that was going to be a potential problem. The report also says that there was no plan on how to secure that building despite, again, conversations between local law enforcement and secret service prior to the rally about the need to do so.And ultimately, this boils down to the fact that the U.S. secret service is ultimately responsible for the security at Donald Trump's rallies and at various other events that he requires protection for. And the ball was frankly dropped on multiple fronts according to lawmakers, who are conducting this investigation. And I want to point too that this also adds new details about the various communication failures that contributed to the assassination attempt that day. It puts in very stark terms the critical moments leading up to the shooting when local law enforcement saw the shooter and were trying to radio that warning to law enforcement and to the secret service agents on the ground. But secret service never received that warning, in fact, the lead sniper for the secret service team there only realized something was wrong when he saw local law enforcement rushing toward the building with guns drawn and even then did not think to warn somebody to keep Trump from taking the stage. So again, really detailing in very stark terms the failures and the secret service's ultimate responsibility for them.",
