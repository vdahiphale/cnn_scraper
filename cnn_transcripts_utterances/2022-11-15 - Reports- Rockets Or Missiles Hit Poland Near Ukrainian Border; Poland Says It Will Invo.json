      "sentences": "Well, President Zelenskyy has said very emphatically and very boldly that these wereUkrainian missiles. Part of what he says -- sorry, correct that, that Russian missiles. The Ukrainian president said that these were Russian missiles, as a consequence of what he said was terrorism, his word, of Russia, that it was long anticipated, that it could spill over into Poland, the Baltic nations. He also pointed out Moldova has also been affected by a wave, upon wave of airstrikes and missile attacks that have occurred here in Ukraine today that have attacked the mostly electrical infrastructure here. That has had an effect to power cuts also a neighboring Moldova. So, as far as President Zelenskyy is concerned, the culprit is unequivocal Moscow. But it's more complicated than that because yes, the Russians have denied that they were using any kind of missiles in or near the border between Ukraine and Poland. But this is factually incorrect because the city of Lviv, the one thing that's come under attack repeatedly today, and that city is not far from the Polish border. So, it's conceivable that there could have been a missile that overshot from Russia, missed its target, landed in Poland. It's equally conceivable that a missile fired by the Ukrainians struck a Russian missile, or knock it off course, and sent it into Poland or indeed, there could be a missile or anti-aircraft missile gone astray, or missiles gone astray from the Ukrainians. We simply do not know. What we do know is that the Ukrainians -- say it wasn't us. The Russians say it wasn't them. But it should be pretty clear to all NATO partners, but particularly to the polish, now that they've been on site, been able to see the debris. There will have been able to have tracking systems, monitoring the use of these missiles because there are NATO monitoring aircraft in the Polish airspace at the time of these missiles being fired around in the area. So, I think it's pretty clear to all parties, probably already by now, where these missiles came from and really, then the issue will be, you know, whether or not it was deliberate. If it turns out to have been Russian missiles or it was some kind of accident, the result is a consequence of these very substantial waves of missile attacks here, close to 100 missiles being fired. Many dozens of them shot down, of course. But some getting through and at one point, some 8 million people in this country were suffering from power cuts. The Ukrainians are proud to announce that the power is going back on in some cities as they tried to repair everything once again the infrastructure that is attacked by Russia.",

And all the European and NATO nations and the U.S. have immediately stood up and said quite clearly that they said for the defense of their fellow NATO ally. And while they wait to actually determine what happened and what the intent was, they are telling the Russians very clearly that if this is something that was deliberate, if it was, you know, something that violated the rules of the road, so to speak, that they've been undertaking for the last nine months, then there will be, you know, measures taken. But at this moment, we are still not being told and I think it's really important to keep that in mind, exactly what happened. We do have to really stand by and wait for that. Article Four is the consultation process, you know, within NATO members. And that obviously happens more than article five. Article Five so far has only ever been activated once. And that was on behalf of the United States after 9/11. But all the NATO leaders and all the countries that are involved have been saying since the very beginning that not one inch of NATO airspace or NATO territory will be violated without a strong response from NATO, without article five being activated. So, that's the question. To see what, frankly, the polish government, the Polish investigators, figure out what they asked their fellow NATO nations to do. But obviously, a step before that would be consultations, which is what you're asking about Article Four.",

      "sentences": "Well, I mean, they've been very clear as well. If it is deemed to have been a deliberate attack on a NATO member, well then there is anobvious response. If not, then there are a number of other ways to try to deal with this. For instance, you know, one thing to say about division, NATO has been remarkably united. I think that's the thing that has been one of the keys to the whole activity over the last nine months in supporting Ukraine's right to self-defense. That despite the difficulties, despite the energy, you know, weaponization that Putin has done, despite the inflation, despite, you know, the real hurt that this has done, sanctions -- to the West, the West has stood strong behind its commitment and behind Ukraine. So, it would be very difficult to see how they could suddenly be divisions, you know, amongst NATO if something this serious has actually happened. This is the time where NATO actually would have to band together to actually protect each other and one of their own. So, I'm not so sure about divisions if it is deemed to have been something that was done deliberately. We -- I heard from a military analyst who we spoke to quite a lot. Many believe that it might, in fact, have been something that was an intentional. However, it points out the danger and the recklessness of Russia's consistent behavior in this regard, where it is sending barrages and salvos of missiles on any given day, you know, to attack what is civilian infrastructure, after all, energy and the other things. The towns, for instance, close to the Polish border. So, this is something that is going to have to be, you know, dealt with by the alliance and presumably they're going to be calls underway right now, presumably, between the United States and others who have direct contact with their Russian counterparts.",

The rejecting allegations that they said were sourced in the Polish press. But they climbed a long way up the tree. It's difficult for them to clearly see how they could climb out of it again. But this has been the pattern throughout this conflict, going back to the downing of the Malaysian airliner several years ago but with a Russian manufactured missile that fired from Russian controlled rebel territory. They denied that, they denied that they were going to invade Ukraine. They denied the massacres in Bucha and elsewhere in the country, and they continue to deny that they're attacking civilian infrastructure. So, at the end of the day, we really shouldn't be surprised by that.

We have confirmation from Poland that they will be moving to invoke Article Four,NATO's Article Four, calling for the consultation of NATO members. This comes after a missile landed in police territory on Tuesday, killing two people. We don't have any indication as to when that will be held. We'll bring that as soon as we have it. NATO Article Four, the parties will consult together whenever in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independents or security of any party is threatened. So, we now know that consultation will be taken place of all 30 NATO members. World leaders are watching closely and are scrambling to figure out what happened in Poland, after reports that two missiles or rockets have struck the country. NATO says it is important that all facts are established. U.S. State Department says they're waiting for more information about it, but the U.S. will defend every inch of NATO territory. The U.K. says it's investigating and liaison-ing closely with his allies. Louisiana says it stands in strong solidarity with Poland. My next guest has also offered his condolences on Twitter saying, quote, the criminal Russian regime fired missiles that targeted not only Ukrainian civilians but also landed on NATO territory in Poland. Latvia fully stands with Polish friends and condemns this crime. Let's bring in Latvian Defense Minister Artis Pabriks. He joins me now live from Brussels. Thank you so much for joining us. Before we get your thoughts on the evoking of Article Four, I just want to try to get your understanding of what actually occurred here, because we still have little detail at this hour as to what happened.

This is because of this war. It's too close to our borders. Now, I think the first thing is, of course, in the nearest time, we are very much looking forward for full information about the missile type, about who could fire this and why it happened. It was an accident or it was planned airstrike. And then, we would have to consult.

Everyone else is simply saying that we are looking into, we're studying it. This is incredibly concerning, but we need more answers. Of course, most of NATO and he was looking to the polls for those answers. Were these Russian missiles that intentionally attacked Poland, or did they accidentally fall on to Poland? Where these Ukrainian missiles, air defense missiles that accidentally fell into Poland? Those are the big questions. But, of course, at the end of the day, even if these were Ukrainian missiles, this is during a day one almost 100 rockets and missiles were fired at Ukraine by the Russian side. As you are hearing from your previous guest, the Latvian defense minister, none of this would be happening here in up for the war that Russia is waging in Ukraine. So, now, the question becomes, what does NATO do? What does Poland ask NATO to do? If it is indeed Article Four, as you noted, the fall short of Article Five, which is the collective defense pact, Article Four would mean that these countries get together and discuss what happened and it does look like that is what is going to be happening. But now, hours after the first headline, after the news first broke, there are still many questions that remain, as the European defense official told me, who is here in Washington, you must get the facts first and then talk about the options for reaction after that -- Christina.",

So, in my view, what you're seeing here is that playing out. At the moment, we don't think it was a deliberately strike but we do need to, as you mentioned, wait for more information, more confirmation about where this missile came from and what exactly the type of missile it was and then also what other orders were given, if you get that information from intelligence sources.

That, of course, would be a strong reaction if that were to be taken, but that's the kind of thing that NATO has to go through. They had to go through many responses to see what makes the most sense. At this point, their efforts are going to try to avoid an escalatory situation as much as possible. But the fact of the matter is, this was certainly a provocation of some type, whether accidental or not.
