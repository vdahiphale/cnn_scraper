Everybody that leaves seem to be endorsing me, you know, people are leaving now. And they're all endorsing me. I don't know about Mike Pence, you should endorse me. I chose him, made him Vice President but people in politics can be very disloyal. I've never seen anything like it. You know, they asked me a question.

Mike Pence is GOP primary sport. Nationally, he was at 4 percent, quite big.You get into those early primary caucus states the First Nation contest Iowa 3 percent, New Hampshire, he was down to just 1 percent of the vote for a Former VP, no Former VP has done this bad since Dan Quayle during the 2000 GOP primary cycle. Why did it get so bad? I think this question tells it to you all. Among Republicans was Biden's 2021 legitimate 60 percent said no, just 23 percent said yes. So Pence is roll on January 6, certifying those votes overseeing the certification. Those votes in Congress, I think at the end of the day were just something he could not overcome.",

Where have people in Trump's position in the past what have they gone on and done? So look at this primary poll leaders at 50 percent plus at this point, all before Trump won a nomination. Gore in 2000, Bush in 2000, Hillary Clinton in 2016. Will Donald Trump repeat in 2024? We'll just have to wait and see. But no one should be under any illusions.

We've had an economy that's run primarily by the Fed.Primarily on the basis of easing money, low interest rates, all the things that have kept stock prices high, but frankly, have kept incomes until recently pretty low and income still, if you factor in the cost of living, the inflationary pressures that you just mentioned, they're really not up that much. That's why folks aren't feeling on Main Street. This President came in on a campaign of work, not wealth. Now, what that fundamentally means is we are using fiscal stimulus, we're using things like, you know, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act. We are building things, there's a manufacturing resurgence in this country. I think that we're about to start really seeing the job impact of that.

This survey conducted by Arab barometer on the eve of the latest conflict found 44 percent of people in Gaza had no trust at all in the Hamas led government.It also found that a majority of Gazans favor a two state solution. Arab Barometer is a research group that measures attitudes and sentiment across the Arab world. Joining us now is the group's Director Michael Robbins and its Co-Founder Amaney Jamal, who is the Dean of Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Thank you both. This is really important because we have consistently said the administration continues to say you cannot group Hamas a terror organization with the Palestinian people they govern, yes, but the distinction is so important. Talk, if you could first, Amaney about what this 44 percent tells us. AMANEY JAMAL, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CO-PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF ARAB BAROMETER: Well, what this tells us is that the support for Hamas does not enjoy popular opinion in Gaza. In fact, most Gazans on the eve of the October 7 atrocious attacks, two thirds of Gazans do not have trust or a great deal of trust with the Hamas government. So in other words, the citizens themselves are not necessarily supporting Hamas as a governing authority, nor are they supporting Hamas, with its tactics to annihilate the State of Israel. So in other words, as citizens now are bearing the brunt of the Israeli retaliation, they too have not supported Hamas. So it is really a catastrophe.",

We found is that when the economic blockade has been strengthened, support from loss has gone up. In some sense, Palestinians are responding to I think the anger and frustration about this situation from either the economic blockade or military actions. They're responding with a positive view towards Hamas, who is in a sense, resisting this and so in a way it's striving people into greatest support for Hamas, given the actions of Israel.",

But certainly, given that they're being bombed, given the horrific nature of what's happening, I would certainly expect there to be significant changes, and that there's significantly greater anger towards Israel. I think certainly blaming them and not so much a focus on Hamas, and that this likely, when this does end, in a Palestinian public opinion in Gaza, is likely to be very, very different than it was worse off, and certainly, I think, much angrier than it was, you know, in terms of thinking about this as being Israeli caused, as opposed to really looking at the domestic government of Gaza as it was before the attacks.",

And he had that magnificent quality of just being so quick, so smart, so quick, and that quick turn. And he could just pop up with something that you were not expecting out of the blue.And it made it work, especially when we're working together with this sort of weird mother-son relationship that Chandler and -- being had, where he was always so embarrassed by her and part of his neurosis trying to deal with his parents, which I think a lot of kids could identify with it. But he was just always so quick, just so quick. And in real life too, very funny, very witty, and it affected his acting. His acting showed that quick turn that caught you off guard that that made you laugh, because he was just a very endearing, fun, wonderful, wonderful guy, and I send my love and condolences to his family. I just felt that I should do something because for millions of people who watch the show, they sometimes think of me as his mom, is Chandler's mom. And I just wanted to reach out because I've gotten lots of condolences on social media from all over the world who realized how many people this show touched? How many people felt that it helped them grow up? That they identified with this character wanting to be the character, be the best friend and just as his fake mom, I just want to say how much I loved him. And how special he was and thank, you and let his family know all the condolences I have gotten to pass on to them.",
