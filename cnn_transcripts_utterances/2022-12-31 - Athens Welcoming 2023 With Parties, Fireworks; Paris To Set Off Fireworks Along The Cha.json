Nigerians who live abroad have been flocking back home to do just that. But this roundabout is quite special. This is where we're going to see in the New Year. This is a famous roundabout, the most famous one in the city, with this amazing display of lights which attract thousands of people daily. It's been up since November and it's been part of the festivities. And this is where we're going to see a really massive display of fireworks.

At the age of 35, Messi finally lifting the World Cup trophy for the very first time in his fifth, and what he says, most likely now his last ever World Cup. We're all still catching our breath collectively from that final for the ages you mentioned. La Albiceleste beating the French with Kylian Mbappe after that dramatic penalty shootout. Messi, then look at that image there, with the one trophy that he craved more than any other. Congrats to him. He gets it done finally. And how about England's Lionesses as well? My joy and pride from my Homelander, the Lionesses winning the European Championships back in July for their first ever major championship. Huge congrats to them in front of a record crowd of just over 87,000 on hand for that very special moment at the famed Wembley Stadium. And from the world of tennis, as you mentioned, iconic greats such as Serena Williams and Roger Federer as well, calling time on their storied careers. But look at these images. Now the images of the greats, like Federer, Rafael Nadal that was at the Labor Cup there, Nadal had crossed these long-time rivals. But the emotion there, the fighting back of the tears, literally embracing each other after Federer's last ever competitive match, that was something really special.

Earlier, we saw Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, ring in 2023 with lively fireworks show. And in just over 10 minutes, the clock strikes midnight in Paris and Lagos, among other places, as they become the latest cities to welcome in the New Year.And one of the biggest parties in the world is, of course, being held in Times Square, the heart of New York City. It's a tradition going back more than a hundred years. Revelers have filled the streets of midtown Manhattan since 1904, but the first ball drop didn't actually happen until 1907. This year, 1 million people are expected to descend upon Times Square to ring in the New Year. And CNN's Richard Quest is one of them. And he is joining me now live from Times Square. And I hope, Richard, you are dressed -- no, you're not dressed as the Statue of Liberty this year. What a disappointment, Richard. What is the atmosphere there like, Richard, as you count down? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS, EDITOR-AT-LARGE: Good evening. I decided to add a touch of sartorial elegance, raise the standards a little bit as we prepare to ring in the New Year. We've got some hours to go here in Times Square. By the way, this is my 25th year being in Times Square on New Year's Eve, so a bit of history goes by. Now the crowd are here, they're looking a little muted. That's because they've been here for hours and it's raining. Oh, for goodness' sake, you can do better than that. OK, I do promise you they will get louder as the music gets turned off. But let me tell you exactly what Times Square in New Year's Eve is all about. At the top of that, where you can see those letters, in another 10 minutes or so, the ball will go up the pole and start flashing. And then for the next six hours, we will all be watching this, because one minute to midnight, the ball comes down the pole. Now, you may well ask, what a very quaint tradition to have it going up and down and what's the point? It was all to do with the idea of creating a celebration on New Year's Eve and this was the place to do it. So the crowd is here. By the way, getting wet with me is Walter. Good evening, Walter. It's a New Year's Eve, so this is my producer and my other producer. We have Josh and we have Chris. It's New Year's Eve, right? What have we got there? Hello. Where are you from?",
