The Justice Department threatening to sue Texas for those floating barriers that have been placed in the Rio Grande to prevent migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.The Justice Department, writing in this letter, the state of Texas his actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, prevents -- presents serious risks to public safety and the environment and may interfere with the federal government's ability to carry out its official duties. And then this letter, the Justice Department cites a clause in existing law that bars preventing navigation of U.S. waters. And so, this is such an important issue. And it's important -- it's separate from an ongoing Justice Department assessment of the broader treatment of migrants that's happening in Texas, including these disturbing scenes of razor wire being placed in the river. Scenes of migrants being pushed back over the river. Certainly, inside the White House, inside the administration. There's been growing concern about the scenes that are unfolding there in Texas. And ongoing discussions about how the administration should respond and take action and that is what you're seeing in this letter. Now for his part, Governor Abbott says that he has the sovereign authority to defend our border under U.S. Constitution and the Texas Constitution. Really remaining firm in his stance here, the Justice Department has given Texas until Monday afternoon to respond but making very clear that they are prepared to take this to court, Fredricka.",

This is the full extent of what we know that the contact has been made.Kemp's office is declining further comment on that front. But I will point out that Kemp did testify last year in a separate investigation being led by the district attorney down in Atlanta. So, he is apparently willing to testify under some conditions that may be coming in the future. Now, why would Jack Smith want to talk to Brian Kemp? The simple answer is that Donald Trump repeatedly in 2020, both in private and in public tried to pressure Kemp to get Kemp to help him overturn the results in Georgia. Joe Biden won by about 11,000 votes, but Donald Trump wanted Kemp to interfere with the vote counting. He wanted Kemp to help him get fake electors involved to overturn those results. He wanted Brian Kemp to block certification of those results. All of these matters are of keen interest to the special counsel who of course, is potentially nearing criminal charges in the investigation of those efforts to interfere with the 2020 election.

But clearly, they are doing just that. So, the target letter told Donald Trump that he can come to Washington and appear before the grand jury here, if he wants to tell his side of the story. He declined to do that which was probably a very smart move.

She won that fight. When President Trump went after her when she was wearing the red, white and blue for the U.S. in France four years ago at that World Cup. Have we ever seen an athlete from the U.S. being attacked by a U.S. president while she's representing the country on foreign soil? Guess what? Megan Rapinoe not only played great, the U.S. won, but she was the star, the winner of the MVP award and leading scorer in the tournament. She's 38. It's time, but what a way to go out.
