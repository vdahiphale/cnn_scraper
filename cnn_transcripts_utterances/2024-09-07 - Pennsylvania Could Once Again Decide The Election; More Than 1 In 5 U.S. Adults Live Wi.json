That used to mean we'd be that many days and a couple of hours away from figuring out who would be the next president, but maybe not this year for at least two reasons. First, by all accounts, the race is razor thin. New CNN polling of six battleground states shows a dead heat, while Harris has the edge in Michigan and Wisconsin, Trump has the advantage in Arizona. There's no clear leader in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. Overall, too close to call. And it's not just CNN, a variety of other respected pollsters have similar results. The Real Clear Politics Average for Pennsylvania as of yesterday, Trump, 47.2, Harris, 47.2. \"The Washington Post\" just by illustration of another measure, Nevada is a tie North Carolina and Arizona, it's Trump by less than one, Georgia, Trump plus two, Michigan, Harris plus two, Pennsylvania, Harris plus three, Wisconsin Harris plus four. Curiously, you've got polling guru Nate Silver saying that Donald Trump today has a 61.5 percent chance of winning the election to Kamala Harris's 38.3 and that's the highest Trump has been since July 30. One betting market seems to agree. Polymarket says there's a 53 percent likelihood that Trump wins, although predict it gives Harris 53 percent odds. Here's one thing about which all observers agree. The most important state is Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BRENDAN BOYLE (D-PA): We're enjoying our moment in the sun.

Since the primaries on Super Tuesday back in March, the seven key swing states have seen nearly 590 million in political ad spending. Pennsylvania, the largest prize in the race, far ahead of the rest with over 188.8 million already spent and another 145 million set to air. And just look at how much time they're spending in Pennsylvania. Harris's latest trip to Pennsylvania to prepare for the debate marks her 10th visit this year, while Trump has campaigned here nine times. So, the race is close and Pennsylvania matters most.Here's the potential problem, and the second reason, we might not immediately know the winner. As the Philadelphia Inquirer noted this week, \"Election officials in Pennsylvania are warning that because of inaction in Harrisburg, the swing states, votes may again take days to count, creating a window for bad actors to sow distrust in the results. County election officials have been petitioning state lawmakers to update the state's election code for years. They've also persistently asked the General Assembly to clarify questions surrounding which mail ballots can and cannot be counted to address voting rights litigation that has played out in Pennsylvania since November -- since no excuse, mail voting was authorized in 2019. But as November approaches, little has changed since 2020 when former President Donald Trump used the slow counting process to promote unfounded claims of voter fraud in the wake of his defeat.\" Back in 2020, it wasn't until the Saturday after the election that CNN was finally able to make the call.

      "sentences": "So could this year be even later? Do you remember the red mirage and the blue wave? That was a reference to Republicans showing artificial advantage as in person votes were counted only to see the margin change when mail-in ballots favored by Democrats were tabulated. Trump nevertheless used the red mirage to claim victory. The day after voting ended, he tweeted that people were, quote, \"working hard to make his 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania disappear.\"Nearly five hours later, he tweeted again, \"We have claimed for electoral purposes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\" Well, Pennsylvania was and remains one of seven states that does not allow pre canvassing of ballots until Election Day, and as the Inquirer noted, this creates a strain on resources, which delays the final results. And other litigation is ongoing. There are issues over whether counties should count mail-in ballots sent without secrecy envelopes or whether counties should notify voters if their mail-in ballots are at risk of rejection because of a mistake in filling out the forms. And in a third case, the state's Commonwealth Court ruled that not counting votes because someone failed to put a proper date on the exterior of their mail-in envelope which arrived on time is in violation of Pennsylvania's free and equal elections clause. And more challenges will surely arise, as Steve Ulrich, an editor at politics P.A. and an election official in York County during the 2020 election told me, If Pennsylvania is as close as it's been in the last two, anything will be fair game. It could all create the perfect storm. One candidate again complaining of a fix while ballots are still being counted in the normal course of events while being egged on by some elements of a partisan media. And that's only the domestic story. Earlier this week, the DOJ accused two Russian employees of RT, the Russian owned media outlet, of working with the Tennessee company to distribute its content to American influencers. And in July, Avril, Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, issued a warning that Iran is becoming increasingly aggressive in their foreign influence efforts seeking to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. It's enough to keep you up for the next 58 nights. I want to know what you think. Go to my website at merchandish.com. Answer today's poll question, will the election end with a smooth and peaceful transition of power? Joining me now is Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth, Al Schmidt, who, during the 2020 election, was Republican Philadelphia City Commissioner. Secretary Schmidt, nice to have you back. What is at the root of this? Why doesn't Pennsylvania begin the processing of received ballots before Election Day? AL SCHMIDT, (R) PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH: State law in Pennsylvania doesn't permit our county election officials to begin processing those mail-in ballots until 7:00 a.m. on election morning. So plenty of other states, red and blue, alike allow that process to begin days, if not weeks, in advance, so you know the results earlier. Pennsylvania, we don't have that. It's a technical problem with the technical solution that has not been addressed since 2020.",

After interviewing hundreds of therapists across the country, they told us it's really unsustainable and challenging to work with insurance companies. They described that the insurance companies have taken on an outsized role in mental health care in this country, and it's often the insurance companies and not the therapists, that determine who can get treatment, what kind of treatment they can get and for how long. Providers also told us about red tape dealing with insurance companies, delayed and low payments, audits and reviews, and that's really what's contributing to squeezing them out.",

You know what we found with mental health care, we heard stories of patients in the midst of a mental health crisis who needed intensive treatment, but the insurance company would only approve coverage for less intensive treatment first.

This is going to go right down to the wire and these battleground states are going to go right down to the wire. And anything that makes a marginal difference in the outcome is significant.You know, I think that Kennedy, once Kamala Harris became the candidate, I think much of his Democratic support melted away. And what was left was sort of hardcore anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theory buffs and so on, who are more likely, if they vote, to gravitate to Donald Trump than Kamala Harris. So Kennedy's name on the ballot, on balance, probably helps Harris more than Trump, because I think he'd take a few more Trump voters. Whether it'll be determinative, I can't say.",

He's an improv artist, sometimes an obscene improv artist, but nonetheless an improv artist. I don't think he's going to be any different on that stage than he has been the six other times that he's been on a debate stage.And remember, he is -- except perhaps a little less disciplined. He has been on that stage. He will be this -- this will be the seventh time, Michael. No -- no one else in history has participated in more presidential debates. But, you know, Trump has been off his game, I think, since Harris got in the race. He thought the race was won. He thought he had Biden beaten. She came in the race. And she is what he most fears, someone who looks and sounds good on TV, big crowds. She's raising a lot of money. And he has been acting out since she got into the race. And the question is, is that what he will do on the stage? And does she use that to her advantage and use his negative energy in a kind of jujitsu and says to the country, is this what you want? Now, in terms of Harris, there's no doubt that she has been doing a lot of scripted events since she got into the race. And she hasn't done many media interactions, other than the big interview with Dana Bash on this network. And she's going to have to do more. But this is the biggest test. This is the biggest event, planned event that we know of for the rest of the race. And she is going to be scrutinized here, and she's going to have to be prepared for that. I do think from this point forward, she's going to have to do more media as well, not for the benefit of journalists, but because the public wants to see you untethered from scripts.",

And there's a lot that -- you know, Kamala Harris can pick up a lot of ground here if she continues to introduce herself to the American people and talk about the future and answer some of the questions that you raised.But I think it's most important for her to focus on where she wants to lead the country. I don't think a majority of Americans want to vote for Donald Trump. They want to know if she's an acceptable alternative. This is the biggest opportunity she'll have to answer those questions and create the contrast that I think ultimately may work for her.",
