President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speak in a, quote, \"direct\" phone call as Israel threatens a deadly and surprising attack on Iran. And Indian tycoon Ratan Tata has died at the age of 86. All of that and plenty more coming up. But first, Florida is beginning to feel the wrath of Hurricane Milton, which is expected to make landfall near Sarasota in about two hours from now. That is earlier than was previously forecast. That Category 3 storm could weaken, but it has doubled in size since yesterday, threatening to bring destructive storm surges, intense winds, and dangerous flooding in the coming hours. And add to that, tornadoes in its outer bands, already destroying homes in the Fort Myers area. Of course, having just recovered from Hurricane Helene, Floridians are no strangers to storms, but Milton is simply massive. And it could become one of the most destructive storms on record there. Elisa Raffa is joining us now from the CNN Weather Center. And, Elisa, I know you're tracking this as we get ready for landfall. What are you seeing?",

Already, we're seeing impacts in the storm, including significant winds and heavy rain. And there's also been frequent and widespread tornado warnings throughout the day, and they're continuing and expected to expand as Milton moves over land, including a few that have already touched down in South Florida. Currently, Milton is a Category 3, with wind speeds up to 120 miles per hour, but no one should be confused.

You are seeing very, very strong winds, very pounding heavy rain. It feels like pellets smacking onto your skin. You typically can actually see the Tampa urban skyline behind me. Instead, it is just a mass of gray. Beyond that, you can see the waves are really starting to get very strong earlier in the day, especially during low tide. We watched the water recede significantly. The wind, the easterly wind had sort of took it back. Now, it's coming back in very strong. And, Jessica, that is one of the chief concerns from officials here in the Tampa area and further south in Sarasota, where they are anticipating a 15-foot record storm surge, that would shatter the record that was said about two weeks ago from Hurricane Helene. That in this community is not only unprecedented, it could be devastating. They're warning of a significant potential for loss of life, obviously loss of property. As we watch these very strong rains come down, you're not only looking at that very powerful storm surge, you're also talking about an added foot or so of rainfall. The maximum rainfall began starting at about 2:00 p.m., that's going to go out throughout the evening. Another thing that has officials concerned, Jessica, is the timing of this hurricane. We were anticipating a landfall that was set to be later in the evening, that has since moved up. We're now looking at 8:00 to 8:30 p.m. This powerful Category 3 storm, at one point a Category 5, making landfall here on the Gulf Coast of Florida, and the effects are being felt very far from the Gulf Coast. Earlier this morning, about 200 miles away in Broward County, on the southeastern part of Florida, we're roughly in the southwest -- sort of central west area of the state. There was a tornado that touched down, tornado warnings all across the street of the state, at least 90 of them in the State of Florida. That is a record for a single day, and we are likely to see many more tornadoes touched down and far more dangerous conditions as this storm finally makes landfall in a couple of hours. Jessica.",

Once you get into 50, 60, 70-mile an hour winds, it is just a very dangerous situation for rescue crews. They're putting themselves at risk. Keep in mind, as I'm giving you those stats, we're looking at miles an hour, roughly from 130, 140 miles an hour coming in from this storm. So, for folks that haven't left, what we're hearing from officials, just hunker down, stay in place, don't go running around outside, as we've seen some people do, trying to take selfies in the storm, that is extremely dangerous and against good judgment.

We're going to see something interesting going on in the Tampa Bay, of which the Hillsborough Bay is connected to. And what we're going to see happening there is a wild swinging of water levels, from low to high as wind directions change. So, we're going to see something interesting called a storm reverse, or a counter storm surge. And that is when, depending on the wind direction, it actually sucks all of the water out of the bay into the ocean. We saw that dramatically during Ian back in 2022, where people were standing in the Tampa Bay at the exposed sea floor. So, by Thursday, however, Thursday morning, tomorrow, the wind reverses yet again as a storm passes us. And then, what we're going to see is NOAA's predicting water levels to rise six feet in six hours.

And those estimates from CoreLogic, they assume that Milton makes landfall as a Category 3 storm. Of course, if this is a Category 4, the numbers go even higher. Now, this is not just a major population center, this is a major center of commerce as well. Moody's estimates that commercial buildings valued at $1.1 trillion lie directly in the path of Milton and its ferocious winds. We're talking about tens of thousands of retail properties, apartment buildings, industrial sites, office complexes, 5,000 hotels. Oxford Economics estimates that 3 percent of the total U.S. economy lies in the path of this storm. And over the coming days, there will be assessments done to determine just how much damage was done to Florida's economy and its businesses, not to mention the homes as well. Back to you.

The storm is now poised to become one of the most destructive and deadly on record. Milton and then Helene before it have underscored the effects of climate change and they need to do more to protect buildings and other infrastructure from extreme weather events. Tampa General Hospital has put up these temporary barriers to prevent flooding. It's called an AquaFence, Florida-based Savannah Trims also designs and builds flood barriers and they come as fences, vault doors, or special protective glass. And joining us now is the company's president, Gene Kennedy. Gene, thank you so much for being here with us. I know this is got to be a crazy time for you, but help people understand about how these flood barriers blood protection devices you create work. GENE KENNEDY, PRESIDENT, SAVANNAH TRIMS, INC.:  Well, there's a range of different devices. Over the years we've tried to gear towards what referred to as passive, so you don't have to deploy anything. I heard you mentioned about the Tampa General Hospital and you see what they deployed there, which is perfectly fine. But we have a system that is actually the glazing system on the building is flood proof. So, you don't have to deploy anything. As well as a series of flood doors and flood gates, you just hint them closed and it blocks all the water from coming in. So, it's a little bit more advanced now. And then -- like again, you don't have to have the personnel to deploy them. So, the long-term costs, you know, are reduced to, you know, pretty much nothing at that point. So, that's one of the trends that we're seeing now.",

Now, because FEMA keeps increasing theflood maps and they keep increasing the pressure that you have to design to. So, I actually coined the phrase engineering in motion simply because we have to engineer product now for more pressures, higher water levels, and more items that, you know, will prevent not just the floodwaters, but also floating debris. The standard now calls for 1,000-pound log floating at five to eight feet per second to not be able to penetrate through the structure. So, all of these -- that's again, so we engineer these buildings per the requirement of the building within this location and it's code requirement, you know, for the city that's sitting in, as well as the position, if it's sitting on the coast is what's called wave action. So, there's a lot of factors that go into this. So, we engineer these -- our products for the building, for the requirements of the building based on FEMA, Army Corps of Engineers, and what's called American Society of Civil Engineers' requirements for commercial flood protection.",
