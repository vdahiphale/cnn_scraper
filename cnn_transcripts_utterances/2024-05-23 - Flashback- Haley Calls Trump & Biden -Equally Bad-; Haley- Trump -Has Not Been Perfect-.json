Nikki Haley makes official what was long assumed that she will pick Trump over Biden after a vicious campaign that included racist and sexist taunts, even an attack on her husband while he was serving his country overseas. The question now will her voters follow her lead?Plus, he did it again. The New York Times reports that Justice Samuel Alito flew a flag used by stop the steel supporters and some Christian nationalists above his second home. A top Democrat says Alito is quote, speaking pretty clearly about his political loyalties. And we're standing by for a rare White House news conference. President Biden will take questions later this hour after meeting with the President of Kenya. We'll bring it to you live. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. 77 days ago, Nikki Haley ended her campaign without endorsing Donald Trump. Instead, she challenged Trump to earn her support and that of her voters. Trump hasn't done much to answer her call, even as hundreds of thousands of Republicans kept voting for her after she dropped out of the race. The two haven't spoken yet. But yesterday, she reemerged from a few months away from the spotlight and said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R) 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have put my priorities on a president who's going to have the backs of our allies and hold our enemies to account. Who would secure the border, no more excuses. A president who understands we need less debt, not more debt. Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I've made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So, I will be voting for Trump. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We're almost at June, not quite. But she needed to say at some point sort of reestablish a Republican credentials, if you will. She of course, is a conservative Republican from a different strain of the Republican Party than we see leading the way right now. But there was no scenario under which she would vote for Joe Biden -- even Biden officials knew that. But the question is, I thought how she said it was so interesting. She still did not -- really pretend that she can bring along her supporters and one advisor said she doesn't own those supporters and her voters. And that is true. The big question now is what will she do going forward? I'm told they're waiting to sort of see what the Trump campaign does. So, she has some delegates. She'll take them to Milwaukee, I think 93 or so.

He's very supportive of the former president.But what's telling here, I think is not so much. Haley's clearly thinking about her future, thinking about 2028. You can't run and be a viable contender, then without endorsing or supporting Trump.

Two of them by Justice Alito, it was really business as usual. And as you know, we're about to get our most closely watched cases, including two that involve former President Trump and activities that trace to January 6, the riot at the Capitol. Now, here's why this is important in terms of the overall ethics picture. The justice's last November adopted a code of conduct in which all nine of them signed that said that they should be acting in a manner that promotes confident -- public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary. And that code specifically says a justice should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the justices' impartiality might reasonably be questioned. That is where an unbiased and reasonable person who is aware of all relevant circumstances would doubt that the justice could fairly discharge his or her duties. Now, one caveat, I would add to that though, Dana, is that test is completely in the control of each individual justices to decide whether they have a conflict or not. And there's really no way to lodge a formal complaint for the -- with the court, or to have an airing of this.

It is closely associated with stock the steel. That of course, is a movement that sparked the January 6 riot shortly after the 2020 election.According to The New York Times, quote, when Trump lost, Mr. Sheets and a team of others formed an instant ad hoc religious arm of the stop the steel campaign, blitzing swing state, MAGA churches, broadcasting the services at each job and drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers.
