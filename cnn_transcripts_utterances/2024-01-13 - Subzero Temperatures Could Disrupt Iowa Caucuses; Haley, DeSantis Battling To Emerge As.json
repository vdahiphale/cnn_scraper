Donald Trump remains the overall Republican front runner, while Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis are pitching themselves as alternatives to the former president.But powerful winter storm has brought blizzard conditions that are already impacting the contest. Multiple campaign events have been canceled or rescheduled as virtual meetups. Temperatures are expected to fall below zero and that's on the Fahrenheit scale on Monday night when the caucuses will be held. There are growing concerns that weather will have a negative impact on turnout. Parts of Iowa have already seen the snowiest week since 1942. Additional accumulations could impact candidates' plans to barnstorm the state this weekend. CNN's Jessica Dean has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA DEAN, CNN CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With three days until the Iowa caucuses, the snow fell and fell and fell and campaign scrambled. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You have to go and trudge through snow to be able to earn the vote you trudge through snow. DEAN (voice-over): The snowfall is set to be followed by dangerously frigid temperatures heading into caucus day on Monday. Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley canceled all of her in person events on Friday, instead opting for tele town halls. NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am so sorry that we couldn't be in Fort Dodge, but I didn't want to miss the opportunity to be able to communicate for all of you that were planning on coming out to see us on this snowy day in Iowa.
