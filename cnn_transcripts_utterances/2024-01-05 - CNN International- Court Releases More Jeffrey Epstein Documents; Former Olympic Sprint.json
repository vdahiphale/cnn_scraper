It also includes an allegation that former President Bill Clinton pressured Vanity Fair to not write about Epstein, a claim the magazine's former editor categorically denies.The documents were unsealed as part of a now-settled defamation lawsuit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who sued Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. In a 2011 email with a journalist, Giuffre claims Clinton threatened Vanity Fair not to write about sex trafficking articles about Epstein. Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair's then-editor, said in a statement to CNN that that interaction, quote, categorically did not happen. A Clinton spokesman told CNN they had no comment about the alleged incident. On Wednesday, in response to Clinton appearing in the unsealed documents, a spokesman said it has been nearly 20 years since President Clinton last had contact with Epstein. With more than 150 names expected to be made public by court order, there are still several names that are under seal. In a different email, the same journalist references someone being trafficked to, quote, two of the world's most respected politicians. Both of their names are blacked out. Also redacted, the name of another accuser who said in a deposition that she was paid to give Epstein massages that then turned sexual. At least 30 girls told authorities in the mid-2000s that they were recruited to massage Epstein, the lead Palm Beach detective investigating him said in an unsealed deposition. The majority of them, the detective testified, were under 18 years old. Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. He died by suicide in jail before trial.

Whether you're talking about southern England or northern France or northern Germany, they basically are suffering under the same kind of conditions.Let's start up on Scandinavia, though, as Allison was just talking about. Frigid temperatures up there. Thousands of people are still without power in parts of Scandinavia because of the low temperatures and the heavy snowfall. Some people were trapped out on the roads overnight. One woman in Finland went out skiing in the middle of the blizzard and died. It's kind of a dire situation and something the Scandinavians, who know winter, are no strangers to the cold temperatures, in fact, were not used to. One area recorded at a low temperature that was lower for than any other temperature recorded since historical records began in 1887. Moving further south, like we mentioned, you know, England, northern France and northern Germany are all suffering under flooding conditions. And here the rain hasn't stopped. This is, for many communities, the second or third time within two months that the areas have been flooded. The floodwaters are slow and receding because of the fact the ground is now saturated. So that's a difficulty. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz went out to take a look for himself. There, the problem is for many of the farmers in northern Germany who basically have to hurry up and get what crops they can in before the floodwaters totally inundate their fields. The crops of potatoes and sugar beets, for example, which normally are harvested a little later, were brought in early just to rescue them from the floodwaters. So, it's kind of a dire situation, but it is at least getting better, as Allison indicated, getting better this weekend. On the other hand, the winter is not over yet. We're still just January -- Max, Bianca.",
