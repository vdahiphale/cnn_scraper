One month ago, Warnock led, but it was only by 37,000 votes. So, he's expended that margin and notice that was a libertarian candidate one month ago, this time it was a single runoff. A 95,000 vote margin.What happened? Well, there were two counties out of the 159 counties in Georgia that flipped. That voted for Herschel Walker last time and Raphael Warnock this time. They are not giant counties, Washington County here, you can see that Raphael Warnock won by 100 votes this time and one month ago it was Herschel Walker by roughly the same margin. The same story right here in Baldwin County. These are small counties, you could see Warnock up by 150 and one month ago, it was Walker who had the edge there. The bigger story is in, I think, the more populous areas. One thing we can do here is that we can look at where Raphael Warnock overperformed versus one month ago. That is him over performing, it's almost everywhere. He did better than almost everywhere from one month ago. Now, look at Herschel Walker, outperforming what he did one month ago and he may look at this and say, hey, wait a minute. He outperformed his results from one month ago and a lot of places. He did. But remember, two things, number one, there was a libertarian candidate, those votes run away and got absorbed in other places. Number two, the places where Walker overperformed in rural areas with small populations where he underperformed, look at this, the population areas, Columbus, Augusta and Savannah were huge numbers of votes there and all we have to do is push into some of these counties. And, Don, you know this from living there, Fulton County, the most populous county in Georgia. You could see Raphael Warnock here overnight with the margin of, what is that, 52,000? Let's go d+ 53. There and you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of votes and one month ago the margin was what? 49. So 53 and 49 is a 4 percent difference. It might not seem like much but when you're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes, Don, it adds up.",

But he had already lost the race by then because of the early vote.And, throughout the night, we're hearing from Republicans, yes, there was optimism in the room but Walker strategist really knew from the get-go that they were in some trouble because of the votes that John Berman, which we were just talking about here in Metro Atlanta, they were just blown out in a lot of these counties. So, he did not improve his performance for November in these areas. He didn't several areas. But the bigger takeaway, I think is four months, Mitch McConnell on the Senate Republican leaders have been talking about the quality of candidates, the need of the quality of candidates here. And, when this race was not going to be the determination of Senate control, Republicans no longer in the Senate, Republicans basically stopped sending money, and they stopped sending a lot of reinforcements here. So, he was of left on his. On so many cases some Republicans are happy that he was just in the race at the end, that this wasn't a blowout.

I was talking to a top Warnock advisor and they said two things actually kept us in the game. Brian Kemp, and the operation and Joe Biden.
