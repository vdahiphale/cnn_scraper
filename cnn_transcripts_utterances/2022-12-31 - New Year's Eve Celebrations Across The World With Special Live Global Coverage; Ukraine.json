Yes, it was a song about my mom, which then passed our national selection and later won Eurovision. When the full scale war happened, this song was everywhere to hear. We call it the anthem of our war. MACFARLANE (voiceover): He says winning Eurovision was a victory for all of Ukraine. PSIUK (through translator): It was the same in Lviv. I mean, for all of Ukraine it was a celebration, a great victory that cheered everyone up. MACFARLANE (on camera): You have been making a lot of new music, I understand, back in Ukraine. How difficult has it been to be creative when you're living and working in a war zone? PSIUK (through translator): At first, after the start of the full scale war, it was very difficult to gather ourselves and understand what to write and how to write at this time. But then we realized that we needed to write and support people in any case, so we've already somehow got accustomed to it. MACFARLANE (voiceover): As Putin tries to destroy Ukraine and its culture, Oleh says the work of every musician has taken on more meaning. PSIUK (through translator): I think this is a valuable contribution, both ours and that of every Ukrainian performer, musician, artist. What's very important is that we see our culture has really taken off and this is good. We hope that this is just the beginning and that our culture will be even bigger and shared even more widely around the world.",
