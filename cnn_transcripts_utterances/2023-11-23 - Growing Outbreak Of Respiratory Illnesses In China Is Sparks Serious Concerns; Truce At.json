How much do we need to worry about seeing a similar spike here?DR. REINER:  Well, I think we've already had a bit of that already this fall. What people should know is that we have tools to fight these illnesses. We have a booster, which is much more effective against the current strain of COVID, yet only about 15 percent of adults have availed themselves of this. We have a new seasonal influenza vaccine. Last numbers I saw were only about 36 to 38 percent of Americans have gotten vaccinated with the new shot. So, we don't have to act helpless against these illnesses. We have the ability to attenuate the effects. So, I would encourage everyone to talk to their health care providers about how best to protect themselves. COVID, RSV, influenza, you know, we can take action against these.",

More than half also are not taking any precautions to avoid getting infected. Two-thirds say they are not concerned about spreading it potentially to their loved ones. What else, other than what you mentioned, getting vaccinated against COVID, against influenza, what else can be done to try to avoid getting sick this holiday season?DR. REINER:  Well, I think that will go a long way. But I think another major point is if you are sick, if you do feel like you're coming down with a cold or a flu or even COVID, then you really should stay home. I think if you're going during Thanksgiving today or during the Christmas season to visit family, particularly in multi- generational homes where some of your older relatives might be much more fragile than you, you're not doing them a favor if you come while you're sick and you get them ill. So, I would encourage people to, you know, exercise some discipline and some insight and to stay home if you don't feel well.",

Is a quiet, fun leader that people like to follow. And he decided to do a gap year after he was accepted to Binghamton University in Upstate New York. And basically, follow his grandparents who were Holocaust survivors. Came to Israel, built a country. And like other Jewish people, understanding that this the country that needs to be defended. And as such, he decided to join the Israeli army and do his part in defending the country. O. NEUTRA:  He felt that that's what he had to do. You know, he's an American kid. He's very social. He's always very inclusive. He's optimistic. He felt that it was his duty to do his share in protecting. And that was his motivation to do what he decided to do. And -- but ultimately --",

We're on a mission with Iceland's Coast Guard to the already affected area by what could soon be a massive volcanic eruption.

We fly over the most recent one, past the mouth of the volcano and over seemingly endless lava fields still steaming hot even months after the actual eruption ended.
