He had several ads where he -- you now, this was -- he was running against Cale Boggs.And in these ads, he you know, would say things like, Cale doesn't want to run. He's lost that old twinkle in his eye that he used to have. He placed ads against him with the slogan saying, you know, he understands what's happening today.

He said, If you still feel you can do the job and you have physical health, then I think you should be able to do it. And if you fast forward to today, you know, that's how he sees it. And I think oddly enough, actually, running against Donald Trump, if he is the front-runner in the end, if he is the nominee, that undermines the age argument for Republicans.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has sent a letter to law enforcement, saying the announcement could come any time between July 11 and September 1. \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" first reported that letter. Willis sending a warning to law enforcement, because she says the case, quote, \"may provoke significant public reaction.\" She is weighing whether to charge Trump or any of his allies for their attempts to overturn the results of Georgia's 2020 election. So let's bring in our senior crime and justice reporter, Katelyn Polantz, who joins us now. It's interest -- I mean, it's a surprising letter to send. She outlined sort of this two-month timeframe.

And now we're just waiting for these charging decisions. So this letter from Fani Willis, the district attorney in Fulton County, Poppy and Kaitlan, it says a couple things. It says, quite frankly, that Fani Willis does plan to announce charging decisions in the 2020 election investigation. So that confirmation that they are going to be coming to a conclusion here pretty soon, giving the time line. It's essentially an eight-week period in July going through the end of August when those charging decisions would be announced. And the reason is this concern over security. So this letter doesn't say that Donald Trump himself will be indicted. That is something that remains to be seen. The grand jury will have to look at. But there's a clear subtext here that Donald Trump supporters may be quite angry. And here is what Willis writes in her letter: \"Open-source intelligence has indicated the announcement of decisions in this case may provoke a significant public reaction.\" And she goes on, \"We have seen in recent years that some may go outside of public expressions of opinion that are protected by the First Amendment to engage in acts of violence that will endanger the safety of our community. As leaders, it is incumbent upon us to prepare.\" She's not mentioning January 6th itself, but obviously, she's investigating the leadup to that event, the Capitol riot.
