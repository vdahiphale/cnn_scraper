This collection includes the following criticisms from former Trump officials including former Attorney General Bill Barr, who says Trump \"will always put his own interests and gratifying his own ego ahead of everything else, including the country's interest.\" Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper says he puts himself before the country.  MATTINGLY:  Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly says: \"The depths of his dishonesty is just astounding to me. He's the most flawed person I have ever met in my life.\" Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson: \"His understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of US history is really limited.\" Our next guest published one of those essays titled \"America will Abandon NATO,\" joining us now is Anne Applebaum, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian, staff writer at \"The Atlantic.\" I think this is a really important moment to pay attention to policy. I think a lot of people have been working on that over the course of the last couple of weeks and months, not just horse race, policy as well. On this issue, specifically, what convinces you this time will be different? He's always raised concern since the convention in 2016, I vividly remember it, about NATO. But this time, if he's in office, he will actually withdraw. ANNE APPLEBAUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\":  Well, famously, Trump told John Bolton, \"I don't give a shit about NATO,\" and Bolton has said that, in his view, the only reason Trump didn't act on it is because he and Rex Tillerson and Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo prevented him from doing it. None of those people will be in the White House or anywhere near the White House in Trump's second term. All of them have criticized him since 2020. He will not rehire them. Instead, he will have a cohort of officials who are either people who don't care about NATO and don't care about America's alliances around the world or actively hostile to them. And so we will see a very -- we'll see a very different set of policies. And remember, what's really important about NATO is it's not just a treaty, it is a treaty that says, okay, everybody who signed it should, in theory, come to the aid of anybody else if they're attacked. But it's more than just a legal document, it's also a psychology. You know, why don't the Russians attack Poland given that so much aid for Ukraine is coming through Poland? The reason they don't do it is because they think the US would respond.",
