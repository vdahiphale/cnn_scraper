But post-pandemic, numbers haveswelled to record levels, well beyond control, local authorities say, causing human traffic jams and garbage to litter the sacred peak. The local prefecture now says it needs to charge $13 per climber and impose a daily hiker cap of $4,000 in a bid to address over-tourism starting this season. (On camera): But as you can tell by the crowds of people around me here, one of Tokyo`s biggest tourist hotspots, Mount Fuji isn`t the only victim of over-tourism. It`s a nationwide problem. Over three million people visited Japan in the month of April, and though that`s good news for the economy post-pandemic, it`s put a strain on resources and local communities. (Voice-over): Earlier this year, the historic city of Kyoto had to close off some alleys to combat Geisha paparazzi, a name given to visitors snapping photos of geisha without permission. While Kamakura, a seaside town just outside of Tokyo, is urging tourists to walk around instead of taking the train to ease congestion. Struggling to accommodate an unprecedented surge of inbound visitors, many encouraged by a weak yen, local tourist spots have resorted to taking matters into their own hands. Even if it means curtains for an Instagram hotspot. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In 1956, Dartmouth College professor John McCarthy organized a summer workshop around Alan Turing`s question, Can Machines Think? McCarthy named the project Artificial Intelligence and a field of research was born. Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson has some serious issues with the new voice for the bot in an update for OpenAI`s ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence program with which you can have conversations. She says that voice sounds eerily similar to hers. CNN`s Jason Carroll is on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

I was shocked, angered, and in disbelief. Altman fired back saying the voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson, and it was never intended to resemble hers. We cast the voice actor behind Sky`s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. On OpenAI`s blog, it said the company wanted a voice that was timeless, approachable, and it narrows the field of more for than 400 voice submissions and settled on a different actress saying, we believe that A.I. voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity`s distinctive voice. Altman would not reveal who they hired to voice Sky, he says, to protect their privacy. Johansson isn`t buying that, saying not only did Altman reach out last September with an offer to have her voice ChatGPT 4.0, which she says she declined. She also says two days before it was released. Altman asked her agent if she would reconsider, then he tweeted this on May 13th, the day of its release, just one word: her.
