Everything we have heard out of most of the parties is rather optimistic that something could happen in the coming days and the weeks. It does not appear to be immediate.I have just been listening to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who for the first time in public was responding to Hamas' counterproposal that just came out yesterday. And he said that: \"We haven't committed to anything. We haven't committed to any of the crazy demands from Hamas.\" So, that isn't exactly the most positive reaction, but he's -- it's also not a full-throated rejection. And the major sticking points that I see at this point -- and there are so many parts to this potential multiphase deal that would almost -- that would likely lead to a release of more than 100 hostages, hopefully, as well as to a significant pause in the fighting. But the major sticking points are the presence of the Israeli soldiers in Gaza.. Hamas wants them all out, at least in a second phase, not initially, but in a second phase. Israel is saying that that is essentially a nonstarter. There's also the question of prisoners. In exchange for the hostages to be released, Hamas wants Palestinian prisoners, and they're asking for a huge number, including 500 they say they want to name who Israel would say have blood on their hands. And then, finally, I think the biggest sticking point is, Hamas wants to see an end to this war, that at the end of this pause, the war is over, whereas Israel says there is still work to be done to eradicate Hamas for a complete victory over Hamas.",

So, he was not committal on that subject, and that could be a huge problem for him, because many Republicans in his conference are opposed to additional Ukraine aid.

But it's also a tacit admission that really the circus approach didn't quite serve them in the way that they had hoped, right? So you're seeing this more traditional, more disciplined approach. While Trump is not expected to be there, he will be represented by Johnathan Mitchell. I mean, this is a very experienced lawyer. This will be his sixth time arguing before the Supreme Court. This is someone who writes law review articles on textualism, right, not the usual Trump lawyer. And yesterday and today, they have been engaged in mock arguments, moot court. That's something most people would do to prepare for the Supreme Court, but, as we know, the Trump team not always conventional.

They have several questions that go to the text of this section of the 14th Amendment that would bar anyone who had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and then incited or engaged in insurrection.So the lawyers from -- Colorado who are challenging Donald Trump and want him off the ballot are really going to try to get the justices to focus on January 6 and the attack on the Capitol. But I think this is where the chief is going to try to steer the conversation toward the text of the constitutional provision and away from the horrendous activities that we all witnessed on January 6. And the chief justice, who sits at the center of the bench, also is the strategic center of the bench. And he has gone into the breach before and been able, in very tough cases, like the Obamacare case in 2012 or previous Trump cases in 2020, been able to figure out a way to get a majority or nearly a unanimous court by strategically working with justices. And I think what we're going to hear tomorrow is where he's headed on these questions. Now, there are easily a dozen legal issues that they could plumb here, including, did Donald Trump engage in an insurrection? But, as I said, I think the chief will probably try to steer away from that, steer away from some of those political considerations. But he is well aware that this whole thing is clouded in the politics of January 6, but also the politics of this year's election.
