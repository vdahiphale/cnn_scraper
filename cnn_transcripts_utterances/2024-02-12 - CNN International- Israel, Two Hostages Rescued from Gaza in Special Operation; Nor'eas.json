NATO's Secretary General says Donald Trump's controversial comments about the alliance puts European and American soldiers at increased risk. Trump has said that he would encourage Russia to quote, do whatever the hell they want to NATO countries who don't pay their full quota for the year.

Can you just tell us how those hostages are after everything they've been through?LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESPERSON: Good morning, Max. Indeed, I can report at this stage that Louis Har and Fernando Marman are in good condition. We have conducted a combined special operations mission in Rafah, in a residential area, in a civilian building they were being held, on the second story of that building. We had to breach the place they were being held, kill the terrorists, and bring them home.",

There are a broad range of different numbers being told.Our operation was focused at bringing home the hostages, making sure that they can return to their families. Why were they even being held hostage in the heart of Rafah? From our perspective, the reality is that our operational goals, our military goals of this war, to bring home the hostages, every last one of them, and to dismantle and destroy Hamas as a governing authority, remain relevant four months into this war. Today, we had a military operational success at bringing the hostages home. Indeed, there remain 134 hostages remaining in the clutches of Hamas. This war can be over tomorrow. All it needs is for Hamas to let the hostages home and unconditionally surrender.",

Because there are, as I understand it, a million people there, many of them displaced from other areas. Inevitably, you're going to have a higher rate of civilian casualties if you go in with a ground operation there than you would have done in other parts of the country.And it does raise the question of how you would avoid that, get civilians out of the way, whilst filtering out Hamas fighters who you are targeting.",

And, of course, we are very attentive to our allies that are raising concern.The reality, once more, is that's where the civilians, the uninvolved, those that have not chosen to be part of this, are always going to get caught up in the warfare. Our role is to distinguish between civilians and the combatants, the civilians, the non-involved, and Hamas terrorists. We've proven time and time again that we can do that, and we have. As you rightly pointed out, the government has instructed the IDF to create a plan of action in the eventuality that we need to mobilize. I think what we learned this morning in the aftermath of this rescue operation that that may be a reality that we need to mobilize. There are still 134 Israelis being held in the clutches of Hamas. They need to be brought home. We could avert a need for a ground operation in Rafah if Hamas releases them. We are creating the conditions to either bring them home through operations or through diplomacy. Those are the two options. There is no other option. We will not stop our operations in light of Hamas's aggression, in light of the fact that they continue to hold men, women, and children hostage in dungeons, in residential areas. Our obligation is to bring them home, every last one of them.",

I would say that we are increasing the pressure constantly on Hamas to create the conditions to bring home hostages, either with our forces, with special forces, with combined operations, or through diplomacy. The operation can result in a hostage release. That is what we are trying to do since the outset of this operation, since the outset of the war, since Hamas abducted the 240 people.We have to keep in mind the families of the remaining 134 people being held by Hamas. Their lives have been torn to pieces through Hamas's actions. We need to bring them peace. We need to bring them and their loved ones home.

That's where you're looking at that threat for the 70-mile per hour wind gusts, large hail, and a few tornadoes. Some heavy rain there too.You can see that line continues to push east and then move north into the Carolinas as we go into Monday. Then as we go late Monday into Tuesday, it starts to clash into some cold air up in parts of the northeast going into New England. And that's going to pump some snow from central Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and parts of New England. And we'll find that snow come with some gusty winds and could drop visibility late Monday, early Tuesday morning, and then going into Tuesday night. All of that starts to exit. Here's your footprint of the snow. You see all the deep pinks and purples. That's where you're looking at some snow totals, 6 to 8, even upwards of 12 inches of snow. Snowfall rates could be 1 to 3 inches per hour. Couple that with the gusty winds, gusts up to 40 miles per hour, and you're looking at some really messy conditions with low visibility kind of peaking as we go into Tuesday. Really, again, exiting Tuesday night. Now, we haven't really seen too much snow up in the east. A lot of our snow depth so far this year has been to the west. 25 percent snow cover for the lower 48 and a lot of it from the Sierra Nevada's into the intermountain west where we had that atmospheric river event unfold just a week or so ago. Seasonal departure from normal for snow has been well below average for some places from the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes area where you see all those brown dots and then going into New England. Some places that you really typically see snow, like Minneapolis, Buffalo, haven't really seen too much so far this year. And part of the reason is we've had a really warm winter. You see all the red dots. A lot of these cities in the Great Lakes region and then in the northeast there are looking at their warmest winter on record. It's just been kind of spring-like, really lacking a lot of the cold and lacking a lot of the snow. We know that winter is warming across the lower 48 since 1970. You can see those same places, the upper Midwest, Great Lakes, going into New England are some of the places with the biggest fever, 4-to-5-degree fever since 1970. That makes winter the fastest warming season for a lot of these places. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
