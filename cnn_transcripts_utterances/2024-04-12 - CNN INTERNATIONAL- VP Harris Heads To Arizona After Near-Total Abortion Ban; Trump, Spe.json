      "sentences": "It's 8And let's get right to the news. Two dueling campaign events today will spotlight issues President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump want front and center this November. For team Biden, it is abortion rights. Any minute now, Vice President Kamala Harris expected to touch down in Tucson, Arizona, to mobilize voters against a now, enforceable 1864 ban on nearly all abortions in that key swing state. Meanwhile, in Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump is hosting House Speaker Mike Johnson for what they call an election integrity announcement. We should note both men have been megaphones for falsehoods regarding election integrity, particularly their false claims about a stolen election in 2020. Let's begin in Arizona with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez. Priscilla, the White House announced this trip to Arizona within hours of that Supreme Court ruling, which resurrected this 1864 abortion law. Tell us what VP Harris intends to say?",

      "sentences": "Well, the vice president is expected to hammer home the point that former President Donald Trump poses a risk to personal freedoms and health care, tying the former president directly to the overturning of Roe and these unpopular abortion bans.Now, according to prepared remarks that haven't shared with reporters, she's expected to say, quote, the overturning of Roe was a seismic event and this ban in Arizona is one of the biggest aftershocks yet. She's also expected to say that this is what a second term looks like -- more bans, more suffering, less freedom. Of course, Jim, the issue of abortion is a salient political issue for the Biden campaign, one they think they can seize on heading into November and also one that can help mobilize voters and get them to the polls. And this week, the Biden campaign on the heels of that Arizona Supreme Court ruling purchase a seven-figure ad buy so that they could run more abortion-related ads in the state, again, putting the blame squarely on former President Donald Trump. And the vice president herself has taken on this issue for the beginning of the year when she launched her reproductive freedom source. He's been crisscrossing the country, making these arguments and making sure that she is tying the former president to the overturning of Roe. And look, I talked to be Democratic strategists who said this ruling is ultimately another data point in this ongoing argument by the Democratic Party that foreign President Donald Trump is to blame theme for these unpopular abortion bans. But all of it is important in a critical battleground state like Arizona, where President Biden only one by nearly 11,000 votes in 2020. So the vice president expected to bring home that point in her event here in Tucson, Arizona, today, and make sure that voters here understand who is to blame for this ruling.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with his war cabinet to discuss Israel's readiness. The top U.S. general for the region is currently in Israel to meet with the IDF about that security track. It all comes after an attack on the Iranian consulate in Syria just last week, Israel did not take responsibility, but a great deal of attention focused to that being a likelihood. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Jerusalem with the latest. Jeremy, in the last hour, we've seen a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel. That is not an unusual thing. The pace seemed to be stepping up a bit. Is that believed to be part of the response?",

He said, he expects such an attack sooner rather than later. His message to Iran was, one word, \"don't\". For that part of the story, I want to bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann from the Pentagon. So, Oren, the U.S. moved additional military assets into the region in response to this, to do what exactly? And I wonder what the concern is that building for Iranian or Iranian proxy strikes on U.S. forces in the region.",

Now whether that's Iranian forces directly or Iranian proxies, that's all on the spectrum of what the U.S. and Israel are looking for. As you pointed out, the U.S. has surged additional assets to the region, likely air defenses of the type that would be needed the intercept incoming rockets, missiles, or drones. We have seen U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria already on high alert especially after the attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. So there isn't sort of a higher alert status to go, forces are already on alert, aware of the possibility that an attack could be coming from Iran or Iranian proxies.So, that's all on what the U.S. is looking out for. Sources familiar with the thinking here, believe it's more likely that it's Iranian proxies that targeted direct response, perhaps towards Israel itself as Iran, just like the U.S., trying to avoid a broader regional escalation and potential war, so trying to calculate how to respond to Israeli strike in Damascus that hit an Iranian consulate here. So, that's all part of the thinking here in terms of what might happen. And then it's a function of seeing first what role can the U.S. play, if any, here that depends largely on how Iran or Iran's proxies carry out an attack. And then second, what is the Israeli response following that? Just as Jeremy pointed out, the us, like Israel, very much waiting to see how this happens with the commander of Central Command on the ground in Israel right now, a trip that was moved up because of all this.",

So, the conventional wisdom, at least what passes for conventional wisdom, right now, is that the Iranians are first going to use their proxies.The one thing that could change that is if the Israeli response to this attack actually goes after Iranian installation specifically on Iranian territory. If that were to happen, then the Iranians would respond in behind from their own territory. And that's the kind of escalation of the Iranians are not quite ready for because quite frankly, they are ready to put the finishing touches on a nuclear device. And if they have that capability, if they are actually going to do that in terms of uranium enrichment and things like that, they're not quite there to do that.

The issue is not about who you like or dislike. The issue was whetheryou can put those issues opinions aside, and judge this case based upon the facts in the courtroom and only the courtroom. That is the critical determination. And so, what happens when people talk about the issue of fairness, remember, very important not to get in the weeds, but lawyers have what are called the voir dire, some call voir dire, that's jury selection, right? You have these challenges for cause. What that means, Jim, is that if a person indicates and a question that you know what, I don't like the president, I think he's guilty. I don't want to sit on this jury. They get excused and you have an unlimited amount of four cause challenges. And so, to be fair to be clear, if there are people who are expressed opinions that are negative to the defendant in this case and don't believe they can serve, they are excused. Then, there's the other pool of people after you get through the four cause challenges, you have another thing called peremptory challenges. Those are challenges that are based on discretion. I didn't get a vibe from a juror that I thank would be appropriate for this case. I got a great vibe. I'm not going to exercise. So what I'm looking for is what kind of four cause challenges there are, and whether or not the jury pool as they are constituted, could indeed set aside whatever their opinions are, sit on the case, be fair. And if they're not, expect more motions from the -- from the former president to delay the case.",

And are you married and single? And then specific to the case, you know, in terms of have you attended Trump rallies, have you not? Are you part of this organization, what cable do you watch?But then the lawyers get to ask questions and asking those questions to the lawyers, get to drill down with respect to what the jurors' views and beliefs are. And so, I don't anticipate that jury selection will take an overly extended period of time, but I'm going to fudge on that because obviously this is a case where it's different from a normal case. I think that in the event that you can't get a jury pool, that is seemingly, right, impartial, you could expect more motions from the Trump team to either a delay the case or B, change the venue of the case. And so generally, jury selection doesn't take more than a few days. This case may be different, predicated upon who were dealing with, but that's the nature of how it should proceed.",

They might in fact, you know, embrace the fact that, hey, I want to be on the jury. I don't have any specific bent or lean and any particular way. So we'll see how the questions are developed by the lawyers and the judge and whether or not the people who are on the pool, Jim, could serve on the case if you get a pool that says don't like the president, don't want to be here, wouldn't vote for him, didn't vote for him and will not vote to acquit him, then expect certainly more delays, more motions delay of the case, right?
