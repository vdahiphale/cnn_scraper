Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin tonight on Ukraine and with a special interview with the Ukrainian defense minister. This as the U.S. secretary of state has just finished his trip there and is winding it up, deploying more money, promising aid to help build up the country's defense industry, and throughout his trip, been trying to reassure Kyiv of Washington's support. Words that hide a bitter truth, that is at seven months of U.S. delay in sending military aid has left Ukraine's troops overstretched and under armed. And it couldn't come at a worse time, with Russia pushing against multiple fronts, including the second largest city, Kharkiv. Now, President Zelenskyy has been on those frontlines, addressing the situation, as I said, along with his defense minister, Rustem Umerov. And we have managed to reach him in that area. Defense Minister Umerov, do you hear me? And can I ask you to give your perspective on the state of the frontlines around Kharkiv?",

Now, we're joined by the retired general Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied commander of NATO. He's recently written a public memo to the president for \"The Atlantic Council\" about a new -- a strategic approach and specifically for what needs to be done to help the Ukrainians along the lines that you've just heard from Defense Minister Umerov. He's joining me now from Little Rock, Arkansas. Wesley Clark, welcome back to the program. Can I just ask you to react to what you heard? Quite extraordinary to get the defense minister in the area of the frontlines where he's just been obviously inspecting what's going along -- going on along with President Zelenskyy. GEN. WESLEY CLARK, (RET) CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, first of all, I'm, I'm very reassured to see that he's up there with General Syrskyi and President Zelenskyy. I'm very reassured to see their repositioning forces and trying to hold the Russians where they are. It seems that the Russian advance this, thus far, has sort of run out of momentum.

Onthe one hand, over the last few days, there was a certain sense of panic, you know, since they breached that vital area, since they started to target Kharkiv, since they took those small villages, since people started to voluntarily evacuate those villages.

The Russian forces come in, they get tangled up in a village. There's some resistance there. They're being hit from the flanks. They just haven't bulldozed through that opposition. Maybe they haven't staged their artillery effectively. They are bringing in these glided bombs. They do have artillery superiority in the area. They just haven't effectively massed their forces. And so, right now, it's a sort of a foot race. It's whether the Ukrainians can get enough combat power up there to hold this. I'm sure behind the lines, the Russian commanders are trying to organize to get a greater push in. I don't think this was just an effort to distract and bring Zelenskyy out of Kyiv and get him all upset. I think it was more than a feint. I think there could be behind it a serious effort to try to penetrate around, isolate Kharkiv, and go deeper into Ukraine. But we don't see that yet. And the Ukrainians don't have the ability to strike inside Russia with any significant force to break that up. So, that's why I say it's a little too early to see what the outcome is going to be.",

That's a policy decision by the United States. And really, Christiane, this whole conflict has been driven by the U.S. policy to try to help Ukraine defend without getting into a confrontation with Russia by helping Ukraine attack. And so, Ukraine is being forced back. Its forces are being bled out. And then with the six-month delay, this has thrown another wrinkle into the Biden administration plan. But I think if you listen to the minister of defense, he wants Ukraine back. He wants all of the Ukraine back, including Crimea. And so, it's going to take a policy change in Washington and NATo be able to give Ukraine the forces it needs to go through those Russian obstacles, to be able to strike inside Russia where the Russian forces can stage with impunity.",

Just imagine, it's unbelievable that it's so -- such a huge magnitude number of this occupation. And I think that we are all paying a heavy price for this ignoring the occupation and finding ways to detour it, ways in reality and ways in the mind. I deeply believe that our way to -- not only to survive in the Middle East, but to live full life there, life with the richness and multilayeredness and culture and inventions as we can. It all depends on the question of the occupation. I will not be tired of mentioning it again and again. I don't want to occupy anyone. I don't want to be occupied by anyone. I want to live equal life, life of mutuality and brightness. And it can be done. I know it sounds farfetched now, and of course it might -- and also it might heard as a very naive declaration, but I think, you know, even Israel was created by some naive people who had a dream. This is my dream. I know it's -- again, it sounds naive, but dreams can be very, very practical. And I like always -- when I talk to people, Israelis and Palestinians, I like those who are practical idealists. And I think I am also like that, if I may say so. And I don't forget, for example, for a second, that Israel, with all the terrible mistakes that it has done throughout the years, and especially in the last years, where she nourished the idea of ignoring the Palestinians totally. But I do not forget that Israel was created three years after the end of the Second World War and the end of the Shoah, and that it has created enormous agriculture and culture and industry and high-tech and a military, which is also very important in the Middle East. And without that, we wouldn't have survived. And in a way, it is -- it's a kind of a secular miracle. And I wish that we shall be able to go back to this path of the secular miracle.",
