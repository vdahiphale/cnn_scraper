I'm Jake Tapper.This hour, it's hard to forget the images of a cargo ship crashing into the Baltimore bridge in March causing a devastating and deadly collapse. But while the cleanup and investigation have moved forward, those 21 crew members have been stuck on the ship for almost three months. Today, there was a hearing about letting them return to their families, mostly in India and Sri Lanka. And we'll bring you those updates. Plus, is the United States at risk of being pulled into yet another global conflict. The White House is issuing a stern warning after video emerges of a major clash in the South China Sea. And leading this hour, supreme suspense as the country waits for blockbuster decisions from the highest court in the land. The justice is issuing four rulings today, but we're still waiting on the three -- highly consequential ones that we have been talking about for weeks now. Former President Trump's claim that he has immunity from prosecution for actions he took as president, the case concerning whether January 6 defendants can be charged with obstruction of a proceeding under that specific law, and third, emergency room abortions. Let's get right to CNN Supreme Court Analyst Joan Biskupic. And Joan, all of these huge decisions could come down within the next two weeks. Take us inside the court as this anticipation mounts.",

And the chief says to whoever's going to read the majority opinion for the day has them speak. But as you know, this is the season of dissent from the bench also, because we have so many big cases out there that, you know, a lot is at stake. And this is the time of year when a justice who's dissenting, wants to call more attention to his or her protest, and will speak from the bench. We had that last week and the bumps tax ruling when Justice Sotomayor protested the majority's decision to invalidate a federal regulation that prohibited bump stocks as machine guns. And you know, there is just a lot of anticipation in the room. Sometimes, relatives and friends of the justices come, often a spouse will show up. Today, Justice Kavanaugh's, his parents were there.

Again, we've got it posted in historical buildings all over the place. I don't understand why this is such a shock factor to the nation that we would somehow do this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not just -- it doesn't actually encompass all Protestant faiths. So that's important to note. There's wide disagreement among various faiths and denominations about what the text of the Ten Commandments say, and what they mean.And let's not forget that the first few or actually probably four or five and six of the Commandments explicitly reference religion and their religious dictates. They say, don't take the name of the Lord in vain. They say, don't make a graven images, remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. These are not just a religious moral tenets that they're trying to teach the kids. If you want to teach the kids not to kill, if you want to teach the kids not to steal, those are certainly valuable lessons that of course, we want to values that we want to instill in all of our children. But there are ways to do that without posting the Ten Commandments in every single public school classroom. TAPPER: The ACLU also has a history of defending students' rights to decline to say the Pledge of Allegiance, which of course, includes one nation under God, which was added to the pledge in the 50s, I believe. How will that history and form if it will at all, how the ACLU approaches this case?",

Here, we're talking about separation of church and state issue, whether the state is imposing religious scripture, on students really for no reason, the Pledge of Allegiance, ostensibly at least has some sort of patriotic purpose. Although, again, as you know, we do object to the inclusion of under God on it. And we think students have a right to not stand for the pledge if they don't want to.And so, you know, we're defining as students right there. We also defend students' rights to exercise their faith and school all the time. But this is not that, this is the government imposing a particular religious scripture on students day in and day out from kindergarten through senior year. You know, if you go -- once you enroll in school, you're going to be subjected to this, we calculated it, it's something like over 2,000 days, you will be subjected to the Ten Commandments on this classroom walls, official state version. It's sending the message that these are the rules that you should be following that this is the religious doctrine, you should believe in. And that just violates the rights of students and parents and families to decide for themselves what they want to believe. Do we really want the government telling us what our religious beliefs should be? That's what's happening here with the Ten Commandments displays.",

Remember 21 crew members on board the Dali, 20 of them are Indian nationals, one of them is from Sri Lanka. All of them have been stuck on the boat for nearly three months now.And there are several reasons for that. Look, they've been keeping the ship, safe and operational, which was particularly critical when it was stuck behind me here at the reckoned site. But they had been also been part of several investigations, federal investigations, including a federal criminal probe involving the Department of Justice as investigators are still trying to piece together why it is that the ship lost power and steering just beyond those pillars behind me before ramming into the bridge. They are still piecing all of that together. We know that there has been a federal order in place, a customs order in place requiring the 21 crew members to be and stay on board that ship. But we've learned from court documents that in the last few days, the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice gave the green light essentially for those eight specific lower ranking crew members to be released and to be able to fly home as long as they are available for this investigation and eventually to be deposed by lawyers for the city of Baltimore. Remember, they still have that big case, as they're seeking damages from the shipping companies. But Jake, for those other 13 crew members, they are still stuck here in the United States. They are not going to be allowed to leave potentially, until the end of this investigation. In fact, I spoke with the chaplain for the Port of Baltimore. He has been working closely with the crew of the Dali since this incident. And he told me he doesn't believe those 13 crew members are going to be able to leave until after all of the litigation is done, Jake,. and that could take many months, maybe more than a year.",

And as we touched on yesterday, nearly 7 million Americans are living with this horrific disease to say nothing of their friends and family members. Alzheimer's is the focus of Dr. Gupta's latest documentary, The Last Alzheimer's Patient, which is now streaming on Max.Yesterday, we asked you to submit questions that you might have for Sanjay. And today the doctor is in. So let me bring you in CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, also a neurosurgeon. So Gita from Houston asks you Sanjay, quote, can daily mental exercises or doing words with friends or paper-based crossword puzzles, reduce your odds of getting dementia? That's actually my question too, Sanjay, because I'm doing these word games and such because I read somewhere that keeping your brain active can help. Is that real? [17:50:28] DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, I think it can help. I think what if Gita is asking, can it actually reduce your risk of dementia later on in life? That would tell you I think the evidence is less clear on that. What we seem to hear is that if you're doing a lot of crossword puzzles, it may help a little bit with your working memory. But what it mainly does is make you good at doing crossword puzzles. The point is this. If you're actually trying to create cognitive reserve or cognitive resilience in the brain, which helps decrease your chances of dementia later, you need to be doing things that are different. Taking up a new hobby, for example, learning how to paint, doing a musical instrument, taking up a new language, preferably things with your hands, so instruments and painting would be better. Crossword puzzles, not so much, not at least in terms of looking at the long term risk of dementia. Interestingly, I'll tell you, Jake, the thing that has the best evidence in terms of actually growing new brain cells is brisk activity, brisk movement that actually helps create new brain cells. So for you, for example, I'd suggest going for a brisk walk with Jennifer, your wife, versus doing a crossword puzzle, if delaying or not getting dementia is your goal.",

It was also a part of a clinical trial that Richard Isaacson is running as part of a preventive neurology testing. It's not widely available yet, although they're getting to that point. There is a website called retainyourbrain.com, retainyourbrain. And you can do a lot of these cognitive exercises there. I got to tell you, Jake, I don't know, I think you would do really well on this. But questions like name as many words as you can, starting with the letter T, in the next 60 seconds. And the more complicated the word, the more words you can actually name, the better. How many animals can you name, the rarer the animal, the more unusual the animal, the better?How many can you name in the next 60 seconds, things like that. But also checking your bone density, because physical health and brain health are very interconnected and that's what a lot of these studies show. So, you know, the second part of Jesse's question, how do you really know, you know, if something is age-related versus actually dementia due to Alzheimer's? Well, if you look at sort of how people remember things, I always say if someone actually forgets the name of a family member, that's a problem. For getting the name of acquaintance, that's actually pretty common. A better example, people forget where they put their car keys all the time. That is not a sign of dementia. But if it takes you an extra beat, to actually remember what those keys are, what is this thing that I'm holding? That's obviously a sign of a bigger problem?
