Well, she quit.After six weeks of unprecedented political chaos at Westminster, her resignation has sparked more turmoil within the conservative government, with intense speculation now over who will be the third leader of the Conservative Party in just four months. Sources tell CNN former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering a run. Other possibilities include former finance minister Rishi Sunak, defense minister Ben Wallace, and newly-resigned home secretary, Suella Braverman. Truss announced her resignation outside No. 10. It seems she never recovered politically after her economic plan for growth sent the pound plunging and financial markets into a panic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What is remarkable is just a few weeks ago, approximately 60 members of Boris Johnson's government resigned. And the question is why. Appalling behavior scandals, rules violations and so on. Terrible performance in byelections and, ultimately, a majority that he -- that he squandered and did damage to the -- to the party.

Probably it involves things like doubling down on the independent of the central bank, the Bank of England, so that investors believe, again, that it has credible, political independence. And it doesn't have to tighten financial conditions -- or raise interest rates quite as much as it might otherwise if people doubted its commitment. It probably also involves a freer flow of people and goods into and out of the U.K. Again, a very touchy subject in the wake of Brexit. But, you know, the British economy needs labor.
