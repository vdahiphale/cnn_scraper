We begin this hour with reports of live explosions heard in central Israel near Tel Aviv as Hamas is now claiming to target Ben Gurion Airport.And tonight, the atrocities of Hamas are being revealed. We do want to warn you, the images that we're about to show you are graphic and disturbing, but it is critically important for the world to see the reality of what has just unfolded. This here is the aftermath of the attacks on a music festival site in Western Israel. An Israeli rescue organization says that at least 260 bodies were found at that site. The survivors of that massacre, describing Hamas fighters storming the festival yesterday morning attacking civilians with rifles, with RPGs, killing or kidnapping anyone that they came across. The death toll now in Israel is more than 600 people. We learned tonight that at least three Americans are among that number, and at this moment, we do not know of the fate of dozens of people who have been taken hostage by Hamas and other terrorist groups. Now, Israeli forces are stepping up their attacks on Gaza tonight, the area controlled by Hamas. Now this was the scene there just a few hours ago. Explosions lighting up the sky as Israel carries out round after round of airstrikes. We're also getting a look at how these brutal attacks started from this propaganda video released by Hamas as their fighters' launched rockets and used bombs dropped by drones yesterday. Now our coverage starts with CNN's Nic Robertson, who is in Sderot, Israel. Nic, we are learning about Hamas potentially attacking the center of Israel right now. They're claiming that they're targeting the airport in Tel Aviv. What do you know?",

      "sentences": "What we saw from here we can see rockets and saw rockets about three I would say fly up out of Gaza and they went across the sky this way. It's unusual here to see rockets fly up -- there was an explosion there -- see rockets fly up and not have them intercepted. They're intercepted here when they're targeting this area right close to Gaza. But when they're going further into Israel, they are targeted by the Iron Dome defensive missile shield. They're targeted further into Israel when the system can track the incoming missile better and therefore make better contact and destroy that incoming missile. So, we saw those missiles fly out from here. And within a minute of that we could hear fighter jets, Israeli fighter jets come on station above here. There were a couple of explosions.At one point they sounded like a couple of fighter jets in the sky above us. There are drones up there now. It goes from sort of all quiet here to suddenly seeing those rockets flying out, no intercepts, which is a telltale that they're flying up towards central Israel. And then you immediately hear the fighter jets and the buzz of the drones in the air, where all eyes are on where were those rockets launched from and can those sites be hit. And that's the cat-and-mouse that Israel plays now. Every time Hamas launches a rocket, the cat-and-mouse take out that site, take out the team that are firing those rockets. And of course, both sides know, have very experience in trying to evade and avoid each other on this because they've been doing it for years, Abby.",

The way Hamas can be successful is to fire a huge number of missiles and hope that the Iron Dome cannot cope with them.On the first phase of their attacks, early yesterday, 2,200 missiles fired. By late yesterday evening, they were firing them only in clusters of about 150. This evening, Hamas is firing its missiles in clusters of maybe, 3s, 4s, 5s, or maximum a couple of dozen or a dozen or so. So, I think we're seeing Hamas' ability to fire large numbers of rockets. They don't have that ability or they're not using that ability if they have it. Their tempo and rate and numbers in their rate of fire has dropped off, I would say, definitely compared to yesterday morning to right now. The thing is, we don't know what they're planning. We don't know what their stockpiles are like. We don't know what else they might do in the next couple of hours. But in the hours of darkness, this is when Hamas calculate they have a better opportunity to launch missiles because they think it's harder for the Israelis to see them when they're moving the missiles around and trying to bring them out to launch sites without being spotted.",

We've also seen rockets targeting the Tel Aviv area as well, the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv as well as the area around Israel's main airport, Ben Gurion Airport. Now, the Hamas group has said that they were specifically targeting Ben Gurion Airport. Of course, the goal of that is to shut the airport down.As far as we understand, the airport's activity has not been affected by these rocket attacks. But the area around Tel Aviv had not been targeted in about 24 hours. I would say it had been some time since the suburbs of Tel Aviv where the Tel Aviv area had been targeted by rockets. Most of the rocket attacks in the last few hours, most of the day-to-day have been focused on the areas just around the Gaza Strip where they are often focused. That's probably likely because to target Tel Aviv, you need to use these longer-range rockets. And also, what we're hearing in the last few hours or so is that there are still militants, apparently, engaging with Israeli soldiers in some of these towns and villages in southern Israel. We are now approaching within the next few hours, 48 hours of this war since these attacks began and still Israeli forces are encountering armed militants in Israeli towns and villages.",

So, when you're close to a, you know, war situation like this, then it's in relative terms. But rest assured, we have secure, safe places to be quite literally immediately at hand. So, the team here is safe in those terms. The other thing that has been developing in Sderot over the past hour or so is the possibility of two or three Hamas infiltrators. It's not clear if they're newly in or they've been lying low, but it's a possibility some have been spotted and they're being chased down not so far from here. But the Israeli defense forces are right on that operation as they have been, as they were here earlier in the day and as they are in other parts of the country. This is just ongoing in the background all the time. And I'm hearing a helicopter in the sky above me there. That's an indication that may be brought in as part of the search here or it may be brought in because they're going to try to use it with its heavy machine guns to try to target some of those launch sites of these latest salvo of rockets. Again, it might just be to get better eyes on the situation, to aid and assist any drones that may be in the sky. I'm hearing fighter jets as well. This is just the dynamic.

That raises the risk of Hamas killing the hostages, civilian casualties on the Palestinian side which could inflame Hezbollah, bring them into the war.

In the end, you know, if you have enough determination to pull off a terrorist attack, you know, that's a very, very hard thing to prevent 100% of the time.

The first is, what are Prime Minister Netanyahu's objectives when he goes in? I mean, I'm certain he will go in. They've got to make them pay a price here. But does he want to go in and basically forever oust Hamas from Gaza and administer it because that would be long and bloody or does he have lesser goals than that?The second is, how much does Hamas think they can play this out? I mean, it's interesting that tonight, they're shooting rockets in and missiles, but there isn't the ground operation. It's possible that yesterday, they played their biggest play.",

And so, of course, this is Israel right here, and you have the capability of the Israelis to attack a lot of the different countries around here.However, the Iron Dome is designed to protect the Israel and one of the key reasons for the Iron Dome was not only to protect against missiles from Gaza right here, but also to protect from missiles that are coming in from further away, all the way like over here in Iran, because the Iranians have a relationship not only with places like Syria and Hezbollah, which is based primarily in Lebanon, but also Hamas here in Gaza. So, the Israelis are looking at trying to protect as much of their territory as they possibly can and any vulnerabilities such as that shown by the Iron Dome could make a huge difference in not only their ability to defend themselves but also their ability to respond to any attacks.",
