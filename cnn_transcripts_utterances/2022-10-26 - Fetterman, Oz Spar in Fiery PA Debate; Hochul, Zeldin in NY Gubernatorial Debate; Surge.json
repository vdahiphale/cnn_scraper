So we saw John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz coming together for their first and only debate. And we certainly saw effects Fetterman's stroke recovery on display. He said I'm going to mush words together and he did. He seemed to get lost in his sentences. So we did see that. But there were also issues discussed. And Fetterman's campaign is zeroing in on Oz's answer on abortion. Asked if he would support a federal law that would ban abortions after 15 weeks, here is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MEHMET OZ (R-PA), U.S. SENATORIAL CANDIDATE:  I don't want the federal government involved with that at all. I want women, doctors, local political leaders leading the democracy that has always our nation to thrive to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves. I'm not going to support federal rules that block the ability of states to do what they wish to do. The abortion decision should be left up to states. I've been clear on my desire as a physician not to interfere with how states decide. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He had said in years past that he did not support fracking. And now says that he does support fracking. Listen to that.

It was clear to me that there are very different approaches to policy in Pennsylvania and national policy. I think it came through. Any of us who have relatives, friend, co-workers who have a stent in their heart or have recovered from a stroke or use glasses or hearing aids, it is not that unusual to see someone in recovery trying to keep up and fight against different kind of physical challenges. It did not come across as any kind of a psychological problem.

I think that is one approach to it. The other approach is that we have to halt our use of bail reform, we have to lower the age of criminal responsibility and treat 16-year olds like adults, put more cops on the streets. Two different versions of reality and they didn't necessarily argue that much about it. The governor was saying if we don't deal with the guns, we're never going to get our hands on this.

Do you have any sense of when this will peak since it is hitting early? DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF COVID-19 MEDICAL ADVISER:  Yes, when you see something peaking early, at least initiating early, it likely will peak sooner than usually. RSV is fundamentally a late fall/early mid winter infection. It usually peaks then. And then sort of tapers off into the spring. We're seeing RSV early and hard right now. As you showed on the clip, it is really putting stress on the pediatric hospital beds, including ICU beds. But as you mentioned, we're also seeing the conflation of influenza. The Australians usually precede us in severity and they had a bad flu season. So we hope that we don't get it. But if history proves true, we should get a bad flu season. And we still have COVID. So it's really an unfortunate situation as we get into the colder months to be dealing with three infections. And all the more reason to get people to get their updated COVID shot as well as their flu shot, to at least hit two of the three threats that we certainly will be seeing over the winter.",
