Two women were pulled from the rubble just today, eight days after that massive earthquake struck the region. They spend more than 200 hours buried underneath these collapsed buildings. And also, a 10-year-old girl was found alive after all of this time as well.Nada Bashir. She's standing by for us in Istanbul, Turkey with more on this. Nada, people still being pulled out alive. It's just amazing to see amongst the tragedy of it all.",

But like most everything with the economy these days, there's more to it than just that. So, Christine Romans is here with us once again to explain what does this all mean. What does the report mean for the Fed's efforts to try to calm down and stop inflation?",

That is -- right, an improvement from the pace we saw in December, improving seven months in a row. But month over month, you saw inflation growth of 0.5 percent and that's a little bit troubling. Shelter, the big reason their rent prices up a record 8 percent. So, anybody who's noticed their rent is being raised, well, we can see that in these numbers.So, the trend there is what we want to see but there's still just so much more work to be done. And again, when you look at the next chart, I'm going to show you, you know, a little bit of a spike for the first time in three months, so that's when you dig in these numbers, you can start to see the signs that show us there's still more work to be done. Food up 10 percent year over year, gasoline prices ticking up a little bit, and shelter again, a record shelter number. So that's something that is a real problem.",

Police located him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound last night. And police say before that is they've laid out in detail this gunman killed three students and injured five others on Michigan State University's campus. Police say the 43-year-old killer had no ties to the school that they're aware of so far. So many questions in the midst of this tragedy.Joining me right now is Michigan's Attorney General Dana Nessel. Thank you so much, Attorney General, for coming -- for your time. CNN has some additional reporting about this note that I'm just reading, that the note included a threat to two schools in New Jersey. What can you tell us about this?",

This is an individual who just recently was off probation for a gun offense in the exact same area. We know that he had his probation extended a couple of times, I'm not sure why and I'd like to know that.We know that the gun that he was carrying, he was obviously carrying illegal -- illegally. He was a convicted felon. It's a crime for him to even possess that weapon. How did he get it? I'd like to know that. So, there's a lot of unanswered questions and we're going to be digging deep into this to find out if we can figure out what the answers to those questions are. And also understanding that we now at long last, have a legislature in place, as well as a governor that are committed to gun violence protection laws and the passage of those laws. How quickly can we get new laws into place, and is it possible that if we had some of those laws, would they prevented last night's tragedy?",

This source is saying the defense is strongly considering putting Alex Murdaugh on the stand. This is going to be a very last-minute decision. They want to see how the prosecution's case plays out. They are expected to wrap their case tomorrow, so much will depend on where that ends and how that ends. And then they'll decide what to do about Alex Murdaugh.But there was quite a bit of testimony as well continuing today from this pathologist about the autopsies that she performed on both Paul and Maggie Murdaugh. She did confirm that Paul Murdaugh was shot with a shotgun. The manner of death was homicide. She said the first shot was to the chest that was not fatal. The second shot was to the shoulder and the head, and that was believed to be the fatal shot. She also said there were no defensive wounds, didn't see any signs of a struggle, and he would have been facing the shooter at the time. So, if it was his father, Kate, as the prosecution alleges, he would have been looking at him. And as far as Maggie Murdaugh goes, she was shot four or five times. And the fatal shots were delivered, Kate, while she was on the ground, including a shot to the back of the head, and the pathologist says there were no signs of a struggle with her either. And, of course, there is that body cam video that was released by the court. It was redacted, so the most gruesome parts were blurred. But you do see Alex Murdaugh on that video talking to a couple of the deputies from the Colleton County Sheriff's Department. And he offers up his own reason as to why someone would have done this to his family, Kate.",

Because there's this, at least three or four denials, deflections or lies about being at the kennels prior to the murders. The jury is going to want to know, why did he lied. Why is he covering up if you haven't done anything wrong? Why are you lying about it?The Lies don't make up for the lack of evidence, right? They can be explained. And the question here is who better than Alex Murdaugh to explain that he was panicked, that he had skeletons in the closet, that people were after him, you know. People react differently. I mean 85 percent of my clients who come in contact with law enforcement do lie. They talk -- you know, they say -- they tell half-truths, but I could still get a not guilty if I have a -- you know, plausible explanation for the lie. So, I think the jury's going to want to hear from him. He has no prior criminal convictions. Yes, he's a bullshit artist, according to all the fraud evidence, but I think he can be rehabilitated. As emotions are raw, he's distraught, he's sad, he's devastated, and I think he's going to be also angry at the prosecutors for singling him out and prosecuting him. Let all that come out. Let the jury decide whether he's credible or not.",
