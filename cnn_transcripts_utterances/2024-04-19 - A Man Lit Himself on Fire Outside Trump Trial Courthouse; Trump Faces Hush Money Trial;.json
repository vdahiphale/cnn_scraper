      "sentences": "I know there was a historic trial happening today. I was standing outside the courthouse, 15 stories below the former president of the United States, talking to a jury consultant when the unimaginable happened. There were screams, people started running. Because of the times we live in, I thought it was an active shooter. Instead, it was a man who lit himself on fire, feet away from me in a public park.And to say I was shocked would be an understatement. You must remember, I didn't come to this anchor desk in a traditional way. I was a federal prosecutor who has gone in and out of a courthouse more times than I can remember. And inside those courtrooms, you get witnesses to recount truly horrific details and stories to a jury who will decide the fate of the accused. Well, today it was us who bore witness. And my instinct told me to tell you what I was seeing. My mouth narrated my eyes. But my eyes, I wish I could unsee it. My nose wishes to un-smell it. My heart breaks for that man and his family. And my mind, well, has the same questions you have. Who is this man? Well, he happened to be someone that we think we saw milling around earlier and throughout the week near the courthouse where we were. And tonight, we know a little more. Police say that he was a conspiracy theorist. And while his theories run the gamut, they didn't center around Trump or Biden. His self-immolation was some sort of protest tied to his conspiratorial grievances. And he's alive and currently in critical condition. Why did he do it? I don't know. I don't think I'll ever truly understand. And I felt -- I feel so conflicted about turning back to a trial after what we saw. But today, we did. And we are. So, let's take it from the top. In this case, back to the 15th floor of a Manhattan courthouse, where a former president of the United States can now put a face to a juror. This trial is starting. Judge Juan Merchan delivering that piercing line today as he announced the opening statements in Donald Trump's criminal trial are going to begin Monday morning at 9:30 a.m. The jury has been sworn in, 12 jurors and six alternates. They range from a man originally from Ireland, to lawyers, to an English teacher, to a recent college graduate, to a female project manager for a construction company. I mean, a cross section of New Yorkers who will have Donald Trump's fate in their very hands. And he says they're going to hear testimony from him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN (voice-over): President Trump, are you going to testify? DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jean Carroll defamation case that's costing him, what, $91 million? And a lawsuit Trump filed against Hillary Clinton that was dismissed for being frivolous and in bad faith, which they want to use to what they call impeach his credibility. The judge says that he'll announce his decision, whether any or all or even more of that might come in, on Monday.Now, that's all happening as the prosecution today offered to provide the name of Monday's first witness to Trump's legal team, but not until Sunday, warning -- quote -- \"if that should be tweeted, that will be the last time we provide a courtesy.\" I want to bring in CNN senior legal analyst and former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Elie Honig. Also, jury consultant Richard Gabriel is here as well. Gentlemen, thank you both for being here. We know that this trial is going to begin. And Elie, let me begin with you because the prosecution says they intend to call their first witness, of course, after open statements, but on Monday, but that they won't tell Trump's team who that person will be until the day before. So, what will the prosecution really be looking for out of whoever their first witness is going to be?",

And I think the reason Donald Trump's attorneys suggested that was to try to get the judge to order the prosecutor to tell him who the witness is going to be.Now, Laura, you know, ordinarily, judges will make prosecutors turn over the names of their witnesses. Sometimes on a Friday, they'll say, okay, who are you calling next week? At a minimum, they'll say, okay, who are you calling tomorrow or next business day? And defense lawyers need to know that because they have a witness list with dozens and dozens of names, but they need to know who they're prepping to cross- examine on Monday. And because the judge doesn't trust Donald Trump and because maybe to some extent his lawyers are wary of what he'll do, the lawyers now don't have that ability to fully prepare in advance.",

And so, a lot of times, the evidence that comes in against an impeachment is going to be used to show his intent and his fraudulent intent at that.The truth here is that his credibility is going to be the key in here. If I were on the defense team, I'd obviously be trying to convince him not to testify because he's a wild card and you just don't know what he's going to be saying. So, you know, but jurors look at all kinds of nuanced behaviors in order to be able to judge credibility, and his character is going to be on trial here as much as the documentary evidence. COATES: You know, and meanwhile, the prosecutor in me, my mouth, like Pavlovian-type, salivated at the thought of a defendant taking the stand, probably for the opposite reasons you're actually speaking about.

You want people who aren't going to get swept up in whatever feelings people may have about Donald Trump to be able to say, okay, first of all, did Donald Trump, we know he knew about hush money, but was he involved in the falsification? That's the crime. And second of all, if so, was the campaign finance violation the actual motivation?And then this other juror number two, you know, the fact that he follows Donald Trump on social media and Michael Cohen doesn't really tell me all that much. I mean, following Donald Trump certainly does not mean you support Donald Trump. It means you want to see what the then president, now former president, has to say. Having read \"The Art of the Deal,\" a lot of people read it, it has been around a long time, but I think the overall profile suggests to me somebody who might be sympathetic with the defense overall.",

Criminal defense attorney Bill Brennan is here. He served as an attorney on the 2022 Trump Organization trial in front of this same judge, I might add. Bill, I'm glad that you're here. I want to pick your brain about this because Trump is again saying today that he is going to testify. And, of course, that might be bluster. It might, in fact, be a guarantee. We don't know. But what do you think his lawyers are advising him and about the possibility of even getting on that stand? WILLIAM J. BRENNAN, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, REPRESENTED TRUMP PAYROLL CORPORATION IN 2022 CRIMINAL CASE: Well, thanks for having me, first of all, Laura. Hello, Elie. You guys are both former federal prosecutors. I'm sure you'll agree that the lawyers are unlikely to be supportive of the former president's statement. I can tell you, having been trying cases since the 80s, the late 80s, that that is a battlefield decision and it's the last decision you make in a trial. You don't -- as a defense lawyer, you don't know where that's going until, you know, the bottom of the ninth.

You're in a -- you're in a very specific subset here. I agree with Elie. The lawyers on the case, normally, we shy away from lawyers. But the way this case is structured to get into a felony, it has to go through a couple of filters and it has to get through that filter of, if the payments were made, were they made for the purpose of circumventing campaign finance laws?

I remember because I was trying cases then. And at first, we as prosecutors, weren't sure, are we allowed to look at this? Can we look at someone's Facebook profile? Because there's so much valuable information on there. And the way it's played out now is it is allowed, it is very commonly done, but you can only look at what's publicly available.So, for example, you can't send someone a friend request or pretend to be someone else and ask for access, you cannot contact that person, but anything that they post up in a publicly available social media profile is fair game. And you better bet both of these sides are scrutinizing social media.

Remember, there was a moment during this trial where they believed that he was uttering towards in the direction of one of the jurors.

And what if there's a mixed intent? What if part of Donald Trump's mind was, well, I want to cover up for the election, but part of it is I don't want to be personally humiliated, I don't want my wife to be humiliated? The latter of which would not be illegal at all. And you're going to see this battle play out. The answer is prosecutors do not have to prove that the only motive, the 100% motive was campaign-related. The jury will likely be instructed that the prosecutors have to show that the campaign motivation was a substantial part of the motivation. Now, I'm sure, Kyle, you're thinking, like, what percentage is that? That's up to the jury. There's no mathematical formula. It's whatever the jury thinks substantial is substantial.",

And I think everything was fine and everything was dandy before he became speaker. And once he stepped into that role, it's -- it's essentially an impossible role because you can't kind of play with this idea of, I want the base, I want what MAGA has to offer, I will hardline them on all kinds of things.And then you get into Congress. And what are you elected to do? You're elected to govern. And when he governs, that's when he is being punished, when he actually legislates, when he pushes through things, because it's a necessity for whatever reason, whatever intention. But when your goal is obstructionism, when your goal is simply to block whatever is in front of you, then you're not going to make anyone happy. And I think this is the conundrum that they're facing. This is what Marjorie Taylor Greene was talking about when she said a civil war has erupted within the Republican Party. That is what Mike Johnson faces.

I want to introduce you to Frank Burrell. His story starts on a July night back in 1999 when a drive-by shooting killed a 29-year-old woman in Illinois. The other occupant in the car initially told police he did not recognize the shooter, but then later identified Frank Burrell as the alleged shooter. Burrell was arrested and charged with murder.Despite his desire for a jury trial, Frank received a bench trial instead where his case was put in the hands of a judge. Frank had been at work earlier in the evening, then was home with his sick daughter and other family members, contradicting witness testimony, but his defense attorney gave no evidence and called no witnesses at trial. In 2002, he was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 32 years in prison. For the next 17 years, Burrell fought to clear his name. First, he acted as his own attorney and filed a motion to vacate the conviction based on inadequate legal representation. Finally, in 2019, 20 years after his initial arrest, the First District Illinois Appellate Court vacated his conviction and ordered a new trial, and Burrell was finally released on bond. But, you know, it wasn't until just last month that the prosecution finally dismissed the case, preventing Burrell from having to stand trial again. Joining me now is that man, Frank Burrell, and his attorney, David Owens, of the Exoneration Project at the University of Chicago Law School. Gentlemen, thank you both for joining me this evening. Frank, let me begin with you because I cannot believe your story and what has happened. I just thank you for joining us tonight to share what your personal journey has been. Welcome. How are you doing tonight? FRANK BURRELL, EXONERATED AFTER 20 YEARS IN PRISON: I'm doing pretty good. Thanks for having me.",

What happened?DAVID OWENS, POST-CONVICTION ATTORNEY FOR FRANK BURRELL: I want to actually fill that question about what happened at the trial. And so, one of the issues is that people, when they come into the legal system, they're given advice by their attorneys about whether to take a bench trial or a jury trial. And because the witnesses in the case were so obviously bad, a lot of attorneys would say, hey, look, there's these gang members, they're bad, this judge, I know him from my practice, this judge used to be a public defender like the one in this case, and so, they were like, yeah, a bench trial makes sense. And when you're young and you're, you know, a teenager in your 20s, you're really reliant upon the things that the attorney said and their advice because they're the ones who opt into the system.

The attorney had an investigator who didn't show up to meetings. It's really crazy because the attorney listed on the witness list these people.
