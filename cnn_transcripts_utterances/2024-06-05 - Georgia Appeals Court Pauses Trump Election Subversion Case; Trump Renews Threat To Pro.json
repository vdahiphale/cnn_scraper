The state appeals court ordering the pause until it rules on the latest effort to get District Attorney Fani Willis disqualified from the case.Also tonight, Trump is renewing his threat to seek revenge for his criminal conviction in New York. The former president turned felon, suggesting he may prosecute and even jail his political opponents if he returns to the White House. Plus, President Biden lands in France just ahead of the D-Day anniversary, aiming to show global leadership and draw stark contrasts with Trump. Will the President's message get through as the White House is rushing to dispute a new report about his mental fitness? Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. First up tonight, the breaking news, Donald Trump scores two desperately needed wins in court. His Georgia trial now indefinitely on pause as the judge overseeing his classified documents case in Florida puts off key decisions and agrees to hold a highly unusual hearing on Special Counsel Jack Smith's appointment. CNN's Katelyn Polantz and CNN's Zachary Cohen are working both of these stories from every angle. First to you, Zachary. Does this ensure that the Fulton County, Georgia case will not happen before the election in November?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Wolf. Today's order makes it official that there is effectively zero chance that Donald Trump stands trial in Georgia before the 2024 election. And, look, the chances of that happening were already slim. But now this order today from the Georgia Court of Appeals puts all work in. in the trial court overseen by Judge Scott McAfee on hold until this issue of whether or not Fani Willis should be disqualified is resolved by the appeals court. And we do expect a decision on that won't be made until potentially March 2025. That's when potentially work could pick back up if Fani Willis is allowed to remain on this case.Now the D.A.'s office in Georgia, in Fulton County, can appeal this decision by the appeals court. But the fact that they went explicitly issued this order today when Judge Scott McAfee had allowed work to continue already pretty much makes the chances of them accepting an appeal from Fani Willis very unlikely. And what this does is it underscores how Donald Trump has really been successful recently in putting prosecutors on their back heels. And he did so in Georgia by really raising issues about Fani Willis' personal life. Remember that this whole disqualification issue rose out of allegations that she and her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, had an improper romantic relationship and that she benefited financially from that relationship. Scott McAfee said that there was not enough evidence to show an actual conflict of interest, but did really criticize Fani Willis and his order to allowing Donald Trump and some of his co-defendants to appeal the decision saying that there was the appearance of a conflict. So, now the appeals court in Georgia will take this issue up. And I want to read what Trump's lead attorney in the Georgia case, Steve Sadow, wrote in reaction to today's order. He said, quote, the Georgia court of appeals has properly stayed all proceedings against President Trump in the trial court pending his decision on our interlocutory appeal, which argues the case should be dismissed and Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis should be disqualified for her misconduct. Now, the D.A.'s office is not commenting on the order at this time, but we'll have to see how this does ultimately affect the future of the case.",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, I'm glad to be with all of you. It's significant, but I will say that I don't think it is completely unexpected. I mean, frankly, the court of appeals looked at several things and they could have been thinking, well, you know, we've got an issue challenging her qualification to stay on. So we've got to decide that, so there's no more damage done to the case. This could also be the result of the cross appeal that the D.A. filed, where she appealed the judge's ruling where he had dismissed certain counts of the indictment. The court of appeals may very well be thinking, look, you know, let's know what the actual trial is going to look like so that, you know, if we decide that that needs to be addressed, and, you know, we don't waste time in the trial court having motions that end up being irrelevant if some of these counts don't remain.The other thing is this is sort of following Georgia Supreme Court precedent. There's a case out of the Supreme Court that essentially talks about staying these cases when there are challenges to the counsel, the qualifications of counsel, the choice of counsel. So, this is not the first time it's not that unusual. But I do think it makes it very clear. And, you know, it's sort of like waiting around me thinking that the captain of the cheerleaders asked me to your prom. Somebody just -- a friend needs to tell you this is not going to happen. Well, let me just say this case is not going to happen before the election. And I think at this point, we just sort of accept that, but also not read a lot into the order from the court because it is not the first time, and this is this is typically how you would expect an appeals court to handle the case, that is to stay the case so that no harm comes to it. There are no more complications as a result of things moving forward that might have to be redone should they decide that in fact there was some impropriety or that the court order should have been reversed and that the D.A. should have been disqualified.",

As Michael just stated, this wasn't that much of a surprise even to Trump's team. They had long believed that this case was not going to happen or go to trial before that November election, but this really solidified that.Now, remember, part of their tactics have been delayed, delayed, delayed. They have tried to do that with all four of the cases that he was indicted on, obviously unsuccessfully in New York. But now, with that Georgia case being pushed, they are also believing that that Florida case, as Katelyn said, will also be pushed beyond the election, the only one that could potentially happen before the November election now is that January 6th case in D.C. Now, they are hopeful, they are optimistic that given the Supreme Court timing and their announcement on whether or not he has presidential immunity, that that will be late enough to push that again beyond the election. Just a reminder here, part of the reason for those delays tactics are if he is tried, or if that trial is supposed to happen after he is elected, and, of course, all of these are only wins if Donald Trump becomes the president, it would be hard to put a sitting president on trial in Georgia. We also know that, federally, he could essentially get rid of those cases. So, that's why they had to put those tactics in place in the first place.",

I think Fani Willis is in trouble. Most of the time in a conflict case, you don't say pick one and the conflict is solved. You have both people that were a party to the conflict removed.Now, I think the judge on the lower court made some very genteel findings, and those factual findings get a lot of respect on appeal. So, it is a crapshoot in terms of what happens on appeal. But I think there's a chance she gets recused, and then there's Georgia case law that says the office is recused.

And so she's given the parties a chance to come in and argue the cases, argue their points.And I think, frankly, that's a good thing. I also think this is not an ordinary case and we want to say that's being treated the same. But the reality, this is not the same thing. This is a former president and these kind of charges are out here. So, the fact that she's having an evidentiary hearing, she's allowing significant time for arguments, I think that's good. I do think some of the delay, I don't think there's anything necessarily nefarious about it. I don't think she's holding back to do anybody any favors. I think it's just a complicated issue and she's got some learning on the bench maybe to do as she goes on. But, you know, even the 11th Circuit have said, you know, they're not going to disqualify her off of the case. And so, you know, I think having the hearings is probably a good thing.

It was in front of a group of Latino doctors at a hotel in Manhattan. And he must have spoken for 30, 35 minutes. Within those 35 minutes, he confused the name of the German chancellor. He said the wrong name. I'm not -- you know, I think that if you start nitpicking and taking out of context and looking for errors, I'm not sure any of us would pass that test. And so that's the one instance I can attest to the guy spoke fine for 30 minutes. He made one slipup and they're focusing on that. If that's the kind of thing that they're basing this entire article on, then, frankly, it's very misleading.
