It offered a bit of an interesting split screen, but luck, I actually saw something on Friday that I hadn't seen while covering Donald Trump's campaign thus far, and that's -- that just a couple moments into his remarks, his audio and his mic completely cut out. You could see him trying to continue on with his speech, but nobody could hear him. Watch.Now, Victor and Amara, that ended up taking place for about 18 minutes, during which Donald Trump had paced up and down the stage while the crowd was chanting and cheering for him, but once they had resolved the issue, Donald Trump picked right back up again and continued with his remarks. Now, it was pretty much a typical stump speech. He spent a lot of time talking about energy, touting his tax cut proposals, talking about immigration, all things we know that Trump's campaign believes will help him win in November. But one thing that I was watching for was whether or not he would directly address some of the comments that he had made when he was in Detroit just a week earlier speaking to the city's economic club, and that was really when he had insulted Detroit while being In Detroit, he called it a more developing city than countries like China. Donald Trump did not specifically get into those comments, but he did repeat them in some way. He said, quote, we're going to, you know, Detroit has such great potential, but Kamala and the Democrats have been wreaking havoc on this place. Trump went on to say that he would make Detroit great once again. And his campaign had put up signs as well as showed this on some projectors with the sign, make Detroit great again. Now, just to take a quick step back, Victor and Amara, and tell you why this state is so important to the Trump campaign. It's not just because it has 15 electoral votes, which is, of course, so important in their pathway to reaching 270 electoral votes, but it's also because out of the three so called blue wall states, the Trump campaign, I'm told, believes that Michigan will be the easiest for them to win. So that's part of why you've seen him aggressively campaigning here in this final few weeks before November 5 try to shore up support with these voters. Victor. Amara. (END VIDEOTAPE) [06:05:02] WALKER: All right. Alayna Treene there. Thank you so much. Now Vice President Harris also looked to shore up support in Michigan.

The Vice President visiting three counties, one of which voted for Donald Trump in 2016 but then for President Biden in 2020 those two other counties, one is that President Biden won by wider margins in 2020. So the Vice President, her campaign tried to emulate that, but also build on it.Now their messaging on Friday was more pointed to union workers and manufacturing. The vice president again trying to appeal to union voters, as some rank and file members have lead toward former President Donald Trump. Now the vice president elevated and criticized some of the former president's anti-labor comments and also talks about the former president making, quote, big promises, but not delivering on them, as she talks about manufacturing. The vice president also kicked off her remarks here at her rally with a message for the Arab American community. Of course, her campaign trying to make inroads with that community which has grappled with the Israel-Hamas war, and some of whom have peeled off and at least hesitated to vote for the vice president or support her, and this is what she had to say. KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: And listen, I know this year has been very difficult, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza and given the civilian casualties and displacement in Lebanon, it is devastating, and now Sinwar's death can and must be a turning point. Everyone must seize this opportunity to finally end the war in Gaza, bring the hostages home and end the suffering once and for all. And I continue to believe diplomacy is the answer to bringing lasting stability across the Israel-Lebanon border and as vice president, and with your help as president, I will do everything in my power to achieve these goals.",

For instance, you after he was dead, one of the soldiers cut off a finger of Sinwar because they didn't know who it was, and they needed to be identified through DNA analysis. And they set that finger to the lab to sort of double check who he actually was. Also for my sources, I've learned that the Israeli authorities are potentially looking at the body, the remains of Yahya Sinwar, that Hamas leader, as a bargaining chip for a potential swap with Israeli hostages, more than 100 of whom are still being held inside Gaza.

His burial site could become a shrine, which the Israelis say to us that they want to avoid. At the same time, you know, it's obviously significantly more valuable in terms of what they can get in exchange for this set of remains, if they can get Israeli hostages out for the remains of Sinwar, then I've been told by my sources, then that's something they'd be prepared to consider.",

He's the president of the U.S. Middle East project, and CNN military analyst, Colonel Cedric Leighton, joining us now,Daniel, obviously this is a big question here in this moment, because initially when Sinwar had been killed, there was hope for a ceasefire, for a hostage release, for what that was going to look like as we're getting away from the immediate reaction of this. And let me bring you in Colonel Cedric Leighton on this as well, because as we're getting further away from Sinwar's death, that seems less likely as of this moment, based on what we have heard from Hamas and what we have heard from the Prime Minister's office here in Israel. As you're looking at this moment strategically, what do you think it means for where this goes next? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, this is a really great question Kaitlan, because it looks like everybody is entrenched in their positions, in spite of Sinwar's death, in spite of the death of all the other leaders in Hamas and in Hezbollah, there is this great intransigence, I'll call it, that we see, not only within the proxies, but also within Iran itself. You showed the tweet from the Supreme Leader earlier, and that kind of indicates where things are, at least publicly. Now, underneath that in the diplomatic phase, there is the possibility that there might be some negotiations that will start, but there's really basically an ice jam that is, you know, right now present where negotiations would normally be, and that ice jam would have to be broken before any negotiations can have any meaningful result that we can see outside of that.

In essence, Israel has created a situation where they've decimated the leadership, both of Hamas and of Hezbollah, and that is a big advantage.Both these groups are going to reconstitute in one way or another, but this is their moment of weakness, and it's up to the Israelis to take advantage of that, both diplomatically as well as militarily, and certainly from a PR perspective.

Because we didn't know for certain the cause of death until yesterday. And now, we know that for certain, but we also know for certain that the state is really hanging their hat on the idea that this bullet is connected to Richard Allen, and that bullet is -- they're smoking guns so-to-speak, as it relates to his kill. Another bombshell that we heard on that issue yesterday was from -- related to the forensic analysis of that bullet. Before now, I think the general public has had the idea that the evidence on that bullet was solid.
