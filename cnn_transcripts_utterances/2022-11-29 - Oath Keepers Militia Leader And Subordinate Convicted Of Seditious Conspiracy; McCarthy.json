Tonight, for the first time since 1995, a jury has returned guilty verdicts on the charge of seditious conspiracy against some of the leaders of the so-called Oath Keepers for their roles in the January 6 attack on the Capitol.

This is the very first trial in which several defendants were accused of seditious conspiracy -- and now the jury has spoken.Two of the people on trial, members of the Oath Keepers militia, which is a far-right militia group who was here on January 6, who you saw a video of and the world saw a video of wearing military combat gear and a military sack walking up the steps of the Capitol that is just to my left, and some of them going into the Capitol and bragging about storming the Capitol. Two people have been found guilty of seditious conspiracy, and they include the founder and leader of the Oath Keepers who founded the group in 2009. Elmer Stewart Rhodes, III has been found guilty of the most serious charge in this case, seditious conspiracy. He is joined by Kelly Meggs, one of his lieutenants who was also found guilty of seditious conspiracy. That charge is a charge that the jury had to take quite a while to look at because of the seriousness of the charge, which is trying to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power by force, and the jury said that is exactly what these two men did. Now for the other three defendants, we have Kenneth Harrelson. He was found not guilty on that charge. Jessica Watkins, not guilty and Thomas Caldwell, also not guilty. Four of the five of these people were -- they're all veterans, and so they had a certain kind of training as well, that I'm sure the jury looked at and it was certainly mentioned in Court. What we also saw were several other charges. Now, seditious conspiracy was the first conspiracy charge, but there were others, including conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. Now in that case, Kelly Meggs, one of Mr. Rhodes lieutenants was found guilty, but Rhodes was not found guilty of that particular charge. Neither were the other defendants, the other three that I mentioned. And so you have this hodgepodge of decisions. They're not all guilty, except for on one charge, all five people were found guilty of obstructing an official proceeding. These all carry some pretty heavy terms in prison. The seditious conspiracy carries a 20-year maximum sentence in Federal prison. And so by the way, does conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. But this was a really important case for the DOJ and frankly, for Americans to see this play out in Court the way it did over seven weeks of testimony. In the eighth week, the jury came to a decision. They had to go over thousands of pieces of evidence, hundreds of videos. They had some secret recordings, they got to look at. Some of the defendants actually took the stand in their defense, but when it came to Stewart Rhodes and Kelly Meggs, they did not believe that they were not planning to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power, and so they were found guilty -- John.",

The nation's two top Republican lawmakers did just that today about the former President's recent dinner with the antisemitic artist, Ye, and the antisemitic Holocaust denying, White nationalist leader, Nick Fuentes. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, both condemning the whole dining with a White nationalist thing, but neither one directly condemned the actual person who actually broke bread with the actual White nationalists and how they each avoided doing it is fascinating and telling. Leader McCarthy simply said something that isn't true. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I don't think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes. He has no place in this Republican Party. I think President Trump came out four times and condemned him and didn't know who he was. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And while it's impossible to read the man's mind telling that lie certainly helped Leader McCarthy avoid directly criticizing the former President. It suggested falsely, that no criticism was even necessary, because after all, hadn't the former President already done as much himself, by condemning Nick Fuentes. Except, of course, he never did.The former President posted about the dinner three times. The first time saying he knew nothing about the antisemitic artist's three friends he brought to dinner, then a day later saying: \"Also, I didn't know Nick Fuentes.\" Finally, most recently saying: \"He shows up with three people, two of which I didn't know, the other a political person I haven't seen in years.\"   He also gave a statement to AXIOS saying the antisemite artist arrived with a guest whom he had never met and knew nothing about. And just moments ago on FOX Digital, he said he didn't know Fuentes' views before having dinner with him, and again, did not condemn those views. Nowhere online or anywhere else on record has the former President condemned Nick Fuentes. Nor have many Republicans directly called Trump out by name for dining with the man. Senator Mitt Romney has, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson did, so did former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and most notably former, Vice President Mike Pence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I got the feeling he was confused about the difference between condemning and saying, \"I don't know who it is.\" But either way, that's not true. Trump hasn't condemned it and I suspect that he won't, because this is his pattern. He does dumb stuff and then he tightens down, and never quite, you know, figures out a way back to doing the right thing.

You know, as you just said to Matthew, he is able to leave there, he spends a day with them and then departs. But I'm sure tonight, at three o'clock in the morning, which it is right now in Ukraine, with temperatures below freezing, those same troops are looking through night vision goggles, continuing the fight under unbelievable physical pressure, their ammunition is running low, the cannons are firing out their tubes, it's not so much the artillery rounds that are causing the problems. They're firing so many rounds, thousands of rounds a week that their tubes burn out. So all of those things are factors, and then you add the psychological component, constantly being under shelling, constantly being in the cold -- the smells, the sights, the sound of warfare. You know, John, I can only compare it to my own experiences -- Desert Storm, you know, we were on the attack for four days without a lot of sleep with some artillery attacks, but then it was over. You know, Operation Iraqi Freedom where we were deployed for 15 months, but the fights in that kind of combat were sporadic. There were terror involved incidents, that would happen arbitrarily, as units did patrol.

You know, oil for equipment, the kinds of things you need to stay dry, the uniforms that will keep you warm. What NATO is providing Ukraine right now is the type of uniforms they need to sustain themselves. They have the shelters. I saw a picture the other day of a Russian shelter that was basically Saran Wrap, wrapped around trees just to keep the wind out. The Ukrainians have tents. They have underground shelters. So the combination of equipment, performance standards, and discipline in my view, even though weather is equal to both sides will give Ukraine the advantage in this winter fight, but it is still going to be very tough. The other thing that's important is during the winter, the daylight, certainly less time of daylight that you can fight.

What's really chilling, though, John, is that in places like Shanghai, some of this intimidation, it's playing out in broad daylight. Police randomly stopping people in the area where the protests had broken up days before ordering people to delete content from their phones, and other videos appear to show police randomly checking the cell phones of passengers on a subway and Shanghai. Protesters have told us police are also checking if people have installed VPNs on their phones to get around China's firewall in order to use those banned apps like Twitter, and Telegram which some protesters have been using to communicate.And all of this it is preventing people from gathering. We see the protests become smaller and more scattered since the weekend. Police on Monday broke up and attempted protests. In Hangzhou video show a woman being dragged away, screaming authorities violently pushing people. All of this this aftermath, it's a reminder that this is a police state where there is virtually no privacy. People know that even their private messages on Chinese apps are monitored. All of our movements are tracked with COVID health apps, security cameras are all over this country. So, as you say the fact that these protests happened at all across the country. It's just extraordinary.",

Police collected their fingerprints, the retina patterns. They were later released and had their phones returned. But they said police deleted photos and removed apps. A Beijing protester told us that she's received a phone call from police asking if she took part in, quote, illegal activities. And she said something pretty striking that police may have been calmed during the actual protest, which I witnessed myself as well. But the Communist Party, she said is very good at doling out the punishment afterwards.And John, we've also finally gotten some sort of response from Chinese officials to the protests, even though it was a veiled response. China's security chief said law enforcement needs to quote, resolutely strike hard against infiltration and sabotaged activities by hostile forces, as well as illegal and criminal acts that disrupt social order. So tough language there that may signal a more aggressive crackdown ahead. But meanwhile, health authorities they are still defending zero COVID. But now saying they want to reduce the impact of COVID restrictions on people's lives. That's nicer language, but no concrete changes. John.",

But I think that it's fair to say, yes, that there is a broader dimension to this, which is people are saying, we don't want to live in a society where the government has this kind of power. Where we are this -- that we are pawns in, in a government spas (ph). You know, we, we often look at the United States and all the chaos of our COVID policy, and all the politicization that we talk about.But you know, in a way, it's a good thing, because you have open contestation, you have arguments, you have disagreements, and then policy gets adjusted. China has, does not really have the ability to have that kind of policy adjustment, you know, it wouldn't be such a mark of Xi's weakness, where he didn't now given that he's trying not to -- what the government is trying to do is race to the point two or three months from now, where they will probably have an mRNA vaccine that they have, you're an indigenous Chinese one, they don't want to use Western ones. And then they can vaccinate the whole population, and then presumably, they'll start opening up. It still sounds like a very, very tough challenge, because that's a long way away. So.",

Alta's roommate at the time handed off Melissa to the babysitter on the morning of August 23, 1971. The woman and Melissa never returned.

I've been going out of my mind with worry. The call never came. But DNA testing did decades later. Melissa's family submitted their DNA to 23andMe and got the results a few weeks ago with a match to one of Melissa's own children. The now 53-year-old confronted the woman.
