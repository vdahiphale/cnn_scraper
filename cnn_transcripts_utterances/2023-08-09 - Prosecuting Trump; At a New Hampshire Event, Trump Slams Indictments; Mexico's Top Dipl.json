This part that just kind of pointed out when she read a piece of this memo which says that this -- that letting this -- that by putting this out there and by doing this, it guarantees that public attention will be riveted on the evidence. Just kind of the P.R. attempt, if nothing else, short of it actually working that they thought that that was to the advantage of Donald Trump. You see a lot of echoes of that now.LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST AND WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR:  You do. I mean -- although, I don't think that Trump's die-hard supporters are actually going to be peeling through this indictment or the potential evidence that is -- or the evidence that is in this indictment. And that his supporters, ultimately, end up believing anything that he says, be it lies. And we see it already right now heading into full-on 2024 cycle that he is trying to cast doubt about the legitimacy of the 2024 election. And that he's trying to say, that it's all stacked and all rigged against him. Now, the irony of this, Kate, is that I think some people may forget that in October of 2020, when Trump was president, he actually called on his DOJ to indict Joe Biden. And now, we see that he's claiming election interference when he was very well trying to interfere in the leadup to around the November election, and then even after the November election in 2020.",

He's using tactics that you might come to see in -- from North Korea, and that's not something, I think, that the federal government, that the United States government should be part of. There is a taint to the whole thing of Operation Lone Star rid right now.

But since Donald Trump came onto the scene, Republicans have really made the border and immigrants their number one bogeyman issue. That's how they scare and that's how they excite and rile up their primary base.And so, instead of solving issues in education, health care, economic development, and so forth, they go back to the same thing over and over.

She is the oldest member currently serving in the U.S. Senate. And you'll recall that she has faced a pretty steady stream of questions about her health recently with members of her own party, saying that it may be time for her step down and resign after an extended absence -- her extended absence earlier this year as she was dealing with shingles.

We learned of their release after El Roi Haiti, the Christian humanitarian aid organization, the American nurse works, for released a statement. As you remember, Alix Dorsainvil, the wife of El Roi Haiti Director Sandro Dorsainvil and their child were abducted on July 27th in the morning while serving in their community ministry in El Roi Haiti's campus near the capital city Port-au-Prince.In a statement released a little while ago, El Roi Haiti said the following, \"It is with a heart of gratitude and immense joy that we at El Roi Haiti confirm that the safe release of our staff member and friend, Alix Dorsainvil, and her child who were held hostage in Port- au-Prince, Haiti. Today, we are praising God for answered prayer\", the statement said. John, the organization asks that no one contact Dorsainvil or her family. There is still much to process, they said, and to heal from in this situation. The same day, John, they were kidnapped, the U.S. State Department ordered the departure of non-emergency government personnel from Haiti as the security situation in the country deteriorates. As we have previously reported, Haiti's capital, Port- au-Prince, and surrounding areas have been gripped by years-long kidnapping for profit with hundreds of Haitians targeted by gangs, seeking ransom payments each year. A late July advisory by the U.S. State Department said that given the recent armed clashes, people were asked to leave -- citizens, U.S. citizens, I should say, were asked to leave the country immediately. But the good news today, the nurse and her child are now free, John. back to you.",

That, to which you just indicated, were three charges so far against the three looking for one other. And those charges, at this point, are assault in the third degree.Just briefly, what does that mean? It means intent to cause physical injury to another person. Now, it's not first or second degree, the distinction being serious physical injury from physical injury. And if it were first degree, it would involve a weapon, none of which is here.

In terms of witnesses, in terms of statements, in terms of what other evidence may point to that.When you locate at the issue of incitement of a riot, now what you're talking about is commanding, importuning, encouraging other people to engage in tumultuous and violent behavior that would affect public safety.

What were you doing? And whenever you're talking about assault the natural defense is self- defense. But in order to establish self-defense, you have to establish a few things. Number one, that you were in immediate fear, right, of safety yourself. Number two, that your actions in response to that were proportionate to whatever threat posed. And number three, that you acted reasonably.So, if that doesn't line up with what jurors, if it goes that farsee, then you can make the defense whether it will be successful as predicated upon what the facts show.
