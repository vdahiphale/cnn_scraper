He didn't have a big splash. And that was clearly deliberate, the campaign it feels and it's been betting both overtly and covertly that they can just last out a lot of their competitors in this primary. But, you know, Manu, I kept looking at those at the absence of DeSantis meeting with Biden. And I kept actually thinking about a big contrast when president Obama met with Jan Brewer in Arizona, and you know, she stuck her finger in his face.

But for the Biden White House, they see him as a critical partner in a lot of it -- a lot of important priorities. First and foremost, Ukraine funding, so I can tell you White House officials are watching McConnell's health very closely, not just for Biden, as a friend of McConnell, they go back, you know, generations they go back decades, but just as someone who can kind of be this bulwark against a really conservative right-wing House Republican Conference that really concerns them on their priorities.",

Thune and Trump, they have not really -- Trump has attacked John Thune repeatedly. One-time called him a RINO. He called -- John Cornyn, one- time, he called him a stiff. There was actually a comment about John Barrasso kind of a McConnell flunky, even though Barrasso is aligned himself much more with Trump, at least has defended him, unlike Cornyn and Thune who want to keep the president -- former president at an arm's length. How do you think this would work with Trump with any of these Republicans? STRAUSS: I mean, it's a good question. I -- especially if -- especially because Trump defers to his own criteria for supporters, which is strong compliments for him from anyone he's thinking about endorsing. And then they have to look the part also. But beyond that, I think the hazard for McConnell and his allies or anyone in the Senate is that Trump is very malleable to whatever you put in front of him.

Does it surprise you in any way that he's not helping these co-defendants? BARRON-LOPEZ: No, it doesn't surprise me. You know, he doesn't -- he also doesn't want to spend his own personal money on his legal bills, which is why he uses what he's raised for his campaign and diverted over to his legal bills. There is a risk there, though, to him not trying to help his co- defendants, we saw that. Just about a week or so ago, we found out from the Justice Department from the Special Counsel that a Mar-a-Lago security aide, flipped his testimony, got a new lawyer and decided oh, actually, I lied before, I'm going to tell the truth now, and flipped and is now providing testimony against Donald Trump's actions and against others that helped him with the Mar-a-Lago classified documents holding on to those documents.
