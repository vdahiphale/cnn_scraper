Now, the earthquake struck at 13 minutes past 11And you can see from that video that people were in restaurants and whatnot had to rush out into the streets. And since that earthquake took place, there have been at least a dozen aftershocks. So, many people are still staying outside for fear that buildings could collapse. And what we're hearing is that many buildings have collapsed, not just in Marrakesh itself, but in the towns and villages in the high Atlas Mountains. I've been through that area before, it's very rugged and very difficult for the rescue teams to reach those areas. Now, CNN was able to get through to one woman, Fatima, who lives in the remote town of Asni. What she told us is that, \"I barely got the chance to grab the children and run out before I saw my house collapsing in front of my eyes.\" The neighbor's house also collapsed. And she said, there are also two dead people under the rubble. And in that particular town, the rescue workers haven't even arrived at that point, when CNN spoke to her just a little while ago. Now, we understand that in addition to Moroccan authorities doing what they can and this includes the military to join in this rescue effort for instance, the United Arab Emirates is setting up an air bridge to provide Morocco with help. Israel is assembling rescue crews to send to Morocco as well. In France, they've mobilized to try to assist. For instance, the mayor of Marseille has assembled a team of firefighters to participate in the rescue effort. As far as the death toll, the last we heard from Moroccan television is that it was at least 820 people dead, but the assumption is that that number unfortunately will increase. Amara, Victor.",

Thank you so much. Before I begin, I must say my thoughts and prayers to the Moroccan people. What they witnessed during the last 12 hours is really mind-boggling. They're really going through some hardship as we see these things unfold in front of our eyes. Coming back to your question, this earthquake was a pretty significant size. It was magnitude 6.8. And an earthquake of that size can clearly produce a number of aftershocks, mainly in the range of magnitude 5s. And there's a small chance that an aftershock could be even higher than the main shock. However, we have so far recorded a magnitude 4.9, which was within first 20, 30 minutes of the main shock, and the aftershock activity does continue. This main shock had a very shallow depth and which was one of the important reasons for very strong shaking. In fact, our initial estimates suggested that about 400,000 people experienced very strong shaking in this earthquake.",

Just to give an example, if you go in a rural area in this country, you are typically going to look at mud-brick buildings, adobe constructions, stone masonry, or unreinforced brick masonry, maybe made of cinder block if they are newer.So, these are predominantly one to two-story high, located on slopes, and really vulnerable to earthquake shakings. So, even a magnitude five can easily bring those structures down if it is very close to those populated centers. And thus, any aftershock can, has a potential to bring some of these vulnerable buildings down.

Also, not in attendance thereSo, it is a notable statement. And the National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, we just heard from him in a briefing with reporters where he said that this was a series of \"consequential paragraphs on the war in Ukraine.\" And he says that he believes that these paragraphs do a \"very good job of standing up for the principle\" that states cannot use force to seek territorial acquisition. Now, at the same time, though, this joint leader statement is not a joint communique, which suggests that there is some divergence among the members in the views here. And that is noted, where it does say here that there are other members in the G20 that express different views on this issue. It's very similar to the kind of joint statement that we saw from the leaders at the end of the G20 last year in Bali. And all of this really underscoring the fact that most members in the G20 do, indeed, oppose Russia's invasion of the war in Ukraine, but that Russia remains a member of the G20. And China, which has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, also a very powerful member of the G20. This despite the fact that, as you mentioned, Victor, neither Xi Jinping nor Russian President Vladimir Putin are in attendance at this summit. And we've seen President Biden throughout the day today already beginning to take advantage of that opportunity, of the fact that Xi Jinping in particular is not here at the summit, both in making a very strong statement in the first leaders' meeting today about the war in Ukraine. But then also later as he made an appeal to developing countries that the United States, through its reforms that it is trying to make at the World Bank and increasing funding for the World Bank, is the most reliable partner for those developing countries heading into the future, very much taking a stand in offering another option, an alternative to the leadership that China has tried to stake out for the developing world.",

And then whether they should charge.You know, prosecutors have discretion. It's not always wise to charge even where they technically can.

The one in Sumy that we saw just there with the rescue crews were then able to actually pull several people out of that rubble.Two people, specifically, in that place. We can see the video. They are absolutely dramatic as pretty much with their bare hands. And with a fire extinguisher, they are trying to put out the fire, and then get those people out of there. So, that, in Sumy region. And then, Victor, I was just talking about Kryvyi Rih. That also a huge missile strike. And one of the things that we picked up on that one is that one person was killed. However, 72 people were wounded, as apparently, in Kryvyi Rih, that missile hit an urban area. At the same time, of course, a lot of people internationally looking at that interview. That Fareed Zakaria did with President Zelenskyy. There were a lot of really interesting things that Zelenskyy said there. One of the things we just heard about the compromise with Vladimir Putin. He also urged more patients on the part of those countries supporting Ukraine, specifically the United States with the counter offensive. And now, one of the things that we're seeing this morning is that Ukrainians are saying, they're continue to press that counter offensive on the southern front towards a town called, Melitopol. That's close to the Black Sea. The Ukrainians still pretty far away from there. But they do say they are making headway. And they also say that the Russians now are so under pressure on that part of the southern front, that they are moving. A lot of their most combat, ready airborne troops to that area to try and hold the Ukrainians up. And that could be an indication that the Ukrainians no longer as bogged down as they were before by those really tough minefields and trenches, possibly making more headway there. And obviously, also, the Russians feeling the heat as well and having to put more troops into that areas. There could be an indication, nevertheless, that going still very tough. And that's of course, one of the reasons why Volodymyr Zelenskyy, not only urged patients from the international community, specifically from the United States, but also, of course, the Ukrainians calling for more weapons as well. They did get 10 more main battle tanks that are made in Germany, and are set to get dozens more of that same model. So, we can see the Ukrainians, obviously, digging in for the long run, as far as that counter offensive is concerned, saying they do want to keep building momentum. That's also, of course, what Secretary of State Blinken said when he was in Kyiv this week, guys.",
