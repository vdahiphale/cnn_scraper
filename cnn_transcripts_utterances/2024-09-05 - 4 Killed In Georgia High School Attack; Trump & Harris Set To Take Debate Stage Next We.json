I don't know the nuances of that but assuming he is treated like an adult, the likely defense that will be offered as some skill be some sort of insanity defense. I am sure the evidence -- the physical and circumstantial evidence against him will be overwhelming.So for law enforcement to overcome that defense, they're going to have to prove in front of a jury that he understood the consequences of his actions, that he knew right from wrong. In the Aurora theater shooting, that was essentially the only defense that was available to the defendant. And that's exactly what the litigation became in front of a jury. In order to prove that, the investigators are going to have to delve into everything about this young person's life, his social media profile, everything he said or did with anyone in the last year, to work towards proving that. And I'm sure the investigation is being as thorough as it can into all of those things, then there are the issues of access to the weapon. We had the example several years ago in Michigan where two parents were held accountable under Michigan law for the reckless disregard that led to their 15-year-old getting access to an AR-style weapon. So there are those kinds of issues around culpability for the origins of the weapon, then of course, there's the issue of actual conspirator liability, whether or not anyone else actually aided and abetted him in committing this act. So there are layers upon layers here in the investigation. There's an awful lot to get done and we are way, way too early to have a lot of insight right now. So --",

So it'll be interesting to see if Trump attacks her on that. Yesterday, we also saw Harris in New Hampshire releasing more details from her own economic plan, which is also crucial ahead of this debate, we know that Trump has positioned himself as slipped pro- business candidate. So she is very much trying to prepare for I think a number of attacks she's going to face next week. Now, the big question will be, does Trump in next weeks debate focus on policy and Harris on that?

GRACE PANETTA, POLITICAL REPORTER, THE 19TH:  Yeah, I think what we're going to see in this debate is a really clear sort of articulation from the Harris side of what her economic policies are going to be. I think this coal kind of fracking question illuminates both the challenges and opportunities for Harris going into the debate. I think the big opportunity she has here on the economy. Latest polls including the CNN battleground poll released on Tuesday, shows that just kind of close the gap, the big gap that Biden had with Trump and how voters would trust more on the economy. And that's kind of why we see her moving to release more for economic plans. Of course, the vulnerability is her past positions she took in the 2020 primary when running for president, which Trump and his allies are going to look to hit her on, even though the show, those involved.",

We have her out there breaking with Biden on a tax-related issue, the capital gains tax.But it's clear that one of the things Trump is going to be trying to do in this debate is lump her in with, with Joe Biden.

I mean, yesterday, yes, she did talk about that capital gains tax, but she also talks -- to talk about targeting small businesses and trying to invest in those -- in small businesses, in particular. But the issue was she didn't talk about, you know, which sectors -- which small businesses in particular.I heard some Republicans chattering about that. So I think you're going to continue to hear, you know, she's not being specific enough. And once again, from the Trump campaign's perspective, this is all about contrast. They are trying to put him forth as upfront as the pro-business candidate, the former business leader talking about that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we didn't have high inflation. We know that Harris has also talked about price gouging, lowering prices, making this all about the cost of living. So that's I think what we could expect to see from her going into next week.",

CNN has identified the company as Tenet Media. It's linked to right-wing commentators and has millions of subscribers on YouTube and other social media platforms. [05:25:01] Trump's legal team is asking a federal appeals court for a stay in his hush money case sentencing until the judges can hear the former president's legal argument about getting that case moved to federal court. This comes just days after a federal judge denied moving the case and delaying the September 18 sentencing. In just a matter of hours, jury selection begins in Hunter Biden's tax evasion trial in Los Angeles. The president's son accused of failing to pay more than $1 million in taxes. And for filing false tax returns, he has pleaded not guilty and could face up to 17 years in prison if convicted. All right. Time now for weather. Five million people still under a flood watch in southern Texas and Louisiana. And meanwhile, heat alerts still in effect for nearly 55 million people across parts of the western United States.

It's two days ago, but its still valid because this is the flash flood threat that has encompass much of the south over the past several days and it continues into the weekend, dramatic, swift water rescue of a gentleman who was stuck within his car. There were six other people saved from the San Antonio fire department just along this road. You can see the swift water moving within that area. So that was San Antonio. They're out of the flood watch now, but the flood watch really confined to the coastal areas of Texas and Louisiana and parts of Mississippi where the potential here for several inches of rain exists across the southern portions of Louisiana. This is where the weather prediction center has a moderate risk of flash flooding or at least excessive rain that could lead to flash flooding with a slight risk extending towards the Galveston and Houston region. The potential here for six inches or more localized amounts according to some of the National Weather Service discussions of 10 inches are possible. So were going to watch out for that flood threat across the Deep South. The other big story, the heat continues across the West, 55 million Americans under heat alerts from L.A., northward into Portland. Check out the temperatures departure from normal. It should be 77 in L.A. It'll top 98 today, perhaps 100 degrees by tomorrow. Portland, you're a scorcher, 102 this afternoon. If you reach that temperature, it will only be the third time in recorded history where a temperature of 100 degrees or higher in the month of September has been recorded.
