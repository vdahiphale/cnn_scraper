This hasn't happened in the last 100 years, not to be able to finalize who was going to be your speaker in that first round, let alone after three rounds and there's still no conclusion.A tough day, everyone can say, for Kevin McCarthy. After all of this time, his dream of being speaker was within his reach. And he believes it still is. But so far, it has succeeded his grasp. So, the question tonight, where are we now? I mean, there's still no speaker of the House and they're going to do the whole thing tomorrow, beginning at noon. So here is where it all stands tonight. Kevin McCarthy does not, as we sit here today, have the votes, does not have that magical number of 218, let alone the majority of those voting at present. But then again, he is not alone because neither does anybody else. Now, there's no doubt that the horse trading will be going on, frankly, all night long, likely as we are conversing with one another right now.

It's going to take either some great luck or some magic, or something to get 15 people to come over to his side who have already said they are not going to do it.And look, anything is possible in this environment. Maybe McCarthy gives away the entire store, if he has not already done that. To Manu's point, that won't work for about, you know, I mean, at least four of the whole ballots. It won't work for them.

First of all, I think we do need to obviously hear from the doctors, you know, and get more clarity on exactly what has happened here, and then sometimes things get a little bit lost in translation. But nevertheless, two separate resuscitations', one on the field, where he sounds like he underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation for a period of time, and then had a defibrillator placed and was able to restore a normal rhythm to his heart.But then it sounds like his electrical rhythm to his heart was still unstable. And by the time he got to the hospital, it sounds, like from what Adrienne is saying, needed to be -- he needed to undergo a second resuscitation. It's obviously concerning. Also, something else that Adrienne pointed out, the idea that the lung damage itself, or the reason that he may be on his chest, on his abdomen, is in part sometimes, because the heart itself, when it's not working well, Laura, when it's not pumping blood well, the fluid, the blood, tends to backup. People develop swelling, for example, in the legs and the feet. But it can also develop swelling in the lungs. It becomes harder to oxygenate those lungs. Actually, flipping someone prone, into the prone position can help with that, but it also, again, speaks to the severity of things if that's what's in fact going on here. He is still listed in critical condition, which kind of fits the picture that has been described. But, you know, we obviously need to get more clarity from the medical team. And that may not happen for some time. They may wait for a while to get some test results back, get more of an idea of how he is doing, how the rest of his organs are doing beside his heart, how he's lungs, his brain and other things have responded to all this. So, it could take some time before we actually get some more medical details from the medical team itself.",

But I don't want to minimize, I mean, how critical, how serious this sounds.Again, from the details that we are now getting, a couple of things. One is, when the heart is not functioning well, Laura, you have the goal of trying to improve the heart function. That can be done through medicines that can help stimulate the heart and create a stronger pump, you know, so it can actually pump some of that blood throughout the body. And at the same time, you may decrease the demand from the body as well. Heart is not working well. Let's lower the demands of the body from the heart. And that is, in part, why he is sedated, and medically induced coma. The light picture, it sounds like, but also, things like hypothermia. Sometimes they will use hypothermia, actually cooling the patient, to try and reduce the demands that the patient's body has on the heart. Those are the things that are probably ongoing right now. And that process can take a while. And then even after that process, and he starts to improve. You then want to check and see how did the other organs fair here? How did the brain fare through all this? Did it get enough oxygen and blood throughout this? So, it can take -- it can take some time. I know that there is a desire, obviously, to get some sort of disposition on how he is doing and I am sure they are providing some, as much as they can, to the family. But it can take days, if not weeks, to really, sometimes, get a clear idea of exactly how he is going to do from all this.",
