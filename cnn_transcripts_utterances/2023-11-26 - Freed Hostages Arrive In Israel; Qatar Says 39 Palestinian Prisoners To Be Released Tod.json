We'll get to them in a moment.We begin with this breaking news. The third group of hostages released by Hamas is now safe in Israel, ending an excruciating 50 days of imprisonment for them. And here they are, in all, there were 17 handed over to the Red Cross a short time ago, including 13 Israeli citizens and, for the first time in this-limited four-day truce, an American was also among the freed hostages. Four-year-old Abigail Edan is now safe. She was the youngest of the Americans captured by Hamas on October 7th. Let's send it over to Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv.",

That is the first night that is really civilians were recently freed from captivity with Hamas actually entered Israel, not via that Kerem Shalom crossing where we've been the past two nights near the Israel- Gaza-Egypt's border, but instead, coming in through central Gaza directly into Israel, not passing through Egypt. So, our understanding is the reason that happened, because of the medical emergency involving one of those newly-freed hostages who is actually medically evacuated by helicopter, directly to a hospital.But the other 12 of those recently freed hostages, Wolf, we saw them come straight down this road here. Coming from that point along the Israel Gaza border, and headed in this direction straight towards that Hatzerim airbase, where on the first night of hostage release, we also saw those newly-freed hostages going to that airbase, from there, Wolf, we expected there would be taking helicopters to hospitals across Israel. These hospitals have been preparing for days for these newly-freed hostages to arrive. Their families are waiting for them at those hospitals. We've seen, over the last few days, as they have stayed there with their families in many cases, surrounded by medical, psychological, social support, a whole range of services being offered to them after this very traumatic experience of nearly 50 days for many of them of captivity with Hamas. Of course, Wolf, among the 13 hostages who were freed today from captivity, those Israelis were part of that deal between Israel and Hamas, nine of them are children or teenagers. One of them, of course, is little Abigail Edan, the four-year-old Israeli American citizen, who, of course, we hear the president earlier tonight speaking about her case directly, talking about the efforts that his administration in the Israeli government underwent to try and secure her release. Finally, tonight, Wolf, she is freed from captivity. She is now back firmly on Israeli soil. Unfortunately, Wolf, it's important remember, she is also orphaned because Hamas terrorists killed her family on October 7th. But, nonetheless, Wolf, finally freed from the nightmare that she faced over these last 50 days of captivity.",

This is where they've set up in a hole here behind me with a big screen, watching the release of their friends, their community, the members of their loved ones from the hands of Hamas in captivity in Gaza.We spoke with one woman who described the last seven weeks as a hell. She said, 61 people from the small community of Kfar Aza were buried. She had to go, at one, point to eight funerals in one day. Because of the amount of people murdered there on October 7th in the Hamas terror attack. That list, she says, includes her husband. Today, finally, after seven weeks of darkness, seven weeks of what she called hell, this was a bit of joy, a bit of light for all these people here. All of these families, who have waited to hear word of what happened to their friends, their loved ones, their families who are held inside of Gaza. They had no updates over the course of the past several weeks. They set up here, first, to be together, second, also to see the latest updates from Israeli news, as the pictures, as the videos came out. We have repeatedly heard applause from the room behind us.

If Hamas can release ten more hostages, they could get another extra day in a truce. For every ten more hostages they can buy another day. They need this. I'm sure they suddenly do, because of the suffering that the people in Gaza have gone through and for the Israelis, they would welcome this, that means hostage hot more hostages can be released. There's still about 200 hostages that remain in Hamas. These other groups, like Oren which is talking about. So, I think both sides would welcome an extension of this truce, but as we've seen, especially what we saw yesterday, when it was delayed because of some disagreement that Hamas was not happy about, it's not done until it's done. Even if they do agree to it, they will always one side of the other accused the other of violating it. This Qatari ministry of foreign affairs spokesman saying so, it's a tenuous troops, but still a glimmer of hope that it could be extended, if Hamas can agree to it, and Israel can agree to it, Wolf.",

So far, the quota as part of the temporary truce, a lot of 200 trucks to come in. And they've almost, they hit almost that on Saturday, 187 trucks came in. The Egyptians told us today that at least 120 trucks were allowed into Gaza, and the Palestinian Red Crescent has confirmed that at least 100 trucks made it to northern Gaza, which is the sticking point during the disagreement with Hamas yesterday.And Northern Gaza is where the most in need is. There's a fear that dehydration could be breaking out there. Some diseases could be breaking out there because food has run out. Water has run out. And in a country where 1.7 million people are displaced, this -- every amount of food, and fuel, and water, and cooking gas coming in is in Italy snapped up. That's why you see people scrambling to pick up whatever pieces they can get as soon as the trucks drive into Gaza. But at the same time, with the pause in fighting, you see people go back to the markets, long lines outside fuel stations to try to get some cooking gas or fuel, people going back to the markets, hoping to pick up essentials that they have not been able to do it almost 50 days because of that fighting. So much relief, as you can see, from this one individual. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UM IHAB, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): For 47 days of war, we were living in fear. Our kids were terrified. This was the first time we went out. We were afraid to go out, because of the missiles and the airstrikes. Since the first day of the cease-fire, we have been able to go out, to buy our needs safely.

We've seen, this is a day-by-day approach, hour by hour process, nothing is guaranteed, and nothing is being taken for granted.But the proof that this is working, and worth pursuing further, isn't every smile and every grateful tear we see on the faces of those families who are finally getting back together again. The proof is little Abigail, more than 20 other children, 18 years and younger, have been released. They've been released through this deal as well. They have endured a terrible ordeal. They can now begin the long journey towards healing. I'm going to continue working with the emir of Qatar, President Sisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, to do everything possible to see the hostage freed, all the hostages. I'm grateful for the personal partnership, as we pursue this deal from each of those men I just mentioned. As we work together to see all this implemented, and now, to try to extend it further.

But it's not even clear what that would mean, because they are releasing a lot of Israelis.So I have not been able to figure out whether there is a rationale, as you know, Hamas holds the United States responsible because of all the military aid it gives Israel. So, perhaps there's some desire to, quote/unquote, punish the American hostages more by holding the back. But honestly, Wolf, this is part of the challenge of dealing with Hamas, which is a terrorist organization with which very few countries have relations. So you're getting everything third hand through Qatar. Even the Qataris do not have very strong relations with them.

Which is to be very supportive of Israel, hug the Israelis, be there in their hour of need and trauma. But then quietly, and I emphasize quietly, counsel them to take a wiser course than the one they're taking.We have good reports that suggest that President Biden told Prime Minister Netanyahu not to go for an all out massive ground invasion of Gaza. Not to use as much firepower as they have used. To be more targeted, more discreet, to make getting the hostages back, the primary goal. Prime Minister Netanyahu has, so far, not, as far as I can tell, who really listened. He's pocketed the support and pushed back on the pressure. How President Biden would handle that has things go forward, you notice in every conversation President Biden has, every statement, he mentions that he wants to get to a political strategy here, which is a two state solution. What he's trying to say, look, we want to be very clear. A violent militant armed resistance that Hamas represents is completely off the table. And will be dealt with brutally. We want to keep alive the political hope, the political aspirations for the Palestinian people, and the political track. Now, that is not a view that Prime Minister Netanyahu holds. For 15 years, Prime Minister Netanyahu has tried to do everything he can to make the two-state solution impossible, in part, by among other things, building up Hamas to divide the Palestinians. He led in more workers from Gaza through a tacit agreement with Hamas. He allowed the Qataris to fund Hamas. So there's a real contradiction coming up between American strategy and political strategy and Prime Minister Netanyahu's approach. And for a while, with all these temporary pauses, this can can get kicked down the road, but it won't get kicked down the road forever.",

Israel managed to survive, obviously.But Anwar Sadat, made a dramatic announcement that he was ready to make peace with Israeli and go to Jerusalem, addressed the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and talk about establishing peace between Israel and Egypt. What happened? Even after that war, when Egypt, the largest of all of the Arab countries, potentially at that point the greatest threat to Israel, announced that they want to make peace with Israel. They made peace with Israel, the Camp David Accords, Jimmy Carter was involved in that, and there's a peace treaty that still exists to this very day between Israel and Egypt, even after that war. And so, some Israelis have been saying to me over those past couple days that have been here, maybe now, even after this horrible Hamas attack, there could still be some sort of reconciliation, some sort of arrangement that potentially could lead to what President Biden keeps talking about, this two-state solution.
