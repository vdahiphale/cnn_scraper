Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins me now live from Tel Aviv. So what is the status of this pause it is limited to one road.

It kind of came out of the blue this announcement on Sunday that this tactical pause which is just going to affect local time until 7This announcement came out on Sunday, and then it was swiftly followed by a clarification, saying that this tactical pause does not mean that there will be a cessation in hostilities in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, especially in the southernmost city of Rafah which Israel sees as Hamas has lost readout and where it must do battle with Hamas to destroy its last remaining battalions. So what we understand is that this initial announcement went out Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, apparently only learned about it through media reports. And they're also Israeli media reporting that you Yoav Gallant, the defense minister also didn't know about this announcement coming out in advance. So effectively, you have the two men there were three of course, until Benny Gantz left the war cabinet last week, the two men who comprise Israel's war cabinet, which manages this war against Hamas, seemingly being unaware that this tactical pause was something that was going to happen, which, you know, certainly raises questions about, you know, who knew what and who actually made this decision. Indeed, as you say, far-right minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir coming out and saying that in his words, the evil fool who made this decision for a tactical pause should lose -- should be fired from their position, not least, given what happened over the weekend, which was a deadly incident explosion there Rafah, that killed eight soldiers, at least 10 Israeli soldiers being killed over the weekend in fighting in the Gaza Strip. So in the wake of that, Itamar Ben-Gvir saying that this was even less appropriate than it otherwise might have been. But of course, the point of this tactical pause is to enable more humanitarian aid to get to the people that need it most in the Gaza strip that had already was already not enough, then it's gone down to a trickle since Israel took over the wrath of border crossing because Israel -- Egypt closed it, saying that it couldn't guarantee the safety of humanitarian aid truck drivers. On top of that the Kerem Shalom crossing, which I know you just had up on a map that has come under rocket fire from Hamas as well. So that's not always been opened. So the amount of aid getting through there has gone down to a trickle. This tactical pause was initially welcomed by the likes of the main Palestinian refugee agency, UNWRA and UNICEF cautiously welcome but even UNICEF saying that look, this is no substitute for a silk full ceasefire. And just in the last half hour or so CNN has received a statement from a couple of U.N. agencies saying the situation on the ground has not improved as a result of this tactical pause. [01:05:08] Because there are still a lack of law and order to guarantee the safety of this humanitarian aid, getting to where it's needed most, Michael?",

And worse, I mean, reports have accused Hamas of war crimes as well, we should say, but what is the totality of these reports when it comes to how Israel is prosecuting this war? ANTONY LOEWENSTEIN, AUTHOR, \"THE PALESTINE LABORATORY\": Absolutely devastating. And the only major party which says that everything is going fine is Israel, every single leading human rights organization in the world, the ones you mentioned, everyone in Israel, the human rights organizations within Israel, Palestine, certainly Gaza, are all saying the same thing, which is people are particularly in the north of Gaza, but also elsewhere, are often starving malnutrition, there are thousands and thousands of young Palestinian kids, some of whom are dying from starvation. So the idea that we're going to believe the Israeli government, you have a sadly, long history of lying about the facts on the ground in Gaza is absurd. And this is the reality it is utterly devastating and apocalyptic, where the rate of malnutrition and death is some of the worst we've seen in the last decade. It's just horrific.",

From the beginning, there was little chance of making meaningful headway. Russia was not invited. China did not attend. Still, it was a show of continued support from Ukraine's Western allies. Although Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy did offer a one way for peace talks to begin. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Regarding negotiations with Russia, I think I've said it in a detailed manner. Russia can start negotiations with us tomorrow, not waiting for anything if it retreats from our lawful territory. HOLMES (voice-over): Russia has dismissed the summit and on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin laid out his terms for peace talks, namely the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from four provinces that Moscow only partially controls and claims to have annexed and Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO. Proposals neither side will accept. Even at the summit there were some divisions on a final statement, which most delegations signed, reaffirming the importance of Ukraine's territorial integrity and political independence and calling for Ukraine to once again control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But there were key holdouts who did not sign the communique, including India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates, who have trade relations with Russia. Attendees say a follow up Summit is possible. And the joint statement cited the need for dialogue between all parties in order to reach peace, though just how and when to engage with Russia was left unanswered. And some leaders left skeptical.",

Both of these ideas are things that have been researched very substantially. And there's really no evidence for either. But still when an offshore wind farm is proposed or when a solar farm is proposed oftentimes epicenter of the opposition to those projects are these two false claims.

Poland missing their legendary striker Robert Lewandowski (ph) with injuries but they still took the lead through Adam Busker (ph) in the 16th minute albeit against the run off play. At the Dutch (ph) through level in the 29th minute with a deflected shot from Cody Gakpo (ph) but the games seem to be heading for a drawer which would have been a disappointing result for the Dutch considering their superior possession, and their 20 attempts on goal. But their persistence paid off in the last ten minutes. Substitute Wout Weghorst was sent on to shake things up and just two minutes later, he delivered, rifling home. The winner for a 2-1 score. The Dutch had looked really good coming into this tournament. I think they'll be relieved to have kicked off with all three points in their opening game. So the Netherlands have three points, but there's another opening game to come in this group. That will be France. One of the favorites as well. They'll be playing Austria in Dusseldorf on Monday.
