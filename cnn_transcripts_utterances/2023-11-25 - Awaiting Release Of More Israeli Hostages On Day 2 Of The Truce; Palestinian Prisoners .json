And in exchange, Israel is prepared to release up to 42 more prisoners. CNN has learned that no Americans are expected to be released today. Under the deal, Israel is freeing three Palestinians from jail for every Israeli hostage allowed out of Gaza, but Palestinian officials are warning of what they call a possible crisis in the deal. They say that Israel is not following the terms of the prisoner release deal as it relates to seniority.The truce also allows the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. More than 78 trucks entered Gaza today through the Rafah crossing, carrying food and water and fuel and medical supplies. CNN is covering the developments with Arlette Saenz, Jeremy Diamond and Larry Madowo. They're live with us. But we're going to start with CNN Anchor Kaitlan Collins. So, we have seen one day of a successful exchange, several more to go. What are we expecting over the next few hours, Kaitlan?",

And so they are waiting to see that this exchange actually happens, Victor, to make sure before they even come close to celebrating the fact that they are hopeful that a second group of hostages will soon be reunited with their families. And we are approaching the time yesterday when we started to see this process begin to take place where the hostages were handed over in Gaza by Hamas to the Red Cross. And from there, they were taken in those ambulances and that dramatic scene really where we saw them going through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. They were there before they met with Israeli forces, and then were brought here to hospitals throughout Israel.And so what we're hearing today is a little bit of confusion over the number on this list. What we are told by multiple sources, Jeremy Diamond and I, is that 13 names are on that list that was handed over to Israel last night. They get the names the night before, they start to call the families to let them know that yes, their loved one is coming home or no, they don't expect them to be coming home. We are told, however, that Israel had been expecting 14 names to be on that list and instead there are only 13. What we are told is that in the last several hours there have been continued discussions over what that ultimate number is going to be. We know whatever it is on that list, it's in exchange for 42 Palestinian prisoners who will be released from prisons here in Israel for those Israeli hostages that are expected to be released given we know no Americans are slated to be on this list today. So all of this remains to be seen. Right now, though, we are expecting 13 names to be on that list. We'll see if that changes throughout the day. Of course, we have reporters covering this all over the ground. Jeremy Diamond is in Kerem Shalom. I want to start though with Arlette Saenz. Arlette, obviously, White House officials have been watching this just as closely as officials here in Israel have been, we heard from President Biden yesterday. What's their reaction to your reporting that no Americans are expected to be on this list today?",

But I think what we're learning in this discrepancy in the how many people are going to be on this list is that a lot of officials here in Israel that are I mean, obviously anyone except for Hamas, they're just now learning more about the condition of these hostages, there's been so little insight into who potentially could be produced by Hamas as a part of this deal.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. And the fact that, Kaitlan, we are learning that there are still at this hour ongoing discussions that appears as late as this morning going on about the number of hostages and other details. The Palestinian official earlier today raising issues about the number -- the type of Palestinian prisoners who Israel is releasing in exchange for these hostages. It just shows you how fragile and tense this situation still is. And that is why Israeli officials have really been taking this day by day and making clear that issues could arise and will arise in the process.The hope and the expectation is still though, that we will see a release of hostages today and that those issues, outstanding issues will be resolved. But I want to show you a little bit of where we are right now because as you can see there's Israeli military vehicles, there's Israeli military personnel all around us. This is actually the road where those hostages yesterday who were released, newly freed, traveled down this road. I want to take you with me here. This is where we expect that if they do indeed cross into -- through the Kerem Shalom crossing, they will come down this road and straight down. This is the route towards that Hatzerim Airbase where they then went to make their first phone calls to their families and then be helicoptered over to Israeli hospitals. This is the road that they took down here, which would take them to the base. Yesterday, we were at an overlook point where we saw that convoy of ambulances actually drive down this route. There were also helicopters waiting in a field nearby. In case of a medical evacuation, in case that would be necessary for any of these hostages, that ultimately did not appear to be necessary yesterday. We know that there were two of these hostages who were taken by ambulance directly to hospitals rather than stopping first at that airbase. But they were not in a grave enough medical condition, it appears for them to be actually medically evacuated by helicopter. But everything is being prepared as you know, Kaitlan. There has have been so many preparations in terms of the medical support, the social support, the psychological support, financial support that all of these newly freed hostages and their families might need. And so that effort is obviously continuing even as we understand that there are still some ongoing issues in the negotiations to resolve for today's hostage release.",

It also allows for no fighting to happen in Gaza right now.It's been incredibly quiet there, compared to what the last several weeks have looked like. It also calls for an increased amount of aid going into Gaza, aid that is so desperately needed by the millions of people who live there.

U.S. officials say they do not expect Americans to be among the hostages released today, but they expect them to be released at some point during this four-day temporary truce.Joining me now is former Navy SEAL commander and former coordinator of the hostage working group for the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, Daniel O'Shea. Daniel, you are the right person to talk with -- about this at this moment. I want to start with the logistics of what happens, this very delicate handover process. What are we seeing? And more importantly, what are we not seeing that is happening as these hostages are handed over? DANIEL O'SHEA, FORMER NAVY SEAL COMMANDE: Well, I think what they're not seeing is where the hostages are being brought out of the ground or presumably the tunneling system for obvious reasons. That's part of the logistics challenge for Hamas, because obviously, hostages are probably held together in a number of different groups spread out over Gaza. But that's what we're not seeing. But the critical piece is to date has gone smoothly, at least first day, even though the ceasefire was extended because of firefights going past the 07. So, I'm cautiously optimistic that the transfer will continue via the Red Cross to the border into Egypt and then they're being flown into Israel, and then obviously being taken into hospitals. But the critical thing is what's going on in the hospitals, their medical checkups, and the mental health which is going to be a lasting process for all these hostages.",

They knew the IDF would respond to their attacks on October 7. Right now these hostages are the only bargaining chip that in world opinion, but without those hostages, there's nothing that will stop the IDF from finishing what they started three weeks ago, four weeks ago with the offensive.

Let's hope that the four days go smoothly, and that it does get extended because that has been the expectation set. But again, we're really sitting on a tinder block. Hamas and Israel do not trust each other. They did not negotiate this deal across from a table with each other. This was all done through third party intermediaries and could fall apart very easily.

The Thai -- the fortunate thing for the Thai and the Filipino to be -- the 10 Thai and the one Filipino released yesterday, as if there's no real strategic value to Hamas for them.
