Those are the markets and these are the main events. The US Secretary of State says there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and Tony Blinken is due to speak shortly, we will bring you that live. US lawmakers are expected to vote down a bipartisan border deal opposed by former President Trump. It includes billions for Ukraine and Israel. And pressing question here: How much is too much to pay for a French fry. Customers start to push back against fast food inflation. Live from New York, it is Wednesday, February 7th. I'm Paula Newton, in for Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. And we are expecting to hear from the US Secretary of State. Any moment now, Antony Blinken has been meeting with Israeli and Palestinian leaders today as Hamas releases its proposal to bring an end to the conflict. We will bring you that press conference once it begins. You are seeing a live picture of the podium right now. We do expect him to reach that podium very soon. And all of this comes after the Israeli Prime Minister rejected an offer from Hamas for a ceasefire in Gaza. Instead, he promised to achieve, \"complete victory\" in a matter of months. Benjamin Netanyahu argues that agreeing to Hamas' demands would lead to more violence. Listen.

They are reduced people. Their lives are reduced and as they say, there is just sort of -- you know, the world is moving on and in a way life is moving on, but they are standing still waiting for those -- waiting for their loved ones to be released and they really don't feel that the prime minister is listening to them on that.",

In fact, there were just a handful of Republicans who voted for it, including the author, Senator James Lankford, who voted to advance that legislation. It failed to advance, that means that process is now completed.

Any military campaign, military operation that Israel undertakes needs to put civilians first and foremost in mind. And I suggested, again, some ways to do that. And that's especially true in the case of Rafah, where there are somewhere between 1.2 million and 1.4 million people, many of them displaced from other parts of Gaza.

And on UNRWA, look, the -- we were deeply concerned by the allegations that were made about the participation or involvement of some of its employees in the -- in October 7th.

What I can only add in response to the rest of your question is it's clear to me, from talking to many of the countries in the region, that they're prepared to do things with and for Israel that they were never prepared to do in the past, including steps that would further address any security concerns it might have. And similarly, the United States is prepared to do that, too. But the details of that, the substance of that, these are all things that we continue to talk about in these conversations, in our diplomacy, and will bring it into ever-sharper focus because at some point, yes, it will be very important to put forward exactly those details and see if, for all parties concerned, there is a credible pathway to walk down.

So I want to ask you if that's the case, and if so, is that a type of pressure point that you feel is needed to get Israel to agree to a ceasefire and one that could ultimately lead to a two-state solution? That's the first issue. The second issue I want to ask you about is the fact that Israel has maintained that Hamas needs to be eliminated, that it cannot have any role in governing Gaza after the war has ended. Where does the U.S. currently stand on this? Is it in any way acceptable to the U.S. for Hamas to be playing a role in governing Gaza in a day-after scenario, and what would U.S. policy be toward Hamas going forward?",

But our focus today is on all of the diplomacy needed to bring it about, including, again, getting ideas, getting proposals from all concerned, and putting those together in a credible and clear plan. So that's where we are, and as I said, we'll continue to have these conversations to engage in that diplomacy, to really sharpen the focus on all of the different elements that would be necessary, that would be involved, and that each of the parties believes is important.

The narrative sounds very much the same. It's an appeal to Israel to improve the humanitarian delivery to Gaza to avoid civilian casualties going forward. But as you note, it's not to say categorically, don't go into Rafah because that will worsen the humanitarian situation and cause more civilian casualties. It is be careful and try to help those people, which has been the message before. Now Secretary Blinken tried to say that and frame it that there have been improvements since the United States first started that push with Israel. And indeed, that is correct. There have been improvements. There have been a lot of setbacks along the way as well. But it really sounds like, an even from Secretary Blinken has come at the end of a long day. It's come at the end as well. Probably a short night last night wading through the Hamas proposed counterproposal as it was and he does sound as if for the moment he's spent a lot of energy on this today and you get -- you do get that sense that he's trying to keep hope alive in the face of a situation where, yes, it's possible theoretically to close some of these gaps, but he's dealing with a partner here who doesn't appear minded to close the gaps, and who wants to press ahead. And that's what Prime Minister Netanyahu said. He told Secretary Blinken today that victory was at hand within a couple of months, that it was close, essentially stick with Israel on this, it seems absent of any other diplomatic move that we can't see that the United States is really not changing the course of what Israel set out on October 7th, partly because they share the same view. And I think we got it definitively there to Mohammed Jamjoom of Al-Jazeera, his question to Secretary Blinken, what space and role do you see for Hamas in the future? And the answer was no, there is none. And that's very much in keeping with what the United States has said all along. And that's so that is entirely Israel's view. Hamas must be destroyed.

That is a strong statement and yet I wonder, I asked you, is a lot of what's going to be brought to bear here is what the White House now intends to do. Antony Blinken will go back to Washington and will report back to the president. You and I both know that Joe Biden is under a lot of pressure, especially in swing states like Michigan, where there is a large Arab population, to come back empty handed.
