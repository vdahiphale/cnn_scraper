CNN is on the ground in Lithuania where the president and key U.S. allies are preparing for their high-stakes talks.Also tonight, new developments in the Trump classified documents indictment, the Trump Team now facing a deadline to weigh in on the timing of the trial. This as the former president's co-defendant is accused of unnecessary delay by the special counsel. And parts of the northeastern United States are swamped by historic flooding, a once in a thousand-year rainfall swallowing cars in West Point, New York. I'll speak with the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, this hour. We'll discuss the state's emergency response. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, on the eve of a pivotal NATO summit, we're learning that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy plans to make a personal appeal on Ukraine's bid to join the alliance. He'll attend the summit and hold face-to-face talks with President Biden. CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz is joining us live. She's in Vilnius, Lithuania, where the summit will take place. Arlette, what more are you hearing from your sources about the Biden/Zelenskyy meeting? ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Wolf, President Biden will, in fact, sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy here at the NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania. That's according to an official familiar with the meeting. He told me that a little bit earlier this evening. Now, the meeting comes as Zelenskyy's attendance at the summit had been in question, but it will be one sign of unity as Russia's war in Ukraine is expected to dominate much of the conversation here at the NATO summit. These allies are also expected to discuss a pathway for Ukraine to eventually join NATO. Zelenskyy has been seeking security guarantees and wants to have a more clear timeline, a more clear road map for how Ukraine could join the alliance. But President Biden recently in an interview with our colleague, Fareed Zakaria, poured cold water on the idea of Ukraine joining the alliance at this moment, as the war in Ukraine is still ongoing and allowing Ukraine into NATO would further involve NATO countries and potentially put them in direct conflict with Russia. Additionally, Biden has argued that there are diplomatic reforms that Ukraine would also need to make before joining the alliance. All of these issues are expected to come up as the two leaders will meet here in Lithuania on Wednesday. And on the eve of the summit, there's another historic development that could significantly expand NATO's territory. NATO Secretary- General Stoltenberg announced this evening that turkey will now approve Sweden's ascension to the NATO alliance. Turkey had been blocking this bid for about a year now over some concerns Erdogan has argued that Sweden has harbored groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists. Stoltenberg today saying that Turkey has now agreed to allow Sweden into the alliance. One question going forward is the time line for that is that this will still need be to voted on by the Turkish parliament. Now, President Biden had been waging a full-court press behind the scenes in the lead-up to this summit. He had expressed optimism that this might actually happen while they were here in Lithuania. The president actually held a phone call with Erdogan as he flew from the U.S. to London on Air Force One, on Sunday evening, and he said in that phone call that he wanted to see Sweden's joining of NATO happen as soon as possible. There has also been conversations between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and also National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and their counterparts in Turkey. Tomorrow, President Biden will be sitting down for a bilateral meeting with Erdogan, where they will talk further about this as this represents a historic development on this eve of the summit.",

      "sentences": "Well, quite a bit, Wolf. We don't have confirmation of that yet from the Ukrainian side. It's not terribly surprising. There is a lot that Zelenskyy would like to accomplish at the NATO summit. Ukrainian officials have been quite coy about his independence.But, Wolf, it is remarkable to recognize the fact that Finland and soon Sweden have joined or will be joining the NATO alliance very quickly while Ukraine has wanted to join NATO for a very long time. They were told as far back as 15 years ago in 2008 in the Bucharest agreement that they could join NATO, but at the time there was no concrete plan laid out. And, Wolf, that is the main thing Zelenskyy wants right now. He wants what he is calling a technical invitation to NATO. He wants a plan of how and when Ukraine can be expected to join the alliance. In the meantime, he also wants security guarantees. Now, of course, many of the NATO countries have been providing weaponry, military aid, security aid to Ukraine over the past 17 months. That has been done with some kind of collaboration between the countries, but not at an official NATO level. And so Ukraine and President Zelenskyy want security assurances from the NATO alliance in the long-term so that they can count on NATO for weaponry and other kinds of things in the long-term. Zelenskyy is saying that there's a possibility that he could go, but he's not going to go to the summit for fun. There are concrete outcomes that he wants, Wolf.",

And when the U.S. announced this, the reasons that they gave were similar to the reasons that we heard from Ukrainian officials, that Russians have been using these munitions for the past 17 months, that Ukraine would not use these in civilian areas, they would only be used against Russian troops and to take back territory. The U.S. says that assurances have been given by Ukraine in writing that Ukraine will keep track of where these munitions are fired for demining operations later in the future.Ukraine is also highlighting how effective these weapons can be, because cluster munitions are much more lethal than your standard artillery munitions, several times more lethal. So, at this point, Wolf, when this counteroffensive is moving relatively slowly, the Ukrainians do believe they can have quite some effect. At the same time, the U.S. is saying that they are needed to be sent to Ukraine right now because of the low supplies of the more standard artillery munitions. Wolf?",

Let's start, Spider, with the pivotal NATO summit upcoming this week. President Zelenskyy had said he wouldn't attend just, quote, for fun. So, does the fact that he'll meet Wednesday with President Biden in Lithuania signal there could be some progress on Ukraine's future in the NATO alliance after the war? MAJ. GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It is possible that it could happen. Right now, certainly, it's totally inappropriate. There is very little chance that Ukraine will be embraced by the other NATO members. It doesn't have an economy. Its infrastructure is completely collapsed. There's been migration of millions of very educated Ukrainians out of Ukraine. Will they ever return? Nobody really knows. So, there could be a pathway. There should be a pathway for Ukraine, but this is a distant kind of an invitation. I also find it odd that Zelenskyy would, in some case, kind of lecture the other NATO members, the hand that feeds them, that he's not showing up for fun. I'm not saying that anybody going to the NATO conference thinks there's fun while there is a war going on in Europe.",

So, what he needs is those fighters loyal to him, and they pledge that, loyal to each to the commander in chief, and not to Prigozhin necessarily.It's interesting, I think, Wolf, that there was no indication that Prigozhin himself swore allegiance to Putin in that meeting. So, we'll have to see. You know, this is perhaps deliberately now very confusing and it serves the Kremlin to have a lot of obfuscation just so people can't even follow what's going on.

The Wagner Group, on the other hand, have been doing that.Now, let's be frank. They don't have any rules of engagement so they're very brutal at what they do. But that gets to the heart of Putin's, I think, loyalty to Prigozhin and why Putin has allowed him not to be held accountable. I find this incredibly unbelievable that loyalty is such a large factor to Putin but this act of extreme disloyalty, this potential coup, has been left unpunished in any particular way.",

The legal strategy is one thing, but just the political strategy because of where we see the political calendar there. And that is to delay, and if delay isn't possible, to use it as a way to play the victim card. And we have seen, according to pretty much every single poll starting when the former president was indicted the first time and then the second time and where he is right now, he has been able to use these indictments as a plus, which, again, I think we're kind of taking it for granted because it's Trump but it bears repeating that that is not a normal political situation. It is a unique to Trump situation to be indicted not once, but twice, and then use it as a political plus, but he has been so far in the Republican electorate universe.",

They're planning those trips as if he's just running as the GOP frontrunner, of course, but they are also dealing with this and essentially bracing for the fact that this could happen while he's out in public or what it's going to look like.With the January 6th case no one knows who is going to be indicted there, what the charges could be. It's not as narrow as the documents case where we had a pretty good idea that they were zeroing in on Trump and his role and potentially Walt Nauta and some other witnesses in that case. January 6th is much broader. It's much more complicated. There is clearly a focus on the attorneys who were around Trump at that time, the Sidney Powells, the John Eastmans, the Rudy Giulianis of the world. So, I think they're kind of waiting to see who will be held responsible, who will be charged, will Trump be someone, will he be an unindicted co-conspirator, I think, Georgia as well. Governor kemp was just on in an interview the other day saying he's not sure why it's taking so long for indictments in that case to happen given they've been investigating it for so long but that is the timeframe where we're expecting and it could include Trump himself.

But what we have to do is make that commitment clear to Ukraine that, yes, if you do those things, you will be welcomed into NATO. And I think that's why this verbal commitment and the commitment this week is so important.",

And keep in mind, there are plenty of candidates that will be out there working in the Hawkeye state. And it's important to note, Iowa was never meant to be the state to pick the nominee. This was a state that winnows the field. It's a beautiful state in terms of low amount to put your ads on television and candidates like many that I've worked for that don't have a lot of money in the bank can get out there, get their message to the voters, and do some good solid retail politics. Iowa is a state where you can live off the land, you can work with very tight budget and get the message out, and there's more than one ticket out of Iowa.
