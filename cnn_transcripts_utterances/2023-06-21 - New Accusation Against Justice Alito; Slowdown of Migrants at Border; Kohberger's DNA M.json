And that DNA, according to this document, is a statistical match to that unknown DNA on the knife sheath. Now, this document came about because the defense had filed a motion for discovery. They wanted all the information they could find, which is definitely reasonable, on the DNA, the forensic testing, everything they could find. So this, in a sense, is responding to all of that. But now also another headline from this is the first time we are hearing in writing -- and we confirmed this through our sources on the very first day of when he was arrested - but the first time it's in a legal document, that the FBI took that unknown DNA on the knife sheath originally to a public genealogy database and they looked at any matches, even remote of any DNA that matched even in slight part to that unknown DNA along with old-fashioned investigative work of geography, who would be in that northeast area of the United States, and they told local authorities Kohberger is the person you need to look at. And it went on from there. And then the state authorities took it from there, along with the FBI.
