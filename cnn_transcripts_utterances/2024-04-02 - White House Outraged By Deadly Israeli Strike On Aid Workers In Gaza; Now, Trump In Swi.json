Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. We begin with a deadly strike on aid workers in Gaza. It's prompting new condemnation of Israel's war tactics and forcing the suspension of desperately needed food deliveries to Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more from Jerusalem. We want to warn you some of the images in this report are graphic and may be disturbing to viewers. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): There is no mistaking the target of this Israeli strike. The World Central Kitchen's logo still visible after a missile tore through the roof of this vehicle. Pieces of the aid organization's emblem scattered throughout the charred hull of a second vehicle. And then there are the bodies of the aid workers themselves, patches proudly worn on chests, over bulletproof vests that offered no more protection in Gaza than the emblem of a humanitarian aid organization. They are among seven aid workers killed in Israeli strikes on their convoy late Monday night. Six of them were foreigners, including a dual American-Canadian citizen, as well as British, Australian and Polish nationals, triggering international uproar and prompting a rare acknowledgement of Israeli responsibility from Prime Minister Netanyahu.",

Wade, as Donald Trump puts it, was bad for the country. And the events of recent days, particularly the Supreme Court decision in Florida, which cleared the way for a six-week abortion ban and also puts it on the ballot in November, drives home the fact that a lot of voters will have abortion on their minds in the fall, and Democrats believe that probably works to their advantage.",

So, he's really been all over the map, and he's going to have to get pretty clear on his messaging because the pro-life wing of his party feels responsible for helping to get him elected. But this is an issue that, for sure, imperils Republicans. We have metrics to show that, the 2022 midterm elections being one, votes in Kansas and Ohio, red states that Trump won that rejected these kinds of effective bans. Voters there don't want these.

It's not just -- we didn't see these gains in Kansas and Ohio, but even in places like Michigan, where the president just left. You saw Whitmer, who made incredible inroads and Republican strongholds and suburbs outside of Detroit and Grand Rapids on this particular issue. Democrats were able to build an aggressive, diverse coalition, from young to old, to people of color, as well as women in the suburbs, that really are sort of rejecting Republicans' extreme agenda on this issue. So, the president is double downing with ads in these battleground states, Florida being one of them. This is an issue that they continue to see as a winner. But I will add, I mean, my recommendation to the president is continue to make this the center of the campaign, but he also has to become even more aggressive on the issue of the border. Why not start running ads, putting the blame for the open border on Republicans, congressional Republicans, on Donald Trump, in these key battleground states. Immigration and border has now become a national issue right up there with abortion that I think could, if they start to message right and aggressively could help build and stabilize that coalition going into November.

Now, Trump this morning immediately posting again on his social media platform statements about the judge not making comments about the daughter, but he also made comments about the judge who oversaw the civil fraud case.

It's a bizarre thing for a news organization to be doing, to not only keep information, but to be doing it on behalf of one party, not doing it in a bipartisan way. Stormy Daniels will obviously be an important witness to set the predicate for the hush money payments, and then, of course, Michael Cohen, because he is at the heart of this. So, I think those will be important witnesses, but I think you're going to hear a lot about the documents and how they corroborate all of those witnesses in the substance of what they put forth. And, obviously, those witnesses will be subject to enormous cross- examination, particularly Michael Cohen.",

This is one where the judge, I think, is going to be looking at the rule of law to see how other people were treated, other people with a similar criminal background.I think this is an area where Donald Trump's pretrial behavior is going to be relevant. If you have someone who's contrite, if you have someone who shares that he's respectful of the rule of law, that this was an aberration, that is something that the court can take into account. But if you think that the defendant actually is running basically as an outlaw and is basically thumbing his nose at the judicial process and it shows no sign of remorse and essentially is a recidivist, those are factors that a judge can consider. And I am sure that a judge like Judge Merchan, if there were to be a conviction, is going to factor all of that in. But it's just way too soon to say whether it would actually constitute jail time. The one thing I would add, Wolf, is I think the fact that the former president has Secret Service protection is not going to be something that prevents him from doing jail time, that that's something that can be worked out. It is a factor, but it is not something that is preclusive, I think, for any judge considering whether to send Donald Trump to jail if there is a conviction.",

Ebrahim Raisi, the president, said that the attack will not go unanswered and Ali Khamenei, the so-called supreme leader of Iran, said that Israel will regret this attack.Now how does Iran plan to respond is very much open to question. Until now, they have worked through there affiliated militias in Lebanon, we have Hezbollah in Iraq, Syria, the Houthis in Yemen have either targeted Israel or have targeted U.S. forces, as we saw, for instance in late January when Iraqi militias struck an American base in Jordan, killing three U.S. service personnel. Now, since then, those militias have actually stopped those attacks apparently under orders from the Iranians to avoid an escalation. But now it may be the case that in the aftermath of this attack that killed a senior IRGC commander, that the Iranians might tell their proxies in the region to increase pressure on Israel, on the United States, or perhaps given the gravity of this strike on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Iranians will target Israel directly, something they haven't done until now. That very much will raise the possibility of a major escalation, possibly even a regional war. It's widely understood that the Iranians, the Americans, and perhaps even the Israelis don't want that to happen. But it appears that all sides are really pushing the envelope. The Israelis, for instance, are striking deeper and deeper within Lebanon on the early hours of Friday morning. There was a strike on his Syrian military position outside of Aleppo, in northern Syria, widely believed that the Israelis were behind that. That left at least 40 military personnel of dead there, among them, his bullfighter. So certainly the temperature is rising. The question is, is it going to boil over into a full blown regional war, Wolf?",
