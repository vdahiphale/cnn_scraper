We have seen a lot of people with passions very high in terms of what they want to see here. We had the students who have been at the encampment say that they are doing everything they can to get transparency from the university in terms of where their money is invested and divestments. Now we did see today a lot of people who came in support of Jewish students who say that they feel harassed, that they feel unsafe here on campus. And it's when these two sides collide that you start seeing more of the confrontations and you start seeing the shouting back and forth. And a lot of the pushing. So the sides are trying to stay separate. But again, there are many people who try to get the other side to react. And we've seen it on both sides of these protests.

And so this was one of the topics of conversation that the two engaged in, and according to the readout, it says, quote, \"The leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position.\" That is a position that National Security Council John Kirby -- National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby offered some insight in earlier today.

It comes amid these ongoing hostage talks, which have been a monthslong process. But we saw some developments this week with the president joining 17 leaders from other countries calling on Hamas to release the hostages. It was a rare joint statement.

You've got the storm stretching up to Omaha where they're still recovering from Friday's storms and then the line of storms stretches south. This is where we have that new tornado watch. It's in Eastern Texas. It's just outside of Austin, San Antonio and Houston, kind of in that area right between.Right now it does not include the city centers, but we are looking at storms, just really blowing up. We've got multiple tornado warnings in effect right now where we've got some storms that are spinning. The atmosphere in this area is refueling, it's recharging, and it is allowing these storms to blow up once again. So here's the risk for today. It stretches from De Moines down to Houston. You see that orange bulls' eye, that's that level three out of five enhanced risk. That's where we could find the threat for a couple of more tornadoes. The tennis ball-sized hail and 70-mile-per- hour winds, just incredible, plus the heavy rain. You saw some of those pictures of cars and undated in Oklahoma. Flash flooding continues to be a threat in that same area. So storms blow up as we go through the day today. They could organize into a line that would bring you that damaging wind threat and it continues to push east as we go into Monday. This coming after an incredibly active 48 hours, nearly 120, tornado reports, a lot of damage to go through to figure out how many tornadoes and what the damage looks like and how strong the tornadoes are. Like I said, there's that risk for today. A lot of the same areas under the gun, just a little bit farther to the east. And when you look at all the warnings that were issued in the last 48 hours, it is remarkable. In Omaha that weather service office issued 42 warnings on Friday. That is the most that they have ever issued in a single day. Yesterday, Norman, Oklahoma, did the same thing, 59 warnings. That was the most that they had ever issued for their office as well. And we've heard so much, especially from the people in Omaha how it's really saved countless lives. So if you see those warnings today where you're at in eastern Texas, or really anywhere, just take them seriously because we have seen it this weekend at (INAUDIBLE).",
