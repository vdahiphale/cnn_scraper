You are not going to get one inch of grace when it comes to that. You're going to have to own all of what you did in 2022. You're going to have to own all of those nominations.

And you're talking about the women -- the suburban women -- the Independents -- that when it all comes down to it, that Trump is going to need or Biden is going to need to win these key states when it comes to a general election. I was struck by how -- I'm always like -- you know, you're always reticent to say this one issue is what's going to do it. It's just -- it's so powerful. In that case, in that state, it made a giant difference -- more than even I, on the ground, was anticipating. What I am interested to see -- and I've been talking to people out on the campaign trail and I was just in Iowa, too. They're still bringing it up -- people -- voters. Now listen, I was talking to Republican primary voters. Those are a little bit different. But when I was just talking to people out and about in Iowa and in some of these other states that I've been traveling to, they bring up reproductive rights. They bring up Roe v. Wade. And what it is -- what I keep hearing is it's the precedent that they're upset about. That it was set and now it's not -- that it was undone. And that that's -- it's been taken away. So, look, Democrats are betting big that it's going to have the exact same effect that we've seen in state after state -- in Kansas, in Ohio.

I think staying away from trying to be a heavy hand or play into Donald Trump's hand where he is going to try to say that it's the administration that's making all of this hay in all these court cases. So I think it's smart for her to stay away. And look, to your point, you either think Donald Trump is a threat to democracy or you don't. I mean, we're three years into this process and so I don't think that either one of these races are going to be totally defined by that. Donald Trump is going to have his base. Joe Biden is going to have his base. And quickly, as soon as these primaries get over, we're going to start focusing back on the suburbs again. These are the issues that are going to start resonating, and that's who is going to elect the next president. I'm one of those hardcore conservatives that just believes that the suburbs -- Donald Trump's lost the suburbs forever every time he lies. Every time he throws all this -- you know, just fodder and red meat, and lies, I just think the suburbs are away. And going back to the abortion issue, I do think this is a tough spot for Republicans, all right? I do think it's a tough issue for us and we do have to be more cohesive and more -- work together on messaging. But the realities are it's a state-by-state issue. And in Georgia, Brian Kemp -- you know, Stacey Abrams made a big point about Donald -- or Brian Kemp couldn't win because of the heartbeat law that we passed. But he stayed away from trying to use that as a -- as a galvanizing force and we didn't talk about trying to do away with exceptions. And we talked about foster care.
