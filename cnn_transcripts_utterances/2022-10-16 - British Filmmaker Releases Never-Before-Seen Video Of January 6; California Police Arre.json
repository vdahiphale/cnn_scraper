The first being the many, many tips from this community and all the help they received from just everyday citizens. And the second thing, old-fashioned police work. They say once they got all of these tips, they were able to zero in on one possible suspect and they began to watch him, to monitor everything that he was doing: Where he lived, where he was going, trying to see if there were any patterns, and indeed they found those patterns. They say he was out either early in the morning or late at night, going to dark places, to parks. He would drive around stop, look, and then continue driving. And so this is exactly what they say he was doing on Saturday at around two in the morning when police officers were following him. The Chief of Police saying he was on a mission to kill. These are the words that were used by the Chief. He said, \"He was out hunting.\" So instead of all of this, they decided to arrest him and now, they're of course thanking the community and the public for all of their help.

Four were Hispanic men, according to authorities ranging from ages 21 to 54 years old. One was a 35-year-old White man and a 46-year-old Black woman who was the lone survivor. She told police that her attacker fired multiple shots without eversaying a word, which is obviously deeply disturbing. If you are profiling this case, what does all of that tell you? O'TOOLE: So it would tell me a variety of things. It would tell me number one, that these were victims of opportunity. These were not people that were likely known to this offender. He chose pick people who were on their own, it was late at night, and these people were vulnerable. So those were the criteria that he was using. And then secondly, what's really hard to understand is that the motivation for these crimes is simply not logical. It is -- the motivation can include such things as the thrill and excitement of hunting another human being. It can be the sense of being very omnipotent, because you're able to take somebody's life. So, those are the motivations that are tied to this case. So, those two things together would tell me that we're looking for someone in their background, they have traits of psychopathy, which is a personality disorder, it's not a mental illness. Oftentimes, the public thinks when they see a crime that is this heinous, they default to this person has to be mentally ill and that's not the case at all.

So, the firearm evidence is going to be very important, but they will be looking for things that, for example, in his phone, they'll be looking at any camera footage, they'll be looking for -- if he has a storage area where there may be some other evidence there.
