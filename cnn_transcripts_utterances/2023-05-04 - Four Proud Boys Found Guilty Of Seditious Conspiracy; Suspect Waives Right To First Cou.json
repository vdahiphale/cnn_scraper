There are -- I've seen 10 counts also and other charges that have been -- that have -- that have been brought against some or all of these men that I want to -- if you can just kind of run through what that -- what the -- what they mean. But also, as you've been following this so long and so closely, what this day means for the Justice Department?EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, I'll start there. I mean, for the Justice Department, obviously, they -- these are major, major wins of getting convictions of at least four of these men. Again, the jury is still going to be deliberating on Dominic Pezzola, especially on those two major counts. Count one and two, which is the seditious conspiracy count, which is count one. And the second one conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, which is count two. There was no verdict on Pezzola -- on Dominic Pezzola. And, you know, we can maybe -- you know again, we'll get to learn more maybe in the coming days and weeks as to what may have been effective for the defense there. You know, Pezzola, obviously, as Katelyn just described, is the one seen who's breaking that Senate window. It paved the way for a lot of the crowd to go in there. It -- frankly, it coincided with the evacuation of Mike Pence. Again, what prosecutors say was the key moment for impeding this proceeding, which is a key part of the transition of power. According to the jury, at least, they seem to not be able to reach a verdict on that. On the rest of the counts, they found all five men guilty on a number of other -- of the other counts, including one of the other counts of obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to prevent an officer from discharging his duties. Again, that's another charge at all -- five of them have been found guilty on obstruction of law enforcement and disorder, aiding and abetting. Again, five guilty verdicts here. There's a couple of counts, which is having to do with the destruction of government property. Again, Dominic Pezzola, it's obvious from the video that the jury found that compelling. There's a couple of counts where they seem to not be able to reach a verdict at all on any of them. And so, those are the ones -- one of them is assaulting resisting, and impeding certain officers. Those are the counts that now the jury will go back and do some more deliberations. Perhaps, they can go over some of the testimony that they received. Pezzola testified in court himself. And he said that he was not in control of his own actions. And, of course, as Sara has pointed out, that you know, some of these -- some of these defense attorneys blamed all of this on Donald Trump and said that these men necessary -- essentially were foot soldiers, and were being directed to carry out these actions by the former president, guys.",

And now, they had been convicted -- some, on one of the highest charges, a very rare chart, you can imagine seditious conspiracy.JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, let's break that down. When the president of the United States on live national television sends a message to your group by name in response to a question, my message to the Proud Boys is, you know, stand back and stand by. Standby for what? That would be taken by the Proud Boys as an incredible piece of validation. The president is naming us. We are working for him. Interestingly, it was part of the defense they used in court. We were -- we believe we were working for the country, not against the country, same defense that failed the Oath Keepers in their trial on the same charges. But you know, if you peel back the layers, it's interesting. You know Enrique Tarrio, who is a convicted criminal on December 12, went to visit the White House, the Trump White House, and was immediately flagged by the Secret Service. This individual has a criminal record. He's the leader of the Proud Boys. Interesting on a week when a mayor from New Jersey couldn't get in because he was on a watch list. And that went to the Deputy Chief of Staff Tony Ornato, a former secret service agent himself.",

Police say he killed one person and injured four others, then evaded police for nearly eight hours before he was caught. It started about 12About 10 miles north of the city around 12:30 p.m., the suspect was spotted at the battery that is near where the Atlanta Braves play. And then after that, there was a long manhunt and he was spotted again this time by an undercover police officer at a condo complex. Police say he was finally arrested at about 7:45 p.m. last night. CNN's Nick Valencia is in Atlanta. So, he waived his right to a first court appearance, Nick. What now? NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): That's right, John. We were expecting to see Deion Patterson appear in court to -- for his first court appearance but just late last hour, he waived that right so he's no longer expected to appear. He is charged those still with four counts of aggravated assault, as well as one count of murder. With the dicey -- deceased being identified as Amy St. Pierre. St. Pierre was a friend to so many here in town in the city of Atlanta, a dedicated public health professional, served -- you know, was the -- with a connection to Emory University. She was employed by the CDC. And a personal connection to our family. She was close friends with some of my wife's best friends. And I spoke to some of those friends earlier this morning and they are heartbroken. Grieving her loss this morning saying that she was just a mother that look forward to raising her small children. She'd like taking them to the trampoline park. She was energetic, magnetic, and easy smile. Just a great laugh. And this morning all of those who knew her are grieving her loss. There are still those in the hospital. We're waiting to get an update on their conditions. Three of them, last we checked, were in critical condition. One of them in stable condition. This investigation is still ongoing as well. We're told that the mother is cooperating with authorities as is the Coast Guard. Patterson was a member of the Coast Guard between 2018 and January 2023 when he was discharged from active service. And that's when yesterday he went for a medical evaluation at the Midtown location of Northside Hospital and it was sometime during that medical evaluation that he was denied access to the anti-anxiety medication, Ativan. And it was after that, according to his mom, who told WSB, he grew agitated and opened fire. Police had still not released a motive but the mother released a statement to our affiliate WANF in which he seemed to point towards mental health as a cause here in what happened yesterday, John.",

That was when we saw migrants, primarily Haitians, under a bridge in Del Rio because they just couldn't process them fast enough. So, that's the scene they're trying to avoid.And what does that mean? That means that they have to focus on what they call decompression, which is making sure that they're able to process the migrants who are crossing. And then if they are deemed to not have, for example, an asylum claim, remove them quickly. So, for example, increasing removal flights to their origin countries or what they're going to do after striking an agreement with Mexico, returning some non-Mexican nationals back to Mexico. So, really, the focus here is to process migrants and do that quickly, Kate.",

Now, among the things they've seen on this footage, for example, is a young Trump aide Walt Nauta, and another employee moving boxes that contain documents out of a storage closet.Now, we know, we've previously reported that Walt has been asked about what exactly was going on there. Remember, they're not just investigating the possible mishandling of classified documents. They're also looking at whether anyone has tried to obstruct this investigation. That's why this is significant that now they're asking what exactly happened after they sent a subpoena asking for this footage. We know that this interest has spurred a new round of subpoenas, particularly to lower-level Trump Organization employees who have gone in. And they've been asked about what exactly transpired within the Trump Organization after that subpoena was received. Did anyone potentially try to tamper with that footage? Now, we expect several new witnesses to go before the grand jury today.",

But in our reporting our colleague, Katelyn Polantz, and I, we learned that what sparked their interest in Matthew Calamari Sr. is a text message that he received from Walt Nauta asking him to talk. And so, they want to ask him about that text message, any subsequent conversations about the surveillance footage that happened thereafter.But as you noted, these are two top security officials at the Trump Organization. And, Sara, it's really just striking to me as a special counsel Jack Smith is going this far in to Trump's inner circle, but it's clear also from this new reporting that this investigation into what happened with the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago is far from over.",
