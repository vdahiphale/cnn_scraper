Hopefully not all of them in New Jersey, where I'm going to be. Some context around that 37 million figure, that is up by 6 percent from a year ago. But I am here with some good news. And that is despite the rising number of people on the roads, the cost of road trips is actually going down. Drivers across the country are being greeted by cheaper gas pricesthan the last Memorial Day weekend, a lot cheaper. On average, a gallon of regular gasoline sells for about $1 less than a year ago, according to the AAA, and the national average is miles away from that record high of 502 a gallon set last June. And GasBuddy says that prices are down in all 50 states like California, Alaska, New York, New Jersey, and Florida are among the states and during the biggest price drops. All of this is yet more evidence of cooling inflation, the cost-of- living crisis. You know, it isn't over, but it is getting better. There's two important points here. Gas prices, they were lower in 2021 and of course in 2020, when COVID shut the economy down and people weren't really driving. Also, the reasons for the gas price drop, they're not all positive. And some of it is better supply, also better than feared supply out of Russia. But it's also these lingering recession fears that have kept the lid on oil prices and also kept down the price of gasoline. Still, GasBuddy estimates that drivers will spend $1.6 billion less on gasoline compared with last Memorial Day weekend. And that is undeniably good news. Victor and Amara.",

So steady, heavy to moderate rain really from the Georgia coastline right up into the Carolinas and starting to push it inland toward Columbia and Charlotte. We'll be dealing with this all weekend long as the stubborn low sits right here.And not only the rain causing the potential for flooding but coastal flooding where that water gets pushed up onto the shorelines on top of that high surf. We have high surf advisories highlighted in pink from the Carolinas back down into the space coast of Florida, where we can have surf up to 48 feet. And we have high rip current risk suit too. So if you can stay on the water, that's ideal. I mean, it's gloomy anyway. You don't even want to be out there. Rainfall totals through Monday through the entire holiday weekend. Some of these areas highlighted in a lighter orange. That's four inches of rain, isolated higher amounts are a possibility. So yes, flooding is a definite for some of us, especially along the coastlines where you see that moderate risk for Saturday or were highlighted in red. Wilmington, do not drive through flooded roadways, folks. Turn around and find a different route. That's the best bet. Sunday, unfortunately, that flood risk pushes inland over towards Roanoke, and it continues on into your Monday too. Now that's not the only part of the U.S. that's dealing with weather.

At the same time, the Democratic gain here is that the next debt ceiling fight would be after the Presidential election. You can see the incentives for the Biden Administration and Democrats in general and having that because Republicans would want to use that as a negotiating tool and really a hostage-taking situation while on the campaign trail.Look, honestly, I am a little surprised with what we're seeing right now. This is a deal that's shaping up where neither of the base sides of the Republican or Democratic parties are -- are ecstatic.

Doing it instead of on TV where he could reach millions of voters. And also doing it in a way that does not allow his campaign to collect signatures, to collect email addresses, to collect small-dollar donations. That's the real incentive of doing something like this. And frankly, like for those that were directed, or were able to get on and then go to the DeSantis campaign page, there wasn't much there.

He got 18 years for his sentence. His deputy Kelly Meggs, Meggs' was much different. Meggs was much more apologetic and much more emotional at his sentencing. Judge Amit Mehta gave him 12 years in prison and then two others who were sentenced on Friday by the same Judge, Jessica Watkins, receiving eight and a half years in prison, Kenneth Harrelson from Florida receiving four years. And each of these people was very different. Some saying that they were coming to the Capitol because they felt called to provide security, that they wanted to help Rhodes, that they were in touch with Rhodes and assisting there. Jessica Watkins, she was much more enthusiastic, including after January 6. But even in Court, she was one of the people who had been in the stack on January 6 and was celebrating. But on -- in Court on Friday, Victor and Amara, she essentially said that she regretted what she did, and that she realized that her presence inspired others that day. She had been an idiot who should be held responsible by the Judge. She asked the judge to do that. And so, that was a very emotional hearing, both for all of these people being sentenced, but also for the prosecutors of the Justice Department who brought this monumental, unprecedented, seditious conspiracy case against members of the Oath Keepers. And they are now seeing the sentencing, the closing the book of that case that will set the tone for the justice that is determined to -- should be dealt to people who commit serious crimes like these against the United States and what the Judge says were the type of crimes that were so serious that they shook American democracy.

I mean, that's -- that's cartoonish. Somebody who takes a cake with a shiv to a prison or anything. It could be interpreted as a mother promising undying love and loyalty. She also says nothing will come between us. How do you read this letter? Of course, the context of the death is or deaths, that's important, but what do you see here in this in these words?",

It still is an explanation of a mother saying, and I'm paraphrasing here, I will do anything for you. Here are some examples that are extreme, but I will do anything for you. I will protect you, that could also play into the Petitos' narrative as, see, this may not say that she knew specifically about our daughter, but that she would do anything for her son, including potentially lie to us about their knowledge of her whereabouts.",

      "sentences": "Correct, that is absolutely right, and that's the way that it will be interpreted. The Petito family is saying that, listen, just notwithstanding the fact that the letter is undated, and you are giving an indication, mom, of Brian, that you wrote it prior to the trip, that's nonsense. You wrote it knowing what your son did, knowing that he killed our daughter, having knowledge and understanding of that and would assist him in any way possible with respect to either not being captured or in the event that he was doing everything you could to support, defend and protect him.And so, that's very important as it comes to the case. And what's the last thing, important, is it says \"burn after reading\". If this simply was a letter that you were putting out there, about your undying affinities for your son, why would he have to burn it as supposed to paste it on his wall, so he could remember it and he could know for all time how much you love him. So the \"burn after reading\", although, it's not -- the text of the letter itself, is also significant with respect to the mother's knowledge about what the son could have done, and I think it could potentially play in big as it relates to the lawsuit for intentional infliction of emotional distress.",

Let's turn now to the Kohberger case, this is the man who was charged with the four murders of the college students in Idaho, but now, Monroe County, Pennsylvania grand jury, they are being brought in to testify before the grand jury. Now, let's remember that the murders happened in Idaho.A Monroe County, Pennsylvania grand jury can only investigate potential crimes that happened within that county, in that jurisdiction. Just -- what do you see as the potential universe of crimes that could have happened there in Pennsylvania, and are the parents in any legal trouble or jeopardy here?",

In terms of the context of this, remember that the grand jury in Pennsylvania, that grand jury as you noted, right, investigates crimes that may have occurred in that particular jurisdiction. So there could be a school of thought that there is no connection whatsoever, no nexus between the Idaho murders at all, and what that grand jury was doing.It could be that, that grand jury and reports are when investigating a cold case as it relates to a woman of three who died. Now, police have said that they haven't gotten a connection or nexus between anything that Kohberger did, the murder suspect in Idaho in that particular case. [06:40:00] But let's remember, Victor, that that's what grand juries do. An investigative grand jury is making an assessment as to what if any involvement he may have had. And so, I think that grand jury by calling the parents could be focusing in on an alibi to determine where their son was, was he in school? Is there a connection? Was he home for any reason or at any time to see if there's any nexus or connection between that missing cold case and of course, Kohberger, who we know has been indicted this week in connection with Idaho.",

SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENTthe Irish Republican Army, the IRA was in a midst of a three-decades- long terror campaign to try to get Northern Ireland reunited with the Republic of Ireland. And in the United States, newly-released documents show that the FBI was on high alert for anyone who may have been sympathetic to that cause, especially around royal visits to the U.S. One memo in particular describes a caller who said that a patron at a well-known Irish Republican bar in San Francisco, who said that his daughter had been killed by a rubber bullet in Northern Ireland, quote, \"claimed that he was going to attempt to harm Queen Elizabeth, and will do this either by dropping some object off the Golden Gate bridge onto the Royal Yacht Britannia when it sails underneath or would attempt to kill Queen Elizabeth when she visited Yosemite National Park.\" Now, the memo doesn't give more detail than that. And it's not clear what kind of follow-up there was. It's also important to keep in mind that this memo was marked priority rather than immediate, which would have been taken much more seriously. Also, by the time it actually gets to the FBI, this is now fifth-hand information. But the bureau was not wrong to be concerned especially considering in 1979, Louis Mountbatten was killed when a bomb planted on his fishing boat exploded, and of course, the IRA was keen to target anything associated with the British state. These documents also show that even more benign protests were followed closely by the FBI which had informants inside some of the local protest group. So one memo describes an Irish Diaspora group which was planning to distribute free beer at a protest of the state dinner, something they say could have added a dangerous dimension to the events planned. That memo also makes clear that the FBI wasn't just concerned about safety, it was also concerned about incidents that may have been embarrassing to either Queen Elizabeth or to then President, Ronald Reagan.
