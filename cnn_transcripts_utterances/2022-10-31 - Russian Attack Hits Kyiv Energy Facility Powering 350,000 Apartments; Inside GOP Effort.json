People have been laying flowers and lighting candles, handwritten notes to some of the 154 mostly very young victims of this terrible catastrophe. I've spoken with a number of the survivors, people who came out Saturday night. They heard that this neighborhood, Itaewon, just down the road from an old U.S. military base, threw a good party on the weekend of Halloween and were initially laughing at the just massive numbers of people in the nearby alleyways near where I'm standing. And then those jokes about, hey, I'm not going to be able to breathe here, started getting very dark as the reality started setting in.

Now, one email even lays out concerns that lawyers had about submitting a declaration that was signed by Trump personally affirming the election fraud allegations it presented to the court were true, even after the former president had been made aware that some of those allegations were, in fact, false. The judge in this case has suggested that these emails could be evidence of a conspiracy to defraud the United States, which is why they're being released.
