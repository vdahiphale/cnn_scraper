We can go down the long list of Trump policies that they walked away from. Yet, on this one, we want to believe that their hands were tied. I don't buy it for a second.And I've got to tell you, you're going to hear today from these veterans who were so morally injured to hear their commander in chief rather than say we could have done this better -- we could have done better in this withdrawal that this was just an outstanding success. It's politics and spin at its worst when so many people are dead.

Tools that can begin going after their money. Disrupting their logistics. Targeting their leadership. Intelligence space and other types of packets that -- assets that law enforcement doesn't have access to. And we want to provide that authority. We've got -- we have to start thinking about these cartels more like ISIS rather than the mafia. And if ISIS and al Qaeda, through chemical warfare, killed 70,000 to 80,000 Americans we would begin thinking about this and attacking it far differently. So that's what we're looking to -- that's what we're looking to do. We want to give those authorities to the president if only he would take more meaningful action to go after these cartels that are behind the human trafficking, the fentanyl, and right now effectively control our border and 30 to 40 percent of Mexico by some estimates. We cannot have an ungoverned narco-terrorist state right there on our border and do nothing. And from the Mexican government's standpoint -- we did this with the Colombians as well. We sent a message we're going to do this with or without you. Eventually, the Colombian government got on board in the '90s and I believe the Mexican government will too.",
