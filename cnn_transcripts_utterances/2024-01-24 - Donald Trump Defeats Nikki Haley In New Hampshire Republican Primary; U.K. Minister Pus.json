A demographic tailor made for his last standing opponent, Nikki Haley.But within an hour of polls closing, the results were in and the twice impeached, four times indicted one term president defeated Haley by more than 10 points. A win which only tightens his grip on the Republican Party and moves him one step closer to a rematch with President Joe Biden in November. After winning Iowa last week, Trump is now the first non-incumbent Republican candidate to win the first two state primary contests. Despite that historic milestone, Trump's victory speech at times was rambling and mean spirited. He seems especially annoyed by Haley's decision to stay in the race. When Nikki Haley sharpened her attacks on Trump, suggesting he's too old to be president and he's also a big loser. Haley plans to continue campaigning until South Carolina, her home state which holds its primary in one month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now, you've all heard the chatter among the political class. They're falling all over themselves saying this race is over. Well, I have news for all of them, New Hampshire is first in the nation, it is not the last. This race is far from over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The speech sounded almost nothing like what we heard in Iowa when he called for uniting the Republican Party, uniting the country. Instead, focused almost solely on Nikki Haley staying in the race. I was told by an advisor that he was watching at least part of her speech backstage, speech in which she sounded defiant. Listen to some of what Trump had to say. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I can go up and I can say to everybody, oh, thank you for the victory. It's wonderful. It's what -- or I can go up and say, who the hell was the imposter that went up on the stage before and like claimed a victory? She did very poorly, actually. She had to win. The governor said, she's going to win, she's going to win. She's going to win. Then she failed badly. And just a little note to Nikki, she's not going to win. But if she did, she would be under investigation by those people in 15 minutes. And I could tell you five reasons why already. Not big reasons. A little stuff that she doesn't want to talk about. But she will be under investigation within minutes. And so would Ron have been but he decided to get out.

So, that is the prime minister's perspective. And indeed, there's been a lot of talk over the last few days, of course, about, you know, getting some kind of pause, some kind of truce, perhaps leading to the ultimate end of this war. We're also hearing more about the incident yesterday in which 21 IDF soldiers, all of them reservists, so all of them doing other things in their daily lives who were called up as a result of this war, killed in this incident yesterday. Now, we've got a couple more details. There were in fact two rocket propelled grenades fired by presumably Hamas fighters, one hit a tank in which two IDF soldiers were killed. The other hit these buildings in which the troops had been laying mines with a view to destroying them as part of their aims to create some kind of buffer zone because where they were in central Gaza, it's only about 600 meters away from the border. And they want to enable communities to return to their homes, the other side of the border fence. So, when that second RPG hit that building, it's set off, it detonated it seems, those mines inside the building, killing those 19 more soldiers. And of course, in another incident, there were three more IDF soldiers killed, and many of those have now had their funerals. So, Israel are very much in mourning as a result of that. And I think the general view is that the war should continue until it has met its objectives. But of course, there is, as you say, growing pressure on Netanyahu to do some kind of deal that at the very least, would see the more than 100 hostages still being held in Gaza back in Israel, John.",

This is something that worries not just Israel, specifically in the terrorism of what it did, it does absolutely impact the rest of the world.I am talking about a long time. I am absolutely talking about 2024, or not doing a high intensity attack over all of the Gaza Strip. What Israel has tried to do systematically, it's never easy, enormous casualties, is to tell people to go to safer places, the civilians are always the ones that suffer within a war, telling them to go to safer places so that we can systematically dismantle that underground subterranean arena. I'm talking about a very long time, I completely understand the challenge, both inside Israel and worldwide in supporting this. And I've asked again in that sense, what is the alternative? If Hamas stays in power, if Hamas keeps the hostages, if Hamas keeps their military capabilities, that's not a loss for Israel. That is a threat, not just to the existence of Israel, but to what terror organizations worldwide will see.

Definitely Israel needs the hostages back, all of us do.Nobody in the world wants to have a situation that you can do on assault, take 250 people, from babies to elderly people, hold them hostages and win. That's not good news for anybody. That is a plan for the next terror organization to do it. And when it's against Israel, for some reason, it becomes different. It's not different. We need the hostages back and all of us need to destroy Hamas capabilities so that they can't use the terror capabilities to be able to do what they did, and have said that they would do again. So, this isn't contradictory, it's about doing both. Does it make it happy and nice? This is a horrible war that Hamas started on October 7th. And in this sense, as we go forward, I say as an Israeli, it's not about the casualties because our hearts go out to them all of the time. It's about there not being an example in the world of 2024 of a terror genocidal organization doing the attacks, taking the hostages, getting the benefits and showing here's the plan of what you could do worldwide.

There were several people who were wounded in those attacks. And then there was the area around Pavlohrad, where one person was killed according to the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians are saying by and large, the air defense systems that they have worked very well, they were able to shoot down about half of the missiles that were fired towards Ukrainian territory. But of course, one of the things that the Ukrainians have been saying is that they need a continued supply of missiles for those air defense systems to be able to keep that protection alive here for this country. This of course, all comes as the Russians continue to push offensives, especially in the East and the southeast of the country. The area around Bakhmut is one of those focal points and the Ukrainians are saying they're trying to hold back those Russian forces, but because they have a limited supply of ammunition that is proving very difficult.

And you know, I'm not sure if there is a good argument for her staying, and Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee. Nikki Haley (inaudible) she's going to stay in the race and she's doing that on the chance that Trump's legal challenges eventually catch up to him. That's not unreasonable. But, it really is the case that if Haley couldn't win New Hampshire, she can't win anywhere. She had a huge advantage with independent voters supporting her. She had invested almost all of her time in that state. She had virtually unlimited cash from anti-Trump Super PACs. New Hampshire has an independent streak. Those variables aren't going to align in future Republican primary states. Donald Trump is right about that. What we do know is that to win a Republican primary, you have to win over the right wing. The right wing supports Trump. It's coalescing behind him and there's seemingly nothing Haley can do to blunt that momentum. And by the way, nowhere is that more true than in South Carolina, Haley's home state, which is upcoming. So this is the coronation, the Trump predicted, and the MAGA Movement led by an election denier is really the one and only dominant force in the GOP.

We know that 70 percent of weapons that cause violence here in Mexico and in the U.S., that 70 percent come from the United States. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It says, \"Not long ago, a public trial was held, then giving the teens' names and saying that they were accused of watching and distributing puppet regime's recordings.\" That's what North Korea calls South Korea, the puppet regime, a puppet of the United States they claim. The video goes on to say they were only 16 years old, just at the beginning of their lives. However, they were seduced by foreign culture, ultimately ruining their future paths. And this video also named their homeroom teachers, essentially shaming them, destroying the reputation, perhaps destroying their careers, their lives, maybe the lives of their family members. Now, South Korea's National Intelligence Service tells CNN that it cannot verify if this video is authentic. Of course, CNN also cannot independently verify the video. It was released by these Seoul-based South and North Development Institute. This is a group that consists of North Korean defectors. So, we know they do have contacts inside the country. They can leak this sort of material out to them. We also know that back in 2020, North Korea adopted what they call the Anti-Reactionary Ideology and Culture Act.

Greta Gerwig is the first woman to make over $1 billion with a single film and so -- as a solo director.It's an enormous achievement and it raises the question of, like, well, who is then responsible for Barbie's success, if not her at the helm. I think that I personally believe that people again, underestimate the degree of difficulty it takes to pull off such a crowd-pleasing comedy that still managed to have a message and was based on a toy that inherently had no narrative. But, you know, people are drawn towards -- voters are drawn towards the dark, the serious, the things that feel very weighty. And so, I think she is often underestimated as a result. I should point out, Greta Gerwig has directed three films.
