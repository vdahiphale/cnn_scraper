      "sentences": "Oh, well, look, this is actually very interesting, Jim, because remember, a couple of weeks ago, Donald Trump and Musk had a conversation on X, formerly known as Twitter. And during that conversation, it was Elon Musk who said, you know, I think you should create some sort of government efficiency commission and said, I would like to lead it to which Trump responded, I love that idea.Well, yesterday at the New York Economic Club during that speech, Donald Trump said that he was going to create this commission and that Elon Musk had agreed to it. Now, there's a couple things here that I want to point out, because given Elon Musk's position, both as the CEO of SpaceX, but also of Tesla, there are some potential conflicts of interest. Now, when you look at SpaceX, he has contracts from the federal government, a potential conflict of interest there. As for his car company, Tesla, that has benefited from tax credits and different government incentives. So, again, there could be some conflicts of interest. But essentially, when we talk to the Trump campaign, when I talk to his advisers, they say they're still working out exactly the details of what this commission would be like, how it would be run, how it would be set up. But essentially, as you mentioned, Jim, they say that it would be targeting government waste and trying to drastically reform many of these agencies and look for ways to cut spending. And really, this was part of a much broader speech yesterday, where it was kind of the first time we heard Donald Trump specifically lay out his economic plans in a way that we really haven't heard him do in the past.",

So, after he delivered his remarks he took a couple of questions from members of the Economic Club, one of which asked him, you know, how would you address if elected the rising care of child costs? And Donald Trump kind of gave a jumbled answer. Take a listen to what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Childcare, I want to stay with childcare, but those numbers are small relative to the kind of economic numbers that I'm talking about, including growth, but growth also headed up by what the plan is that I just told you about. We're going to be taking in trillions of dollars. And as much as childcare is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we'll be taking in. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So, Jim, a bit of a confusing answer there. Donald Trump had said that he was committed to addressing the rising childcare costs, but did not offer any specific legislation. I think a lot of people were confused at what exactly he meant with that answer.At one point, he also suggested that perhaps tariffs would could pay for such a thing. And as we know, he does plan to impose sweeping tariffs if elected. But that is something that many economists argue would actually create more inflation. So, I guess let's decide who you want to listen to with that answer. Jim.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. So, Donald Trump entered the courtroom, and this courtroom is fairly narrow and small as it's set up. So, he had to walk right past E. Jean Carol, who was sitting at the front corner of a table. There was a seat across an aisle that could have placed Donald Trump right next to her, just an aisle separating them about three feet. He instead chose to walk to the far end of that table and sit at that seat. So, giving himself some space between her, there appeared to be no eye contact between the two.Trump sitting during this hearing, which lasted less than 30 minutes, just facing forward, watching the arguments there. His lawyers went on for about 10 minutes. Then Carol's lawyers started their arguments here. Now, Trump's lawyers are trying to get a new trial in this case, saying that the trial judge made mistakes, including by allowing the Access Hollywood tape to be played before the jury. On that tape, Trump is caught on that hot mic, saying how he gropes women and grabs them without their permission, then they also said that the testimony of two other women who came forward and said that Trump had assaulted them one in the 1970s on an airplane and another one down at Mar-a- Lago, they were allowed to testify in this case, Trump's lawyer saying that shouldn't have been permitted. Now, as they began to address the judge, his attorney, John Sawyer, started talking about how this was the quintessential he said, she said, saying that there was no DNA evidence, no police report. One of the appellate judges cut him off and said, we're here to talk about challenges to the evidence not about the other arguments that they want to make about the case. So, he tried to ring this lawyer in and get him to focus on the evidentiary arguments that they're making. And the attorney -- excuse me, the judge telling the attorney that, in fact, it's very difficult to overturn a trial judge's decision on evidence ruling. So, really trying to get him to focus in on these arguments. Part of the arguments that Trump's lawyers are making is that in the 1970s, it wasn't a crime to sexually assault someone on an airplane. Well, E. Jean Carroll's lawyer got up, she said it was a crime to assault anybody on an airplane, and so that should stand, that should be evidence that comes in. So, just a lot of back and forth over that evidence, whether these two women should have been allowed to testify. The judges ended the hearing without making any decision. That will come in due course. Often takes weeks or maybe even months. Donald Trump did not answer any questions by reporters as he left the courtroom. He was in there, though, for just under 30 minutes, and his motorcade has already left as he's making his way back to Trump Tower. Jim.",

Kara Scannell outside the courthouse in lower Manhattan, thank you very much.We should note today is the very first day of voting in the 2024 race, as North Carolina is set to mail out early voting ballots. There's just one problem though. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., while he is no longer in the race, Kennedy's name is still on the ballot there and a number of other states. He wants the State of North Carolina to delay its plans until his name can be removed. A judge denied that, but ordered a pause in voting while Kennedy appeals. As of now, the state is still planning on mailing ballots this afternoon. And Robert Brandon joins us now. He is the president and CEO of the Fair Election Center. Robert, good to see you.

And hopefully, the courts will block that kind of an effort and we'll be able to have a regular election.There are other limits in place, of course, that have more to do with restricting some of the absentee ballots, for example, that we were talking about before. Mail ballots in a number of states now require an I. D. ahead of time. The time to request the ballot may have been pushed earlier. So, you have to make your decision about whether you want to use mail earlier. The time that they have to be received maybe pushed earlier or -- so, for example, Ohio used to allow mail -- it was mailed before Election Day, but came in as late as 10 days to be counted, now it's four days.
