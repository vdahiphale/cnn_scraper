He had lobbied Donald Trump intensively around pardoning a group of military members who had engaged in conduct for which they were reprimanded, a really difficult incident.

And they could be relocated. So these are extreme views, actually, a minority view for, you know, if you take the world view of what's happening there.

Seems to align with the political realities on the ground in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, you know, we were talking to Joel Rubin, who was a former State Department official who was on the program yesterday basically saying a two state solution is not part of the conversation in Israel right now.

So it's a very clear focus of intent here. So then you do start questioning what is the long term solution what is Donald Trump's solution to peace in the Middle East, which is something that he's promising to bring in if it's not a two state solution, then is it, you know, allowing Israel to take over that land, relocating Palestinians? There are so many questions that come out of that. So I think, you know this is one ambassador. We know what his views are. We need to hear more clearly about how he intends to push them through but most importantly, whether Trump is going to empower him and whether Trump very much believes in those views, too.",

Still, the gusty northwesterly winds after a cold front passed through overnight and into the late morning hours yesterday very dry air, ongoing drought. I want you to see this relative humidity. This is just a sample of how much moisture is in the atmosphere. See how that shade goes from green to brown kind of evaporating taking out all the available moisture in the atmosphere. This is typical with the passage of a cold front this time of year, but also with the changes of the temperature through the course of the morning to the afternoon. Regardless, still very dry. And the winds again coming from the northwest will be gusty at times 20 to 30 miles per hour. You layer that on top of the ongoing drought, so that means we still have the potential for some ignition. That's why the National Weather Service has maintained this red flag warning across parts of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and even into Long Island. So the fire risk there clear over the western parts of the U.S. But I want to point your attention to what's happening in the southwestern Caribbean.
