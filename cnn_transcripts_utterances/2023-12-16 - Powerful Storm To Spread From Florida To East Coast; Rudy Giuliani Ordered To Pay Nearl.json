Right now most of the rain is really offshore. We're just starting to see some of those light rain bands begin to push in across Florida. By this afternoon that changes entirely. Here you'll see that system be finally becomes onshore. It does have the potential also to bring some severe thunderstorms with it as well. By Sunday, we're looking at the main concern to be over the Carolinas then by Sunday night really more over the Delmarva region. And then by early Monday morning, if you've got to try to get a head start maybe on some of those travel plans or you still have to work next week, you are likely going to be dealing with a very soggy commute first thing Monday morning across the Northeast. So here's a look at the breakdown. Again, by the time we get to the afternoon. A lot of those really heavy bands really begin to set up shape. You're looking at, on and on throughout most of the day today and even through the evening hours tonight. By Sunday morning, again, mainly focused here across Georgia and the Carolinas. Then once we get into Sunday afternoon in the evening, now you're really focusing across the Mid Atlantic for the bulk of that really heavy rain, then it's going to continue to slide up into the Northeast. One of the other concerns in addition to rainfall is the potential for flooding because of how much is expected to come down. You're talking widespread two to four inches, not just along Florida, but pretty much up and down the East Coast and winds guys also could be bringing down some trees and power lines in the next few days.",

And he has no other money to be paying lawyers or do other things. So there is still a question of exactly how much money these two women will be seeing out of Rudy Giuliani, someone who was quite powerful after the 2020 election and for many years in this country, but they say that it never was about just money alone and what they could be rewarded. It was about sending a message that people with a platform like his should know better and should not do these sorts of things to harass workers of elections and people who would be participating in elections.

Does it is -- it proportional to the egregious tense of the conduct, etcetera, that'll be evaluated.But Notwithstanding that, and even if the award is reduced, I would expect that it would still be significant. So let's say it's reduced to 75 million, let's say it's reduced to 50 million, let's say it's reduced to 80 million. The fact is that it will still be a multimillion dollar verdict, as we look there at the specific numbers for the defamation for the emotional distress caused, and of course for the punitive damages, which are designed to punish. And so at the end of the day, while there may be an appeal, I just don't know that it really reduces it in the figure that even makes it manageable for him.

Is this what happens in the fog of war?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Unfortunately, Amara, it can be. Yes, this is one of those situations where when you are in close quarters, and you're going around corners, and in a very dark area, or even in an area where you're not expecting certain things to happen, this can occur. And you know, I think that in a situation like this, you often have troops who are afraid, because they the most experience that they've had is been with hostile forces. And when something unusual happens, like hostages coming toward you ones that you know, are seeking freedom, then it's sometimes hard just switch your mindset to figure out what these people actually are. So this is definitely something that can happen in the fog of war. It's extremely unfortunate. And that's why special operations forces train very, very hard to try to avoid situations like this.

CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Seven weeks after Matthew Perry was found dead at his Pacific Palisades home, an autopsy report released Friday reveals that the \"Friends\" star died of acute effects of ketamine. According to the Los Angeles medical examiner's office, Perry's blood tested positive for the drug, and says that the actor was reported to be receiving ketamine infusion therapy for depression and anxiety. Perry's last known treatment was a week and a half before his death, but that is beyond the time it would still be in his system, according to the report. His unresponsive body was found by his live-in assistant who, quote, \"jumped into the pool, moved the decedent into a sitting position on the steps and called 9-1-1. Now, the autopsy concluded that drowning was a contributing factor in Perry's death due to the likely of submersion into the pool as he lapsed into unconsciousness. This is an especially tragic ending for the popular actor who was very open about his decades-long struggle with substance abuse. He published a memoir a year ago where he revealed that he attended 6,000 alcoholic anonymous meetings and entered rehab 15 times. Perry also spoke about the loneliness that he endured during his abuse and recovery process and especially his desire to help others going through similar struggles.

      "sentences": "That's true, Amara, and thanks for having me this morning. You know what's interesting to me certainly as a cardiologist looking at this report is that it also states not only drowning, but coronary artery disease was contributing to this.And we know that coronary artery disease especially in older adults is a relative contraindication to this medication. In fact, the American Heart Association lists ketamine along with propofol as compounds that need to be thought of in extreme caution because they can exacerbate any medical conditions, any cardiac conditions that you have. It also should be used in caution, but generally, when it is being used in conjunction with people with mental health disorders, that levels are low enough such that it is not a concern, what we call the subanesthetic levels. [06:35:00] But his autopsy report seemed to show that his levels were in line with general anesthesia, so well above the subanesthetic levels that are recommended for cardiac safety.",

The chief says that he needs technology, infrastructure, and more border patrol agents. In the past few days, we've seen a steady flow of migrants walking along this path. Let me show you how they get into the United States. Smugglers on the Mexican side, they cut the border wall, and on the U.S. side, you see these white markings? These are repairs to the border wall. These pieces of metal are welded on to close the gaps. Take a look at this one, because this is not just a freshly-cut border wall, it was just repaired last week. Now, I don't want to mess with the integrity of the border wall, but if I were to swing this open, this would swing, and that is how migrants are able to slip into the United States.
