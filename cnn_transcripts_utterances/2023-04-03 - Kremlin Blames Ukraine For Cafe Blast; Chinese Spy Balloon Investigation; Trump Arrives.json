We're tracking this with our CNN senior crime and justice correspondent, Shimon Prokupecz and CNN's Kara Scannell, who are both live outside that Manhattan courthouse where Trump will be tomorrow, where we will we will see, does the judge unseal this indictment?

They also asked the judge to broadcast this arena, given the huge public interest, the historical significance, and the momentousness of this occasion. Now, we are also learning, Kaitlan, reporting from you and I and others on our team, that Trump has added a new lawyer to his legal team, Todd Blanche. He's a high-powered criminal defense lawyers lawyer. He was a longtime prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. That was the same office that brought the case against Michael Cohen connected to the hush money payments. Now, he is going to add significant legal weight to this. He's represented some other people in the Trump orbit. He represented Paul Manafort in the state case here. You remember Manafort was prosecuted by Mueller's team. But he also was prosecuted after he was sentenced and convicted and pled out to some of the Mueller charges. Manafort was also charged by the Manhattan DA's office. Now, Blanche represented him in that. He got the charges thrown out under a double jeopardy principle. It's not the same issue at play here, but obviously a big win for one of Trump's allies, certainly something that is appealing (AUDIO GAP). He's also represented others in this orbit. You may remember, in the Ukrainian saga, there was Igor Fruman. He was one of Giuliani's associates. He represented -- Todd Blanche represented Fruman in that case. He pled out and served less than a year in prison. So, Blanche certainly is bringing a different legal strategy here, certainly to beef up the legal team. We understand that the other two attorneys on it, Susan Necheles and Joe Tacopina, are still part of the team, but certainly adding additional firepower here as we're heading into an indictment, and as this case is really going to get under way, as the battle lines will be drawn by the lawyers and the different legal challenges they will take once we get through tomorrow's arraignment -- Kaitlan.",

I should add, one other person who was there with us at the same time was Alvin Bragg, the DA, so they know each other too. So let's keep that in mind. What does this mean for Joe Tacopina. I'm not sure. But, usually, in a case like this, you only want one quarterback at a time in football. And I think the same would go here for criminal defense. So they're both alphas. They're both quarterbacks. So, in my view, it's going to be hard for Tacopina to be the sort of second seater here.",

And then Donald Trump, standing at the defendant's table, the same defendant's table where thousands upon thousands of criminal accused have stood, will enter his first plea, which most assuredly will be not guilty.

It was then able to send that intelligence back to Beijing in real time. CNN national security reporter Natasha Bertrand is following this story. Natasha, what more are you learning? This has been a huge outstanding question. You have got details now.",

The attack killed a prominent military blogger who supported the Ukraine conflict and injured 30 others. The late blogger was leading a discussion at the cafe when the bomb exploded, Russian police arrested anti-war activist Daria Trepova, who they suspect was part of the plot that delivered the bomb to the blogger in a statue. CNN's Matthew Chance is in Moscow. So, Matthew, has Russia released any evidence?",

But they have definitely, for instance, released a video of Daria Trepova, this suspect who is accused of taking the statue to the cafe in St. Petersburg which later exploded, killing that prominent Russian military blogger. They have released a sort of on-air admission by her, saying that she did indeed take that statue. You can see the video there. That's her walking into the cafe carrying a large box. I mean, her defense seems to have been that she didn't know that the statue had a bomb inside it. And it could well be true. But this is to be determined, I suppose, by Russian investigators. What they're saying is that this is terrorism, it was organized by the -- by the Ukrainian security services, alongside -- and this is astonishing -- alongside the anti-corruption campaign of Alexey Navalny, the poisoned, jailed critic of the Kremlin. Of course, both the Ukrainians and the Navalny organization have categorically denied any involvement. Some latest news I can give -- bring to you. The anti-corruption -- sorry -- the anti -- the pro-war blogger who was killed in this attack, Vladlen Tatarsky, he has just been awarded a Medal of Bravery by Vladimir Putin, the Russian president. And the main suspect in this case, Daria Trepova, she's now been moved to Moscow for further questioning from St. Petersburg.",
