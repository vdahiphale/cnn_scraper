He was arrested early this morning on his way to play in the PGA Championship. It's a major tournament he hopes to win just weeks after his victory at the Masters. Scheffler reportedly tried to drive around a fatal crash scene near the golf course and kept driving when an officer says he tried to stop him. ESPN's Jeff Darlington shot this video of the arrest.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He though, and you see him there in this jailhouse uniform, he is still charged with four counts, including felony assault on a police officer who was reportedly injured after being dragged by Scheffler's car for several feet. Let's go now to CNN correspondent Patrick Snell and CNN chief law enforcement analyst, John Miller. I want to start with Patrick Snell, who is at the PGA championship there in Louisville, Kentucky. Patrick, we should also mention just hours after this arrest, Scheffler returned to the course to play his second round, but this arrest is raising a lot of eyebrows because of how mild-mannered Scheffler is known to be.",

It's likely going to shed some more light on whether or not this was a misunderstanding as Scheffler has described it. What kind of role can it play?JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, it can play a very decisive role, especially when you have a he said, he said scenario here. You know, according to Scheffler's attorney, he was directed to go that way. And a second officer stopped him. And that's what he calls a miscommunication. The story goes south where the officer says he was holding on to the car and Scheffler and he lurched forward and dragged the officer. What one witness described is about 30 feet before the officer fell to the ground, causing these injuries of abrasions and swelling and so on. The body camera will tell us what the officer's instructions were, what Scheffler said in return. The body cameras of other officers. And look at all those police cars in the background, the dashboard cameras running from those cars. There are pole cameras that are up in that area on the high ground. So between all of those points of view, we should get a clear, literally a clear picture of what occurred and maybe some of the sound that goes with it.",

But think of the way these scenarios actually occur in real life. You know, you come up upon the accident scene. This is not the normal traffic detail of police officers who are always there and directing people in to the golf course and managing traffic. This is the team that's investigating the fatal accident involving a bus and another vehicle. And, you know, one officer says, OK, well go around this way, according to Scheffler, and another officer says no. And at that point, does he say, I'm just going to ignore this guy because the other guy said it was OK and accelerates the car?

Bodies were recovered from a tunnel. The operation took place last night, but just terrible for the families of these three people because for so long they thought, they've hoped that their loved ones were alive. Worried every moment that they were in terrible conditions, that they were being tortured, that they weren't getting enough food, that they all the horrible things that the hostages have been released have talked about. And now to find out that they'd actually escaped the music festival, they realized that danger was coming, gotten into vehicles and managed to get about 10 or 15 minutes drive away to Miffl Sim, which is a kibbutz. A short distance away.We drove past that kibbutz just a couple of days after the attack. It was absolute chaos there. There were cars strewn on the road all shot up. Baby strollers at the side of vehicle's trunks open on the vehicles. And this is what the IDF is saying. That rather than them actually being taken alive, they were killed when they thought that they had reached safety in this kibbutz. And we know from the from a relative who was on the phone with one of those young people, he said he was on the phone with her for about an hour and a half talking to her. And he could hear the gunfire. So the family knew the desperate nature of the situation she was in, but just kept hoping and hoping that she was alive. So this is a really hard day for those families now to have this terrible news. But what we're hearing from the other hostage families is a very clear message that they want their loved ones brought back. They want a deal done. The hostages released dead or alive and to come home.",
