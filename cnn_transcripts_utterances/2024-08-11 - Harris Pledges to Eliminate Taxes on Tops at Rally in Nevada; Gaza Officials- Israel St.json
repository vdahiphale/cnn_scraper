(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: At a worker focus rally in Las Vegas, Vice President Harris pledging her support for eliminating taxes on tips for hospitality and service workers. It was the first time that she has made such a pledge and also notable because this is a policy former President Donald Trump also supports and has been campaigning on for weeks. Harris really aiming to go after the support of workers in this critical battleground state. She received the support of the Culinary Union and their 60,000 members.

These hacked documents were sent to \"Politico\" which reported on Saturday that it received emails from an anonymous account containing internal Trump campaign documents. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement that foreign sources were behind this attack and he blamed Iran for the hacking.He said in a statement these documents were obtained illegally from foreign sources hostile to the United States intended to interfere with the 2024 election and so chaos throughout our democratic process. Cheung pointed to a report from Microsoft that was released this week. In that report Microsoft revealed that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had attempted to hack high-ranking officials emails in June. Now the Microsoft report did not say which campaign it had targeted or if the hack was successful. CNN reached out to the Trump campaign asking if it had sought more information from the FBI and the Trump campaign declined to comment. Microsoft also declined to comment on this report. It's worth remembering now that in 2016 it was Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta who was hacked himself and his emails were published by WikiLeaks in the days and weeks before the 2016 campaign.

Israel says the school housed a Hamas command and control center and that a top Islamic Jihad commander was likely among two dozen militants it says was killed at the school.

As you say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has very much been focused on what he says are Israel's war objectives and Israel won't give up on them. Those are to destroy the military and governance capabilities of Hamas, to get the 115 or so hostages about a third of whom are believed to be dead back into Israel. Those that were kidnapped, of course, on October the 7th in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks, and to prevent the Gaza Strip from posing a threat to Israel in the future. So I don't think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to bedeterred or deviated from those goals but perhaps with a nod to the international criticism particularly from the United States. The IDF put out not one, not two, but three statements on this same strike, something that they don't usually do. It emphasized that it says it's used aerial surveillance, intelligence and small munitions to try to minimize civilian casualties. At the same time it very swiftly named 19 of the two dozen militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad that it says were killed in that strike including it says the likelihood that a top Islamic Jihad commander was killed in that strike. And then at the same time it reiterated what it has said -- has said on numerous occasions that Hamas is to blame for this because it uses these civilian facilities in order to -- well, as command and control centers to store weapons and also to use as a base to carry out terrorist attacks. So that's kind of what Israel has been saying and doing in response and also before the international condemnation. As I said I don't think it's going to change Israel's war objectives or the way it goes about this war but certainly it's trying to put its version of events out there, you know, as a kind of counterweight to what the authorities in Hamas run enclave have been saying.

We do not like to see people -- innocent people killed.It's time after 10 months put this to rest. We the majority of the people that live in Israel, you know, are very grateful for what the United States has done the last 10 days with mobilizing these forces into the region. It has deterred until now Iran and Hezbollah for making an attack on Israel. So we are first very thankful for that for the United States. We see the efforts that the United States are putting on this. We also see a very interesting comment from Iran that came out the last 24 hours saying that they are not a side to a deal between Israel and Hamas. We've seen Arab countries come out. We've seen France and, of course, Qatar and Egypt urging for this deal to happen. So we are optimistic because we have no other choice but we are positive that this is the time, this is the window of opportunity because of the political window both in the United States and in Israel to get this done. And we need everybody, everybody focused to get this deal done. And I would even urge the Prime Minister of Israel that claims he is the best negotiator. He knows how to get a deal done. He knows how to stand for what is correct for the state of Israel. I would urge him Mr. Netanyahu please get on a plane this Thursday. We see the Prime Minister of Qatar involved directly in these talks. I would urge him get on a plane.

But something we'll need to watch closely. It will likely become our next named storm. The next name on the list is Ernesto, and we are again ahead of schedule for the season with all of these named storms, in large part because our ocean temperatures are just incredibly warm. They're still three to five degrees above normal across this zone here of development where we have that tropical wave right now. And then even near the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf, we're still looking at some of these water temperatures that are one to two degrees above normal. The water temperatures have really been driving this above average forecast, this active season that we're in. NOAA just updated their forecast this week, and we're still looking at a 90% chance that the season is above normal. Up to 24 named storms possible. Average is 14. Up to 13 hurricanes possible. Average is seven. So again, an active season possible ahead. Another big reason is because we're still in that La Nina. That's that cool ocean circulation in the Pacific. But what it does is it moves the jet stream north. The jet stream has a lot of wind shear. It's that wind energy upstairs in the atmosphere. So with the jet stream out of the way, that decreases that wind energy that the hurricanes heat and allows more of those tropical waves to form off the coast of Africa and head towards the Caribbean. And that is exactly what we're seeing this week. Again, something to watch. We could be having Ernesto on our hands in a couple of days.",

Now this is the first time the group has backed a presidential candidate breaking with the norm and adding to her campaign's momentum. Latino voters have been seen as a key swing group. A recent Pew poll shows the demographic is mostly split on who they would vote for. 36% say they would vote for each of the candidates if the election were held today but that polling was done before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. The poll found about a third of registered Latino voters say they would vote for a third party with just 85 days left until Election Day.

Team USA had 122 medals overall right now, putting it far ahead of the pack.And there's still a chance for the U.S. to come out on top in the gold rush. Thirteen more golds will be awarded for today's closing ceremony, including the Women's Marathon, when just moments ago the Netherlands Sifan Hassan clinched the gold and set a new Olympic record. Ethiopia took home the silver and Kenya the bronze. All right, I want to go live now to Paris.

There was such a buzz on the streets here in Paris last night, particularly around the men's basketball final, the one that the script writers had been wanting. The stars were out in force both on and off the court.And the game more than lived up to the hype as host France took on what might be one of the most talented U.S. teams ever assembled in that quest for gold. 20-year-old Victor Wembanyama, familiar name and face. He more than held his own against some of the all-time greats. The reigning NBA Rookie of the Year scoring 26 points. He did manage to keep his team in it right to the end. But in the end, the new dream team, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Steph Curry and co just proved too strong. It was Curry whose late game heroics have made him a four-time NBA champion. He added to his legend scoring 25 points. He hit four three pointers in the final three minutes that all but sealed the gold for the USA. It was a first for Steph, quite incredibly, third for LeBron and a record fourth gold medal for Kevin Durant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're also looking for their eighth straight, which is quite incredible.It would also mean they join the women's football team atop the podium. Something that felt an impossibility this time last year, didn't it? After that early exit at the Women's World Cup. This was the game I was lucky enough to attend last night. In a matter of weeks, it really does seem Emma Hayes has injected some new life into the setup, bringing her winning ways from Chelsea and England as the U.S. beat Brazil for a third time in the Olympic final. And it leaves a legend that is Marta, still all smiles with a silver medal, but without a major tournament title as she retires from international football after her sixth Olympic game. She is really one of those players that can have that title. Legend and icon on the final night of action on the purple track, though, at the Stade de France, a purple patch for the USA's four by four relay teams taking gold in both the men's and women's races, setting records along the way as well. Now, more than 30 years since the women didn't capture gold in this event, they finished an incredible four seconds faster than the Dutch in silver. The men's event was closer, but they did it. And in record time as well, Olympic record time, the third straight games that both U.S. four by 400 teams have won gold. And just before I hand back, Kim, a word on Sifan Hassan, as you mentioned, taking gold this morning in Olympic record time in the marathon. What an end to her game. She's taken bronze in the 5000 and the 10000 meters here in Paris and now gold. I have no idea how many miles that is in total that she's run in the course of her Olympic campaign. But really quite something. And it's a mark that these games, they've purposefully made the women's events climax on the Sunday to give them more visibility. So something new in that fight for equality.",
