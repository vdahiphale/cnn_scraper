Stakes are enormous for the last two major Republican presidential candidates left standing. Donald Trump seeking a decisive win over Nikki Haley that could potentially end her White House hopes. Haley hoping to defy expectations, pull off a strong showing in a state that has historically delivered upsets. That would propel her campaign forward. On the Democratic side, there's an effort to write-in President Joe Biden's name in a contest that will not be awarding any delegates. But that does not mean there's nothing at stake. Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson are trying to peel away Biden's support within the Democratic Party, hoping to drive home their concerns that his re-election bid is weak as we count down to results on this very important primary night. Our anchors and correspondents are at key locations across New Hampshire, covering the candidates and tracking the votes as they're cast and counted.

Now, again, this is very different from what we saw the last several weeks. They've been watching Haley's poll numbers closely. And as Dana mentioned, because of the large amount of independent voters that can vote in Republican primary, they were genuinely concerned as to what was going to happen.They spent millions of dollars between the campaign and the super PAC, hitting Nikki Haley on two issues, immigration and social security, hitting her on immigration because the Trump campaign believes that that is the most important issue to Republicans here in New Hampshire, they were trying to solidify those conservative votes, and hitting her on social security to try and lessen her appeal to independent voters.

After they've gotten their ballot, after they've gone to be trying the privacy screens to make their choices. This black box, this is the ballot box, this is where the voters, this is their final step. They insert it into the box and then that is that. The latest count that I've been able to get is there have been 1,987 votes cast. For some context, Jake, here in Ward 3, there are just under 5,000 registered voters. There's still time to go. That's been very busy the last, I would say, 30, 40 minutes here. Obviously, people are getting off work and they're coming in to cast their ballots. So, this is a well-oiled machine here. They are coming through quickly. At 8:00, what's going to happen is Jed (ph), the ward moderator, he's going to be able to hit that tabulating button. And that is when you're going to get the totals, the unofficial and incomplete totals, but the first read on where this ward is going to be going. After that, then they have to go through the process of going through and sifting through all of the ballots that require hand counting. That could be write-ins, as we know, people are concerned about needing to do a lot -- going through a lot of write-in ballots because of Joe Biden. But that part of the process will then take some more time. Come with me, though, because after this, the voters come out here, they leave, and we have a voter with us right here.

And as we go through this night, we just need to keep in mind that Trump has already been showing some inroads with some constituencies that in the past he has really struggled with, suburban people, women in particular.

Is that the case now? And does he have how much ground does he have to make up? Because Iowa was one thing, but New Hampshire will be contested in the general election.

The campaign says that Haley is feeling good, that she's trying to have fun out there on the campaign trail.

The plurality of Haley supporters, 39 percent are voting for her because they dislike Donald Trump. They dislike her opponent. 33 percent say they strongly favor her, that's why they're voting for her. 27 percent say they're voting for her with some reservations. And then in terms of how are you going to feel depending on who wins the nomination? Well, here, Trump voters feeling if Haley wins the nomination, 75 percent of them are going to be dissatisfied if Haley ends up winning the nomination. That gets even larger for Haley supporters if Trump wins the nomination. 88 percent of Haley supporters say they will feel dissatisfied if Trump wins the nomination.

You know, Trump was saying, yeah, but, you know, you can have Democrats who come in and vote in this and they cant, you cannot, because you have to have read -- de-registered as a Democrat and registered as an undeclared by October 6th, and fewer than 4,000 people did that.So these are genuine independents that we're talking about here or the undeclared. They're not Democratic voters who decided to come in and mess up the Republican primary.",

Because its just what they have done.And to your point about the fact that these independent undeclared voters, the hope in the Nikki Haley camp is that the majority go to her. It is true because Donald Trump now is establishment because, he was president, he still has the appeal to people who don't like politics, don't register as a party and come in and vote as undeclared independent voters, and do it just because Donald Trump is on the ballot.",

Like that is kind of our --re perhaps our instinct, but that's not necessarily the case for all the reasons that you laid out.And, you know, I think one of the most fascinating things about some of what we're going to learn here. And I think you're going to see the Haley campaign and her supporters tried to capitalize on this. If in fact she has a better showing here tonight than she otherwise, might, it strengthens her argument with Republicans that she is capable of winning in a general election. And they have not really -- one of the major things since we haven't seen in this race throughout the entire arc of it, there has been no one that has been able to stand up and credibly say, I could beat Donald Trump in the nominating contest and do better against Biden. This electorate is one that is much closer. The dynamics that shape it, or some of the same dynamics that are going to shape the electorates in Arizona and Georgia in the states that decide the election. That's her all -- that's her whole argument here. So, if she can come out of here and be able to make that argument more strongly to donors who would be willing to fund or not her continued a campaign, and then whether or not Republican voters buy it, I mean, that's really the only path I see for her this point.",

One who thought that Nikki Haley is too conservative, one thought that she's too liberal, but they both were voting for her because she could restore the Republican Party.So we heard that again and again and again. It is an uphill battle, even if she wins in the state and that's a tall order at this point. But for now at least this is definitely much more of a race than it might have seemed with that Iowa 32 percent, but its all about the margin tonight. And we'll find that out. But just remember even if she does well tonight and I'm not being a naysayer about Nikki Haley, her next shot is South Carolina in a month. And right now in the polls, she's down by about 40 points to Donald Trump. I mean, one of the things we're talking about here is independents coming into a Republican primary, and having their say and that's (INAUDIBLE) allowed and all of that. On the other hand, it is the Republican nomination and it's really hard to win the Republican nomination if registered Republican voters are overwhelmingly for your opponent and for her to stay in this race to late February -- late February, which is when the South Carolina primary is, and she trails by a lot and it's a tall order.",

We have to sort of say, okay, pump the brakes on that a little bit. Yes. People who are not registered Democrats can vote -- registered Republicans can vote, but Democrats who vote in the primary.
