As you pointed out, that video could be an important piece of evidence, according to aviation experts, which could lend to understanding what really happened before the planes crash. According to an aviation expert of the flap of the wing there, could help understand what really happened. Because usually, there's an extra lift the wing takes before landing. In this case, according to that aviation expert, it was not fully extended. Now, the black boxes answer will be extremely critical to this investigation. The committee informed has to submit their report within 45 days. Two other developments we got to know of, according to officials, the pilot had asked for a last-minute change of runway. There are two runways at the Pokhara Airport, the pilot asked for a change in one way, the officials also pointed out that there was no distress call when the pilot was talking to the air traffic control. To me, a very important significant part of this entire incident is the fact that the impact, Christine, of this crash could have been a lot worse, because it was right next to a lot of homes.

So, every once in a while Congress needs to raise it. If it doesn't, the Treasury Department won't be able to pay all the country's bills in full and on time. Now the Treasury does have a little wiggle room before it gets to that point, what it calls extraordinary measures to move money around.
