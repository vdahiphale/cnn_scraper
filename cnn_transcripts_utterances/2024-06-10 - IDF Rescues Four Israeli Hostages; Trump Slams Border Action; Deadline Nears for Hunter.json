You know, people think the longtime (INAUDIBLE) Republican though, oh, Hispanics just always vote Democrat. No, poor people tended to vote Democrat. And as Hispanic moved up, the socioeconomic ladder, they tended to look indistinguishable from other voters. That's changing a little bit because now we're seeing the electorate sort along working class lines, non-college educated versus college educated, really bizarre gender gaps, stuff that's really sort of solidifying, and blacks and Latinos are just following a little slower behind what's been happening with the white working class.

If recent polling on Democratic candidates in Nevada is any indication, I think it is, Mr. Biden has a big problem to overcome. Nevadans are losing confidence in him to do something meaningful about inflation and housing and they're left feeling that he just doesn't get it.\"ELAINA PLOTT CALABRO, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": And we're talking here about broadening out beyond Latino Nevadan voters. This is just about the state and why it is so essential to this election. Recall first that it was a nail-biter in 2020 when Joe Biden won. So, this was never a shoe-in for him. But, Lulu, it struck me when you said how these voters, correctly, they yearn for a pre-pandemic economy under Trump. But I think what Biden's challenge is going to be is to remind voters that 2020 was in fact a year that Donald Trump was president. And I think when I was just in Reno for a panel talking to a lot of voters at the university's campus there, a lot of people were upset still about the closures that they thought harmed the economy, but they were attributing those to Biden, which I found interesting, as if 2020 has been sort of erased from the national memory as having been indeed a part of Trump's presidency.",
