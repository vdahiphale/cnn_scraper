So, it was really a futile effort but it was required from some Republican and Democratic lawmakers so that they didn't slow down the process. They voted so quickly that Chuck Schumer is really keeping time on how fast they were moving. That's because they wanted to get this done so they could get out of town. If there's anything the Senate likes to preserve, it's their weekends and their long weekends at that.But this was a piece of legislation that really was always going to be about that coalition in the middle. There were a number of Republicans who did not back this proposal. Some of them didn't back it because they didn't believe in increasing the debt ceiling without cutting spending further. Some of them didn't back it because they were very concerned about how much the country was planning to spend on defense, arguing that it was not enough. In fact, in order to fast-track this agreement and move last night, senators wanted a requirement and a promise from leadership that they were going to work hard to try to push forward with additional money for Ukraine in the upcoming months. So, that became a critical part of securing the fast-tracking of this legislation. But it's done.

And Austin Police believed that he was willing to carry out more murders at some point. So, some really disturbing allegations and all of this is really stunning because Meza's criminal background is extensive. Back in 1982, he was convicted and sent to prison for murdering an eight-year- old girl in Austin. He got out about 11 years later for good behavior. He's been in and out of the prison system several times since then.

Of course, we know that not true because his team had to return 15 boxes of materials to the National Archives. And that was before the FBI conducted a search of his Mar-a-Lago residence.And then subsequently, his attorneys did additional searches not only for possible presidential records. So, those are materials that are created during the administration but are the property of the government, but they were also, of course, looking for any classified documents, of which we know there were many. So, this explanation doesn't quite add up. But this is what we've seen before from the former president. When he's under investigation, he makes a blanket insistence that he has done nothing wrong. There is rarely any nuance, but what we've seen him and his attorneys do is try to conflate the idea of complying with the Presidential Records Act. Again, that means you have to put all these records back in the Archives when you leave office because they belong to the American people, and also these questions about possibly mishandling defense information or classified materials. It's a way to kind of confuse the issues and also downplay really the gravity of what investigators are looking at.",

And we know that as part of this criminal investigation, the Justice Department special counsel, Jack Smith, is looking at whether the former president or anyone else tried to obstruct this investigation.But what's so interesting, though, about this audio recording is I keep reminding people he knew he was being recorded. This was a recording that he made, as he was in the habit of doing that summer, when he was talking to journalists or writers, people working on books, he would have his aides record the conversation. So, he knew he was being recorded when he suggested, he claimed that he was in possession of a classified document and then also really acknowledged the limits of his ability to declassify. So, it's really hard to reconcile those statements with the public defenses that he and his attorneys have given. But, ultimately, what truly matters are what they say to investigators and what they say in court if there are any charges brought.",

And I think the best way to understand why is to look at the timeline.Now, let's start on January 20, 2021, at exactly noon Eastern Time, Donald Trump leaves office, most importantly, loses the power to declassify documents at that point. Now, a few months later, in May of 2021, the Archives starts interacting with Trump's team and says, hey, we have some concerns. There are some documents missing. We're going to need to talk. Archives then proceeds to negotiate with Donald Trump over the next several months. And during that time, two months after that, this is our new reporting. So, we're in July of 2021. Donald Trump has this meeting that Paula talked about at his resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he's meeting with these writers. And there's been a story out about how Trump allegedly was planning to attack Iran. Trump doesn't like that story. And so he says on the recording, we haven't heard the recording, but we know the substance of it, I have a document that disproves that, but it's classified. I cannot show it to you. After that archive continues negotiating, Trump turns over 15 boxes to Archives in January of 2022, but Archive says, we still have concerns. Then they call in DOJ, and that leads us to last summer, when DOJ does the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. So, this timing on the Bedminster recording is really important because it's after Trump loses the power to declassify, and it's also after he knows that Archive says, we have concerns.",

And one thing we've learned from this new reporting is he was doing something with those documents. He was using them to try to shape the public narrative about his time in office.And let's remember, he has made these repeated false public claims about whether he declassified. We remember at the town hall, Kaitlan asked whether Trump had ever showed declassified or classified documents to anyone, and Trump responded, not really. I would have the right to. By the way, they were declassified after. We know that's not true because here he is after he leaves office saying, these are still classified, I can't show them to you, and that goes to criminal intent.",
