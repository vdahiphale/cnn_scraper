The return of the old Trump all the time news cycle, with the once indicted, twice impeached one term president set to be arraigned in a New York courtroom.Moments before the blasts which killed a pro-war Russian blogger who was handed a small statue of his likeness, possibly packed filled with explosives. And not appropriate Madame Secretary, the dressing down on the French Secretary of State for dressing down for Playboy magazine. In the coming hours, Donald Trump will once again make history for all the wrong reasons when he appears in the New York courtroom to be the first current or former U.S. president to face criminal charges. The judge has turned down a request by media outlets including CNN for the arraignment to be broadcast live, but he will allow some photographers to take still pictures before the proceedings begin. Right now, Trump is at his residence in the Trump Tower, where aide say he has been huddling with legal and political advisors. He is not expected to speak publicly while in New York, instead will deliver remarks on his return to Mar-a-Lago in Florida Tuesday night. Trump attorneys say they believe it will be difficult for him to get a fair trial in New York City. They're looking at every possible legal challenge to this case. Meantime, a small number of Trump supporters gathered near Mar-a-Lago to cheer on the former president Monday, major security now in place in New York ahead of the former president's arraignment. For more now we get CNN's legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid.

So we have 10 misdemeanors, which probably are barred by the statute limitations.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER (on camera): The suspected Chinese spy balloon that was hovering over the United States before being shot down off the coast of South Carolina back in February was able to take some images and collect some signals intelligence over sensitive U.S. military installations across the United States. Now, the U.S. government is saying that they were able to take steps to mitigate the kind of intelligence that the Chinese were able to gather. But at the same time, we are told that the Chinese government was able to remotely erase the data on that spy balloon, making it possible that the U.S. government will not ever know for sure what the Chinese government was able to glean from that balloon. In other words, the Chinese government may have been able to wipe all of the data on that device before the U.S. government was able to get its hands on. So, the U.S. government does have some idea here of what the Chinese were able to gather, because they were able to determine that there were some pictures, as well as some signs that there were some signals intelligence gathered by this balloon. But at this point, the U.S. is saying that they do not believe that any of this intelligence that the Chinese gathered anyway was more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to gather as they orbit above the country on a daily basis. Now, how much longer the FBI is going to be investigating this balloon, they have had it, of course, now for well over -- for about two months now. And they have gleaned some important new information about the algorithms that power the balloon software, for example, and how it is actually able to be maneuvered across its targets. So, what we're waiting for now, of course, is a fuller picture by the U.S. government about what the balloons capabilities actually are. And of course, about the kind of intelligence it was able to gather about these sensitive U.S. military sites. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One is the capability of the Chinese to be able to deploy and capture information and means that there's potentially information that has to be modified, changed, moved, whatever it is that they captured, so that it can be continually can be used, but will be protected in the future. But I think it goes to another point that not many people are talking about. Remember, in the days that follow, we were essentially shooting anything out of the sky, none of them turned out to be balloons. But I -- this goes to why the Biden administration was so forward leaning, and maybe even too forward leaning in shooting down the potential -- the likelihood that there might have been other balloons.

That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me for a couple of reasons. First, if China could get the same information from satellites already in orbit, then why use balloons? And secondly, did they use the balloons because they could loiter or linger in one area for longer at a lower altitude? And that gives them better intelligence gathering?",

And the concerns that that our airspace had been -- had basically had been violated, which we -- which was true in that case, and possibly true in the later cases. You have those communications at moments like that, because the belief is that if you can lower the temperature, do military to military communications, or diplomatic to diplomatic communications, rather than political to political, you can lower the temperature and people who have met each other who work together who may have trained together at one stage, who sort of know each other and are subject matter experts can break through the noise that we were hearing that week, the fact that that was never utilized was always somewhat worrisome, because it suggests that the Chinese or shows that the Chinese are content to essentially go dark, right?In other words, that they will do things like this that sort of challenge us, you know, sort of wake us up in the sense of, yes, we're doing this and then are unwilling to communicate about that.

CNN's Anna Coren in Hong Kong live for us this hour. You know, it's interesting because the new speaker of the U.S. House so Kevin McCarthy, he will host in California, the Taiwanese president, Nancy Pelosi caused a lot more outrage because she actually went to Taiwan. So, it's something which is going to upset Beijing, but maybe not as much? How do you explain this? ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, look, tensions are ramping up, John. We have just heard from the spokesperson of the Chinese Consulate General in Los Angeles, voicing China's protest over this confirmed meeting. He said China firmly oppose any form of official exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan saying \"Disregarding China's solemn representations and repeated warnings, the U.S. insisted on arranging Tsai Ing-wen's transit and plotting and supporting the Taiwan authorities' pursuit of independence. China solemnly protests and strongly condemns this.\" Now, John, President Tsai's office has obviously confirmed Wednesday's meeting. Her spokesperson told Taiwan state media let me read this to you. \"It is the right of the 23 million people of Taiwan for a democratic Taiwan to have exchanges with other democracies.\" Now, a few hours earlier, Kevin McCarthy's office issued a statement confirming the bipartisan meeting with Tsai is going to be held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Los Angeles. McCarthy will be the highest ranking U.S. official to meet the Taiwanese leader on American soil. Now this meeting was long anticipated and obviously he's guaranteed to further inflame the already fractured relationship between the United States and China. Tsai has been in Central America for an official visit to Guatemala and Belize and a stopover in New York last week that really upset China at a banquet.

It's been defended both by Marlene Schiappa herself and by the magazine's editor, who's been explaining that it's been changed quite a lot these last few years. This is an article about promoting, says Marlene Schiappa, women's rights and gay rights, and attracting attention to those causes. Marlene Schiappa, who rose to prominence when Emmanuel Macron was first elected and made equality minister, had been known as a feminist author before that. That is part of the questioning that's come around her decision to grant the interview and to appear on the cover, as has the forthcoming question of the reshuffle that we expect here in France on the back of the social protests that we have seen over pension reform, with many on her own side, taking the opportunity to lay into her decision. It is a time of great political uncertainty here in France, but also people point out an ill-timed decision in terms of how it looks in the context of those ongoing protests over pension reform. It is on Thursday that the unions will be back on the street for another day of mass strike action and protest. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
