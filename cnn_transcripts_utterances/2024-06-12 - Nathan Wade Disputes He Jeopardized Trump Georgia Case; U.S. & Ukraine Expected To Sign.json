And this is THE SOURCE.We begin with breaking news tonight, as the Fulton County District Attorney, Fani Willis, has just moved to dismiss the appeal that's seeking to disqualify her, and her entire office, from Donald Trump's election interference case, arguing that it should be dismissed due to a, quote, \"Lack of sufficient evidence.\" As of this moment, that case is completely frozen, until Georgia's Court of Appeals rules on whether or not she should be disqualified. The issue at the heart of that appeal, her relationship with the special prosecutor that she put on the case, Nathan Wade, who I just sat down with in Georgia, this afternoon. This was the first time that Nathan Wade has spoken to CNN, on camera, an interview that I should note comes three months, after he resigned, after being given an ultimatum by the judge that Willis had to go, if he didn't. You're about to hear whether he regrets that relationship, whether he thinks Trump's trial can happen, even if Trump's in the White House next year. And also, a moment that I wasn't expecting, when his media consultant stepped in, as Wade was answering the critical question, about the timeline of their relationship. My interview with Nathan Wade starts right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And so I know, for all of us, the challenge of having your family member, battle addiction. For so many of us, who've had friends and family, who have battled addiction, and the consequences of it. They are real. I also know that the President is managing to lead this country, and also being very, very, very clear that whatever happens, and whatever legal processes that Hunter Biden goes through, that the President will respect that.",

One, can you just talk to us about what this moment means for your community. And also, if you have a better estimate of how long it will take to build the new bridge, which is the next phase, I know, of this whole recovery process.",

But we're going to work together, and we're going to get through it. And today was a major milestone after such a tragic and traumatic event, one of the most traumatic events, in our -- in our state's history. Where, we were told that this could take almost up to a year, to be able just to clear the Federal Channel. And instead of taking 11 months, we got it done in 11 weeks, because we've worked together, and because we worked in close coordination with the Biden administration. And so, we know that the process is not over. While we were able to successfully recover the bodies of the six individuals we lost, and return them to their families, to give some form of closure, while we were able to take care of the port workers, who lost their jobs and making sure that the work that happened, throughout the state, helped to save 3,000 jobs. And we also know now we're able to reopen the Federal Channel faster than anyone thought imaginable. This mission will not be complete until we get that bridge rebuilt. And so, we continue working with members of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, to ensure that we can get this done, on time and on budget, for the people of our state.",
