He's innocent until proven guilty.The second part there is the proof beyond a reasonable doubt when we're talking about guilt. That's something we anticipated Griffin to talk about quite a bit today. Because the defense has sort of been trying to create that reasonable doubt, point out circumstantial evidence that doesn't necessarily directly focus on Alex Murdaugh throughout the entire trial. The third aspect of his argument is law enforcement. They had the entire time throughout this nearly six-week trial trying to characterize the investigation into the murders of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh as messy, sloppy, incomplete. They said today that law enforcement failed miserably with their investigation and pointed out that, in part, they believe that's why Alex Murdaugh was indicted in the first place.

The prosecution seizing on that in their own closing argument yesterday, pointing to all of the data and the video. But of course as well acknowledging that they do have a widely circumstantial case. But they pointed out to  those jurors that circumstantial evidence is still evidence. When you have a whole bunch of it, you are still able to come to a guilty verdict.

That's a big no-no. You're not supposed to do that. The judge said, every time they leave the room, when he dismissed the jury, he told her she had been a good juror who focused on the case and he could tell she was. They simply could not keep her on.

The core of the defense presentation to the jury at this point is that there is no hard evidence -- or not much hard evidence -- tying Alex Murdaugh to this case.

      "sentences": "Look, I remember that the prosecution in a double homicide trial, three hours of argument, made not one mention about the crime scene. They completely ignored the facts that were bad for them.In contrast, Jim Griffin got up today and he embraced the funk. He went right to the lie, you know, he's a liar. He's lied but he's also an addict. He was under a lot of scrutiny and has a lot of skeletons in his closet. That is why he lied. He just didn't want to be in the spotlight. So that is what a good lawyer does. We don't ignore the bad facts. We embrace them, we explain them. I think he did a great job weaving in the very important instructions for the defense. The presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, the definition of reasonable doubt. And more importantly, circumstantial evidence instruction that says essentially to a jury, if there's more than one inference on a specific fact, you have to find it on the side innocence, not guilt. These are really important instructions for this jury. And listen, it's ironic that, in a double murder trial, that it's the defense coming forward with the science and the lack thereof as opposed to the prosecution presenting the science and being beyond a reasonable doubt. I think the argument today was very effective. I think he hit all the points. There's a lot of criticism about it being maybe not as dynamic but neither side was. At least we didn't have Professor Waters slouched over on the jury box, mansplaining to the jury. I found that to be so offensive yesterday. (CROSSTALK)",

We're all dead because we're not using our phone now. That's effective.Is that lie really then material? Does it even matter or is it consciousness of guilt if, at the same time he's denying being at the kennels, he's also pressing for data that is exculpatory, that shows he was not with Maggie at the time. And on this nonsense about \"my baby,\" we don't know what Maggie and Paul were doing. These are not facts and evidence. This is borderline prosecutorial misconduct. He's misleading the jury. Sure, I think a jury can make an inference that a mother would want to protect her son but it's not a fact in evidence. And it's very misleading. I was surprised there was no objections.

When you read some of the messages, they can be described as anti-Semitic but bizarre, unhinged and really alarming, including this particular post we want to show you, that dates back to February 17th.That's what FBI agents first noticed when Carpenter allegedly went on Twitter and wrote that he would, quote, \"carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan government.\" The very next day, the FBI's National Threat Operations Center relayed that to FBI agents, working with Michigan state place, that were able to speak to Carpenter's mother, who told investigators she believed her son was in Texas and that had access to multiple firearms. They put, through the use of his phone, they were able to track him down and arrest Him. We're still working out the details on an actual timeline but everything does suggest he was taken to custody extremely quickly, preventing a tragedy here. The more we learn, the more questions that raises. He was previously arrested for assault charges in Michigan. There was a protection order filed against him. And perhaps what escalated this to actual threat is when authorities found out there were three handguns that were registered in his name. And that's escalated the situation. We know he had a scheduled court date. But just to close out the earlier point, this is not unfamiliar to Michigan state officials, that saw the threat of political violence, with the foiled kidnapping plot in 2020 against the governor. Then we heard from the ATL say this morning they are monitoring this increased threat. You have through COVID and antigovernment conspiracies coming together with anti-Semitic ideas and, for certain individuals, the concern is that they will actually go through with these potential threats.",

We know his name is Marc Muffley. He's 40 years old from Lansford, Pennsylvania. And the FBI says that he, on Monday morning, tried to check a bag with explosives right here at this airport. But that suitcase did not go far. The reason is because TSA screeners caught something unusual in their bag and the TSA and an FBI bomb technician found these items. They found powder consistent with commercial grade fireworks, a can of butane, a lighter, a pipe with white residue on it, a wireless drill and two outlets taped together. Now the bag also had a luggage tag on it that had his name. So the airport called out his name on the PA system on Monday and then security camera footage showed that gentleman walking out of the airport as soon as he heard his name. Police knew the name because of the luggage tag. The FBI arrested him that night without incident. This is not his first encounter with the law. He's been charged in Pennsylvania before. But they have been for much lesser offenses than the federal charges that he's facing. Like possessions of controlled substance, harassment, minor theft. But the federal charges that he now faces include possessing an explosive in an airport and attempting to place an explosive on a plane. We should know more at 1:30 at the federal courthouse.",

And he called for the release of Paul Whelan, the American wrongfully detained in Russia. Let's talk with Col. Cedric Leighton and David Sanger. David, a State Department official told us not to expect Russia to change course after this meeting. That's not particularly surprising.

In fact we believe that Lavrov probably wasn't told about the invasion until just hours before it happened.

And I'm very concerned that the genie might not be able to be put back in the bottle at this point. So what the Russians want to do is they could potentially be able to use this lack of limits. They have a little less than 6,000 warheads right now in their nuclear arsenal. They could potentially expand that number and they could also develop newer weapons. We talked before about the hypersonic weapons capability. We also know that they were planning some of their nuclear capabilities.
