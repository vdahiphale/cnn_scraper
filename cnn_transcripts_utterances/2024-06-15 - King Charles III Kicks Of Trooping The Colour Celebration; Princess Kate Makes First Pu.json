Just yesterday of course releasing that statement saying she would be a part of the ceremony today.And we saw her passing just a short time ago, leaving from Buckingham Palace and heading down the Horse Guards Parade which is what you're looking at right now in terms of the live pictures you can see the carriages arriving there. And this is part of the military side of the King's birthday parade. Trooping the Colour is when one of the five regiments so the household divisions, Foot Guards regiments, they troop that color which is showing their flag and it's a very, very old ceremony actually dating back I think to King Charles II and it's held as part of the King's birthday celebrations. So here you'll see both the king inspecting his troops. You'll see all of the regiments passing through and slow and quick march. You'll see military bands. But then perhaps the moment all of you want to see is when the Royals head on back to Buckingham Palace, and you get that amazing balcony shot. And this year everyone's hopes and dreams are sort of being answered because we're going to have the whole royal family on that balcony including the Princess of Wales. The first time we're seeing her for months since she announced she was being treated for cancer. She is looking incredibly well. We've seen her in a carriage with all three children. And of course for the King also receiving treatment from cancer. So this is a big difference to last year. Last year we saw the king on horseback. This year he is riding in a carriage but and they went to celebrate and this is one of the most colorful, most fun, I'd say parts of the Royal calendar each year. There's a pump, there's a pageantry, but also it's all about the family and you actually get to see them all together on that balcony and we only really get that once a year ordinarily when we don't have coronation and other jubilee celebrations.",

And I think as well, one of the important takeaways that doesn't get a lot of talk about here was the commitment for development and developing banks and developing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly climates -- particularly countries that are affected by climate change.

But then the question was, what do you do with it, and the initial idea was given to the Ukrainians.But that would really undercut the reliability of Western banks, United States, but most of the European banks as a repository of central bank assets for other countries around the world. So the idea was, we're going to freeze it, not touch the principal, but use the income that can generate three to $5 billion a year, maybe more, depending on how interest rates fill in the next year or so.

Suppliers are buying material from all over the world and building parts that make their way to Boeing and to Airbus to be assembled into an aircraft.Now in this case, Boeing reported to the FAA that a company at the front of that supply chain is selling titanium that was ultimately used in these commercial jets, not just for Boeing, but also for Airbus, was selling it using fake documents, verifying that titanium's authenticity. Now, that raises concern that they may have been selling counterfeit titanium that doesn't meet safety standards and shouldn't have been used in a plane for parts like doors or the components that secure the engine to the aircraft. Critical parts that we're talking about here. Now, this was caught by a supplier that noticed little holes in the titanium that looked like corrosion, according to the \"New York Times\", which first reported this. Now, of course, that immediately raised safety concerns, but since then, testing of that titanium material has showed that the correct titanium alloy appears to have been used. And so, at this point, there is no clear threat to safety. Boeing put out a statement saying, \"to ensure compliance, we are removing any affected parts on airplanes prior to delivery. Our analysis shows the in-service fleet can continue to fly safely.\" Airbus put out a statement of their own saying, \"numerous tests have been performed on parts coming from the same source of supply. They show that the A2 20s airworthiness remains intact.\" But the FAA is of course, investigating this now to see if that is the case or if these titanium parts pose any safety hazard.

Of course, you've got to pay some lawyers first, but at the end of the day, some of these families, these victims who suffered through years of hate and harassment because of Alex Jones, they might finally start to see some money. But you mentioned that $1.5 billion -- you know, amount that was owed, that was found to be owed by Alex Jones. He doesn't have anywhere near that much money either, personally or inside his company.

Now, for the moment, he's claiming victory, so, he can't sell that kind of grievance or resentment, but I'm sure he'll find another way to do it soon. And the bottom line here is, this is going to go on in the courts for quite some time. This is one particular ruling about personal assets, now, Jones is going to have to sell his properties.
