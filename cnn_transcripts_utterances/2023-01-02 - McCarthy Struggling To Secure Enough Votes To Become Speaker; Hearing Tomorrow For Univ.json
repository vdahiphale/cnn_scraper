Consider Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, after condemning her antisemitism in May of last year, for the second time in four months, by the way, he is now promising to restore her Committee assignments without any restrictions he says on which ones, and she now says she will support him for Speaker, as is the former President who McCarthy never directly mentioned by name, after taking a week to denounce the dinner he had with the antisemite rapper formerly known as Kanye West, and White supremacist, Nick Fuentes. Then again, that is nothing compared to other efforts to keep the man sweet on him including drumming Liz Cheney out of the party's leadership, and then out of Congress at the former President's behest.

That includes making it easier to topple the sitting Speaker, but his critics are still unmoved. And so, he is continuing the talks today and that includes a meeting in his office not long ago with some of the holdouts including Matt Gaetz, Lauren Boebert, and Scott Perry, and they left the meeting saying it was short, but productive. So it is unclear if McCarthy is going to have to give in to even more of their demands at this point. And meanwhile, he has also been meeting with some of his allies to try to rally support and to try to discuss a floor strategy heading into tomorrow.

Potentially, you could see some horse trading on the floor, some really last minute deals being made.

He has been really frozen because he doesn't want to be seen as having his fingerprints on the dagger, so to speak.

You don't negotiate and give -- make your friends and your allies hold their nose while you try to give concessions.

That's why you have Kevin McCarthy still working as we speak to get those votes to try to potentially offer them more concessions.

But it's still unusual. But in the case of Ted Bundy, he received his Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. And of course, BTK got his bachelor's degree in criminal justice as well. And then the Unabomber, got his PhD in Mathematics. So we do have precedent for it. But it's still, I think, unusual. And the fact that he was located so close to where the victims lived, I think is also interesting and probably goes to personality traits. That's what we look for when we're doing assessments of people is, what is their personality in their regular life, because you bring your personality to the crime scene, and that is what's helpful if we can describe for detectives, this is the personality you're seeing at this murder scene.

So for example, if an offender goes into a scene, and treats the victims as callous, in a cold-blooded way, without any kind of empathy, those are traits that in their everyday life that they are going to have. They're going to be callous, they're going to be -- they will come across as cold blooded without empathy for people.

Instrumental violence is cold blooded, it's without empathy and victims are treated like objects. So the focus of those murders were not to sexually assault or rob, but to make sure that those people were killed. And we do know that there are offenders out there that can be sexually aroused by that kind of murder. We also know that there are people out there who offend, that are -- that become really aroused and satisfied, just by the act of that kind of a violent murder. So while that may not seem like a traditional motive, I think in this case, based on the crime scene, there will be multiple motives. There is never just one motive, multiple motives, but there are offenders that will -- they will tell you, I thought it was the greatest thing in the world when I went into that house or into that building and killed all those people and their emotion, their response to it is part of their motivation.",

So, I'm not critical at all of the police department or the way they handled it. But this is also the cadence of a major case. When you walk into the crime scene, and it's Harry killed Sally, you still have to prove it in Court. But you have a great running start when you have a really good idea who did it. When you walk into a crime scene with four dead people, who are popular kids with no known enemies, no witnesses to the crime, no one who saw the killer and only the forensic evidence and your investigative abilities and profilers, like Mary Ellen O'Toole, to give you offender characteristics and leads, that's a challenge.

Ukraine says hundreds of Russian troops in the occupied Donetsk region who were being housed next to an ammunition cache were killed. Officially, Russia says it lost around 60. For Ukraine, the New Year started the way it ended, with a barrage of incoming Russian missiles and drones, ringing in 2023 with the sound of air raid sirens instead of fireworks. Thousands of Kyiv residents took cover in metro stations. Others defiantly stayed put, shouting, glory to Ukraine from balconies as blast hit the Capitol. In spite of seemingly endless Russian strikes, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, still upbeat in his New Year's speech, underlying the sense of unity among Ukrainians and asking them to recharge and warning Russia that Moscow is fighting a losing battle. They're afraid, you can feel it, and their right to be afraid because they're losing, he says. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin ended 2022 by visiting a military base in southern Russia. He toasted with his forces, awarded the country's highest military honor to its general overseeing Moscow's war in Ukraine, and in his New Year's address said in 2022, Russia laid foundations for its true independence. It was a year of difficult, necessary decisions, he says most important steps towards gaining the full sovereignty of Russia. Last year was brutal for both sides.
