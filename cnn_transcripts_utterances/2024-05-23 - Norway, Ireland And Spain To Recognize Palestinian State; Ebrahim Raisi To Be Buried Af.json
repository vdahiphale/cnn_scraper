Ukraine says it shows the moment a Russian drone hit a police car in Vovchansk on Wednesday killing one officer and wounding another. And it reportedly happened while the city was being evacuated. Vovchansk now looks like a ghost town, you see some of the video there, Ukrainian troops are fighting Russian forces house to house to keep them from advancing. Ukrainian prosecutors say a woman in a wheelchair was shot and killed last week while her husband was trying to help her flee the town. They blame Russian troops and an investigation is underway. Now, many of those evacuating that town are headed to the nearby city of Kharkiv, which took more Russian fire on Wednesday. Ukraine says an airstrike damaged multiple buildings and left four people wounded. A bus driver lost both legs in that attack. Kharkiv is Ukraine's second largest city which lies just south of Russia's main thrust there, their advancement in the north. But there's another crucial town also in the Kremlin's crosshairs, which Ukrainian troops are desperately trying to defend, but they're heavily outgunned.
