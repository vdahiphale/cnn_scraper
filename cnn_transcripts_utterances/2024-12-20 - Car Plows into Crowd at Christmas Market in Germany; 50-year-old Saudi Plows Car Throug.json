For Mike Johnson, had this not come together in the way that it did, he probably would have been out as speaker once that vote was taken somewhere around January the 3rd. But he'll probably be able to hold on because to pick another speaker would lead to days of drama and dissension among Republicans again, just as we have seen in the past few years.

At least twopeople have died and at least 68 people have been hurt. The CCTV video of the incident is too graphic to air. We will however show you some of the images, and I do want to warn you that they are disturbing. They show some people lying on the ground. Others are running from the car in panic, some jumping into the market stalls to avoid it. A local official says that the suspected driver is a Saudi doctor who has been in Germany since 2006. He's believed to have acted alone and is under arrest. Let me bring in my colleague, Richard Quest, who has been following these events. Richard, we haven't shown the video, but it is widely circulating on social media. It is horrific as we learn about these victims, an adult and a toddler. What more are police saying? RICHARD QUEST, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR-AT-LARGE AND CNN ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS:  Well, this was a Christmas market. It was 7:00 in the evening on a Friday night. The Friday before Christmas. So, the place was packed. Absolutely heaving. Not only with people doing last-minute shopping, but just revelers. This is where people go just before Christmas. They -- families, co-workers. And then you have the video of this car on a straight line, goodness knows how fast it must have been, we'll get that number at some point, and it just goes right through the narrow alleyways between the Christmas stalls and people go flying. Now, what we know is that the driver is a 50-year-old Saudi doctor in Germany, as you say, since 2006, now arrested. We don't know any reason for why he did what he did. In other words, was this, in some sense, Islamic militants related or inspired or radicalized, which would seem to be the suggestion from modus operandi of precedent, or something completely different related to Germany's political crisis and the awful situation and chaos in Germany at the moment.

A few things that we believe about the bill, $100 billion goes to disaster relief, $10 billion in aid to farmers.

And something notable is that this attack today took place almost eight years to the day after the 2016 Christmas terrorist attack in Berlin where dozens of people were injured, 13 people were killed, and that attack was perpetrated by a Tunisian national, the attack that ISIS eventually claimed. One thing to remember is that Germany has early elections coming up in February, just a couple months from now. This is after Chancellor Scholz's government fell apart just the day after the U.S. elections in November. And the AfD, the Alternative for Germany, a far-right political party, will no doubt use this terrorist attack to ramp up anti-immigrant and anti- Muslim rhetoric I think in the lead up to the election in February.

So, they're going to be looking at all the picture, the entire picture, his electronic signature, his laptop, his phones, everything will be looked at. His interview. Family members will be interviewed, friends, colleagues, to see where the path of violence commenced. Where did he go off the tracks? He's been residing in Germany since 2006, and he's been a member of the community, a doctor. Where did that all change? Where was it?

HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY), U.S. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  -- the government at levels requested by President Biden in order to meet the needs of the American people in terms of their health, safety, and economic well-being. House Democrats have successfully fought for families, farmers, first responders and the future of working-class Americans. House Democrats have successfully fought for $100 billion in disaster assistance in order to make sure that those everyday Americans whose lives have been turned upside down in terms of hurricane, storms, tornadoes, wildfires, floods and other extreme weather events can get the assistance that they need to address the problems they've been confronting. House Democrats have successfully stopped extreme MAGA Republicans from shutting down the government, crashing the economy, and hurting working- class Americans all across the land. House Democrats have successfully stopped the Billionaire Boys Club, which wanted a $4 trillion blank check by suspending the debt ceiling in order to enable them to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, and cut nutritional assistance while providing massive tax breaks for the wealthy, the well off, and the well connected. This is a victory for the American people. We have successfully advanced the needs of everyday Americans, but there are still things to be worked on. And we look forward to that fight in the new year. Happy Holidays.",

I mean, that's the initial assessment, but of course, they have to take a deeper dive into this person's background. And was there any kind of signaling out there that prompted this person to act that might get more people to act? We've had intelligence services in Britain, France and Germany and the Netherlands just in the last few days, certainly in the last two and a half weeks, focus their attention on the possibility of attacks around Christmas time. There's always a gap right after it with a date of almost equal concern, which is New Year's. We've seen plotting separately from Christmas around New Year's for at least in the last three to four years, not just, by the way, in those countries, but further afield as well. Think of Turkey, think of Italy in the past. So, certainly, law enforcement is looking the propaganda that's been coming out in recent weeks, particularly from Islamic State, but not solely. Is that being a factor driving things right now? And in addition to that, Juliette's absolutely right. We don't know yet, you know what this Saudi tie in the background means, but certainly, it will drive debate. And the one hand, analysts will want to know was there by any chance a Gaza motive in this one, or is this going to cause greater concern about possibly more refugees coming in from Syria because of the news there the last few weeks.",

They have barricades, he said, and he said that, it appears at least from his reporting, that the suspect found the one place in this Christmas market that apparently did not have the barriers. What does that suggest to you in terms of how much preplanning may have gone into this or whether he may at least be a local to this area and had come to this market before casing this event if you might?",

He's from the area or he lives around the area. And so, could have, in previous years, even noted some of the vulnerabilities or gone in the last couple of days. These markets exist for much of December. So, he could have gone on previous days, seeing where a commercial activity maybe comes in and out, where the vendors come in and out and viewed that as a vulnerability and then was just able to penetrate the weakest part of what's already a soft target, even though there was hardening at these Christmas markets, you simply cannot make them impenetrable because of the pedestrian nature of it, the openness, the sort of ins and outs of the stalls, all of it makes for a vulnerable situation that can be made less vulnerable, but certainly, there's always going to be those openings. I do know that throughout Germany now, you know, this isn't just a singular attack, we are a few days from Christmas. All of these markets, if they remain open, because that will be a decision by localities, will increase their security because of just the -- as we were saying, just the worries that this is copycat, that it's related to either the Middle East or Gaza or even something domestic.

This is the scene in the City of Magdeburg about two hours west of Berlin. At least two people are dead. Dozens are hurt. Authorities say that the suspected driver is a doctor from Saudi Arabia who has been living in Germany for almost 20 years. He is now under arrest. I want to now go to Frederik Pleitgen who is on the scene there. Fred, as I understand it, you have just recently gotten there. Give us a sense of the scene and what you're seeing on the ground.",
