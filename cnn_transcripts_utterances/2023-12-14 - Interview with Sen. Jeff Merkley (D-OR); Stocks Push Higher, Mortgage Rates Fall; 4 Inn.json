CNN has learned that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer may let Senators leave the capitol today, but they must return on Monday. Still, this morning, two of the top Republican negotiators, Senator Lindsey Graham and John Thune, said they doubt a deal will be possible before the end of the year. Let's discuss the status of these talks with Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. He's a member of the Foreign Relations Committee as well, we should note. Senator, thanks so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. (CROSSTALK)",

Are you and your colleagues ready to stay until the holiday?SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D-OR): Here's the vision, which is that the team from both sides was working, along with the administration, until three 3:00 a.m. this morning. They decided they had made enough progress that they have a fair chance, a fair chance of hammering out a complete framework over the weekend to have that ready for Monday, not the legislative language but the framework. And that, simultaneously, they will be working on putting the legislative language. It's a very complicated undertaking. The best we can consider is a 50/50 proposition whether we can get this done. But absolutely we are willing to be here. We will lose momentum on this incredibly important legislation if folks will go home for the holidays, and we are not coming back until January 8th. We have to secure this funding for Ukraine.",

If we fail to fund Ukraine, then essentially, those who are opposing it are saying to Vladimir Putin you can take Ukraine.

And just things, like separating children from their parents. Things that are unacceptable. Clearly, we have to work hard to figure out how we can address the surging folks coming to the border.

But understand this. Right now, I am very concerned that we are not at a point where Ukraine can strike that deal, and that Putin is not at a point where he can strike that deal. Putin is saying I can outlast you all, and the signals we are sending to Ukraine is encouraging Putin. In fact, Russia has been putting up media thanking Republican Senators for undermining the Ukrainians.

Now it's not cheap to get a mortgage. Three years ago, mortgage rates were historically low. We may never see sub-3 percent mortgage rates again. But things are starting to move in the right direction. And this trend could continue because the Fed is preparing to start cutting interest rates, perhaps as soon as March. Renters are also starting to catch a little bit of a break. The median asking rent fell by 2 percent year over year in November. That is the biggest drop since 2020, being driven by a building boom that is starting to increase vacancies. So that means, for all you renters out there, you may finally start to have a little more bargaining power with your landlords. And that, of course, is good news of course.",

When someone is at the scene of the crime, police want to know what they saw. But there's danger when police focus on just one witness statement, and perhaps exclude other evidence, which is what prosecutors say happened in these cases. In one case announced yesterday, a man named Miguel Solorio had been in prison for 25 years. When authorities say it was a botched photo lineup that led to authorities arresting the wrong person. In the second case, a man who was 14 at the time, Giovanni Hernandez, he told police he was nowhere near the scene of the crime, but a witness said they thought they saw him there. The prosecutors actually brought in the FBI that did a forensic examination of this phone and determined he wasn't there. His phone and him were both at home, which is what he claimed all along. So that just goes to show you how this witness testimony can be so flawed. Now both men, along with their advocates, spoke yesterday describing what this ordeal has been like. Have a listen.
