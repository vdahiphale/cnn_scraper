That was one juror from earlier today. And a second juror was asked questions in that questionnaire, about a 42-page question document. One of them, question 19, is the one at issue here. And the question was whether you had ever or somebody you knew and your family had -- have been arrested, are involved in allegations of criminal activity before. He apparently answered that he had not. They then later discovered through the D.A.'s office that, in fact, he had been arrested at one point in time for tearing down some sort of political posters over the course of the '90s. And that was another woman that the judge said that was enough to have this person excused. It underscores the point of how seriously this court is taking credibility and truthfulness at this stage to give a fair opportunity for the defense and the prosecution to determine who can really be impartial in their case.",

Obviously, Jesse Watters or support Donald Trump's statement on Truth Social.And it's important to note that the whole voir dire process is aimed at trying to determine impartiality. So the process of vetting in voir dire, you are going to have information revealed that would lend to suggest that there is some bias or otherwise. And so the voir dire process is focused on doing just this very thing of trying to understand who can truly set their opinions aside and who cannot. Again, today, over half for the 90 that the came in the courtroom, who was asked to raise their hand if they felt they could not be impartial and they truthfully answered and over half were dismissed. Now, the gag order is set to be heard on this coming Tuesday, which, ironically, some thought might be the day two after opening statements on Monday. But given the pace of things, it might not actually come to fruition. Either way, the judge has made it very clear that he does not either want a juror to be intimidated, witnesses to be interfered with or intimidated, and that you cannot make a statement or cause somebody else to make a statement that would have that similar effect. The question before this judge, at the very least, is going to be, is the quoting of somebody who has made such a statement sufficient to say that he himself has made the statement? You can't use -- you can't sort of hide behind, oh, I used quotation marks or air quotes here on a Truth Social post so say that you did not defy the gag order. And the judge has a lot of things under his purview to decide what to do about it, if he does by him that he does, in fact, and has, in fact, defied the gag order, including fines and even what's called stepping back a criminal defendant, to the jail pending their compliance.",

And they went inside the school campus where were told there are a couple of hundred people gathered inside there.You can see some of them. Let me show you. Come this way. Frank. Let's just show them inside. This is inside the campus. We can't get inside. Security is not allowing us inside. But if you look just through these gates, you can see there are people gathered there in the center square of the campus. And that's where all of this started. It's in that area, the pro-Palestine protesters had gathered. They had set up tents. They were encampments setup. And essentially, something happened in the university president issued an order for them to disperse. And that is when the NYPD came in and made up to at least 30 arrests. We're told those that were arrested have now been taken away to be processed. There's a few folks now that have gathered outside here. It's unclear if they're students or if they've just supporters of the students. Buth this is what we're seeing out here now. The other thing, Boris, that I want to show you, this usually doesn't -- this isn't an everyday thing here at Columbia. I've gone through this campus. It's usually open. You can usually walk through the campus. And in the last several days, they've set up security out here. It's just been a very tense time for many campuses across the country. And so there is stepped up security like this at many of the campuses. We did speak to a student of the school whose friends were arrested. She has a lot of concern over what she's seeing here. And she told me that it is very triggering to see this kind of response from the school towards her fellow students and our friends. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That would be the highest level this year.That's based on the betting that the Fed is likely to delay cutting interest rates to make sure inflation cools down first. For more on this, let's bring in CNN business reporter, Matt Egan. Matt, it goes without saying this makes things even more expensive for Americans who are hoping to buy a home.",

Mortgage rates topping 7 percent for the first time since December.Rates are now about twice as high as they were at this time four years ago. And rates are creeping up again because of these concerns about inflation. And the fact that it does increasingly look like the Fed's interest rate cuts have been delayed, right? We hoped that it would maybe be a march story. That didn't happen. Then maybe June. Now, and increasingly, it looks like a July story or maybe even September or could be later until the Fed is able to lower interest rates. And remember, the higher rates go, the less home that people can afford. These bigger mortgage payments, they're not going to get you another bedroom or a bigger garage. They're really just going to cover the cost of interest. And this, of course, is not just an issue about mortgage rates. It's really a one-two punch between borrowing costs and home prices. And we also learned today that the median price of an existing home increased another five percent in March, topping $393,000. This is the ninth straight month of annual price increases. And this is the highest price ever recorded in March. Now, this, of course, cuts both ways, right? Because if you already own your home, the fact that home prices are up is boosting your net worth. But, Jessica, we know there's a lot of Americans out there who are on the outside looking in there and want to buy, but they can't.",
