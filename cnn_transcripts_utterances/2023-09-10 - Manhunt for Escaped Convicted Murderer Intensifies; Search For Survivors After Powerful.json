The keys were left in it, according to authorities. He then went on a drive, about 22, 23 miles north of that dairy farm, eventually making his way to the house of a former colleague of his, that house near Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. That's where that ring camera video is from showing him wearing a hoodie. And Paula, when you look at that video, he looks in fairly good spirits, especially when you consider that this is somebody who has been on the run for well over a week and a half. Eventually, though, throughout the night, he begins -- he resumes his drive, in this case heading west. And that is where authorities say he literally ran out of gas. So that's where the big search is concentrated right now. I want you to hear from Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens, as he addressed some criticism and many questions right now about how this man was able to slip past hundreds of law enforcement personnel.

We know that last night he showed up at actually two former associates' residents, the first one where he was caught on the doorbell camera. And then a second location where he knocked on the door in Phoenixville, and the person who was inside the residence called a friend who came over and reported it to the police.So he is looking for the things he needs. As the chief said, he needs money. He needs access to transportation. He could probably use a communications device of some sort, at least to be able to track the news media coverage of his manhunt and possibly reach out to other associates. He managed to go about, you know, 20, 10, another 13 or so miles west before he ran out of gas in that van. So you can expect that having made some progress with a stolen vehicle, he will probably try to get his hands on another one. When he decides -- when he gets desperate enough to interact with a person who has a car to try to take that from them, either at, you know, knife point or out of threat or something like that, that's when things could get really dangerous.",

It was magical.I played six seasons in Buffalo and they were some of the best years of my life. My sixth year in the league, I was playing linebacker for the Bills, and we were playing the Jacksonville Jaguars. And this huge man put his huge helmet right on top of mine and I felt my arm going numb, and I would eventually need a titanium plate and four screws put in my neck and I thought my career was over. I think about the hits that I've taken, the injuries I've had and I worry about my future and I lose my keys and I'm wondering is that because I had too many hits in the head. Everyone loses their keys. Football is always going to be a violent game and it is not for everybody. But I think we'd be foolish if we didn't do our best to make the game as safe as it could possibly be. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

All 50 states now, Paula, have concussion protocols following the NFL's lead, and I would urge parents all across the country to make sure your coaches and your schools are being vigilant about having the best equipment, having those protocols in place to keep your kids safe.
