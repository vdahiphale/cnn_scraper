Thanks for tuning in to this hour where we bring you \"Tomorrow's News Tonight.\" But there is a big story tonight to bring you, and that is the expected surge at the border as the Trump era policy used to quickly turn away some migrants is set to expire in less than an hour.We have our great lineup of reporters with me tonight. We have Polo Sandoval, Athena Jones, Shimon Prokupecz, and Eva McKend. Ed Lavandera is also standing by for us live in El Paso, Texas where this is happening. So, in less than hour, that Trump era policy that quickly turned away migrants is going to expire. Thousands of men and women and children are waiting just across the border and federal officials are bracing. Paulo, what can we expect in the next hour and coming hours?",

There are about 10,000 apprehensions in the last 48 hours, and that is really what is straining authorities, as you will hear from the ground in a few moments. But I think that what we will talk about in a few moments also is really the impact on what will happen in cities beyond the border. Right?

I don't think that is the way this is going to unfold.And as Polo has mentioned, you've already started seeing that surge in the days leading up to -- I think the numbers in the last few days have been 10,000 apprehensions per day, which is record-setting. But the Biden administration has been saying for several months that the numbers of people crossing after this is lifted could be anywhere from 15,000 to 18,000 per day. The border patrol chief kind of starting to walk that back and perhaps not convinced that that is not what we are going to see. But, you know, there are a number of people stuck right now between the Rio Grande and the border fence. It's important for people to know that the border wall that you see, especially here in Texas, does not actually sit on the international borderline. It's a distance away. The international borderline goes through the middle of the Rio Grande. So, you can't build the wall there. So, there is this kind of what's known as \"no man's land,\" and that's where many of the migrants have been able to arrive and wait there behind the border wall as they wait to get processed. There have been about 2,500 or so in the last 48 hours, and they're trying to process a lot of those people. [23:05:04] But the real question will be what happens to the people who have been sitting and waiting on the Mexican side of the border for months and months, and what decisions are they going to make now that all of this is going to change here so dramatically in about an hour.",

You can still come between ports of entry, but that becomes a little bit more complicated situationI think one of the things to actually look for, and it's really important for people to understand this, since this policy has been in place for the last several years, you have this phenomenon where people cross the border between ports of entry, so that is an illegal crossing, but they immediately turn themselves in to border patrol agents. So, it has been kind of like this organized chaos. If you've spent any time in these border areas, you see mass groups of people, they simply just turn themselves in. I think in the coming weeks, you are going to see -- I've been starting to see signs of this, where if the process becomes too difficult to get in, we are going to start seeing those numbers of people who are trying to evade arrest and trying to get away from border patrol agents. I think those numbers are going to start ticking up rather quickly. That's something that we will be watching.",

This is something that is so important in our coverage.Many of these are Venezuelans. Many of these lack the social ties. And this is why once they make it here to New York City, they don't have a couch to crash on, right? They don't have family or friends that would take them in. And that is why we see -- when you look at the numbers, Alisyn, we followed this for a really long time, these numbers of total asylum seekers that have been processed by New York City officials are over 60, 000, approaching 65,000. Out of those, nearly 40,000 are still currently in the cities care. And this is the next part of the story here. If we continue to see asylum seekers instead of about 200 a day up to a thousand a day, you are looking at just tens of thousands of people in New York with the inability to work. And this is why -- what I'm hearing from my sources at the city level. They have been urging President Biden with a stroke of the pen, which we all know is not that easy, to annex some sort of executive action that could allow many of these asylum seekers to get to work. I spent some time on Monday in Queens, New York, in a work center that brings in many of these asylum seekers and gives them orientation. Thirty-two of them that were sitting in front of me, I asked them, what is your main priority? And everybody said, we just want to work on the books.",

So, yes, they can be there, sort of -- as one person there described it to me, he said, you can put them on ice for four months, but what happens beyond that, because we just discussed, the asylum process takes years. And so, this is why this is all playing out. It really has become a back and forth between Eric Adams and some of these -- I should note, of course, Republican county leaders.

And that is something that the state officials and the local sheriffs are all very much concerned about, you know, because what happens is, they say, many of these migrants wind up on private property, ranchers and hunters who have large acres of property. One of the officials says, you know, you have situations where they start knocking on people's doors in the middle of the night looking for help, wanting water, wanting food.

These would be migrants that would be allowed to be released into the United States without the necessary paperwork but with some conditions.The Department of Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this will only apply on a case by case basis to a fraction of migrants. Nevertheless, it was intended to help alleviate the pressure on U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities that are processing thousands and thousands of migrants, which right now stands at about 28,000 migrants. We are really stretching capacity here. The federal judge in Florida has temporarily blocked the use of these parole program by the Biden administration. How this is going to affect the processing of migrants here in the coming days is not exactly clear, but it's clearly a tool that the Biden administration was hoping to help alleviate this strain and the pressure on Customs and Border Protection officials here on the front lines. Here tonight, it's relatively quiet. I was just speaking with colleagues on the Mexican side of the border from El Paso. They say it's very quiet. The large group of migrants that have been waiting to be processed, the number of those people have dwindled down. As we reported throughout the evening, we weren't really expecting this massive rush of people rushing to the border when the clock struck midnight Eastern time.
