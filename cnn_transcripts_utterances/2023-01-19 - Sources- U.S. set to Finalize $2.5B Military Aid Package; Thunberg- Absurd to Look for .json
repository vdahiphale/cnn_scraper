      "sentences": "A warm welcome as always to \"First Move\", I'm Julia Chatterley coming to you live once again from Davos inSwitzerland and the World Economic Forum today's show scaling mountainous new heights. Let's call it an Alpine piece de resistance as we discussed the ongoing quest for global energy security without compromising sustainability that's the key. And China's reopening and hopes for Asian markets profitability, also the rise of artificial intelligence, chat ability. All of the important issues being discussed at this year's Davos is the rise and quick adoption of sophisticated AI search and information tools like the chat GPT bot, developed by the firm open AI and their power, of course too, to change society. This is one chat lib both excited, but also concerned about the ethics of all of this as well of course a little bit about being replaced perhaps one day soon. The rise of AI and society's reply, just one the number of tech trends. We'll be discussing this hour with Brad Smith, the President of Microsoft; his company was an early investor in open AI and is reportedly in talks to up its stake. Now amidst the futuristic fanfare tech is going through a painful post lockdown adjustment too. Microsoft just one of many of the growing numbers of firms across the sector announcing sweeping layoffs this year. Microsoft warning that customers are pulling back spending and with the recession fears we've all been talking about so much here this week in Davos short term spending cuts however, cannot be a reason to slide on those climate promises. Greta Thunberg and other young climate activists in Davos today had big oil firmly in their sights, blasting the international community to for not doing more to cut fossil fuel usage during a panel discussion with Fatih Birol the Head of the International Energy Agency. And he will be joining us shortly to discuss that and more. And another key theme to China and the investment opportunities tied to its big post lockdown \"Reopening\". Chinese listed firms having a great 2023 so far with the HANG SENG up almost 10 percent. I'll be discussing what's ahead for the investment in the region with the CEO of the Hong Kong stock exchange operator HKEX. And here's the global picture now weakness across the board. The European Central Bank had Christine Lagarde in Davos today to adding her voice to those who believe the economic trends across Europe in particular are improving overall. Though, of course, the wild card remains energy prices and the devastating war in Ukraine and that's where we begin today's show. The United States is set to finalize a $2.5 billion military aid package to Ukraine. Sources tell CNN for the first time, it will include a shipment of Stryker combat vehicles. What it won't contain, however, other tanks all long range missiles, Kyiv has been desperately asking for. Instead, the pressure is on Germany to provide tanks with its lap and battle tanks being seen as the most suitable option. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So she's stepping down it leaves her party in a bit of a lurch for elections, which are now scheduled to take place in October because she is the biggest star of her party and she and the party are sagging in the polls have been for some time now. And that also may have contributed to this decision. You know, that's some of the analysis that we're hearing from people who watch politics in New Zealand. Yes, she's been through some huge hurdles. I mean, I remember personally covering the Christchurch terrorist massacre of 2019, when a racist attacked two mosques in Christchurch and killed more than 50 people. And she stepped in and helped heal her country and also pass restrictions on firearms in very quick time. And then going through the COVID 19 pandemic, but it is some of those measures certainly linked to COVID that have hit her politically at home.
