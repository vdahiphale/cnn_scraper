But this is not really Reznikov's failure per se. It's more a failure of the West in the sense of being overcautious in supplying Ukraine with those critical capabilities.

Their counter-offensive was delay because of a slow response by the West to supplying the types of capabilities that they would need, such as the tanks and the oven fighting vehicles.So they're now battling against the clock. They're advancing south towards Melitopol from Tokmak. Tokmak is the next big target for the offensive if the Ukrainians can break through the Russian lines there and they have indicated they're broken through that first line of defense. They can then bombard Tokmak, or at least the Russian forces around Tokmak and make Tokmak unusable as a resupply area. And that makes it virtually impossible for the Russians to hang on to Crimea. It sets them up for an advanced deeper into Crimea via Melitopol in the spring of 2024, but they would certainly have to hunker down during the rains and winter period of '23, '24.",

They're advancing on a wide front.But they are making gains. They've apparently pushed through the Russian first line of defense. They're now advancing potentially further than that. But we still have yet to see how tough those defenses are behind that first line of defense, and whether the Ukrainians can widen that breech sufficiently to pour through heavier forces like armored fighting vehicles, and main battle tanks. If they can, then they certainly can make rapid advances before the winter, essentially deny the supply lines for the Russian forces in Crimea, and then establish a good position from which they can poise to advance into Crimea in the northern spring of 2024. Obviously, the Russians will try and defend that as much as they can. But there is some question about just what is the quality of Russian troops behind that first line of defense, and I think it will be critical to see just how effective that Russian defense is.",

And then schools, yes, schools do have to play a role. But again, I mean, in the schools that I've kind of been in touch with, and that I've spoken to, even schools have significant trouble kind of controlling that element of screen time. So I'm -- there's all sorts of things that are brought about by kind of the use of social media and children being engaged with that in ways that maybe they shouldn't, OK, within the schools sort of environment sometimes. And so that's another problem. In terms of government, the Chinese government is actually doing something that I don't think many other governments have attended so far, which is a centralized system, or centralized policy, where we have to remember why is something like this important, right or wrong. It's because as a parent, sometimes you don't know how to control this stuff. You don't know how to help your child, right? Or you don't know how to stop them for having too much screen time. Now, if it comes from government, you have a central portal of information. There is at least a national policy that, right. Whether you implement it or not, is up to you. But there is something there, right. So if the government doesn't do it, then it's again down to the parent. Now, if as a parent, when I go on to an app store and try to look for parental control apps, the list goes on forever. Which one of those should I use? Right. Now, I've been through this myself, right? You pick any one that you think is good, you spend half an hour or an hour setting the system up. And then eventually you find that it doesn't quite work in the way that you want it to. Right. So it's a whole minefield out there. Does government solve the problem? No, I don't think government can solve the problem. Because there's so many technologies involved. There's so many sort of factors involved in how you actually implement this.",

Participants are putting particular focus on drought and other weather-related developments, the changing climate's escalating impact on migration, and ways to fund climate mitigation initiatives in countries saddled with debt.

The latest reports from the IPC says that Africa is actually the continent warming fastest on earth, faster than any other continent. We have a number of countries on the continent already reporting more than one degree Celsius on average of temperature increase. And that has led to multiple impacts. But you know, not being an economic powerhouse on the continent or on the planet, obviously, that is oftentimes not seen. And then thirdly, I would say the big challenge for us in Africa is therefore not as emitter but as the most vulnerable means that our challenges are really around adaptation and responding to the loss and damage happening across the continent.

What does this mean for people? As a culture, food is the mainstay of the economy in Africa. Half of all jobs and livelihoods, a third of the economy.
