This is an over 30-point advantage with Trump getting a majority of the vote.And I want to put this in historic context for you, just how large Trump's lead is. These are folks who polled at 45 percent or greater in Iowa at this point, all before Trump won the caucuses. Mondale in 84 Bush in 2000, Gore in 2000, Hillary Clinton 2016, and now we see Trump at 2024. I would note, in fact, Trump is the only one to actually be at greater than 50 percent of the vote.

Based on how you have kind of thought through this over the course of the last several months, when you saw the appeal last night and what was actually in it, do you think it's an effective one?TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, PARTNER, SELENDY GAY ELSBERG:  I think what's effective about the appeal is that there are a lot of potential offramps for the Supreme Court. I think that's what benefits the former president. The court can get rid of this case without necessarily getting to the core merits that all we want to see them talk about. The court could say that the former president is not an officer. That doesn't get to the insurrection question. The court could find that there was process issues with the state court. The court could find all kinds of things that don't really get to the core of did President Trump engage in an insurrection. So I think that's a benefit for the former president. He just needs one. It could be procedural. It could be less than substantive. And I think that's the most likely way the court actually deals with this. I don't expect the Supreme Court to issue a wide ruling, opinion to get to the substance, really get to the meat of this. So I think that's why if you are going to call it effective, it's that, is that it gives the court lots of options out.",

They are not fact finders. And B, they don't need to because really what they're being asked to pass judgment on here is, was this process as prescribed in the Constitution, was this process fair and adequate? And then, of course, there's the is the president an officer point of view. And Temidayo is right, all Donald Trump has to do is win one of these arguments and he has got it. The challengers have to win them all. So I think the Supreme Court is very, very, very likely to take this case, virtually certain. If I think, if I had to guess, I think Trump is going to prevail.",

It may be unsatisfying to people. It's possible the Supreme Court says that's all Congress has done, and, therefore, the only way to be disqualified under the 14th Amendment is to be charged and convicted of insurrection.To the larger point, we will ever get definitive word was this insurrection or not. The place that will be litigated is in the criminal courts ultimately with Jack Smith's case and perhaps the Fulton County D.A.'s case, and we'll have a full airing of the issues.

And they see movement from Democrats towards their side on this issue. You have even pretty liberal Democrats, like Senator John Fetterman, from the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, saying wanting to have a strong border is not xenophobic. You see Democrats in negotiations willing to make concessions on tightening asylum policy, making it easier to deport individuals who have come into this country illegally. They feel like they have a winning issue. The question is, how far are they willing to push it? Do they need to get 100 percent of what they want in order to declare victory? Or will they be happy with seventy- five, eighty percent? I've been in this town for a long time and I can tell you that I have seen House Republicans for year after year, whether the immigration reform measures are being pushed by President Bush or President Obama, House Republicans tend to demand perfection in terms of what they think an immigration bill should be, and at least historically, they would rather have nothing than 80 percent of what they want.",
