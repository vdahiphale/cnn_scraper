In Martinique, powerful crashing waves, people walking through flooded streets as we obviously -- look how that water is rushing though. We know so far, at least three deaths have been attributed to the storm.And this morning, dozens of passengers are recovering after a terrifying incident on board an overseas flight. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was bound for Uruguay from Madrid when it was rocked by severe turbulence, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Brazil. At least 30 passengers reportedly suffered injuries, including fractured limbs and faces. Take a listen to what some of the people -- some of the passengers had to say about those moments on board. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVAN, PASSENGER (through translator):  From one moment to the next, the plane destabilized and went into a dive. The people who didn't have seatbelts went up in the air and hit the ceiling, and they got hurt. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  It was a pretty horrible feeling. We thought we were going to die there, but thank God it didn't happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I feel like this is becoming more common, either that or we're hearing about it more. What causes this kind of such severe turbulence?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST:  Well, thank you, Erica. It is. It seems to be happening more, doesn't it? And there's some scientific consideration of the fact that the turbulence caused by climate change may be a factor. But let me tell you what causes it. The aircraft, this 787 model, as it's flying along, it's getting, you know, a high river of wind underneath the wings like this. If there's a sudden change in direction, that reduces the lift on the wings, and it drops very suddenly, very precipitously, and anything that is not attached to the aircraft itself is going to fly up, as we saw. And we saw one individual, one person, literally stuffed into the overhead bin, and they had to pull him out of there. So, I thought it was quite telling, the passenger saying, those without seatbelts on got hurt, those who didn't, not so much. And that's an important point for all of us to consider here.",

      "sentences": "Yes. To remember that it means something when they say, please buckle your seatbelt when you're not up and about my cabin. I think it also -- for a lot of people, it raises the question of, OK, so this is turbulent. Sometimes the pilot will get on and say, oh, there's going to be some turbulence, just a little bit of a warning. Everybody gets your seats and buckle your seat belts.Is there less of a warning? Is there more of a piloting issue? Because in a lot of these instances, it seems so sudden. O'BRIEN:  Yes, it's strangely, oddly, perhaps surprisingly not a high- tech operation. When you're at altitude in an airliner like a 787, particularly when you're crossing the ocean, you have no capability on board the flight deck to see turbulence per se. You can see overall weather patterns before you take off, the rivers of air we call jet streams, that sort of thing. And you can make large-scale predictions and how to avoid it in your route. However, as you're flying along, you're literally relying on the aircraft ahead of you to tell you, there's turbulence here, you might want to be ready. And that's why that seatbelt sign goes on often. It's the so-called -- we call them PIREPs, pilot reports. And that's fine. And that can get people buckled up, hopefully. But it's still hard to predict these more sudden precipitous cases of either wind current changes, abrupt changes, which cause these sudden and quick falls, which can be so hazardous. And so, really, you should err on the side of caution and stay buckled while you're in that seat.",

Do you know why? Because they also saw the debate on Thursday, but instead of focusing on how Joe Biden said things, they focused on what he said, and they focused on what Donald Trump said. And what Donald Trump said was incredibly offensive, dangerous, terrifying. And I understand why Shermichael does not want Republicans -- and Republicans don't want Donald Trump to focus on the immunity Supreme Court decision because it underscores just how much of an imperial presidency Donald Trump would impose upon all us, and he's made no secret about it. And it is terrifying to Latinos, to black voters, to women, to young people, to LGBTQ community, to every single coalition that is going to support Joe Biden to ensure that Donald Trump is not the massive existential threat to our democracy, that he is even more so now because of the Supreme Court decision.",

I think the issue for Democrats, however, is that the president isn't able to make that argument because the focus really is on whether or not he's mentally and physically capable of not only continuing to lead presently, but for an additional four years.Why haven't we seen the president go before reporters for 30 minutes, an hour? It's been five days. We still haven't seen the president sit down for a live interview, perhaps not with a friendly journalist, but maybe someone who's going to really challenge him. We haven't seen those things. And so, I think in the mind of many voters, as we continue to see the polling leak out over the next couple of days and weeks, will indicate that the numbers have only gotten worse for the current president.
