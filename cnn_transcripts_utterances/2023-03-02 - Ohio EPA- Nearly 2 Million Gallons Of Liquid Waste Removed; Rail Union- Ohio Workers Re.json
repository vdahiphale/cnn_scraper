Now, the same day, the Teamsters sent a letter to the secretary and governor of Ohio. They say that Norfolk Southern put its workers at risk by not providing protective equipment. Days after the derailment, several railroad workers experienced experiencing symptoms. CNN has reached out to Norfolk Southern for comment on that letter. For now, let's talk to Tony Cardwell. He's the general president of the union Brotherhood of Maintenance of Ways Employees Division. Tony, thank you for your time. First, talk to me about these symptoms. Are your members experiencing them? And what are they?",

They were put on scene shortly after the derailment, and have been working on the scene for quite a while after, fixing and repairing the track. That's what our members do, they fix and repair and rebuild track. Ultimately, they were put on the scene. And were not provided, or we are being told they were not provided the properly personal protective equipment. They were working out there in street clothes, leather boots and leather shoes. And obviously, those aren't appropriate barriers for the contaminants on the ground.",

They said they were going to investigate the matter.They did seem concerned and seemed that they wanted to figure out if there really was -- if what we were saying was true. They should have already known this. They didn't deny what happened, what we said happened was reported not by one, not by two, but 30 or 40 members that told us this is what was going on. The reports that we provided to them, they simply stated they were going to review them and go out to the scene and talk to the folks. I don't think that's been done. I would hope they would do this in a more timely manner. It's important that our members are protected. And I do believe they were exposed in a way they shouldn't have been. We asked for them, you know, to be taken offsite. And they told us that they weren't working at that time. This is two days ago. We were told they weren't working at that time onsite. And they were told they wouldn't bring them back to work onsite until they could provide the proper PPE. Obviously, there needs to be a lot of testing and a lot of assurance given to them that there isn't permanent damage done. Unfortunately, I believe, that, you know, what had happened was there's going to be a problem for these folks for a while. And I hope that we can do whatever we can to get it corrected. Norfolk Southern has to be more responsible for when our employees are in an unsafe work condition like this. It's just totally unacceptable. [14:40:03] BLACKWELL: Yes. I understand that you were one of the union heads that met with Secretary Buttigieg, calling for more protections. Tell me about the meeting. What are you asking for? What was his response to this?",

First of all, it was a historic meeting, where we were able -- in fact, I don't think it's ever happened before, where we've had the opportunity to express our concerns.You know, we obviously represent the folks on the ground. They know the most about these issues. And they have the most experience and knowledge on how to correct these issues. So we are echoing our members' sentiments. And Secretary Buttigieg was extremely courteous. And I believe that he was going to take these things serious. He assured us that he's going to look into these different issues and he has been working on these issues. And it seems as though we're going to get some results out of his staff, his team, in the White House. And it's exciting to be working with folks that are willing to work with us to be reformed to the industry that obviously needs it. We've been warning of this for years and years, and warning that the railroad's trend, precision scaling and operating system needed to be corrected. It's unsafe for the communities, it's unsafe for our workers, and it's not good for the customers either. Right now, you hear the customers complaining at all-time highs, and they're extremely frustrated with the carriers, the railroad carriers and their operating system. And it's come to fruition. Unfortunately, it caused damage. Put a community, you know, in an unsafe situation. And it's our hope that the reform comes swift and comes quickly and the industry changes so that, you know, it's a safe place to work and it's, more importantly, safe for the communities that they operate within.",

I think, Victor and Bianna, what we really have to and get our audience to understand is the chaos that these incidents are engendering. We were able to speak to one student who had been caught up in an incident inside of her school. Take a listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED SCHOOLGIRL (through translation) (voice-over): It was a terrible situation. Girls had been falling on the floor and were crying. Some were unable to walk. Really didn't want to leave one another. (END VIDEO CLIP) ELBAGIR: We could absolutely hear the fear in the voices of the students we were speaking to. And in the voices of the parents. And the real heartbreak here is, within the framework of the limited freedoms that girls and women have in Iran, the right to school and right to education was the one that so many were holding onto. Around whether or not these attacks are linked to an attempt to force girls out of schools, the practical reality is that many parents are now keeping their daughter's home. Because they are terrified what could happen if these incidents continue -- Victor and Bianna?",

The same is true when you look through federal election filings. By contrast, Santos' first treasurer, Nancy Marks, was a treasurer for dozens of campaigns. So he doesn't have that footprint we're used to seeing. We also spoke with the Republican Party out in Nassau County, where part of George Santos' district is. They said they had never heard of this person who was appointed the new treasurer. In addition, on the forms, all it gives you is his name, email address and physical address. So we went to the physical address. It's a mixed-use building, mostly residential apartments. It happens to be where George Santos' sister, Tiffany, had lived up until January when she left after a dispute over unpaid rent. So no one has been living in that apartment connected to Santos for at least a month but that is the address that is on this form. You know, we asked campaign finance experts about this. And one of them that we spoke to, from the Citizens for Responsibility in Washington, said I've never seen this before, having a complete mystery as a treasurer for a sitting member of Congress. Usually, the person that's the treasurer, there's some familiarity at least within the party or on some committees. And in this case, no one seems to know where he is.",
