Now they feel Ukraine really does need it on the battlefield because they are running low on ammunition. President Biden said that in an interview with our Fareed Zakaria earlier.

      "sentences": "I don't think it's ready for membership in NATO. But here's the deal, I spent, as you know, a great deal of time trying to hold NATO together, because I believe Putin has had an overwhelming objective from the time he launched 185,000 troops in Ukraine, and that was to break NATO. He was confident, in my view, and many of the intelligence community, he was confident he could break NATO. So holding NATO together is really critical.I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family moment in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that, then mean what I say, we're determined to commit inch of territory that is NATO territory. It's a commitment that we've all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we're all in the war. We're in war with Russia if that were the case. So I think we have to lay out a path for the rational path for Russia -- excuse me, for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into NATO. And we have -- when the very first time I met with Putin two years ago in Geneva and he said I want commitments on no Ukraine and NATO, I said, we're not going to do that because it's an open door policy. We're not going to shut anybody out. NATO is a process that takes some time to meet all the qualifications and from democratization to a whole range of other issues. So in the meantime, though, I've spoken with Zelenskyy at length about this, and one of the things I indicated is the United States would be ready to provide while the process was going on, and it's going to take a while that process was going on to provide security, Allah, the security we provide for Israel, providing the weaponry, the need, the capacity to defend themselves, if there is an agreement, if there is a ceasefire, if there is a peace agreement. And so I think we can work it out. But I think it's premature to say to call for a vote, you know, in now because there's other qualifications that need to be met, including democratization and some of those issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, there is a process, it does take time, but I do think the administration should be more forward leaning in pushing for Ukraine's acceptance into NATO. I think at the end of the day here, the President is right insofar as Russia and Vladimir Putin certainly thought that they could break NATO, that we would not be unified with our allies in response to their illegal war and invasion of Ukraine. We have been unified, we need to continue to be unified, and we need to ensure that Ukraine is able to defend its sovereignty.

And so I think the counter offensive is critical, and we're at a critical stage in this war and for Ukraine's ability to defend itself. And so I think getting them as much ammunition and weaponry as possible is critically important.I think there's two key points to note. Number one, obviously we are not party to any agreement on the use of cluster munitions. But in addition to that, these would be used by Ukraine in defense of its sovereignty in its own borders, as opposed to, you know, bombing outside of its borders. And I think that is a distinction that is important to note. They are trying to defend their sovereignty, and they are at war with Russia and the Russian military and its forces. So, I think in this instance, given what the use is intended for, given the limited, you know, chance of it impacting civilian casualties, I do think it is the right decision and I think -- and I support what the administration is trying to do here.",

That is not how Ron DeSantis comes across on the campaign trail.He has been effective in his state on executing policy, but that does not make you effective at retail politics. So that is ultimately the challenge. And by running to the right of Trump, these billionaires who have initially funded him as opposed to Trump's small donors, they're also starting to wonder, can DeSantis actually make this work? Can he -- not just Iowa, can he turn out Nevada and Wisconsin, South Carolina? Those are the states that are going to matter far more than any national polling numbers.",

I will mention that yesterday there was a shark sighting just off the coast here that prompted lifeguards to get people out of the water for a few moments, just to allow that shark to head out to sea without incident.And to answer that other question, well, I think these pictures will tell you just about everything you need to know whether it's on purpose or not, most folks here are adhering to the recommendations, which is you're going to get in the water, which they encourage you to do. Simply stay close to the shore and stay close together. Now, in terms of what officials are doing, we heard from New York Governor Kathy Hochul today announcing that she plans to deploy not only drones, but also offer equipment as well to some of those municipalities along New York's coastline. So they have the ability to actually surveil the situation just off the coast here. In fact, that's how they were able to pick up some video on Tuesday, which at the time officials here had assumed that they were small sand sharks. We later found out just yesterday, in fact, it was a school of fish. So this certainly gives them sort of eyes not only on the ground, but on the water as well. But in terms of what we've seen today, really no major incident. It was about five separate incidents that took place on Monday and Tuesday, basically around the 4th of July weekend that resulted in five non-life threatening injuries. Officials believe that sharks were involved here, though we should say that neither the victims or anybody around there could actually confirm that there were sharks, but that's what officials are saying. But it really does kind of paint a picture of what will be a very busy summer beach season, even long after the 4th of July holiday. People are going to continue obviously getting in the water. And officials certainly not discouraging people to do that, simply to stay aware and of course, reminding folks that every year more people die from lightning incidents than shark incidents.",

Their only option surgery that did not leave their child intact so they couldn't hold her. H. MABERRY: Now we're grieving pictures. We're grieving footprints. We're grieving on a teddy bear.
