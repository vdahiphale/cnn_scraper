Minutes from now the president is going to meet with leaders from NATO's eastern flank here on Warsaw. These are the allies who are on Russia's doorstep. Some of them share a border. They have raised concerns that Putin could potentially attack them next.This meeting comes after President Biden delivered a powerful and forceful speech on the world stage last night. He made a solemn vow that Russia will lose and Ukraine will prevail with continued support from the United States and the west. CNN's chief White House correspondent Bill Mattingly was there as the president was delivering the speech. You were there a year ago, but today, the message today is just as important as what he has been saying since Kyiv and yesterday as he was meeting President Duda, to these leaders as well, because they're just as concerned.",

I think that's a critical point here.The support is still fairly widespread. Most importantly the support includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, all of the key committee chairs, and that's very important here. However, they are going to need 218 votes in the House to get anything passed. And so I think part of what you are seeing from the president, this is a trip that has multiple audiences, whether it's President Putin, she.. it's the European leaders, particularly those in the eastern flank, whether it's the Ukrainian people, it's also the American people, because they believe that the American public is still largely behind this effort, understands the stakes, and that will drive where lawmakers go. But what they are most concerned about is that the kind of small group that has been very vocal, particularly on social media, about their disdain for the assistance to Ukraine up to this point starts to grow. I don't think it has yet, but they're aware that it's a possibility, and that's why moments like this are critical.",
