Security Council, signed off and supported by the G7, closing this deal will be a critical next step in his legacy. And continuing to invest in Ukraine's fight for freedom, making sure they are as best positioned as possible, I hate to say Trump-proofing it, but, you know, recognizing that former President Trump chose as his running mate, the most vocal opponent of funding Ukraine's freedom here in the U.S. Senate.

Our fight is your fight, really trying to strike up that kind of longstanding bipartisan support for Israel. And he did so by praising both former President Trump, as well as President Biden.What he also did in order to try and achieve that objective was to really try and reject some of the allegations that have been made against the Israeli military. And he did so while not entirely sticking to the facts, including when he rejected claims about Israel starving people in Gaza as a total fabrication, although members of his own governments earlier in this war called for exactly that. There is also clear evidence according to humanitarian aid groups that Israel simply has not allowed enough aid into Gaza at various points. They've also shown that they can turn on and then back off the spigot at various points. He also talked about this notion that Israel has effectively one of the best rates of civilian casualties in Gaza, citing one expert at West Point, who has, he has repeatedly cited. But I've talked to multiple military experts, Jake, and they all make clear that Israel simply does not stand up to the words that it says about protecting civilian casualties, that when you compare it to other conflicts, including those in which the U.S. is involved. For example, the U.S. bombing campaign in Syria, which internally in the U.S. military was really viewed in some ways as a blight on the U.S.'s record in terms of civilian casualties, they say that what's happening in Gaza is far, far worse in terms of civilians. And we should note that of course that it comes as the death toll in Gaza has ticked up past 39,000, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which we should note does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.",

But if you look at the overall content of his speech, he overwhelmingly focused far more on this notion of achieving victory against Hamas, vowing that Israel will not stop its war until it achieves that victory over Hamas. Rather than on the prospects of this ceasefire deal, even as top U.S. officials now say that a ceasefire fire deal is effectively within reach, and that's very interesting. The question is, is the Israeli prime minister making this kind of speech before he reaches a ceasefire deal to try and assuage his right wing or is he doing so for other reasons, perhaps because he doesn't intend to move forward with a ceasefire agreement at all. As we've noted before, the Israeli prime minister certainly stands to gain more by this war prolonging than by ending it. That being said, an Israeli delegation is set to leave to meet with the mediators and the coming days to deliver Israel's latest response. And then we will see if there can be a deal -- Jake.",

Israel and the United States government believe that five of those eight are still alive. Today marks 292 days for parents, friends, and family members of those hostages without their loved ones.Joining us now from Capitol Hill, Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jon Polin, they are the parents of the Israeli-American hostage, Hersh Goldberg- Polin, along with Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa. Thanks to all of you for being here. Rachel, I'll start with you. You and Jon attended Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech. What was your main takeaway? RACHEL GOLDBERG-POLIN, MOTHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE:  Look as parents of one of the American eight, we were saddened. We were disappointed. We really wanted to hear that the prime minister was on the brink of signing this deal, or that he was going to announce, I have signed or we are signing right now, this first phase of the deal, just to get some movement going. And we didn't hear that. So, we are laser-focused and that's obviously as any parent can appreciate, our main objective, we didn't get that and so, we are continuing to be broken and moving forward and trying to be hopeful and optimistic.",

He gets to remain prime minister.I know you're reluctant to wade into the politics of this, but what's your assessment of it all? JON POLIN, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE:  My assessment is that the prime minister wants to do a deal. I think he understands that there could be no victory without bringing home the hostages. I think that as the son of an historian and somebody who himself appreciates history to prime minister understands that his legacy see, is going to be very much shaped by whether or not he's able to bring home these hostages. So I know he wants to get this done as all of the families, what were trying to push on is Dr. King's fierce urgency of now, and we need this to happen few days. We believe there's an opportunity. And so we hope that that's going to happen. And hopefully, today's speech solidified the support from both sides of the aisle that we know has been present, but that we think that the prime minister is going to take out a Washington this week. And it's going to give him the energy and the -- everything he needs to go out and get this deal done imminently.",

He's also been accused of trying to stoke division in the U.S. domestically because obviously his leadership is not universally praised, shall we say? I think about 80 Democrats from Congress did not attend, many of them were meeting with hostage families.How do you see it all? SEN. JONI ERNST (R-IA):  Well, I do think its important that the prime minister lay out for the United States what his plan is to return not only the American eight, but also all of the hostages. And we also did hear a little bit about the day after plan, what he hopes to accomplish as soon as the war concludes. I was able to briefly speak with him after the speech and asked him, please to get that American eight hostages home as quickly as possible. And he did respond that they are working on it. And I also think that the United States needs to shape an influence where we can, we should not tell Israel how to run the war, but certainly we can shape an influence because we cannot forget, that nearly 40 Americans were killed on October 7th, eight of them were taken hostage. Among those, Hersh. So we need to do what we can as America to help Israel find a way to win this war and bring our hostages home.",

It's a really sad situation.I appreciate that we have our First Amendment right to protest, but to do it peacefully and not destroying other people most property. So it's really unfortunate that we see this. And I think that many of those protesters don't fully understand the loss of American life on October 7th. They probably have no idea that an Americans are being held by Hamas. Hersh, we know, was badly injured by Hamas on October 7th, and he has yet to be released. So, I would just challenge those that are out there protesting. Do they truly know what they are protesting for and who they are protesting for?",
