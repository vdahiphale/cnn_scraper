It has been absolutely catastrophic in terms of the damage that we've seen after these torrential rains that pummeled down on Dubai and in the entire UAE yesterday, and absolutely scary. I mean, my pass was flooded. We lost power. So many homes experienced the same thing. And then, in this street, what you probably think is a river or some kind of lake, this is a residential area. And what residents tell me, this is half of the water that was there this morning. So, essentially, the water levels have somewhat gone down. But, I just wonder how long it's going to take the cleanup.You mentioned the airports, complete disaster there. People weren't actually able to get to Dubai International, Sheikh Zayed Road, one of the most important arteries, flooded, people trapped in their cars for hours, cars submerged, cars, of course, unable to move through the water. In fact, there are some cars that are submerged in this residential area as well, Rahel. It's incredible to see. Schools are shut down. People have been told to work from home. And honestly, some of the images absolutely harrowing. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIOKOS (voice-over): Powerful storms, torrential rainfall, bringing Dubai to a standstill, disrupting the lives of thousands. Among the towering skyscrapers, the rain fell so heavily and so quickly, streets were turned into rivers, highways into lakes, cars submerged underwater, people stuck for hours on the main road to the airport, forced to abandon their vehicles as the flooded water rose. And at Dubai International Airport, planes battled against flooded runways. Emirates Airlines halted all departing flights from Dubai on Wednesday, with the incoming flights being diverted to neighboring countries. Severe weather also affected other Gulf States. In neighboring Oman, at least 18 people died in flash floods, according to the country's National Committee for Emergency Management. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, when we were driving around, we almost got stuck. And we just saw so many cars submerged. We also met a few people. One person had come to Dubai specifically to go to a conference. They were unable to get there.And then we met a woman who says that her plane was going in circles for around three hours before eventually being diverted to Abu Dhabi, and then she was delayed by seven hours and then eventually left in the middle of a highway, where then we helped her to go to her hotel because she was carrying luggage. And she had a six-year-old little girl. What is of course encouraging is that we saw so many Emiratis coming in with their big trucks to try and help people and drive them to their final destination, to help people. We saw emergency services really working around the clock to try and assist Dubai International Airport with so many passengers that were stranded at the airport, unable to get taxis to their hotels, also offering them food and water and a place to stay. I mean, it's been incredible to see hotels have been chipping in. And now, it's the cleanup. You've got insurance companies really trying to assess the damage. But, the point here is, Rahel, that Dubai's infrastructure is just not made for this type of rainfall and that is why you see this kind of flooding. You don't really have drain water -- stormwater drainage in the streets. And this is -- the water has absolutely no way to go. I mean, look at how deep I am. And of course, this is one of those shallowest areas here. We've seen people falling in ditches. It's been absolutely horrific. We've also seen the other end of the spectrum where little kids have been taking little canoes and kind of swimming around and enjoying the water. And frankly, it's a tale of two worlds, right? You've got the excitement of the water being around in certain residential areas, and then the harrowing reality of what it means for people that were trapped. And of course, one man, 70-year-old man, losing his life around an hour or a half away from Dubai. And also, other Gulf nations experiencing these torrential rains. In Oman, over 17 people lost their lives. It's been really unprecedented to see the impact of this. People that live here -- who've lived here all their lives say they've never seen this.",

So, stay tuned for that.In the meantime, as fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow, a diplomatic full-court press of sorts is going on in Israel today. It's an effort to keep tensions from spiraling out of control. Those efforts are happening amid violence in Gaza. Hospital officials say that a strike on a refugee camp killed at least 13 people, including seven children. Gaza's Health Ministry says that 56 people have been killed in the enclave over the past 24 hours, although CNN cannot independently verify those figures. Meantime, Iran's President has issued another warning saying that, quote \"Even the slightest attack by Israel will be dealt with fiercely and severely.\" British Foreign Minister David Cameron and his German counterpart met with top Israeli government officials today, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Cameron urging Israel to show restraint, as it continues to weigh how it will respond to last weekend's attack by Iran. Let's bring in CNN's Nic Robertson, who is with us now from Jerusalem. Nic, just -- let's start in Gaza. What more can you share with us about this situation there and this strike on the refugee camp?",

Three quarters of people here in Israel at the moment don't want Israel to strike back at Iran at the expense of losing international support. Now, there is a school of thought here that says Israel miscalculated, misread Iran when it struck the diplomatic facility in Damascus, killing those senior Iranian commanders. Israel failed to read the room rate, if you will, when it comes to Iran. Why? In part, the understanding is, because Iran thinks that Israel's position, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position, is weakened because the international pressure, because of the rift with the White House over what's happening in Gaza.So, there is this sense that Israel read the room wrong when it hit the consulate in Damascus. Iran responded. So, the question then becomes is, is Iran -- is Israel, rather, going to read Iran right now with their response? Will they be able to deliver a response that satisfies what they want without further escalating? Iran says, no, that they will respond to any provocation, any retaliation from Israel. So, this is uncharted territory that we're in at the moment and that shouldn't be underestimated. So, when you see the tensions, as we are today, along the northern border between Israel and Lebanon, with Hezbollah, just sort of going up a notch.

It says quote, \"We are fully confident in the 787 Dreamliner. These claims about the structural integrity of the 787 are inaccurate and do not represent the comprehensive work Boeing has done to ensure the quality and long- term safety of the aircraft.\"Now, this is just the latest chapter in this years-long saga of Boeing issues, two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, killed 346 people abroad. That led to a 20-month grounding of the 737 MAX. Then this past January, there was the Alaska Airlines door plug blow out on a 737 MAX 9. But, remember, this latest accusation has to do with the 787, not the 737, though the 787 has not been without its problems. Deliveries of new 787s were paused in 2021, 2022, because of quality issues. Some of that is because the tolerances are just so tight. The gaps allowed between the main fuselage sections are five one thousandths of an inch. That's the width of two sheets of paper as thin as a human hair. Boeing says it set that tolerance, and maybe it's more extreme than necessary for a plane to be safe. Rahel.",

Pete Muntean, our thanks to you.Let me continue this conversation now. Joining us now is the former Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Mary Schiavo. And Mary, always good to have you. Let me just ask, I'm sure you saw the NBC news piece. I'm sure you've heard the interview. It felt -- the allegations felt quite alarming. He said at one point that the plane could theoretically fall out of the sky. I mean, how concerned are you by what you heard? What are your reactions to these allegations? MARY SCHIAVO, CNN AVIATION ANALYST, &amp; FMR. INSPECTOR GENERAL, U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPT.: Well, I'm very concerned for two reasons, and the first reason is, as Pete mentioned, this is deja vu, this issue with the pieces, the sections of the fuselage. And you have to remember that on the Dreamliner, there are four key sections. They're like metal cylinders, or composite cylinders, rather, that are joined together at the Boeing assembly plant, and those are made by different people. And they have to fit together very closely, because over time, a plane fuselage is just like a balloon. Every time it's pressurized, it blows up. And when it lands or is depressurized, it contracts. And over time, those joints, those rivets, the pieces that are fastened together, they stretch and can go out of shape. And over time, you will see more of a danger. But, since it was brought to Boeing's attention back in 2020 and 2021, I remember, Dreamliner, that's what this plane is, Dreamliner deliveries were suspended for a while because of this issue. I think it's even more troubling, because once again, we're saying, wait a minute, Boeing. You said this was handled. And wait a minute, Federal Aviation Administration. You said this was handled and you gave Boeing the authority to go on, so the fact that this has happened before and these allegations are very alarming. And yes, if the plane has a stress fracture, it will fall out the sky. Nothing is going to keep it together if you lose the ceiling of the fuselage. It will fall.",

He is the former Chief of Staff at the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration. We are also joined by former Special Assistant to President Biden, Meghan Hays. Good to see you both.Miles, let me start with you. So, by day, Trump was obviously in court as potential jurors were questioned and sort of vetted. By night, though, he was on the offensive at that Harlem bodega, attacking DA Bragg, attacking a crime in New York. But, crime is down in New York. Crime is down in a lot of major cities. So, what do you think the campaign's thinking is here? MILES TAYLOR, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY DEPT.: Well, I think the conventional wisdom, Rahel, had been that it was going to be very difficult for Donald Trump to campaign while he was in the midst of these trials. And so, his campaign has tried to think through what are different spectacles, if you will, that we could pull off so that we're getting the attention that we want. So, Trump is getting his message out there. And I think what you saw with his visit to the bodega where, of course, the DA prosecuting him had had a controversial case, is just an example of how they're going to pursue this. They're going to keep him in the region. They're going to try to perform symbolic events. Whether it's true that crime is up or down, I think, is irrelevant to most Trump supporters. They care about what his message is. And he is saying that the message is that there is greater crime in the Biden administration. They're going to believe it. And they seem to be lapping these events up. I mean, I've got to say, I reluctantly need to agree with the former President when he made that comment there at the end of the visit to the bodega, that there was probably more press there than there would have been if he'd done a campaign event outside of New York. And I think they're going to try to capitalize on that. So, I would expect this just to be the beginning, and they're going to try to make it look like Donald Trump really is, quote, unquote, \"a man of the people\" by doing more of these events. Although I'll add, this was probably the first time he has ever been to a bodega.",

Some of the answers are interesting. And it's going to be difficult on both sides, and by both sides. I mean, the folks on one side of the bench who are dealing with the prosecution and the defense, recognize that there is a person being prosecuted here that everyone in America knows, and is probably the most polarizing figure in America. So, it's very difficult to select a jury pool.But, I also want to point to the jury box, Rahel, because it will be very difficult to serve on this jury in the culture that we have today of crowd-sourced intimidation and violence. There are going to be security worries for these jurors. And you already saw it with the judge's very quick reaction to shut down even Trump looks and comments and muttering. That could be perceived as intimidating the jury. And this isn't just aimless speculation. We're talking about someone here who is being prosecuted, who in the past has intimidated courts and judges, and people who have ruled against him. When I worked for Donald Trump, he said that there were judges around the country who had made rulings that would result in Americans' lives being in danger and who would die. He directly attacked courts. He attacked judges by names. One time in the Oval Office, he told us we needed to, quote \"get rid of the judges.\" He wanted to eliminate a certain Circuit Court altogether. So, he has a long history of going directly after people in the justice system who are administering it or who are supposed to decide cases. So, I think this judge has been very attuned to that.

And in places like Dubai, which was not built with drainage in mind, monsoon level drainage, it's just -- it's another lesson that we live on a different planet. We're outside of the Goldilocks zone of which we built the modern world now, and it is happening. There were some questions whether cloud seeding gone wrong. Could have something to do this? That's when countries in this region actually do -- will spray salt particles into existing puffy clouds to try to get rain out of them. But, you can only get out as much rain as already is there.The officials say there were no such flights before these storms. It was just -- this is climate change, folks. This is what it looks like in a warmer atmosphere.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. A couple studies out today, really interesting, connecting your personal health, wealth and happiness with what is happening in the climate. The one in nature just basically says the tolls that are caused by damage to your house, it's going to cost more to grow and move food on a warmer planet. The mental health tools, worker productivity globally will be a hit on the economy close to 20 percent over the next 25 years or so. And it's not distributed evenly. This is what's so unfair about this crisis. The people who have the least amount of contributing to the problem will suffer the most.Middle East and North Africa will suffer 22.4 percent decrease in their economic productivity. You can see North America towards the bottom, around 11 percent. Central Asia and Russia not suffering as much as Siberia becomes a breadbasket, as the planet warms closer to the northern poles there as well. Another study, Rahel, interesting today, consumer reports here in the United States basically tried to quantify in the cost of a lifetime, and a baby born today, they say, will cost $500,000 in climate change cost, the same sort of cost there as well. Housing will cost more to repair and ensure food costs more as well. And so, $7 trillion was what they say, the economists say will cost to for countries to make the Paris climate targets. These disasters that are already baked in, they say, will bring about $37 trillion worth of damage. So, what is already sort of baked into the system, the world will now have to pay for how to adapt to that, even as incomes come down as a result.",

Truth Social says that it will take a shot at the streaming business, but shares of its company keep falling. It tumbled 14 percent on Tuesday after closing 18 percent lower on Monday. Shares were down more than 70 percent from the all-time high it set late last month. Now, the company is still worth billions of dollars. The cash just isn't flowing. Experts have warned investors to be careful here.Let's bring in CNN's Hadas Gold to talk to us a little bit more about the future of Truth Social. Hadas, it wasn't very long ago that Truth Social event went public. What's going on here?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, the stock is falling. When you just look at the graph since March 26 as they had that peak, it is just a very fast downward fall. As you noted, it's around 70 percent loss valuation. That's billions of dollars' worth that have been lost. And keep in mind that the former President, Donald Trump, he owns something like 60 percent of the shares here. He is the majority shareholder. So, that is wiping out something like hundreds of millions of dollars of his own personal net worth as a result of this stock tanking now. Last I checked earlier today, the stock is up just a bit today. But obviously, it can't make up what it's lost over the last few months.Now, it's still worth money. The company is still worth billions of dollars. It's a sky-high valuation. But, the company is still having trouble making money, and it's desperate for cash. And there is a question about how much of this is really just a meme stock, in a way of people investing in this company because they like Donald Trump, but not so much because of the value of the company. Now, Truth Social is trying to add more value. They're announcing this streaming service yesterday. They're saying that they are going to launch the streaming. But, there is a question because there is not a lot of details we're seeing. We don't know who will be on it. All we know from the company is that they're going to be promoting content that they believe is suppressed, that has been cancelled in the past, or is at risk of being cancelled. Now, listen to all the subjects they're going to be covering. They say news, religious channels, family-friendly content, including films and documentaries. Again, they say this is all going to be about things that they believe have been suppressed or canceled. We don't have details on the timing. They say they've been testing this out for the past six months. All they really went to details is about the phases of how they're going to get it to their consumers first, starting on apps on your phone, until it can become -- until you can see it on your streaming TV. But, keep in mind, this is a competitive space and it's difficult to make money on streaming. Look at Disney. Disney has Disney+. Disney has a goldmine of content, and even they are having trouble becoming profitable in the streaming arena. And the audience share that this Truth Social is trying to go after, it's already being served by several smaller streamers. Think of places like Newsmax, like OAN. So, there is a question of how much audience they'll be able to get. Now, Trump has a very loyal vocal fan base. They may be willing to pony up the money. But, there is a huge question about how this streaming service will work in the end for Donald Trump and his company.",

First, you have U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who is facing a Senate impeachment trial that could begin today and also -- and pretty quickly. The process was started by Republicans in February over what they call his mishandling of the migrant crisis on the southern U.S. border. But, the Democratic-controlled Senate is expected to dismiss the charges -- dismissed the charges without a trial.And then there is this. U.S. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson is fighting to hold on to his job. He faces a Republican rebellion sparked by his plan to finally move forward on billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. And he may have to rely on U.S. House Democrats to not only get the foreign aid bills over the finish line, but he also may have to rely on them to keep and save his speakership. Let's bring in CNN Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox, who was on Capitol Hill, and joins us now. Lauren, we have been here before. Walk us through what's next.",
