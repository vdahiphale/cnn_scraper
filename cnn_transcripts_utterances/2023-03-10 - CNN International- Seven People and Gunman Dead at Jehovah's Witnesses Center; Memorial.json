Just ahead, German police are investigating the motives behind a shooting that left 7 people dead in the Jehovah's Witnesses center in Hamburg. Amongst them, there was an unborn baby. We will have the latest.Then, Xi Jinping officially secures a third term as President, making him a longest serving Head of State in Communist China since its foundation. Plus, 20 years ago, then U.S. President George W. Bush launched an emergency plan to combat HIV/AIDS. CNN travels to Africa with that initiative that saved millions of lives. German police are trying to figure out why a gunman went on a shooting rampage at a Jehovah's Witnesses center in Hamburg. It happened on Thursday night. The city's Interior Minister says the government opened fire, killing 7 people before taking his own life after police stormed the building, and witnesses describe the chaos. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She's one of the 8 people who were injured in this. We're getting some more details about the shooter himself, 35 years old, he was a German national. And as you said, he was a member of the church he left about 18 months ago, according to a Hamburg Security Official. Not perhaps under the best of terms is the way that the Security Official put it. It's not clear whether he left voluntarily or he was forced out.So it appears that he was not part of the group that was meeting last night, but then came to the group of about 50, who were in the Kingdom Hall last night in Hamburg meeting, as they often do. The Chancellor Scholz called this a brutal act, violence and he feared that some of those 8 who were injured may in fact succumb to their injuries. So that's kind of the way it stands now. We still don't have a very clear idea, what the motive of the government was? But clearly, he was had some difficulties with the church itself, Max.",

He was one of the demonstrators here in the Maidan in 2014, and has been fighting against pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas region ever since.

They say American and NATO Officials have seen instances of Russian forces seizing smaller weapons like Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft systems that Ukrainians were forced to leave on the battlefield is believed the Russians are hoping the Iranians can reverse engineer the weapons.So far it's unclear that if it's been successful, though. Now imposing new penalties on Moscow and shoring up the support for Ukraine will be front and center at a meeting in Washington on Friday, U.S. President Joe Biden will host European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for talks at the White House.

The French President and the British Prime Minister also tackling a myriad of issues at their summit in Paris the meeting between Emmanuel Macron and Rishi Sunak marks the first significant talks between the two countries in five years. The Elysee Palace says besides reaffirming their mutual support for Ukraine, the two leaders will also discuss illegal immigration across the English Channel climate change efforts and the fight against radicalization. Israel's Prime Minister is in Rome today and deepening political crisis back home over his government's judicial overhaul plan. Benjamin Netanyahu met Italian Officials and right wing Prime Minister Georgia Meloni. He says he'll ask Italy to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. His chip comes amid weeks of protests in Israel over his controversial proposals and more violence. 3 Israelis wounded after a Palestinian man opened fire in Tel Aviv. He was fatally shot by off duty police. Hadas Gold is monitoring all of the developments in Jerusalem for us right now.

      "sentences": "No, and in fact, he's being criticized, especially by the opposition for taking off for Italy in the midst of this political crisis here. In fact, his trip to Italy was even affected because instead of being able to drive to the airport as he initially planned, protesters decided to try to block the entrance to the airport by essentially just driving very slowly all through the airport grounds.As a result, Netanyahu had to actually helicopter into the airport. It also affected U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's visit, he also had to change his trip plans to go with Officials in Tel Aviv. Instead, he also actually just flew into the airport met Officials at a complex just near the airport and then left again because of these massive protests. Now 10 weeks in a row or so of people taking to the street to protest Benjamin Netanyahu is far right wing government, and especially their plans to completely overhaul the judicial system, essentially allowing the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions with just a simple majority now. So far, we haven't heard any issuance of any sort of backing down from Netanyahu or his government. But last night, there was an impassioned plea from the Israeli President Isaac Herzog. He made a televised address, we were hastily arranged, and we only got about a half hour notice on it. Essentially warning that the country was at a point of no return and for the first time, speaking out specifically against the legislation so until now, he's been rather sort of trying to play the negotiator trying to get people to come around the table to talk to come to a consensus on what these reforms may look like. And for the first time last night, he came out and said he believes that these reforms could damage the democratic foundations of Israel. Now, Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to be in Italy over the weekend. So we'll see whether the President's speech will affect his point of view when he returns. But as you noted, this is all happening in the wake of this ongoing deadly violence we've been seeing between Israelis and Palestinians last night actually, not far from where the protests were taking place just as they were wrapping up a gunman opened fire on pedestrians along one of the busiest nightlife areas in Tel Aviv. Wounding 3 including 1 critically and then passers-by amongst them off duty police officers shot and killed the man. Hamas, the militant group that runs the Gaza Strip claimed the man as a member of fighter of theirs. And it just goes to show you that this ongoing cycle of violating Israelis and Palestinians that is continuing it doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon, at the same time as these political crises are happening in Israel, Max.",

      "sentences": "Exactly, hush money payments are not illegal extramarital affairs are not illegal. The possible crime here is falsifying business records to explain how Michael Cohen was receiving the money that was a reimbursement for the hush money payments that he made to Stormy Daniels.Look, this investigation has been going on for around 5 years, but over the past few weeks, we have seen this sudden uptick in activity. And the District Attorney in Manhattan is under a lot of political pressure to do something about this case. And in recent weeks, we've seen Trump allies like Kellyanne Conway, his former aide Hope Hicks, going to testify before the grand jury. And the fact that they have extended this invitation to the Former President to come and testify before the grand jury suggests that this investigation is wrapping up and there could potentially be an indictment. Now it's unlikely that he will take them up on that invitation to go and testify. But if he was to be charged, look, this is a complicated case. This is not one of the stronger legal threats that he is facing. This is conduct that occurred around 7 years ago in the lead up to the 2016 campaign at the heart. It is a paperwork crime that in Manhattan would have to be prosecuted under a pretty novel legal theory. And at the center of this would be the star witness Michael Cohen, who is a convicted liar, who has been publicly really fixating on the Former President and his desire to see Trump charge. So any could Defense Attorney would likely seize on that, and it's unclear if there will be charges. But if they are brought it will be challenging to successfully convict the Former President.",
