      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington.The breaking news tonight, the head of the United Nations calling for maximum restraint as Israel weighs its response to an unprecedented attack by Iran. The Israeli Defense Forces says Iran launched some 350 rockets, missiles, drones into its territory overnight. The vast majority of them shot down by Israel and its partners before they could hit Israeli territory. Tonight, the Israeli war cabinet says it has not yet reached a decision on the scale or timing of its response, but that it is determined to act with one cabinet member calling for Israel to, quote, \"exact a price on Iran.\" President Biden spoke with G7 leaders today hoping for a diplomatic path forward saying in a tweet just moments ago, \"We will continue to work together to stabilize the situation in the region and avoid further escalation.\" CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is in Jerusalem. Nic, what do we know about Israel's current thinking in terms of a response? You're hearing a lot of messages calling for restraint, including from the U.S. president, from the U.N. Is Israel thinking in similar terms?",

Around that table Benny Gantz, Gadi Eisenkot, both of the National Unity Party, both former IDF chiefs of staff, both in the early hours of knowing that Iran had launched missiles towards Israel last night wanted Israel to strike back immediately before those impacts, before the intercepts that we saw over the skies here. Now, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoken with President Biden. President Biden or following that phone call where President Biden has sort of urged caution that was decided not to take that decision and respond immediately. But to delay for a day and thinking about it. And today we hear that the war cabinet met for almost five hours, didn't reach a conclusion, has asked the IDF to come up with options of how to strike back, but is now considering its position of the scale and scope and timing of that response. But as you said, it is clear, Israel wants to have a response but perhaps try to broaden out and bringing -- bring in a stronger international coalition, build support for Israel around this. And we've certainly heard that from Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, and we've heard it from Benny Gantz as well. So broaden the base of support, but not change its mind about going ahead with a response, Jim.",

I think there was an attack against the U.S. or the U.K. or France, or any other member states of the U.N. that nation would have retaliated as well.

It was attack against the ally of the U.S. in the region and they seemed that we're showing a lot of strength in our defense system.

It was U.S. partners, U.K., as well as Arab partners who took -- they're not advertising that participation, but they took part in this defense and that was a deliberate regional structure bringing, multiple allies together to help defend Israel.Is that not a win for Israel to see those defenses work in this case?

We don't take it for granted, but it's definitely not a win. Let's not foolish ourselves. You know, when we were hiding in the shelter last night and the entirenation was looking at the rockets flying into Israel, and we had few people injured, a little girl at the age of 7 that was unfortunately seriously injured. But we cannot call it a victory. A win will be when we will send a clear message to Iran not to mess with Israel. We have no interest to start a war with Iran, even though they're sending their proxies from Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq. For the last few months we have been dealing with the proxies of Iran. But if that's turning direct missiles into our communities definitely not a win to intercept 99 percent. It's a great achievement, but it's not a win.",

Just think about when Ukraine was first invaded by Russia. I mean, people were worried that Germany and others in NATO were worried about their gas and oil imports from Russia. Would they stick together? He managed to hold everybody together and we need to hold everybody together here now, not only on Ukraine, but on Israel, on the Indo-Pacific, on Taiwan.
