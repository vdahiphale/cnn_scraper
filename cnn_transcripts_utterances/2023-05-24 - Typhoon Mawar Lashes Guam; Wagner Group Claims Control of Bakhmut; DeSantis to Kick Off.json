You are right, it is not a conventional choice. The decision to hold it on Twitter is very different than what we have seen from other presidential candidates. They usually do it with their political hometown or some other place of significance. But DeSantis has chosen in part, Twitter, because he doesn't see himself running a traditional campaign. People close to his operation said time and time again they will not run a campaign that you are used to seeing. But it's also a controversial choice. Elon Musk, since he has taken over Twitter, has generated a lot of concern not only about his stewardship of this giant tech company but also the way that he has embraced conspiracy theories and far-right figures, as he has created this safe harbor for the right wing to operate. But DeSantis has been leaning into this crowd, trying to gain the support of conservative influencers, as he tried to take on Donald Trump in his primary. And he has a long way to go to topping Donald Trump, who enters this race with a significant advantage over DeSantis, who has been trying to curry favor with supporters and grassroots operatives for weeks by saying look, Trump, if he got into office, he would be a lame duck president on day one. He can only serve a single four year term. I, as a new face, can serve eight years. We can get a lot done over those eight years. I also don't bring the baggage that Trump brings. I have a better track record with recent elections. This is the case he privately makes to donors.

The water has actually been searched before, Eleni, back in 2008. But it was not done by the police; it was done by privately hired divers, who were hired by a Portuguese lawyer, who had gotten a tip from what he called \"underworld\" sources, quote-unquote. This search also was not exhaustive. This is a massive reservoir. They said they searched the places that they thought were most likely to turn up a body or other evidence. Also, there was zero visibility. Right now, there are divers that are on standby but, to our knowledge thus far, none have actually gotten in the water. The search is focused on land. One possible reason for that is because of drought. In 2007, this reservoir was 70 percent at capacity. Now it is less than half of that capacity. So the result is that many of the areas they are searching right now were actually underwater back in 2007, obviously, making it easier for them 16 years later, Eleni.",
