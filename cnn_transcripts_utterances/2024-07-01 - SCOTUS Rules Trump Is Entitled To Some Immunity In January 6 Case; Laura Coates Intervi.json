      "sentences": "Well, the Supreme Court largely co-signs Richard Nixon's infamous argument. What it means for the cases against Donald Trump, and could it help President Joe Biden survive the calls for him to step down? Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"All right, let me ask you a question, America. Do you believe the following statement, no one is above the law? Do you? It's not actually a rhetorical question. I'm genuinely curious. Do you believe, sitting where you are today, that no one is above the law? And I bet, for many of you, at one time, you would have answered yes, and probably emphatically and maybe especially when it came to the president of the United States. But today, tonight, I wonder if that answer may have changed, say it feels less like a declaratory statement and more of a kind of Valley upspeak. No one is above the law. Well, at least one person no longer believes it. Quote -- \"The president is now a king above the law\" -- unquote. That came from Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. I'll read her words again. \"The president is now a king above the law.\" That's how she characterized the impact of the court's historic six to three ruling today, one that found that Donald Trump and, well, any other president for that matter, has substantial immunity for official acts. In other words, if it's part of the official job description laid out in the Constitution, you can't prosecute him in criminal court. Now, here's the thing. That part of the decision is not really that surprising to us. Most people thought that would happen, that a president couldn't be criminally prosecuted for actually doing the job of the president. What was surprising? The kinds of thing the Supreme Court said the work of the president was. And when they punted to the trial court to figure out the exact duties, that same foot kicked the can down the road for any trial, certainly past November. Now, if Jack Smith's case was a kind of one of those Jenga towers, built one block after another of evidence, of testimony, well, today the Supreme Court's conservative majority poked out so many blocks, the case is teetering. Take, for example, this from the court's ruling. \"Trump is therefore absolutely immune from prosecution for the alleged conduct involving his discussions with Justice Department officials.\" So, any discussion that he had with his DOJ cannot be used with Jack Smith or by Jack Smith. Why is that a big blow? Well, a lot of the indictment cites the fact that Trump's own DOJ told him that the election fraud claims were untrue. Testimony, well, like this from Trump's own former attorney general. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a reward, really, for what the president did, former President Trump. A reward for the presidency itself. The court is basically saying we cannot trust good faith of prosecutors, we need to protect the president. So, what will happen now is this line between official and unofficial acts and ambiguity galore. As you indicated, we're going to see appeals. It could go on and on. And ultimately, the court could say what's left of the case is actually also immune. But at the end of the day, this comes down to incentives.",

You know, the rules of evidence aren't going to apply, so it'll be much more efficient than a trial. But Mike Pence will probably testify.And she'll hear all of the evidence. In fact, the American people will hear all the evidence in this case before the election, even though the trial will not happen before November, so that she can decide what -- what fits within the structure that the Supreme Court has laid out for immunity, what is outside of that, and therefore can go forward in a trial, you know, presumably next year, if ever.
