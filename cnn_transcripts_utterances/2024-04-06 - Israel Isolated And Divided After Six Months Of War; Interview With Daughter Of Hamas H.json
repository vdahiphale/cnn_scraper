I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.This weekend marks six months since the single, most deadly attack in Israel's history roiled the region and the world. On October 7, 2023 hundreds of Hamas fighters poured across the border from Gaza, killing 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and kidnapping 253 men, women, and children. Of those 130 is still missing. 34 of them are presumed dead. Since Israel responded with its massive war in Gaza, more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 70,000 injured. In a moment, I'll be speaking to Sharon Lifshitz, whose mother was one of the first hostages to be released and whose father is still being held captive.

A major offensive in Rafah still looms on the surface and Israeli troops do not have full control of the Gaza strip six months later. While the Israeli military has succeeded in killing the number three Hamas commander in Gaza, they have not killed most of Hamas' senior leaders including Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader in Gaza who still remains at large. And then of course there is the fate of the hostages. Of the 253 people the Israeli government says were taken hostage on October 7th, 130 of those still remain in Gaza. 34 of those have been confirmed dead by the Israeli government. For the families of those hostages, it has been 183 days of pure agony for them. 183 days of fighting for the return of their loved ones, of trying to pressure every potential government in the world including of course, the Israeli government and Prime Minister Netanyahu, trying to urge the Israeli government to prioritize negotiations, the return of their loved ones over the war in Gaza.

And I think it's a great story because the Holocaust is a human story, not just a Jewish story. I mean definitely it was an Israeli story. And I think this is a way to show that, in the end of the day, we are people and we have so much in common and we should not use human tragedies, we not really should use excuses of different ethnicities in order to inflict the same pain that was done upon us on other people. Especially if those people had nothing to do with that tragedy. And I want to show that like even before the establishment of Israel, Arabs and Jews in Germany lived a life of harmony and co-habitation (ph). And they were even closer together than the German Christians. And the Holocaust is a very important part of our contemporary history. And we have a role in it, like saving other people from there and we're being erased. So as an Arab, I want to actually show our story, our self and put us into the place where we actually have a say and a place in human history. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
