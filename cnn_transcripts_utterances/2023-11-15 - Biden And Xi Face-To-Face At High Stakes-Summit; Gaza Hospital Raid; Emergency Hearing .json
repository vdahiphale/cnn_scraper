President Biden is hoping that this highly anticipated meeting will put the U.S.-China relationship on steadier footing, but the president has been careful to lower expectations heading into it. The summit is taking place at a historic estate south of San Francisco on the sidelines of a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders.CNN's David Culver joins us now from San Francisco. So, you know, Biden has made clear, look, talking is really important at this stage with China, but what is the expectation? What is the expectation for what will come out of this meeting?",

      "sentences": "And that is actually sad but basic reality in all of this talking, Pamela, is an important part and a first step in something that hasn't happened in a year between these 2 leaders. So, we're at that point now. In fact, I'm just seeing that both President Xi and President Biden have arrived at that estate just south of where we are here in San Francisco, and this is where they're gonna be having this bilateral discussion that could last about four hours.As far as the agenda items, really depends on who you ask. President Biden, we tend to get much more transparency on the U.S. side. He says that this is about making things normal again. Tough to remember what that looks like. And also, about reestablishing military communications. This has been severed since 2 summers ago, and it's really an important and crucial time given how highly contested the South China Sea is right now on the Taiwan Strait. So, getting back on track with that seems to be a priority on the U.S. side. As far as China is concerned, we don't hear from President Xi directly ahead of the events like this. That tends to be how the Chinese handle things. They keep quiet and will put out a readout, if that, on the back end, or you have to look at it through state media. But we can look at what China needs, and that is a boost in their economy. So, look for something that would be economy-related that could benefit China, perhaps easing some pressure on Chinese businesses to allow that boost to take place, which in turn, Pamela, allows for social stability within China, which is crucial for the Chinese Communist Party.",

For the U.S. part, you know, it is warning, look, there's not gonna be a long list of outcomes after this, or likely won't be this joint statement that is customary with a high stakes meeting like this.

And he's got ties here to San Francisco to his first visit to the United States was in 1985. He was a Communist Party official, not nearly as high up, obviously, as he is now, having secured a near unprecedented third term last year, essentially setting the groundwork for him to rule for life.But this meeting with business leaders, that's going to be interesting because it's already proved to be very, very polarizing here in the U.S. Essentially, what China needs is to move these business leaders, particularly American companies, back into China. What we have seen in the past couple of years is that these companies have been dissuaded from doing business in China, in part because of Beijing's crackdown on companies. We've seen some offices of American corporations being raided in places like Shanghai. So they're hesitant and they're concerned about also getting profit out of China back into the U.S. So, these are things that need to be alleviated and discussed. And there is a big welcome Xi dinner, if you will, that's planned after this one-on-one with President Biden and President Xi. But that has drawn a lot of concern from lawmakers, one in particular, a chairman of the House Select Committee that focuses on the CCP. That's Mike Gallagher. He has called this unconscionable. And the reason he's concerned is because there's a price tag for these business leaders to attend this dinner. In some cases, it's reported to be up to $40,000 for a seat at the table with President Xi. So he is not happy about that. To the point, Pamela, he wants to know what companies are involved and what individuals will be going to this dinner.",

They promise to present that evidence to the world. Doctors there at al-Shifa have repeatedly denied such claims.But Israel and the U.S. previously said intel indicated Hamas did indeed have operational infrastructure at the hospital. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot, Israel for us. All right, Jeremy, how is the IDF justifying this operation? We haven't yet seen this evidence they're promising.",

And what we've been witnessing, not only last night, overnight, as this operation was happening in Gaza City, early this morning, but also this evening, is intense battles still happening between Israeli forces and Hamas militants in the area behind me.It appears to have been in the area of Beit Lahiya, as well as that Jabalia refugee camp. We saw explosions. We saw tracer fire being shot. And intense gun battles also happening in two directions, apparently, between Hamas militants and Israeli forces. And so, it's clear that even as Israeli forces push deeper into the Gaza Strip, deeper into Gaza City itself, they are also still very much dealing with the threat of Hamas militants in the northern part of the Strip. Part of that may have to do with the tunnel systems that Hamas has. We know that Israeli forces have told us repeatedly over the last several weeks that ambushes are one of the most serious threats that their forces face as they operate inside Gaza.",

And of course, the situation inside the hospital has been deteriorating for days now. As we know, this is one of the vast majority of hospitals in northern Gaza that is technically now not operational. They do not have enough medical supplies. They do not have fuel to keep their generators going. And as we saw, and as Jeremy mentioned, we've seen oxygen supplies in the neonatal unit being completely cut off at the Al-Shifa Hospital. So, a huge amount of concern around the capability of doctors to be able to provide the urgent care that is needed by so many patients inside the Al-Shifa Hospital. And of course, we have heard those repeated calls from the Israeli military for civilians to evacuate from northern Gaza to southern Gaza. And, of course, as we know, it is extremely difficult for patients to evacuate through that route.",

BROWNmeeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. MJ Lee is standing by for us. The White House really rolling out the red carpet for this high- stakes meeting, MJ. Meeting at this Georgian mansion right outside of San Francisco. Everything has been so carefully choreographed leading up to this meeting, right? MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yeah, and that is very much expected, given that the stakes really could not be higher for both leaders. We have heard that both leaders have actually arrived at this historic estate. So, any minute now, we should be seeing pictures of the two leaders shaking hands. [14:15:09] Now, just to give you a little bit of context here, of course, the last time that the two leaders met face-to-face was about a year ago on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali. And you think about everything that has transpired over the last year, where the 2 countries' relationship has really deteriorated. There was, of course, the issue of the Chinese surveillance balloon that was shot down. There was also the issue of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visiting Taiwan, which very much angered Beijing officials. And that ultimately ended up leading to the military-to- military communications between the 2 countries being severed. And we are told that behind the scenes, in their conversations that they have had with their Chinese counterparts, U.S. officials for months have been pressing them to consider reestablishing that communication, which they say is so critical to making sure that there are not any unnecessary misunderstandings between the 2 countries. And we are told that they have used the example of the surveillance balloon as an example of why that kind of communication being open is so important. So, as we were talking about before, that is just one of the few tangible outcomes that U.S. officials hope to see coming out of this summit, which should be beginning any moment now.",

And that really is to bring U.S.-China relations back to a new normal, whatever that might be. Again, that is about establishing those lines of communication, making sure diplomatic conversations that are happening so that even though the 2 countries are competitors and they have plenty of areas where they disagree, they can work together on areas where there are areas where they can work together, but also just to make sure that there aren't any unnecessary sort of crises that come up between the 2 countries.So, I think that is going to be sort of the headline that we see coming out of this summit.

The United States is saying to Iran, look, you're in a position to not necessarily persuade and get Iran to change its behavior fundamentally. But we want you to thoroughly understand that we expect you to use your leverage when you can. A meeting like this is especially important face to face because we don't know what kind of information Xi Jinping is getting from the people around him. That's at the core of this. In a regular government where you know that the foreign minister is going to speak to the president and say the hard truths, then you can give your message to the foreign minister.

There was a really telling moment a few months ago when Xi visited Putin at the Kremlin and it was caught on camera. You heard Xi say to him, there are changes unfolding in the world, the likes of which we haven't seen in a century. And he said, and you and I are leading the charge, to which Putin said, I agree. And that is what the United States, that's the lock that we're trying to pick to some degree. We're trying to say to Xi Jinping, yes, we know where you've lined up for now.
