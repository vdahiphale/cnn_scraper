Christian Ziegler was -- has not been charged with a crime and has said that he says he is innocent. But let's get more on what is truly a mess and a horrible situation.CNN's Carlos Suarez is following this. Carlos, what more are you learning about this? CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we know that party officials are going to meet in early January to officially remove Christian Ziegler as chair. Party officials yesterday told me that at this point there is nothing that Ziegler could say that will change their minds. They want to see him go. As you noted, Ziegler was stripped of his duties and his salary. At an emergency meeting here in Orlando, where we're told that Ziegler tried to defend himself and apologize in remarks that party officials said, just was not welcomed in the room. Now, over the weekend. There had -- there was also talk that Ziegler was looking for some sort of buyout to leave his post with the Florida Republican Party. But Ziegler himself told me that that was not the case. He said that that was 100 percent a lie. And party officials told me that that is just not going to take place. Ziegler has been under investigation since October when a woman came forward claiming that Ziegler raped her after a planned sexual encounter between the woman, Christian, and his wife, Bridget, fell through. The woman told police that Christian still showed up to her home in Sarasota, where the alleged assault took place even after she canceled this planned sexual encounter. As you also noted, Christian has not been charged criminally, and he said that the sex was consensual. Here now is the vice chair of the Florida Republican Party describing why he says nearly all of Florida's top Republican officials, from Governor Ron DeSantis to Florida's two senators and county level officials, why they all believe that Ziegler is just unfit to serve.

You cannot morally lead the Republican Party forward. And that's, I think, at the end of the day, we wish Christian well in his legal endeavors if he did not do it. We feel for the victim, if he did do it or in what she's gone through. But he needs to handle the legal problem on his own time and we need to move the party forward in its own legal -- in its political process.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

As for his wife Bridget, she has also refused calls to step down from the Sarasota County School Board. Last week, fellow board members asked her to voluntarily resign, saying the details of this sex scandal are disturbing. It's important to note here that Bridget has not been accused of anything criminally any wrongdoing here, though she did admit to police that she did have at least one other sexual encounter with this victim and her husband over a year ago.",

She broke the ultimate glass ceiling, becoming the first woman justice to serve on the nation's highest court. The court was a boys' club until 1981. Justice O'Connor died on December 1st at the age of 93.And just a quick update, the person that you saw fall there, one of the members of the Honor Guard, was able to be walked out. So, she is OK and was able to walk out with a little help on her own. All right. Now, to CNN's Joan Biskupic, who joins me now. Joan, can you tell us more about the memorials that are planned and the public can also pay the respects, correct?",

And for those of us who really knew her record and how much she was decisive on the hottest social issues of the day during her tenure, you knew what she did for the country. And just watching the other justices as they listened to Justice Sotomayor and they listened to the reverend, you could see on their faces how much they miss her.You know, she died at 93. She'd been out of the public eye for many years as she was ill, but she was just such a trailblazer, you know, for them. And really changed how they interacted with each other. Al nine of the justices were there today to begin the memorial events. And Retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is very close to Justice O'Connor, was there too. And then just so you know, tomorrow there will be a funeral service for Justice O'Connor at the National Cathedral where President Joe Biden will be there and speak, as will Chief Justice John Roberts.

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, this test is very concerning because, as you mentioned, it's likely to be another intracontinental ballistic missile with a potential range of over 9,000 miles. But on this lounge, it flew only some 600 miles, as you mentioned, because, you know whether or not it could reach the U.S. very much depends on whether or not the North Koreans could fire it at a flatter trajectory to ensure the warhead survive a prolonged shallower re-entry into the atmosphere. That ability, according to experts we talked to, they have yet to prove.But still, this is likely their third launch of this type just this year. And it's likely, as you mentioned, another solid field missile. Now, that type is more advanced than the liquid fueled versions because they're more stable. They can be moved more easily to avoid detection. And they can also be initiated within minutes instead of the hours of preparation needed for liquid fuel missiles. So, all of that, really, pointing to this growing reliability, this maturing of the North Korean weapons program, which is very much illegal under strict U.N. sanctions. And the more they test, obviously, the more likely they will be able to refine the technology. So, that's why the U.S. and its allies in the regions are very concerned about this kind of defiance, this kind of progress and provocation from Pyongyang. Especially at a time when the North Koreans are growing closer to the Russians while maintaining very strong ties with the Chinese with their deputy foreign minister actually right here in Beijing, to reaffirm this friendship and the strengthening their strategic communication, Sara.",
