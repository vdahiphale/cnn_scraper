      "sentences": "Yes, Max. I think this picture -- this paints a picture here of what we could really expect over the eastern two thirds of the country. And we've got over 50 million Americans traveling this weekend. So, this weather means business, especially if you're on the roads or if you're flying in the skies as well.Can't forget about the Black Friday specials that are going on across many of the stores and outlets throughout the United States right now. So, people need to add a little bit of an extra time to get to their destinations. Maybe they're going to take advantage of some of those savings at the storms. But getting out of the nitty-gritty in terms of the weather today, let's focus in on the snow over at Southeastern New Mexico, Western Texas, this is where we have winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories, up to a foot of snow possible. Then, into the Houston metro area, the potential for flash flooding exists today. You can see the flood watch in existence across that particular region. Radar lighting up like a Christmas tree, even though we're still in the Thanksgiving season, right? Rain across the southwest. And then we look towards the southwest, this is another area of low pressure. So, two distinct different storm systems. And these are actually going to work together to create a very soggy end to the holiday weekend for the Gulf as well as the east coast. So, let's take you forward in time. Here's the first storm system that brings rain to the southeast this morning. And then these one fires up and brings another round of rain to an already saturated Houston area, that means the potential for flash flooding does exist and that flash flood exists -- threat will stretch into the southern portion of the Gulf Coast, including New Orleans for the day on Saturday. This system marches up the east coast, many people trying to get home on Sunday, of course, this long holiday weekend, so many people traveling at the airports. You can actually follow the forecast weather delays that we're anticipating. Here's a look at Saturday, Dallas, Houston, Memphis, you can see the moderate delays. But look what's coming at you along the east coast, the major metropolitans anyway from Dallas into Laguardia, JFK, northward into Boston, these are areas that we anticipate moderate flight delays just because of the sheer volume of people traveling, but also you and into that the potential for heavy rainfall moving to the eastern seaboard. So, plenty of travel headaches coming up. Max.",
