I think that was the word he used, manage the relationship. What should we know? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Poppy, good morning. We are currently watching such a significant piece of history unfold in U.S./China relations. The two leaders of these two superpowers have now been meeting for well over an hour here in Bali on the sidelines of the G20 summit. And you saw when the two men greeted each other, there was a real warmth and almost familiarity. But they expressed to each other as they talked about the fact that they've known each other for years, the importance of their bilateral relationship, and the fact that they need to keep open minds of communication going forward. This is all pretty remarkable if you think about the fact that this meeting is taking place at such a real low point for U.S./China relations, exacerbated in part by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit to Taiwan. Taiwan is just going to be one of the very challenging issues that the two leaders are going to be discussing. And I should just note, we don't know when exactly we will see President Biden emerge from this meeting. U.S. officials have said that they have set aside at least a couple of hours for the two men to talk. But again, there is no time limit set on this important summit.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so let's just sort of lay out where things sort of are and sort of the uphill climb that Democrats are sort of facing. Right?So if we just look at the districts right now, not just where we projected a victory, but also where difference candidates are leading of the different parties, what you see is that Republicans are up in 222 districts to Democrats' 213. Now obviously, we're not there yet where we can project a Republican win in the United States House of Representatives. So let's kind of go through the math and give you an understanding of why it can be sort of potentially difficult for Republicans to lose that lead and for Democrats to kind of come back. But we'll start off with sort of the easiest of the easy seats where Democrats can gain. So this is California House 13. This is one that we discussed on Friday. You can see here, that Adam Gray, the Democrat, is down by well less than a percentage point. He's down by just 84 votes. When we spoke on Friday, he was down by about two points. Well, over -- in the thousands of votes. So this is an easy type of district. But then it gets significantly harder from there. So we'll go to California's 22nd District. David Valadao is up by 5 percentage points, with about a 3,000-vote lead. When we spoke on Friday, that lead was 8 percentage points. But look here. Just 39 percent of the estimated vote in. This is the type of district that, back in 2018, this old district -- it wasn't numbered the 22nd -- but Valadao was running. He held a lead until about a month after the election. I'm not saying we're going to be here for a month. I hope not. But this gives you an idea that we might be in for the long haul. But then let's go to Arizona 1. Because I think this really gets at why it's so difficult for Democrats to make up the ground that they need to in order to take back the House. You can see here the incumbent, David Schweikert, is ahead. And you can see now that there's 96 percent of the estimated vote in. When we were speaking on Friday, Schweikert was trailing. He has gained and gained and gained as more mail votes have come in from the district, the 1st District of Arizona. So it's not just about Democrats gaining back districts where they've been trailing the entire time. It's about holding onto the leads in the districts that they currently have. And this is an example of a district where they weren't able to do that.",

Perhaps you know this early in the morning, I'm not sure you can necessarily read it.But what essentially, it is, when you have a tie in the United States Senate, it basically slows everything down. And you need to discharge votes that essentially are needed to get a full Senate to vote. And it takes hours of debate. And this is especially a case where you're trying to run through traditional nominations, and there are a lot of them that are out there. It just slows the pace down. Having a true majority lessens the chance of a tie. It speeds things up. And also, important for Democrats, there's less reliance on moderates like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.

I know the Jewish people have been through terrible things all over the world, but -- but you can't blame that on black Americans. You just -- you just can't.

But, you know, Chappelle has this very sort of -- he's on a pedestal in terms of his position in the culture. SNL puts him on after big elections. And his show, \"The Chappelle Show,\" was known, basically, for straddling the line with kind of spiky commentary on race, et cetera. I think the problem right now is that he's sort of dragging into the limelight a kind of black strain of anti-Semitism from the '90s, but he's not reckoning with it with the same precision that he does with, say, Trump voters. So earlier in the monologue -- you didn't play it -- but he spoke about the appeal of Trump to certain voters who -- he called Trump an honest liar. The idea that Trump somehow was exposing political and economic sort of imbalances and exploitation that he could take advantage of that the average person couldn't.
