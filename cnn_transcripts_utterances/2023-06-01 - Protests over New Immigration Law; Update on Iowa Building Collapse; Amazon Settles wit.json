      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWS CENTRAL.Topping our headlines this hour, sources tell CNN federal prosecutors have a tape of former President Donald Trump admitting that he held on to a classified Pentagon document. On the recording the former president suggests he wanted to share the document but that he knew he had a limited ability to declassify records once he left the White House. It could be another important piece of evidence for the special counsel investigating Trump's handling of classified documents and possible obstruction of justice. Also at this hour, as soon as today the Senate could vote on the deal to raise the debt ceiling. It won bipartisan support and passed the House yesterday. Both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, they are pushing for a speedy resolution here, but given Senate rules, any one senator can very easily slow passage down if they want to stand in its way. So stand by to stand by on that. And also this just in, the U.S. economy is seeing a slight uptick in weekly jobless claims. It's the highest reading in four weeks, coming in at 232,000 people filing for first time unemployment insurance. That's an increase of 2,000 claims from the previous week. John.",

It is being called \"A Day Without Immigrants.\" It's happening in Florida, California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, South Carolina and Texas. In Florida, some Latino-owned businesses will close their shops for the whole day. It is largely in response to an anti-immigration measure signed into law by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. CNN's Carlos Suarez joins us now from Immokalee, in Florida. Carlos, what are you seeing so far? CARLOS SUAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, we are expecting hundreds if not thousands of undocumented workers to take part in a work stoppage here in Immokalee later this afternoon. We are in Immokalee. That is a farming community to the east of Fort Myers where several businesses, restaurants, even the catholic church has told us they are going to close for the day. Yesterday we were over in West Palm Beach where we caught up with the owner of a Mexican restaurant who told us that a third of his staff, a third of his workers have quit because of this new immigration law. He said that a majority of his staff is undocumented and that the folks that quit told him they were moving out of Florida. Here is a part of our conversation where he was a bit emotional in describing some of the extra work that him and his partners now have to pick up, but also the impact that this is having on the folks closest to him, his workers.

Rahel, you point on something very interesting here. I think some people forgot that he had already faced these incidents in a courtroom and it was a mistrial several years ago.

The sherpa wrapped the climber up, put him on his back, and carried him down, descending nearly 2,000 feet.
