And there's a giant reality check, on that floating pier, to rush emergency aid into Gaza. Blocked by land, now months delayed at sea. And there's word, tonight, of a deadly accident, while dropping aid from the air, as Biden is caught on a hot mic, revealing what he wants from Netanyahu. And my frank conversation, with four women in power, fighting back in the flashpoint, over abortion rights, sharing four very personal stories. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Joe Biden went there tonight, the President bringing the heat, as he kicked off a march through battleground states. This time, he dropped the whole my-predecessor stuff that you heard 13 times, last night, in the State of the Union. Now, he's just calling out Trump by name, all while the presumptive Republican nominee is welcoming a new house guest, who just happens to be the man redefining what it means to be a modern-day dictator. The incumbent president shows no signs of slowing down, his fiery combative State of the Union message, from last night. Tonight, his plan of attack is on full display. Joe Biden wants to cast the 2024 election in no uncertain terms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES7: Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans are trying to take away our freedoms. That's not an exaggeration. Well guess what?

We had to escape Idi Amin in Uganda. And I know what that's like. So, when you have that personal experience, with dictatorships, and defending democracy, you understand it. But not everybody feels this way. I've had numerous conversations with Republican operatives even, who don't feel like the defending- democracy message is good.

But once in office, really adopted the authoritarian playbook, which is something that Donald Trump has said he admires. This means, going capturing the referees of the state, the impartial institutions, the judiciary. One of the first things that Orban did when he came into power was to capture the court system. The second thing he did was he went after opposition players. He attacked the media. He made it -- had his friends buy up opposition critical media. And then, the third thing Orban did, to squelch democracy, in Hungary was, to tilt the playing field, to make it so as hard for the opposition to vote him out of office. And in particular, what Orban did was he gerrymandered the election system. So, it really was very difficult for his party to lose.

He walked into a situation, where the former President was denying that COVID even exists, and that it was just a farce, and that was fake. And the President embraced that, and went after it, and helped us move forward. And let's be real. I mean, I think the right likes to blame a lot, of what happened with inflation, the economy, on President Biden, which is just untrue. The inflation that happened was flat-out two words, corporate greed. It was consumer price gouging, and companies took advantage of that. And, but you look at the economy, and what the President's done. I mean, he's revived the community that was written off for dead. A plant was going to close. And now, there's two plants going up there. I mean, he worked with us, to fight for those things. He's worked with us to, with a just transition for the battery EV industry. And I think he really did a great job, last night, of just showing the difference. To me, last night, Joe Biden made it very clear that there's only one candidate fit to be President of the United States, between the two that are the front-runners. And that's Joe Biden.",

And this year, on International Women's Day, it is really a stark reality, for women, here in the United States that we are seeing reproductive freedom being eroded, right in front of our eyes. And so, I shared my story of having a miscarriage, and receiving the health care I needed, without question. Now, as we're looking at states, like Texas, and other states that have put these bans in place, women can no longer get that health care, that fundamental health care.

REP. SUSAN WILD (D-PA): So, I have to say Roe versus Wade was decided when I was in college. And I had gone to high school, with a very close friend, who had had an illegal abortion. It was highly traumatic for her. Years later, she learned that she was infertile, as a result of that abortion. But I thought that Roe versus Wade was the settled law of the land. That's what we were being promised, by candidates for the Supreme Court, who were being examined by the Senate, in connection with their confirmations. But, of course, we now know that it was not settled law. And so, when the Dobbs decision came down, I couldn't help but think back to my friend, in high school. I had been fortunate not to ever have to have an abortion myself. But I had known some who had. But what really resonated with me, were the number of women well into their 70s, 80s and 90s that reached out to me, and told me their story of illegal abortions, which I had never heard before.",

But I remembered, when I found out I was pregnant -- and didn't even think I could be pregnant, like I -- it was just like, this is what my friends say you do, and you miss your cycle, and I took a test. And it was, I was like, what? But I remembered my friends saying that, you call this place, and they'll, you know, you can have an abortion.
