The Syrian military says government troops had been forced to redeploy outside of the city. CNN's Ben Wedeman is closely following all of these developments for us. So just bring us up to speed and remind us again why it is so important as we're seeing this shift and we're seeing it happen so quickly in these last few days. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it was only a few days ago, Erica, that the rebels were on the northern edge of Hama. And today it appears that, after clashes on the -- from the north, the northeast and the northwest, that the government forces simply pulled out, pulled out of the city altogether. What we're seeing is rebels driving largely unopposed into the center of Hama, taking over, for instance, not only the city itself but also adjacent military bases. Some videos coming out of rebels driving by what is clearly an abandoned Syrian air force base, full of warplanes. We're also seeing videos of them taking control of helicopters and other military equipment. It does appear that the regime, after a few days of half-hearted resistance, simply has pulled out of the city. And they actually announced that they were doing it. This was an announcement from the Syrian army, that they're pulling out of Hama to spare civilian lives, which is -- you have to take that claim with a pinch of salt, given the history of the Syrian army and its treatment of civilians. Nonetheless, the fall of Hama really is just yet another massive blow to the regime in Damascus. Keep in mind, it was just last Friday that the rebels were able to take Aleppo, Syria's second largest city. And now they've taken over Hama, which is the fourth largest city and yet another city on the road to Damascus. Basically, what you have left is the city of Homs, which isn't far. It's about 30 kilometers south of Hama. And after that it's a straight drive to Damascus. And what we're seeing is that the regime clearly is on the back - - is on a real defensive. And despite occasional Russian air force airstrikes, they don't seem to be getting much assistance from the Russians, the Iranians or Hezbollah, all of whom have been distracted by their own conflicts elsewhere.",

Despite the quick gains, though, for these rebel forces, one analyst argues that the real test for HTS and other factions is not Aleppo, a city with a predominantly Sunni population and a small number of Christians, but rather it will be in how they deal with the Alawite villages in rural Hama. Orwa Ajjoub is a researcher at Malmo University, joining me now from Malmo, Sweden, and, of course, an expert and analyst on Syria and the region.

The Syrian army has been fighting for almost a decade or more now. And they have been suffering from lack of living conditions, lack of supports, lack of financial supports from the States. On the other hand, the position, the majority of these people who are fighting under the opposition have been displaced from Hama. So for them, it's a liberation battle. And they are willing to go above and beyond to do it. So there is this belief among the regime fighters that what they are fighting for, the enemy, which is, according to them, is the Syrian opposition, are coming to liberate their lands. So it's very difficult position the Syrian regime finds itself in, not only because of that but also because of the lack or like the Shia (ph) support that it has been receiving from Russia and Iran so far.",

He is asking the Russian government to abandon the Syrian regime, to build constructive relationship between Russia and the Syrian people. But again it's a difficult position. I mean, remember, this is Russia, only Mediterranean stronghold so far. So Russia, I don't think Russia is willing to abandon Assad. Maybe there is some lack of interest at the beginning.

Not only now in the wake of this Amnesty International report but, of course, most prominently in defending themselves against allegations by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. This time, the Israeli military was responding to this report, calling it, quote, \"entirely baseless,\" saying that these allegations of genocide are, quote, \"not only unfounded but also ignore Hamas' violations of international law,\" such as its use of civilians as human shields. Amnesty International does note, however, that while Hamas has violated international law through -- by embedding with the civilian population, for example, that does not preclude Israel of its responsibilities and responsibilities for abiding by the laws of war and not committing crimes against humanity. And that is exactly what the Amnesty International report is accusing Israel of, saying that there is, quote, \"sufficient evidence\" to believe that Israel has committed the crime of genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza. This is a 296-page report that focuses on evidence from Gaza over the course of nine months of war. Saying that Israel has committed three out of the five prohibited acts under the U.N.'s Genocide Convention, accusing Israel of indiscriminate attacks, destruction of civilian infrastructure and the mass forced displacement of Palestinians, some 90 percent of whom have now been displaced from their homes over the course of this 14 month war. And so they conclude that the only reasonable inference from all of this evidence is that genocidal intent, they say, has been part and parcel of Israel's conduct in Gaza. It is important to note, however that Amnesty International's branch here in Israel, Amnesty Israel, has issued a dissent to this report, saying that many in their branch have doubts regarding whether or not you can actually prove unequivocally that the intent of all of these military actions in Gaza actually is the intent of genocide. They do, however, make very clear that they do not dispute that the conduct of the Israeli military in Gaza raises suspicions of crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing -- Erica.",

We're learning from sources, me (ph) and John Miller, that this gunman stayed there for a couple of days. Now it's not clear if that's the entirety of his stay or if it was just part of it. So there's still some questions there. But what came from the search of that hostel? We're learning from sources is that they were able to get an image of this gunman, either in the checkin process or the checkout process, where this gunman is not wearing a mask. He just has a hood on. And it's possible, if it's good enough of an image, police may circulate that to hopefully try to identify who this person is. Something interesting we also learned about his stay at that hostel, he stayed in a room with two other people. But the entire time he was there, other than that one time at checkin or checkout, he was wearing a mask. We've seen a lot of images from the Starbucks not far from where we are, from the shooting that actually happened right here behind me, from his getaway. He has a mask on the entire time. According to our sources, he kept that mask on for a good portion of his movements here in New York City. So an interesting note there. Another thing I just wanted to highlight, as we're learning new details about this investigation, we've learned through sources that, in his getaway, we've talked about how he dropped a cell phone and a water bottle. We've learned from police that they were able to get fingerprints from those two things. However, they didn't bring back any names. That doesn't mean it's a dead end. According to our sources, though, that could mean that, if they do get a name, they'll able to backtrack to those fingerprints and maybe that will help with the investigation. So a couple little threads there.

Today, he's one of Russia's youngest political prisoners, arrested at 15 years old and now facing five years in a penal colony, found guilty on terrorism charges. He was accused of joining a Russian paramilitary group fighting for Ukraine. He admits he contacted them but denies joining. On Russia's National Day in June last year, he staged a solo protest, posting on YouTube, saying, \"I'm against Putin\" and \"Freedom for political prisoners.\" Now Turbin is one of at least three dozen teenagers who are jailed in Russia for political reasons, among Russia's almost 3,000 citizens facing criminal prosecution on political grounds. Human rights group OVD-Info has tracked these cases and told CNN there are at least 16 teenagers that they know of but almost certainly more who were detained after Russia invaded Ukraine and the Kremlin dramatically cracked down on dissent, including by minors.

So that gives you an idea of the kind of abuses and neglect that it has experienced. And that's because, although the Philippines has really good environmental laws, we lack the political will to implement these laws. If we protect the land, what we've seen is that nature renews itself. Biodiversity comes back. The water sources come back. Climate action is there because it absorbs carbon  at the same time prevents, right, floods and landslides, which are so common in metro Manila. So an investment in land is an investment in all of those real conventions but also in the economy, because it's so closely linked to agriculture to jobs, to livelihoods.",

Now we have been supporting more small and marginal farmers by converting their one acre of land into agroforestry. I have seen these chemically degraded farmland converting into a beautiful agroforestry producing any number of varieties of fruits cereals, pulses and vegetables. And I have seen how the multi cropping patterns in this agroforestry has been generating a sustainable income to the small and marginal farmers. It's not just generating the sustainable income to the farmers but it is impacting their children's. They are able to gain the better educational opportunities. They are getting able to afford the better healthcare facilities because the income is very much important.",

Obviously it's having a wild moment, riding that high after president Trump's reelection. But as you mentioned, crossing that $100,000 mark, that's $100,000 per bitcoin. It's something we've been watching for weeks now. And it happened just yesterday after president-elect Trump announced his SEC chair pick, Paul Atkins. And this is the gentleman who was actually SEC commissioner. So he has some experience. And he is known to be a supporter of cryptocurrency, of bitcoin. So he's expected to have a little bit of a lighter touch as it relates to cryptocurrency, compared to the current SEC chair, Gary Gensler, who has been a little more heavy handed and has been very open about sort of stopping the expansion of cryptocurrency in the U.S. because of its volatility. But as you mentioned, president-elect Trump really wasn't initially a supporter of cryptocurrency. He sort of did a 180 in the months leading up to his reelection. He was the featured speaker at Bitcoin 2024. He started a company called Liberty Financial with his family, a cryptocurrency company. And he's surrounded himself with cryptocurrency fans, most notably Elon Musk. He's even thinking about appointing a crypto czar. That would be the first of its kind in any presidential administration. But ultimately, the president doesn't have any power over cryptocurrency right now. It's just the supporters are liking what they're hearing from him and his picks and his administration.
