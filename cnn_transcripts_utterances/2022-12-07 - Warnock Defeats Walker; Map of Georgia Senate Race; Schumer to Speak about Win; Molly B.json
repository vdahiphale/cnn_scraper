A New York jury has found his family business guilty of multiple crimes, including criminal tax fraud, while the January 6th committee is mulling possible criminal referrals to the Justice Department. All of this as the DOJ subpoenas more officials involved in attempts to overturn election results as part of its investigation. We do, however, begin this morning with the Senate runoff in Georgia. CNN correspondent Amara Walker is in Atlanta. Amara, this is quite a win for Warnock. Break it down for us. AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jim, this was such a competitive, hard-fought race with nearly $400 million that was poured into this competition. And, as you said, Senator Raphael Warnock prevailed in this, winning a full six-year term. And his win really underscores several things. First off, that Georgia truly is a swing state. This is something that Georgia Democrats have been watching very closely and they will clearly use this win as a blueprint as they look towards 2024. It also highlights the Democrats' really tenacious ground game. Obviously that was set up by Stacey Abrams. But, as you may know, Georgia, after the 2020 presidential election, passed that controversial new voting law that shortened the time period between the general election in November and this runoff from nine to four weeks and then it also reduced the number of early voting days. During that early voting period, we saw the GOP pushing to ban that Saturday voting after Thanksgiving. That clearly backfired as we saw a surge in early voting. And this is what Raphael Warnock was hoping for, that surge would give him that cushion for election day. And that's exactly what happened. The last thing that it really highlighted was the turnout right here in Georgia. Interest in this election was immense, even though it was a runoff. And 3.5 million people turned out. And earlier this morning, the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger talked about and touted the turnout, but also reflected on the loss for his party. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And one of the ways they are thinking about that is trying to ensure that in a primary election that they are propping up the most electable candidates so that person can turn around and win a general election.The fear from a lot of lawmakers we've been talking to is that you are basically having people win primaries that can't turn around and get the kind of support they need to win in the suburbs, like John Berman was talking about, and actually win those general elections. The National Republican Senatorial Committee did not get involved in primaries this cycle, and that is a question mark going forward. Should they? Would they get involved to insure that at the end of the day, when the general election happens, they are able to actually win up the score here in some of these races that they just weren't able to perform in this time around? Now, also in the next hour we are going to hear from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is going to be celebrating the fact that Democrats feel like they really did a good job recruiting these candidates and, obviously, supporting incumbent Senator Raphael Warnock. It's a big change for Schumer. Even though it's only one more vote, it's a huge deal in terms of the committees because it really could help Democrats expedite how quickly they can move nominations through. It can make it easier for them to subpoena and do investigations that they want to pursue. It also means that Chuck Schumer just has a little bit more leeway when it comes to some of these votes that he wants to move forward. Over the last two years, the story on The Hill has been, where's Joe Manchin going to be, where's Kyrsten Sinema going to be? He now can afford to lose one vote. He doesn't need entire unity of his party. Of course, the big catchall here is the fact that then the bill has to go over to the House of Representatives, which is now going to be controlled by Republicans. Jim and Erica.",

If you recall, when he first ran for president, he always held this threat over the Republican Party's heads that he could take his people and leave. And he still could do that. And Republicans know that. They know that there is a portion of the party base that is intensely loyal to Donald Trump, they love him. And to your point, that's why when Trump says, this is who I want to be the candidate, that candidate almost automatically wins the primary.So we have heard a lot of finger pointing and scapegoating by Republican officials.

He was successfully recruited by the Democrats for this very tough race two years ago and chose to take it on, probably in part because there was not a Trump-like figure out there, as we've seen, just waiting so many otherwise qualified Republicans who might have otherwise run for Senate.So, this was a recruiting win for the Democrats and now we are seeing that pay dividends.
