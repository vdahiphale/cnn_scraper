But not everybody in these meetings is happy. It got heated at some time. And I understand that they've now asked for a postponement. But what we understand is that it's leaning toward a seven member presidential panel. And when you think about this, you know, this panel is going to have the powers of the presidency. So it's like seven presidents, it's what people are looking at this and trying to figure out what does that mean. I think what the international community learned today, that despite their criticism of the process, up until now that it's very difficult to get Haitians to arrive, you know, at a consensus, and you're not going to be able to make everybody happy. And while they made it seemed or allowed them to believe that they were, you know, giving their opinions and they were coming at this, there was definitely a lot of nudging on the part of CARICOM leaders and the United States from individuals that I spoke to who were part of this process.",

Now, right now there's no timetable on that would happen. But also what is key here is whether or not he wouldn't be able to even return to Haiti. That's been the problem so far as he remains in Puerto Rico.Now to the war and situation in Gaza, Israeli officials say an offensive in the southern city of Rafah is not imminent. They say the IDF has not yet built up the forces needed for a ground incursion, and plans for civilian evacuation have not been finalized. More than 1 million people are currently sheltering in that city. Israeli officials say although a potential evacuation could take at least two weeks. And offensive into Rafah during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, they say has not been ruled out. Meantime, the U.N. Secretary General is calling everyone involved in the fighting to, quote, honor the spirit of Ramadan by silencing the guns and releasing all the hostages in Gaza. Antonio Guterres is also asking Israel and Hamas to return to peace or ceasefire talks. And although the U.S. military air dropped more food and drinking water into Gaza much more, of course is needed.

Do you see anything changing that in the next few weeks?DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: You know, you hear a couple of theories back and forth, Paula, about what might change it and ways that the Democrats might find a way to get around the opposition of some of the House leaders and get this to a vote. I don't think there's much doubt that if this come -- if Ukraine aid comes to a direct vote in the House of Representatives, it will pass probably by a fairly wide margin. But the problem is getting it there. And that's why there's all this discussion of procedural methods that will work its way around. I think there are a lot of Republicans who are quite concerned about being tagged as basically the folks who are siding with Putin on the work. And I think many of them are finding themselves deeply uncomfortable with that.

So there are a couple of factors that are in place here.First of all, there's more production ramping up in the United States at the big facility in Scranton, which is right near where President Biden grew up, it's actually just a few miles from the house he grew up in. And in Europe, I've just been in Berlin for several months. And there's a new facility that is ramping up as well in Germany. But these won't be coming online with significant production until probably early next year, maybe the middle of next year. And the question is, do the Ukrainians have a future that's that long. And the problem is not just artillery. It's also that with the absence of funding, you can't get the air defenses to the Ukrainians, and that's what they need to take down the drones and missiles.",

I remember when we interviewed him on foreign policy in 2016. During his first run for president, he made the argument that this was the Europeans problem, and they needed to care about it more than the U.S. did.Well, the Europeans are now largely stepped up. The E.U. was just announced $54 billion over four years for the reconstruction work in Ukraine, but they simply don't have the military capacity to go give the Ukrainians what they want, and the U.S. does. And it'll be a really interesting historical question if Ukraine loses territory or has to come to a badly negotiated settlement with the Russians, of whether that fell in the hands of the U.S. Congress. President Trump and his advocates would say this is not what the United States needs to be doing. Former Republicans, George W.

And one man on board tells CNN the pilot checked on passengers after landing and said he lost control of the plane after his gauges malfunctioned. Here's how that passenger described what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRIAN JOKAT, PASSENGER ON LATAM AIRLINES FLIGHT LA800: It was -- it was -- it was like a scene out of a movie, where actually -- you're actually in the movie. I had dozed off and, luckily, had my seat belt engaged. And the next thing you know, the plane as I've kind of looked, kind of learn to understand, dropped something to the effect of 500 feet instantly. And then have the effect of it coming like a roller coaster and then started to point down. And that's when it -- and I opened my eyes, and there was various individuals at the top of the plane just stuck to the roof, and then they fell to the floor. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The zipper on Kate's sweater is misaligned.QUEST (voice-over): The other big agencies, Reuters and AFP, were quick to issue their own kill notices, telling news outlets not to use the image. Then, more than 24 hours after she posted it, the Princess of Wales apologized, saying, \"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing.\" At one level, this is nothing more than an amateur photographer getting it wrong. But the underlying issue is the fact that the Princess of Wales has not been seen since having unspecified abdominal surgery back in January. This grainy photograph taken on Monday as Kate traveled to a private appointment with William, is one of the few images that's surfaced since then. We don't know what editing she did. And the palace haven't released the unedited version. So is this just an amateur photographer's learning experience, or is there something more to the picture that's fueled a thousand words of speculation? Richard Quest, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
