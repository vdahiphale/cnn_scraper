Horrors striking a city center as a top Russian investigative reporter has new details for us about the phone calls leading up to the insurrection against Putin. That reporter, Christo Grozev, is my guest.And my full explosive interview with the Ukrainian foreign minister, why he thinks the threat to Putin is far from over, and his fears of an attack on Europe's largest nuclear power plant here. Plus, a Wagner commander speaks out to CNN about Yevgeny Prigozhin's bold coup attempt and what's next for the man who humiliated Vladimir Putin. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. We are live tonight in eastern Ukraine, in the city of Dnipro, a city on the road to the front lines of Putin's war. Behind me, you see blackness. But there is a city behind me of nearly 1 million people. It is just completely dark. After curfew completely dark, the street lights behind me are all shut off because Dnipro is a target, something that we've witnessed firsthand, the haunting sounds of air raid sirens have gone off multiple times tonight. Since the start of this war, the city has faced relentless barrage of missile attacks. The people here know they can suffer death or destruction at any moment. And tonight in Kramatorsk, another city in the hot zone of eastern Ukraine, a horrific scene, Russian missiles tearing through a busy city center, hitting a restaurant, a pizza restaurant, at least four people were killed including a child. Bodies still being pulled from the rubble. An area filled with restaurants that are popular both with residents and the military, we understand filled with children tonight. In fact, Roman Trokhymets, the Ukrainian soldier, a familiar face to many of you who watch OUTFRONT, was there tonight with his sister Lila. And she posted this video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Images of Russians cheering Wagner forces would've sent chills through the Kremlin.Not all Russians welcomed the munity, but few turned out to resist it either, despite what the Kremlin says. And what of the man who exposed this serious crack in Kremlin authority? Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Wagner leader, has now arrived in neighboring Belarus, according to its officials, after charges of insurrection against him and his fighters in Russia were dropped. It's possible Wagner fighters could now work alongside the Belarusian military, suggests Alexander Lukashenko, the country's leader. Though he said no camps for them had yet been built. The Russian defense ministry says the mercenary group must first surrender its heavy weapons. And the Kremlin, which now admits fully funding Wagner, says it will investigate how more than a billion dollars recently paid for salaries and bonuses was really spent. Back at the Kremlin, silence for the Russian pilots killed in Prigozhin's uprising. Putin may find it hard to forgive a man who shattered his image of control and who he says stabbed Russia in the back.

Now, one thing we can imagine that this was probably corroborated by some British intelligence that was leaked was that there may have been some pressure on relatives of either Prigozhin or on other senior members of the Wagner private military company. Now, this has happened before Russian domestic intelligence services have put pressure, for example, in the Chechen war, they would kidnap members of the family of the Chechen warlords at that time. And that was seen as one of the reasons that the sort of demise of the uprising in Chechnya was accelerated. So, I can imagine that something similar came to the minds of the FSB this time as well.",

While the situation appears diffused for now, many who dare to defy Putin paid a heavy price.A fierce Kremlin critic, Boris Nemtsov, was once one of Russia's promising opposition leaders. Jailed several times for speaking out against Putin's government. But in 2015, on a Friday night, just steps away from the Kremlin, Nemtsov was shot and killed. A dissident voice silenced. Five Chechen men were later found guilty and sentenced to over a decade in prison. Oppose Mr. Putin's rule, threaten his establishment, and life can turn into one behind bars. Once the wealthiest man in Russia, former oil tycoon, Mikhail Khodorkovsky crossed the line with Putin when he began to promote reform and accused him of corruption. Khodorkovsky was charged with tax fraud, a charge he says was politically motivated. Putin, then the prime minister, was asked about the case, and he replied, a thief should be in prison. The maximum prison sentence was given to the Kremlin critic and he spent years behind bars. Alexey Navalny, a stanched Russian opposition leader, critical of Putin, fell into a coma on a flight returning to Moscow three years ago. He was later medevaced to Germany where he recovered, investigations later concluded he was poisoned with a nerve agent. Navalny vowed to keep fighting, an opposition threat lingered. As he landed in Russia months later, he was arrested. Now, held in a maximum security prison, Navalny faces a term extension that could see him behind bars for decades. It's a fate seen many times over when someone crosses Mr. Putin, and not all can escape, not even living in exile. Wagner's Yevgeny Prigozhin may have found a haven in Belarus for now but his safety seems fragile at best. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
