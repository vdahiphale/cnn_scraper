Barak, you know the ins and outs of these things better than pretty much anyone.

This hostage deal is very connected to what's going on, on the ground. And any small incident that happens on the ground can change everything. But I think that what stands behind what Jon Finer said is that Hamas after a few days, that they went underground, did not speak to the Qatari mediators.
