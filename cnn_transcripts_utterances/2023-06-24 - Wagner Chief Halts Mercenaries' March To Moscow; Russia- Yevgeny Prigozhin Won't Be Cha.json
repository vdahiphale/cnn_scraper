      "sentences": "Yes, an utterly bizarre end to a 24 hours that's clearly shaken the control of Vladimir Putin over Russia, certainly.We may learn what the real reason is. On the surface, what we're hearing at this time, Jim, is the suggestion that a phone call from the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko may have made some potential intervention here suggesting a way out for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He has made no real public statement as to why he made this abrupt 180 when he says he was 125 miles from the outskirts of Moscow, apart from say, as you heard there, he wanted to avoid bloodshed. So you might perhaps see that you saw his forces so unimpeded marching towards the capital, that perhaps lost his nerve, that would seem highly unlikely given how prepared some of these units were over some time. Maybe he didn't get the support he had hoped along the way or more likely, there is something else that we simply don't know about at the moment, Jim. And remarkably, the Kremlin sort of laid out a very simple series of solutions after a day in which frankly, their grip on power had seemed in doubt. Yevgeny Prigozhin will go to Belarus, they say. He was pictured leaving Rostov. He has made no comment on that proposal. His fighters involved in this march on Moscow as it is being termed, well, they won't be persecuted or prosecuted, they will be given a sense of immunity after their heroic acts on the frontline. That's according to the Kremlin. And those in Wagner, the mercenary group Prigozhin heads who want to join the Ministry of Defense can do so. So a sort of nice bow, frankly, wrapped in a day of utter chaos, but it doesn't really make any sense how this morning, Yevgeny Prigozhin is marching on Moscow, demanding the top brass of Russia's military are kicked out. He's accused blackmail terrorist methods by Russian president, Vladimir Putin who says he must inevitably be punished and those alongside him, and now suddenly, it's all forgotten and he is in exile in Belarus. It doesn't make sense. We're clearly missing information here. What is absolutely clear, though, is that the Putin administration, the Putin regime looks like it has significantly weakened its grip on power over the last 48 hours -- Jim.",

You saw that not only was Prigozhin directly insubordinate in the last week, when first the Minister of Defense and then Putin himself said that we demand that all of these paramilitary troops have to sign contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense.Kadyrov with the Chechen paramilitary immediately said yes; Prigozhin said no. You don't get to say no to the Russian president. I don't care how many successes you have on the ground in Ukraine. So it was clear that things were coming to a head. And Prigozhin had a serious problem, right? Because if he had said yes after all of the fight he was having with the Ministry of Defense, and was going to let his troops essentially sign contracts, and then report up to them, he loses his influence on the ground. If he refuses to do that, then he is insubordinate with Putin. Either way, he is sort of holding on by a thread. So basically, in a corner, he rolls the dice and says, I'm going all in, I'm attacking Moscow. Well, he got to Rostov. He got to Voronezh and then he stopped. Did he lose his nerve? Did he not have any influence in Moscow? Did he recognize that he was going to lose and people that he thought was going to go with him didn't? We don't know any of those things. But what we know is he embarrassed Putin. He made Putin look weak in front of his own population. And as a consequence, this deal, which is, as you say, the Kremlin getting most of what they want, what they want, is not a traitor, to the Russian nation, and to Putin, who Putin himself actually created in power, going free. So it is very hard to imagine that Prigozhin is going to be comfortable and with us for very much longer.",

I don't know. We know the Kadyrov who said he was going back to Russia to fight against Wagner now can stay in Ukraine. So I mean, the Russians still have the troops. They have been putting up a good defensive fight against the Ukrainians in the last few weeks since the counteroffensive has started, it hasn't gone as well for the Ukrainians, as many in the west and NATO had anticipated. But definitely the Russians are going to look weaker in their capacity to continue to fight on the ground in Ukraine as a consequence of what we've seen over the last 24 hours. And if that means that the Ukrainians are able to threaten some of Putin's self-announced red lines, Crimea's territorial integrity, the land bridge that the Russians control, well, I mean, then the potential for Putin to do something truly desperate goes up.",

MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: You know, Jim, I'm going to go a different track, if you don't mind. This is fascinating to me. I've been struggling with this all day long, because, you know, Prigozhin is a mercenary leader. He's an oligarch. He has all of these characteristics. We thought this was going to be a potential for a coup, but then I kind of hit the books this afternoon and I realized that's -- the reason we're having trouble describing this is this is a throwback to previous centuries. In a modern day state like Russia, alleged modern day state, what we have is a warlord. He is defined as someone who is accountable to no one, who has no ideology, who rules by patronage. He flourishes when a central government is extremely weak and that describes Russia right now, and he further fragments politics, military actions, and economics. That's what a warlord does. So what we have is a 21st century warlord and it is just confusing all of us, because he's just acting on his own. He's a free floating electron in a time bomb and he is causing all kinds of trouble.

And here's why, Jim, for a couple of reasons.They engaged gunfire today with the Russian military. They shot down multiple aircrafts. They killed a bunch of pilots flying helicopters and jets. So when you when you devolve that trust, when you don't have trust between brothers in arms, you're going to fail. There has been a bunch of losers in today's actions and I would suggest Putin is one, Shoigu is one because he's been undercut, certainly Gerasimov to a degree, the chief of the Russian forces, and Prigozhin is a big loser. Now he, he may or may not have to taste the soup or stay away from windows, I don't know, because he does have that charismatic background, but all of the individuals who are his fighters are now going to become, we would call them super vet bros. They are going to think they're now larger than life, and they are going to be hated by their fellow soldiers. They may get some charisma from the local population as we saw Prigozhin Rostov-on-Don and getting the cheers and everything, but he is not to be trusted. And Putin is now the biggest failure in all of this because he is caught between a dog and a fire hydrant of supporting Prigozhin or supporting Shoigu, his minister of Defense, while continuous actions are occurring on the battlefield and things just keep getting worse for the Russian republic or the Russian Federation and the Russian military.

Fred, you've been looking into exactly who Prigozhin is.

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, I think you're absolutely right, Jim, to say that elusive at least for the large part of his career is definitely absolutely correct when describing Yevgeny Prigozhin. In fact, things started pretty bad for him.He was in jail, actually, in the Soviet Union in the 1980s and then started off really small selling hotdogs in St. Petersburg, in the '90s. And then he started founding this catering company and that's when he became known as you put it, as Putin's chef. And that's when things really went up for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He then later founded a media company which, of course, gained massive notoriety in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where the U.S. says that that company meddled heavily in that election. Of course, Yevgeny Prigozhin was indicted for that. But if we look at the Wagner private military company, that certainly is an organization that we've seen in the battlefield and really across the world over the past couple of years. For instance, I was in Syria in 2016 and 2017, and we already saw Wagner operatives on the ground there at that point doing mostly base protection. But from there, it really professionalized in a big way. They started getting involved in the oil trade. They started going into diamonds and gold in African countries training forces there. But it really wasn't until the war here in Ukraine, I think that the Wagner private military company turned from being essentially a military company to being a full on army. You saw some of the battles in Bakhmut where I was on the receiving end of a barrage of mortars there once. And the heavy weapons use really was something that expanded. And so if you look at what's been going on now. If you look at the few that's going on between Yevgeny Prigozhin and the defense minister Sergei Shoigu, that's where that really built up where Yevgeny Prigozhin kept saying, look, Wagner is winning on the battlefield where the Russian military isn't, but then also accusing Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister of essentially starving Wagner of the weapons that they needed to win in places like Bakhmut. So it's a feud that's been going on for a very long time and really came to a head today and it looks as though Yevgeny Prigozhin for all the backing that he had from Vladimir Putin for being so close to Vladimir Putin, certainly it looks as though he went one step too far this time, Jim.",

All of these factors are going to have an impact on the battlefield. I will say one thing that does concern me is that the last 24 hours were probably a pretty good scare for a lot of capitals, including Washington and policymakers. They saw the potential collapse of Russia and thought about the impact of loose nukes.  And so I fear that there may be rejoicing, which sounds odd that Putin was - remain - was able to stay in power and that the country did not collapse. But I think that's the wrong message.
