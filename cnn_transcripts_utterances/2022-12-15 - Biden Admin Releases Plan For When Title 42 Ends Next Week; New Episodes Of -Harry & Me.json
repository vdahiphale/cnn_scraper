We're still seeing severe storms across portions of Central Florida as well. We still have a tornado threat across Central Florida. It's cleared out for Tampa and Orlando, but now making its way down to the south, Fort Myers, West Palm Beach will be next.So that threat will be winding down as we go throughout the day. Here is the snow. You can see the big cities are all rain: D.C., Philly, New York, you're in on the rain, I-95 corridor is clear of the snow. But we're looking at snow across interior sections and the biggest threat with this is really the ice. We're going to see icy conditions across this region. We've already had ice accumulation of more than a quarter of an inch, so this will definitely create some travel problems in this area as well as potential power outages when you talk about the snow weigh - or the ice, rather, weighing down on those power lines. So winter storm warnings are in effect across interior sections of the Northeast and New England, Boston, New York, Philly, D.C. all out of it, but that ice warning as well. So going forward in time, we're going to see the snow develop or continue, I should say, across northern Pennsylvania, Upstate New York. That's going to continue throughout the overnight hours, just a miserable cold rain for the I- 95 corridor and then that snow will finally lift to the north and get out of here by tomorrow, Victor and Bianna. But we do have windy and cold conditions across the Northeast and New England.",

But to be fair to both sides, they were telling me that this was them coming together for the Queen at a time when the whole nation should be unified. I don't - didn't get any sense that behind the scenes, they were coming together and certainly later on that week, the - it's pretty clear. And Emily, I'm sure, will confirm this as well, that the two sides weren't really speaking, because they were very discoordinated during that whole week.

This is exactly now what's happening to the rest of the family and they are not in a position to respond to everything that's being said. So I think that you have sympathy for everyone involved.

I mean, the institution wouldn't exist without a hierarchy. Charles will always be senior to William, will always be senior to Harry and that, I think, is something that Meghan, in particular, struggled with. Because she felt that when there were decisions, they would lean towards the more senior Royals, but that is what happens in an institution and she felt, and Harry felt that they weren't putting the people in the institution first. They're putting the institution first. I think, frankly, that is often what happens in a monarchy, but it wouldn't exist without that and they just weren't willing to compromise on that.

Will somebody else challenge him - I mean, I'm not naive, I do believe he'll get a challenge, many people will support the President of the United States, but probably get a challenge from the left, someone who thinks that maybe he's not progressive enough or whatever they may say, from the Bernie Sanders' wing of the party. I don't think that challenge is going to go anywhere, but the President has to be prepared to run a full campaign. At 80 some odd years old, he has to be prepared to maybe have a primary but definitely not have a COVID abbreviated general election and that's daunting for someone of any age.",

I'm not that old, but I do remember the Gang of Eight and how they came forward with some bipartisan immigration for portfolio in plan and policy proposal that was pooh-poohed and they were nearly run out of the United States Senate.
