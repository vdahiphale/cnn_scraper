      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us here in the United States, around the world and streaming us on CNN Max. I'm Rosemary Church.Just ahead. Time's up. It's deadline day for Donald Trump to post a whopping bond of nearly half a billion dollars in the civil fraud judgment against him. Four men appear in court to face charges in the terror attack on a Russian concert hall. We will discuss what motivated this deadly attack and the intelligence that may have prevented it. And more than 300 Nigerian school children were kidnapped by armed gunmen earlier this month. Now, dozens of them have finally been released, but the fate of the rest remains unclear. The details ahead in a live report. Good to have you with us. In the coming hours, Donald Trump will have two major legal threats colliding in New York. First, the former president is facing a critical deadline to post nearly half a billion dollars in bond money for the civil fraud judgment against him. That's cash, his lawyer says, he does not have on hand. If Trump fails to secure this bond, the state attorney general could begin seizing assets like his properties. But experts say his bank accounts should be handled first as they would be much easier to take. Meanwhile, Trump could also learn the new trial date for his delayed criminal hush money case. There will be a hearing where Trump's lawyers can argue for a longer postponement or to have the charges dismissed. The earliest the trial could begin is April 15th. And we get the latest now on Trump's legal troubles from CNN's Zachary Cohen.",

      "sentences": "If Donald Trump cannot secure a bond in his multimillion-dollar civil fraud judgment against him by Monday's deadline, he could see the New York attorney general start the process of seizing his assets. That's things like his bank accounts, things like his properties, all things that Donald Trump does not want to see prosecutors take away from him.But look, Trump personally owes over $450 million as a result of this judgment. He has indicated and claimed that he has enough cash to pay that to support a bond. In that case, his lawyers have corrected him saying no, he does not have that amount of cash on hand. But ultimately, if he cannot put up the money to postpone by Monday's deadline, that is when you could see the attorney general start to eye other things to make up for that cost. And look, experts say that prosecutors have already taken some steps to potentially signal that they are going to move to seize some of Trump's assets and properties in New York should he be unable to post that bond on Monday. Those are things like one of his golf courses in New York and another private estate that he has there. And at the same time, Donald Trump is also expected in court as proceedings continue as part of his New York criminal case. Now this case deals with the hush money payments that were allegedly made to porn star Stormy Daniels. These were payments allegedly made to cover up an affair between Daniels and Trump prior to the 2016 election. This trial -- this case was supposed to go to trial. The trial was supposed to start on Monday, but instead we're gonna have another pre- trial hearing. This is where Trump's attorneys will try to postpone a trial for as long as possible. They will argue that discovery issues require further delay. The district attorney's office in New York has argued that no further delay is needed. So ultimately, we're gonna have to see if a judge in this case could give more insight and more detail about a possible trial start date. It's already been delayed through at least mid-April, but it's possible the judge sides with the DA's office and gives us a trial date in New York before the 2024 election.

Investigators say the men are from Tajikistan and have been in Russia on either temporary or expired visas.Outside the concert hall, thousands of people gathered in the rain on Sunday to remember the victims.

We're talking theft, millions of dollars, gambling, and now an IRS and an MLB investigation.Let's sort of recap where we are right now. Shohei Ohtani's longtime interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired after Ohtani's attorneys accuse him of massive theft, millions of dollars, and placing bets with a bookmaker that's currently under a federal investigation. That's according to ESPN and \"The L.A. Times\" who first reported on this, and CNN did speak to a spokesperson with the IRS that confirmed that Ippei Mizuhara and a man by the name of Mathew Bowyer are both being investigated by the IRS. We spoke to Bowyer's attorney and here's what she said DIANE BASS, MATHEW BOWYER'S ATTORNEY:  We've learned during the course of the investigation is that Ohtani's name was on one of the wire transfers to Mr. Bowyer's organization to cover a bet. But as far as Mr. Bowyer understood, the bet was from Ippei or it was being covered by Mr. Ohtani for Ippei.",

Ohtani's reps first telling ESPN that he was aware of the gambling debt, then later saying he had no knowledge of any of this, and Mizuhara's speaking to ESPN initially said that he'd asked Ohtani to pay his debts and the he had agreed to do so. But later, walking everything back, saying that he lied and that Ohtani had no knowledge of any of this.So again, a lot of questions and major implications when it comes to these investigations because of the fact that Ohtani is a worldwide baseball star. And because of the fact that he did sign that massive $700 year deal with the Dodgers. We are being told that Ohtani will likely speak to the media on Monday. That's according to a number of media outlets. So, of course, a lot of people having questions for Ohtani about this entire situation. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
