Both are embodied by the op-ed that former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan wrote for this Sunday's \"New York Times.\" In it, he writes: \"To once again be a successful governing party, we must move on from Mr. Trump.\" He also takes him without naming him, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, in what he refers to as \"angry, divisive and performative politics.\" Now in Hogan's view, the party needs someone other than Trump or DeSantis, a non-divisive common sense conservative who can broaden the party's base, someone his arguments just like him. The irony is he is writing those words in an op-ed explaining why he is not running for President, which with all due respect to candidates, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy right now leaves the fields the top polling figures in the party, which is Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Each spoke over the weekend and though Governor DeSantis at the Reagan Library was more measured in tone than the former President at the Conservative Political Action Committee convention, both portrayed themselves as leaders in a culture war.

And it was a pretty, you know, large audience in the Reagan Library, about 1,300 people, sold out.He has been doing these stops as part of his book tour, but he is clearly testing a message and he is clearly drawing a contrast with Trump. And I think this weekend was probably the sharpest display that we've seen of that, of the contrast between the two of them. You know, DeSantis' comment that really stood out to me was where he talked about how in his administration in Florida, they never had leaks, they never had palace intrigue, that they executed their agenda with surgical precision, you know, making those comments basically saying, this is not what happened when Trump was in office, trying to appeal to the Trump voters while making sure that he distinguishes himself from Trump.",

You're proud that you can't find common ground with half the people in your State, or just less than half the people in your State who are liberals and progressives. You're proud that you're beating up on transgender kids, and showing them no sympathy, no empathy, and at least understanding what they're going through. You may disagree with some of the medical procedures, but you've got to show some empathy for those families. You're proud you have no empathy for these kids. And you think this is going to be rewarded, and the only distinction you want to draw with President Trump is that you're just kind of nicer and more efficient in persecuting people. You're a nicer, more efficient persecutor of people, not somebody who is going to be able to help folks. And what's amazing is his book, you know, is it's a testament to Trump. You know, the book that he put out, he's praising Trump more than Trump praises himself.

And I think one of the things DeSantis is getting at with the drama, and the leaks, and you know, the chaos that surrounded the Trump administration is it prevented them from having focus enough to win the fights and in Florida, you know, whether he's taken on Disney or whether he's taken on, you know, stuff they don't like in the schools or things they are doing in the legislature, DeSantis stays focused and never gets distracted by the personal drama that seems to always surround and follow Donald Trump and his people.

I mean, we talk to people all day long who will concede privately that yes, DeSantis is a real threat to Trump. Trump knows that. He talked about DeSantis so much privately more than any of the other people who've said they're running against him or might.

Obviously, he is checking that box. And do you show an aptitude for finishing these fights? And do people believe you can beat Joe Biden? Those are kind of the boxes that you have to check.And that's where Trump is falling short. Yes, he does reflect the attitude of the party right now and the anger about certain things. But there's real concern that he can't beat Joe Biden, because we know we already lost to him. And there is concern about during his four years, he complained about a lot of things and didn't finish it. That's where I think DeSantis has more upside. On this point about the General Election, I think whether we nominate Trump, DeSantis, or pick anybody else who is in or considering this race, Democrats are going to say the same thing. Listen to Van tonight. He's already describing Ron DeSantis as worse than Donald Trump, that's going to be the case for any nominee. Look at what he did in Florida. He won by 20 points. He turned Miami, red. This is a guy who's clearly got appeal beyond just the Republican base. Democrats don't want to and other people seem to be worried about this idea of he can't appeal.

And so I also would say, you know, Ron DeSantis didn't really have an opponent in Florida. I wouldn't -- you know, I mean no offense, but that wasn't exactly the best the Democratic Party has to offer. So we'll see how well he does if he can get out of Florida.

Now a source tells me that as you mentioned, this appears to be a case of mistaken identity, specifically that investigators believe that it was a cartel that opened fire on this group of Americans mistaking them for Haitian drug smugglers. Now as far as why the Americans were there, a source tells me that these Americans were there trying to get a medical procedure. That's according to receipts found in the vehicle as authorities who are processing that crime scene. Of course, this is so, so stunning to think that this group of Americans were targeted at random here, you know, by mistake, because we know that so many Americans and Canadians go into Mexico for lower costs prescription drugs, for lower price medical procedure.

So again, that's concerning that this already started very violently and then the next question is, what contact are investigators authorities able to make with those who are holding these Americans? And what might their demands be? Again, you know, one source mentioned that they think that these cartel members might have gone into panic mode once they realized that this was an actual mistake. And so you hope that these captors understand that look, only bad things are going to happen if they harm these Americans any further. Whether they can reap any benefits such as financial benefits out of the families, that's something that we've seen in certain cases. But you know, cartels are businesses. So maybe they'll go that route. But it is a very, very dicey and dangerous situation, both because you have people taking captives who didn't appear to be in the kidnapping business to begin with.

This team called the White Angels grabbed civilians who have been trapped. Throwing belongings in the back, there's a cat, someone else with a guitar. The fighting raging nearby. The residents told to hurry up and get in and sit anywhere they can. As they hold on tight, the rescue mission speeds away from the smoldering city. Ahead, there's smoke from a Russian strike. Getting dropped off safely, Leone (ph) tells the officer that everything is blown up in Bakhmut, even inside his apartment. They've survived months of brutally intense assaults. Russia has made gains trying to encircle Bakhmut and surrounding it on three sides as Ukraine desperately tries to fend them off. Today, we met Bakhmut deputy mayor city nearby at a makeshift aid center for Bakhmut evacuees. He tells us it's very hard to persuade the more than 4,000 civilians left there to leave. They say they have nowhere to go and have no money. It's very hard to survive there, he says. It's not life. It's survival. Drinking water is a big problem. Walking to the well is dangerous, he says. Shells landing on your head all the time. All he now feels, he tells us, is fear and sadness. Everyone here knows how hard it will be for Ukraine to hold on to Bakhmut. Svetlana's elderly mother with disabilities didn't want to leave. But Svetlana managed to convince her. I don't know if my house is still standing, she tells us.
