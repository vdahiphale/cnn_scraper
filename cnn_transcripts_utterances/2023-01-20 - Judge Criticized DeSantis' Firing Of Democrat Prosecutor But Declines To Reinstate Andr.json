Because he refused to go after people who seek and provide abortions or provide gender-affirming care to transgender people.Andrew Warren sued DeSantis. But now, a federal judge has dismissed that lawsuit saying this action of the governor did violate the First Amendment in Florida's Constitution. But as a federal judge, he could not rule against a state official based only on the violation of state law. And in the wake of that ruling today, Andrew Warren joins me now. Andrew, thank you for coming. I know we talked when this first actually happened until I've been curiously following this particular suit. The federal judge did take Governor DeSantis to task for his handling of your suspension. But he ultimately upheld it. Tell me why you think that is and what's your reaction?",

The governor violated the federal law, and he violated state law in suspending me. He said that the suspension had no legal basis, and then I was basically being suspended as a political hit job.Now, the judge did not reinstate us, as we've asked. But what's interesting here is that he agreed with us on the facts. He agreed with us on the law. But he's saying that, as a federal judge, he doesn't have the remedy to reinstate me to office. And what's really interesting is that the judge called on the governor to reinstate me. The governor has talked a lot about how he believes in the rule of law. Let's see what kind of man he actually is. Is he someone that means what he says when he actually -- does he actually believe in the rule of law, or is he a coward that's just going to hide behind this and not do the right thing?",

The opinion does not talk about incompetence. In fact, it says there was not a hint of misconduct by you and that -- quote -- \"The assertion that Mr. Warren neglected his duty or was incompetent is incorrect.\" On the one hand, I suppose you feel vindicated by the judge's statement of that. On the other hand, there is still the impression that's being conveyed, that somehow this is not based on politics and, in fact, about your job performance.

This was always a battle for democracy, for free speech, for the integrity of our elections, to hold the governor accountable, and to have the truth come out. And that's exactly what happened here.

A prosecutor that says, listen, I'm not going to be prosecuting or seeking prosecution of people who follow or seek safe harbor under a particular law or seeking to get an abortion.

Look, Laura, you know, I worked at ICE immigration enforcement for five years, and we would get blistering criticism that you're deciding not to prosecute or arrest people, which was just a lie and not true for the entire time I was there. It's the same thing he's running into there. Now, Andrew has got a bit of a problem in that, number one, Florida law empowers the governor with a tremendous amount of juice that are other governors don't have. He's also running into sort of a (INAUDIBLE) of a governor who appears to have national ambitions beyond the state here. Look, this idea that prosecutors can say, I'm not going to prosecute a certain thing, is nothing new. Think about a guy with the joint in his pocket. Literally, there are very few prosecutor's offices that actually would take the resources and time to do that and would spend their resources and going after the guys with the bricks of crack cocaine or the traffickers and so on. That's discretion. That's how law enforcement works. It is silly what the governor has done here. But look, as Andrew touched on, it's all politics.",

In terms of the national political stage, Ron DeSantis is playing for the base right now. If he were to emerge as a nominee, a GOP nominee for national office, he would have a different set of calculations. He would need to appeal to some degree of the center as well as motivate the base. These culture wars have not only proved legal successes. Couple of Florida newspapers have assessed millions of dollars in legal costs to losing some of these culture wars cases, not this one, but politically have been very successful for Ron DeSantis in his home state.And when you look at Florida voter registration patterns, you see Democrats losing a lot of ground over the last few election cycles in terms of newly registered voters losing ground to the middle while Republicans are holding steady. So, he has seen the political climate that has been rewarding him so far in Florida. I think the challenge for DeSantis is going to be -- he has really tried to model himself as a champion of free speech rights in part of his whole anti-woke stuff. In some cases, he's not championing First Amendment rights or rights of expression. He is using his powers as allowed under the law to quash those rights.

I think 94%, 93% of the prosecutors in America elected. But then when they sort of behave in a manner in line with the voters that put them there, they sort of run into trouble. Now, you see it here with Andrew and the governor. You see it with prosecutors all over the country.

Some people got nothing from their homes. Some people got -- homes that are now worth millions of dollars. So, the lump sum is just a small fraction. It's not meant to address all of the harm, but it's a starting point that they have talked about, that they have been committed to, and that we've heard from community members, a lot of whom feel like that's not enough.

And it's interesting also in the report that there is no formula provided as to how they got to the $5 million. I'd like to note as well that it's not just $5 million, there's also a provision in there, a suggestion, in the proposal, that says that every African-American in San Francisco who is eligible would get $97,000 a year for 250 years. I don't know how that became about or who suggested that, but that just seems odd.

Another qualification, potential qualification for eligibility is that someone would be have to suffered from -- quote unquote -- \"failed war on drugs,\" which is federal policy. I'm wondering why those are being brought in as eligibility prospects. I also have to say that if you're going to start talking about redlining, what do we do for the Chinese community and the Asian communities who are impacted by policies in San Francisco? The Chinese community was forbidden to live in San Francisco many years. The board of supervisors just simply issued an apology in February 2022.

And like you said, previously, if you were opening the idea that they said it would continue on and then place protocols in place, safety guidelines, both safety guidelines and protocol were already there and they're already thoroughly documented and followed on almost all shows, especially shows that, you know, want to make sure that, you know, the safety and care of the cast and crew is paramount.",

So, having said that, when you start cutting corners and trying to save money, unfortunately, that money seems to always be saved in the wrong places, such as stunts, special effects, firearms, et cetera, and that creates a dangerous situation. Now, directly to your point and your question, when you have in a custody with that weapon, if you wanted to use that term, and you have people handling the weapon, you have a duty and responsibility of handling that weapon and an armorer who has a duty and responsibility to make sure that weapon is presented properly, is safe, is functional, is there at all times when it's being used, then you start seeing a very evident group of people that either intentionally or intentionally disregarded -- or carelessly disregarded safety.",
