And Harris is expected to name her pick in the next week or so. And just a couple of hours from now, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer will headline a Harris for President Campaign event in Pennsylvania. This as we're learning new details about how the Harris campaign is seizing on republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance as a major liability for the republican ticket. Harris advisors say that Vance's relative lack of government experience is giving them a new opportunity to go after 78-year-old former President Donald Trump.CNN's Danny Freeman is live for us in Pennsylvania covering this Harris event. Danny, what should we expect to hear?",

I say new presumptive nominee.And listen, Boris, we're here in Pennsylvania, so I'll talk primarily about Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, again, one of the people on that short list to potentially be the running mate of Vice President Harris. Think about it. Maybe over a week ago, he was definitely a strong surrogate for the Biden campaign, but he was still pretty much leading a normal governor's life. He was, earlier this month, putting the finalized touches on a state budget. But then, when he was thrust into this national spotlight when it comes to this new invigorated veep stakes, he definitely jumped all in. Now, I should say, when I asked him last week if he is considering or if he would consider being Vice President Harris's running mate, he said, this is a deeply personal decision and that it really should be free from political pressure. But I just want to point your attention to what that political pressure might look like. This is a Fox News poll from late last week, specifically of Pennsylvania voters. And you can see, Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump, they have approval ratings in the high to mid-40s, but within the margin of error. But take a look at Governor Shapiro's approval ratings in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 61% whopping number right there of approval when it comes to Pennsylvania voters. That's part of that political pressure which makes him a strong candidate for this running mate position here. And we saw that in addition, on the trail over the weekend, the Governor was at a campaign event for Vice President Harris. Take a listen to what he said specifically when it comes to Donald Trump and this debate over debates. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're only eight days into this race, but I want to just sort of note how tight things are right now between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris? This is the national margin. Look, the key nugget here is there's no clear leader.Now, I want you to look at the trend line here because I think a lot of folks have been kind of getting confused on it. When we're looking at the national trend line in a matchup between Trump and Harris, in fact, there hasn't been all that much movement. Before Biden dropped out, you can see that Trump led Harris by two. You look where we are right now, it's a one point race well within the margin of error. The massive change, the big switch was when Democrats went from Biden to Harris as the presumptive nominee. Why is that? Because pre-Biden dropping out, he actually trailed Donald Trump by six points in these same polls in which Harris was only down by two. So Democrats are in a much better position today than they were eight days ago because they changed their nominee to someone who's far more popular.",

So this is enthusiastic about voting for. So for Democrats, how many of them said they were enthusiastic about voting for Joe Biden in February? It was only 62%. Look at how high it has jumped now. It is 88%. My goodness gracious. That's a jump at 26 points.Republicans for Donald Trump. Look, Republicans are enthusiastic about Donald Trump and they still are. They were in February at 80% and they're now at 82%. But the key nugget here is just that the difference, 88 for Harris now versus 82 for Trump now on the republican side, there's actually more enthusiasm for Harris now compare that to where we were back in February when Republicans actually had an 18 point advantage on enthusiasm. So what we're seeing here is, yes, we do see a tightening race in terms of voter choice nationally. But the real thing that has changed with Kamala Harris on the top of the ticket is enthusiasm among Democrats is now through the roof.",

What matters is down in those important swing states. And so I want to take a look at these three swing states that havebeen polled since Kamala Harris became the presumptive or likely democratic nominee. This is Harris versus Trump margin. Again, no clear leader. That's the key nugget here. Look at this. In Wisconsin, Trump up by a point, but well within the margin of error. How about Michigan? We've got ourselves a tie. And of course, the pivotal battleground state or commonwealth of Pennsylvania where Mister Freeman just was, look at that, we've got ourselves a tie. Now, why are these three states so very important? Because it's the national map. Let's take a look here. All right. Let's just say that Kamala Harris loses in those sunbelt battleground states that Joe Biden was trailing in Nevada, Arizona, Georgia. All three that Joe Biden carried four years ago, excuse me. But take a look here. If in fact, Kamala Harris is able to win up in these great lake battleground states where the races are so tight right now, Wisconsin, Michigan, and of course, Pennsylvania, just as we were talking about, look at this, she would barely squeeze by with 270 electoral votes. So the fact is, at this particular point, with now 99 days to go, we've got ourselves a very tight race, one in which there's no clear leader and one in which either candidate really could pull out on top. It's thrilling times for a political analyst like myself. I think voters on both sides of the aisle, though, wish that there was perhaps a little bit of a clearer picture. But perhaps, one will emerge. We'll just have to wait and see.",

You were supportive of President Biden staying in the race when many of your colleagues were not. Now that he's stepped aside, I'm wondering what you're hearing from voters in your district if they share that increase in enthusiasm that some of the nationwide polling shows. REP. MADELEINE DEAN, (D-PA): Boris, good to be with you. And it was fun to hear the enthusiasm in Harry's voice in his reporting. And we will hear that throughout the next 99 days. And I have to tell you, in my own district, the enthusiasm is extraordinarily high. You just had a reporter in Ambler, which is the fourth congressional district of Pennsylvania that I am so lucky to represent. And so when I'm talking to constituents, or yesterday and Saturday, as I helped launch some folks who were knocking on doors, handing out literature, handing out signs, I have to tell you, the enthusiasm is extraordinarily high for Kamala Harris at the top of our ticket. I'm proud of Joe Biden. I'm proud to work with him another six months to be very honest and proud of his record. But look what he's done in a selfless way, thinking only of the best interest of America, he put forward this extraordinarily capable woman, a woman who has served for three and a half years as vice president. But think about her record before that as both a state and federal prosecutor. Kamala Harris will be able to prosecute this case for our democratic values, for our freedoms as she put in her commercial, we choose freedom. She is an extraordinary public servant and extraordinary talent who I have had the chance to get to know. And I can't wait until she brings the race here to Pennsylvania.

They're only thinking of themselves. And now, with Mr. Vance, who has said such things as rape is an inconvenience, criticizing childless so called catwomen, how is that going to play in Pennsylvania? It won't play well in my district.
