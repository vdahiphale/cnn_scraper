I don't get what calculation the Secret Service is making at that stage to delay getting Trump off the stage, even if it was just for a few minutes to determine whether the suspicious person was in fact a threat. And that goes to the responsibility of the Secret Service to focus on the protectee, not on Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, Joe Biden. The protectee is not named for a reason. It is because they have a constitutional position that needs to be protected for our democracy. And some calculation went in that I don't -- I don't know what it was that has to be answered. The protectees have no opinions. I mean, that is just basically they are not allowed to have thoughts about their own security. That is security 101.

A lot less fanfare around the -- around the Prime Minister's visit to Washingtonthan he might have expected, even just a couple of days ago, but still a very crucial visit coming at a very critical time. The Israeli Prime Minister, as he addresses Congress tomorrow, he's going to be looking to accomplish a few different things. First of all, obviously, he's looking to accomplish foreign policy goals in terms of rousing U.S. bipartisan support for Israel, raising the issue of the hostages, trying to remind the world of why this -- how this war began on October 7th and trying to raise up support for Israel's fight against Hamas. He will also, of course, be looking to achieve domestic political goals for himself as well. His trip to Washington, showing that bipartisan support, showing that he still has juice in Washington, is going to be something that he can use back in Israel for his own domestic political goals, especially at a time when the majority of the Israeli public do not want to see him continue on as Prime Minister. But, ultimately, you know, it's also going to be about the message that the Israeli Prime Minister gets from U.S. officials. You know, we are now at a time where it seems like Israel and Hamas are very, very close to a ceasefire deal. We heard President Biden yesterday say that he believes that they can maybe achieve this in the short term. The Israeli Prime Minister himself has also expressed some new optimism. But at the end of the day, this may come down to whether or not Benjamin Netanyahu actually wants a ceasefire deal and whether or not he will take the leap in order to make that happen. He's obviously not the only party at the table here, but we have seen that he has more to gain perhaps by this war being prolonged from a political standpoint in Israel, especially given the threats of his right-wing coalition partners to topple the government if he agrees to a deal that ends the war. And so he's also going to be facing a lot of pressure from President Biden, from other U.S. officials, including Republicans, I would expect, to move forward with the ceasefire deal and actually to make it happen. It's very interesting, of course, that he's in Washington right now, including meeting with hostage families at a time when these negotiations are still ongoing and where there are still question marks about whether or not he is actually committed to getting that deal done.",

And so we've found that 39 percent of U.S. adults say they worry all or most of the time that their family's income won't meet expenses, 39 percent. That's pretty high when you think about it. It's up significantly from late 2021. And it's basically right in line with what people were saying in mid-2008, just as the great recession was getting started. Now, of course, this varies. Many other Americans are feeling pretty good right now. They're going out to eat. They're going on vacation. But what's interesting is that this CNN poll finds that nearly half of black Americans say they worry, all or most of the time, that their income's not going to meet expenses. And just over half, 52 percent of Latinos say the same. This is another reminder that even though we see those national economic statistics that you alluded to, low unemployment, cooling inflation, millions of Americans are hurting from years of rising prices. This really is the number one financial headache. Sixty-five percent of adults say that expenses and the cost of living is the biggest problem in the economy that they face right now. It is down a bit from two years ago, but obviously well above what people were saying back in 2021. And, you know, I spoke to a woman in Ohio who works at the CDC and she told me, it's just outrageous what she's paying at the grocery store right now. She said that's not it though. The prices are astronomical everywhere, whether it's insurance or the cost to buy clothes. And people are not imagining this. Moody's Analytics finds that the average American is spending $925 more per month than they were three years ago for the same goods and services, $925 more. And listen, people are being forced to cut back. This CNN poll found that 69 percent of adults say that they are cutting back spending on extras and entertainment. The woman in Ohio told me that she used to have every streaming service out there. Now she's got one or two. She said that when she went to the movies, she used to buy candy at the movie theater. Now, she's going to Walmart ahead of time to stock up on candy. And a lot of Americans say that they are taking on extra work to get by. One in three say that they are finding extra income besides their main job. So I think at the end of the day, Bianna, this is just another reminder that as much as we're focused on the latest swing state polls or the palace entry, you get Mar-a-Lago or the White House, this is really the issue that is on the top of many people's minds.

And this is one of the reasons, as you just heard in our previous segment, that the Trump campaign thinks that they can make a lotof inroads with voters against Kamala Harris by calling it now Harris inflation. Though worth noting, inflation definitely has cooled. For many people in this country, for one generation, at least, this is the first time they've really experienced having to deal with inflation too. That's something also worth noting.

      "sentences": "Yes. Let me actually start by talking about the book because it's relevant. The book describes a networkof dictatorships, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, a host of others, Venezuela, others in Africa, who effectively now work together to help one another stay in power. The book isn't only about finances, it's also about an authoritarian narrative. It's about how they seek to push back against the United States and against America's allies and against democracies around the world. They're not tied together by ideology, but by a set of common interests. And one of the threats in this election, from the perspective of American allies, was that the United States, which has been a leader of the democratic world for decades now, might cease to be. Trump has talked about -- Donald Trump, when he was originally president, when he was originally president four years ago, spoke about leaving the NATO alliance. He spoke -- he's spoken about it since then. He says positive things about autocrats as well. And so that was the -- that -- that's the threat and that's what our allies talk about and what they are worried about. And you are right that they will now look at Harris and ask what's her experience, what's -- you know, what direction will she go in. And, of course, you know, I've had some experience talking to her about foreign policy, both about Russia and Ukraine and other things. She's clearly somebody who's been in inner circles for a long time. She's - - you know, it's not her strong suit, it's not her background, but she's now met most of her -- of American allies. She's met President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. She's met many European leaders. And I think there's, you know, stipulations, very early days. I mean, I think there's some cautious optimism that she would be someone who would continue to see the U.S.'s role as a leader of the democratic world in the broadest sense that the United States would remain allied to its historical partners and that it would remain concerned about countering Russian, Chinese, Iranian influence campaigns when they -- when they -- when they occur. So, I mean, we've had a -- we've had a shift in the campaign and there's obviously a very different conversation now, but actually the structure of foreign perception isn't that different.",

And that is something that allies and alliances around the world, whether it's in Asia or in Europe, have been -- have been very thankful for. But there are also a lot of concern given what we've heard from Donald Trump, as you've mentioned and now from J.D. Vance, his running mate at last week's Republican convention. And while there is trepidation, you do have world leaders, European leaders saying that they want to stick to protocol. They're not going to weigh in on U.S. elections and they'll deal with whoever the winner is. Minus one person and that is Viktor Orban, who has already shown and vocalized his support for Donald Trump. And we heard Donald Trump reference Viktor Orban last week at the convention. Why is there so much attention focused on? And I'm not here to disparage Hungary in any way, shape or form, but Hungary is by no means that one of the strongest countries in Europe or in NATO. Why is there so much focus on this man and the relationship these two leaders have?",

Trump quoted Orban as saying, there's only one way you can solve all the chaos in the world. You've got to bring President Trump back. Russia is afraid of him. China is afraid of him. And he also went on to say the whole world was at peace when Donald Trump was in office. What do you make of that narrative?

You know, the -- it's very clear who Moscow wants to win. And they want Trump to win because they think that if he's in power, he'll allow them to occupy and destroy Ukraine and maybe other countries, maybe even U.S. NATO allies. So the autocratic world is very much hoping for his victory because they imagine that, you know, it's a lot easier to win a war if you don't have to fight it. And if nobody's helping your victim.
