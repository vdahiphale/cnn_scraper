If you don't know how to identify them, it's really when you turn over for the label on your food and you can't identify the ingredients included. They're including ingredients that you wouldn't cook within your kitchens. A lot of ingredients like sweeteners, emulsifiers, flavors, things like that. They make up 57 percent on average of the adult food consumption in this country, and even more for kids. So things like sodas, packaged snacks, chicken nuggets, things like that. A lot of the research now is focused on trying to figure out which ultra-processed foods are worse for folks, but we are seeing study after study pile up warning about the health risks. So the recommendation is if you can eat more whole foods, that's the way to go, because they saw decreased risk in these neurological issues for when you ate less ultra-processed foods. Guys?",

And at any moment, the DOJ could slap the country's largest concert promoter with a massive antitrust lawsuit. Could that end up making it easier for you to see your favorite artists on stage? I'm Amara Walker with John Berman and Kate Bolduan. This a CNN NEWS CENTRAL. This morning, how about a thank you? Radio silence from Donald Trump after Nikki Haley said she would vote for him in the general election. Nothing out loud from Trump, nothing on social media as far as we can tell, nothing from his lawyers or kids. Admittedly, it was not much of an endorsement from Haley, but there are still a lot of Haley supporters casting votes for her in primaries months after she dropped out. Now, Trump could address Haley, or more importantly, her voters when he takes the stage in the Bronx later today. He holds a rally in a place where President Biden won 83 percent of the vote in 2020. CNN political director and sometimes CNN NEWS CENTRAL anchor David Chalian joins me this morning. David, I know you are aware, the Yankees who play in the Bronx haven't won a world series since 2009. So what does Donald Trump think he can get out of this trip?",

Well, that's because his team thought perhaps that the trial would still be ongoing and that he would be in New York on a Thursday and not in this pause moment waiting for summation here. So making the best use of his geography. But there is also a clear strategy it place here to do this in the Bronx because, as you know, John and we've seen in survey after survey after survey, Donald Trump may be a Republican nominee for president who is poised to do better with the African American and Hispanic vote than we've seen in history here. And so this is clearly an effort to try and dig into some of Joe Bidens core support. And it happens to be core support where Biden has been showing some weakness of late.",

So I guess she no longer sees them as equally bad. What changed between January and now, that's a question for Nikki Haley to answer.But I agree with you.

We've talked quite a bit about the large vote share that Nikki Haley has been bringing in even in the Republican primaries since she has dropped out.

So I want to take a look back through history, performance after opponents drop that. These are non-incumbents in presidential primaries. I want you to look through the years, right? Mitt Romney was getting about 71 percent of the vote after his opponent dropped out, Donald Trump back in 2016, 74 percent. Joe Biden last time around, 77 percent.The one who is actually getting the highest share after his opponents dropped out is actually Donald Trump this time around with 81 percent. This is actually a very strong performance for a non-incumbent after his opponents dropped out. The protests vote is actually at a historic hello. So yes, Nikki Haley, sometimes getting north of 20 percent of the vote in these primers. But that's not unusual. What is unusual, Kate, is she's not doing it all over the place.

If you go back to 2020, look, Joe Biden actually won these voters by 16 points. This is actually a fairly favorable Republican primary vote for Joe Biden.But jump ahead to 2024, who they say they'll support. Donald Trump leads amongst them by about four points, which is actually an improvement for Donald Trump from where he was in 2020. So keep in mind that this four-point margin, Joe Biden is still getting a substantial portion of this Haley support. But this is in polls in which Donald Trump leads. This is impulse that Donald Trump leads. So it's not surprising that these folks are still voting for Nikki Haley because there much more likely to vote for Joe Biden than Donald Trump than the regular primary voter.

Now, Ticketmaster is dominant. Live Nation is dominant with venues, with ticket sales across the country, but they have said previously, their leadership has said that pricing for their events including things like Beyonce's tour of last year, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour where a lot of this caused public blowback and political blowback because of some issues they have, they've said that the pricing is set by artists and their teams and that they've been able to cut out scalpers with their process. Now, the Justice Department is essentially going to be accusing this company of having an unfair monopoly that really hurts consumers. But while this is going to be a major lawsuit by the Justice Department, it is very likely to be fought extensively in court by Live Nation as that goes on.
