I said, at what point does this get to the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result? And the answer was, we're there.This is officially insanity. But, you know, we understandably have been focused on these 20 in to see if they're going to move. I just also got a text from somebody who's part of the new crop of Republicans, one of whom is -- a lot of these Republicans in more moderate areas are in Biden-won districts. They're trying to dig in and make the point that they don't want to vote for anybody except Kevin McCarthy, and they will not do that. And so, you have these entrenched camps, even though these guys, the 20 are getting the most play, there are others who are just as entrenched right now in the Republican caucus.",

You know, it's not that he's not ambitious or wouldn't want it, but Kevin has to step aside first. That's what I think is interesting that the 20 have not actually gone in that direction yet. They could nominate Scalise. They could just throw it out there as a possibility.I will say a Republican member told me this morning that Kevin thinks if his numbers improve -- and we haven't seen that, right. We have not seen that today -- but if they improved even a little, that he can break the block. But that hasn't happened, and the last time the person texted I said, you know, we're starting a pool.
