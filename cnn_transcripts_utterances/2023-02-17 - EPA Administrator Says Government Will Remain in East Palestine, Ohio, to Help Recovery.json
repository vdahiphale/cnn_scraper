It's right there on the right hand of your screen. It's 57 minutes before it crashed. You don't see any sparks there. But the train keeps going, keeps going down the tracks. By 8Another surveillance camera here, same time, same town, the train keeps going for 20 miles after that headed for East Palestine. That is where it derailed at 8:55 p.m., a full 43 minutes after we first saw though sparks in Salem. CNN's Jason Carroll is live on the ground where he has been in East Palestine. Jason, this is going to be a cause for concern. I know the NTSB is paying close attention to all of those different clips of those surveillance videos. What are you hearing?",

Again, this according to the NTSB.The wheel bearing is the part, of course, that connects the wheel to the axle. So what's going to happen now is these parts have been isolated. They are going to be taken to Washington, D.C., so experts there can evaluate exactly what happened there with those key parts. All of this happening, though, here on the ground as people continue to worry about their health, their safety, the air, the water.
