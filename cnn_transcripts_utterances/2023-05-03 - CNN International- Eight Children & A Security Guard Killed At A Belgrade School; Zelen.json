      "sentences": "Certainly not and especially not from this school, which is in an upscale part of Belgrade, one of the most famous schools in the city. But we know that this happened around 8Police -- there was obviously a massive police response when this 14- year-old boy walked into this school with two pistols, a 9 millimeter and a smaller gauge pistol and started shooting. Police also said that he had four Molotov cocktails with him. When police got to him, he was actually in the school yard. So what we know about injuries right now is that there were nine killed, eight of them kids, one a security guard. There are seven people injured, six of them children, one of them a teacher, a 53-year-old, we understand, suffering from gunshot wounds to her stomach and her hands as well. There is also one girl that at last word, was undergoing life threatening surgery inside of the hospital. As I said, this is a 14- year-old boy, so 7th grade. There was a picture of him coming out of the school. They've only identified him thus far by his initials, K.K. He had a jacket over his head, skinny jeans on. He got into an unmarked police car and was taken away. Shortly after that, we also saw students, or at some point, we saw students also coming out. Some of them were quite visibly distraught as they were coming out of the school. One girl was in tears. A mother told our local affiliate there that her daughter is frankly in shock. She cannot get her to calm down right now. There's a press conference happening right now with authorities from government and from police, and police have described this as something that was being planned for more than a month now. They said that the shooter had a plan as to which specific classrooms to go to. Apparently, the history one was chosen because it was near to the door, which specific students to go after. And so this seems like something is pre-planned. One official blamed the influence of Internet video games so far as sort of an initial cause.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So initially -- or the initial report at least, is that these are guns that were taken by this 14-year-old student from his father. So guns are not nearly as common in Serbia as they are in, say, the United States, which is why you don't hear this kind of thing from Serbia. It's also a very small country, but there are also strict gun laws.You -- in order to get one, you can only get a semiautomatic. Automatic guns are banned, but in order to get one, you basically have to go through a medical exam. You have to go through background check. You have to have a reason to have one, like sport hunting or a good reason to feel like you're under threat. And you also have to do a training course. There's also lots of guns, though, left around from the civil war back in the 90s. And so one estimate from 2018 suggested that Serbia actually per 100 people, had the third highest rates of civilian guns floating around there. The number is 39 per 100 people. But just for comparison's sake, the U.S. number is 120 guns per 100 people. So obviously, not nearly as common, but one of the more common places to find guns, certainly in Europe and the world.",

Back with you on more details from the press conference.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Finland in a rare international trip to pay an official visit to the NATO's newest member. He's set to meet with Nordic prime ministers at a summit hosted by the Finnish president to discuss Russia's war on Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russian state media claims a drone attack caused a large fire at a fuel depot near a crucial bridge linking Russia's mainland with Crimea. Ukraine isn't commenting on that. Now to a fierce exchange of fire in the Middle East after a prominent Palestinian inmate died at an Israeli prison following a hunger strike. Israel said more than 100 rockets were fired from Gaza in the early hours of this morning. Meanwhile, its fighter jets hit a military post in Gaza, as well as a weapons facility and sites the Israel Defense Forces say were used by Hamas. Islamic Jihad says the round of confrontations with Israel has now ended. An Israeli military spokesperson says there's no official ceasefire with Hamas, but, quote, messages have been passed. Hadas Gold is monitoring events from Jerusalem. Some respite from this action, at least at the moment.",

But we are getting reports of violent explosions today in Khartoum, along with airstrikes and antiaircraft fire in a nearby city. On Tuesday, South Sudan said the Sudanese Army and the RSF agreed in principle to a seven-day truce. A string of previous ceasefires has failed to stop the fighting. Meanwhile, the U.N. aid chief has arrived in Sudan to discuss relief efforts. Iran's president is now in Syria for talks with President Bashar al-Assad. Ebrahim Raisi arrived in Damascus earlier today to begin his two-day trip as the first visit by an Iranian president to Syria since that country's civil war began 12 years ago. Iran has been a key financial and military ally to Assad during the conflict. CNN's Nada Bashir is in London. And these will be unsettling scenes, really, for some around the Middle East and indeed around the world.",

It says no one was injured in what he called, or what it has called an attack, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin was not at the Kremlin at the time of the incident. Let's speak to CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson. Obviously, we're relying on what's coming from the Kremlin here, but it does sound like a significant moment.",

      "sentences": "Well, always treat with caution what you hear directly from the Kremlin, only because their track record on speaking entirely the truth has been called into question many times. But what are they presenting at the moment? State media in Russia is saying that two unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, Ukrainian UAVs, were flown over the Kremlin, that essentially the defense mechanisms there disabled them, took them down.They're saying that no one was injured from the falling debris. The Kremlin has followed up and said that this was an attack on President Putin. However, he wasn't there at the time. The video that state media and others play in social media is playing does appear to show a small puff of smoke over the Kremlin. Now, CNN cannot independently verify this video, and obviously when it's something as sensitive as the Kremlin, one needs to be really cautious and look into it very carefully. However, local residents do report hearing a loud clap or a bang at around the sort of time that this incident was believed to have played out. But again, at the moment, all the facts aren't clear. But if the Kremlin is going to play these events as an attack on President Putin, it has a number of options to potentially use that as propaganda for increasing strikes or whatever against Ukraine. That would perhaps be the concern of many Ukrainians at this moment. But what does it actually mean in terms of the war that is unfolding at the moment? It has no significance at the moment because there were no injuries, no casualties. But it's a very sensitive site, and I think we're going to have to look very closely, very closely at the details as we get more of them, Max.",

      "sentences": "You know, Max, let me show you around because I'm in downtown El Paso, Texas, and take a look around. These are hundreds of migrants who are sleeping on the streets. They are lined, the sidewalks are lined by migrants all around the city block, and it spills over several streets.Now, here's a situation. The city of El Paso is in a state of emergency right now. The city declared that emergency so that they can free up dollars to make sure that they can provide shelter, so that they can provide sanitation and extra public safety and security in this area. Now, one of the big questions, of course, is, well, if there is a disaster declaration, then why are so many people sleeping on the street instead of in shelters provided by the city? Great question. Here's the answer. The city funds that are appropriated by the federal government only allow the city to help migrants who turn themselves into immigration authorities and that those immigration authorities process them. The reality of the individuals that you see here -- and I just turned the corner, and you can see that the lining of migrants continues. The reality is that there's a mixed status here. There's individuals who turn themselves into immigration authorities and there's individuals who decided to enter the country illegally. I can tell you from talking to migrants and officials on both sides of the border that there are tens of thousands of migrants who are in northern Mexican cities who grew impatient. A lot of them tried to cross through the CBP One app, which is a software application that was launched by the Biden administration in January that allows migrants to set up appointments to enter legally through points of entry. And Max, they simply grew impatient, and so they decided to enter the country illegally. And so, that's why we're seeing masses of individuals right now. And if you just look all around me, I mean, this spills over to multiple streets. Max?",
