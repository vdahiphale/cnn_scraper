Joining me now is Tracie Sette who is the city clerk of Cedarburg. Thank you so much. I know that you always say I'm used to being behind the scenes.

If we see a 10-point spread between the number of women who vote and the number of men -- nine-10, which is what it was before -- she should be OK. Secondly, I look at the city of Detroit, the place where I'm from. In Detroit, they're looking at 50-52 percent voter turnout in order for her to be competitive in the state. They're looking at 55 minimum. If they get closer to 60 it's pretty much a wrap for the state. The same thing in Philadelphia. Five hundred thousand net votes out of Philadelphia will get her competitive. They get over 500-550, she's probably a wrap in Pennsylvania.",

So if he just eeks out a win or doesn't win one of those it is going to be a bad night for Trump. If he wins those comfortably -- three-four points -- it could be a very bad night for Kamala Harris.

So what you've got in there is you've got the U.S. Secret Service, you've got the FBI Criminal Division, Counterintelligence Division for actions by other countries, Counterterrorism Division by something that could be spinning up here.

A couple of things.One, I think they learned some lessons from January 6 about underestimating some of the dynamics around the passions and political divide in the country. But also, if you look at the leadup to this what do we have, you know? In October, we had an individual who said he was inspired by ISIS who, with another, was going to shoot up Election Day locations out in the Midwest. And this was straight up terrorism without picking a side. You've got the individual in Australia who was a registered Russian agent who was doing deep fakes of Haitian immigrants illegally voting on video through right-wing posters. You've got the plot -- what was it -- yesterday by an individual in Tennessee to attempt to blow up the power grid with explosive-laden drones. So you see around the election, adjacent to the election, foreign espionage interference. Chat rooms full of threats to send armed people to polling locations. Terrorist plots. It's a lot going on.",

Way more people in this command center this time around, a larger number of agencies, more FBI components in there on the idea that we've got to be able to respond immediately. But more important, this is a national effort. So when the intel comes in, if it's actionable, get it to the field office and to the state and local police and law enforcement people and get them on top of it right away.",
