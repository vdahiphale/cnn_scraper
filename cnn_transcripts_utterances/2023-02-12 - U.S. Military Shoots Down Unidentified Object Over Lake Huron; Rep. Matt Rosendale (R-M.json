The U.S. military has shot down another high-altitude object, this time over Lake Huron. This is according to a U.S. official and a congressional source briefed on the matter. This would be the fourth object brought down by U.S. fighter jets in the past nine days. CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the State Department. Kylie, what are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that's right, Paula. And the third object brought down in just the last three days. Of course, we're learning that this high-altitude object was traveling and shot down over Lake Huron, which is north of Michigan in between, you know, Michigan and Canada, right up there. That is according to a U.S. official and a congressional source briefed on the matter.It appears that members of Congress from Michigan are learning more about this in conversations with the Pentagon today. I want to read to you what Congresswoman Slotkin tweeted just in the last few hours or so, saying, quote, \"The object has been downed by pilots from the U.S. Air Force and National Guard. Great work by all who carried out this mission, both in the air and back at headquarters. We're all interested in exactly what this object was and its purpose.\" We're also hearing from other members of Congress from Michigan, Congressman Bergman saying that he is appreciative of what he's calling the decisive action of the fighter pilots here. So, there's a lot more to learn about, you know, just what exactly this object was. I think Arlette, our colleague, is getting some more colleagues from her sources on that. But it's notable that this was actually, you know, something that the United States was able to track, potentially in part because NORAD over the last week adjusted its controls to better detect slow-moving objects at high altitudes. So, what they were able to do is, you know, put into place these FAA temporary flight restrictions into spaces where they were seeing potentially an object come through. The question remains an open one, as to if there are more objects coming into U.S. air space now or if these adjustments are just allowing them to detect them at a higher rate. Paula?",

I mean, look, Lake Huron basically cuts across both the U.S. and Canadian territories. And for that reason, leaders on both sides, both President Biden and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would have been kept informed with what's going on with this object.Now, when I asked Canadian officials, they referred me to NORAD, which was responsible for this operation. But defense officials in Canada promised to get back to us with more information about what exactly went on there. I will note that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is en route to Yukon. A complete coincidence, Paula, in terms of him being there and the day after Canada ordered that high altitude object to be shot down in Yukon. What's interesting here thought, was when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke this morning before that trip, he did say that they felt that this was a threat to civil aviation, and that's why he thought that the object had to come down as soon as possible. Unlike those objects that they perhaps had been surveilling for days. The other thing that was interesting here was that that object over Yukon, they had had been surveilling it for at least a day before they actually shot it down. What will be interesting here, Paula, is to note exactly when they detected this object. Was it also coming through that northern path from Canada or did it float in from somewhere else over the Great Lakes, perhaps. Still, a lot of questions. Again, Canadian officials promise to get back to us, but right now they are deferring questions to NORAD, which they say took the lead on this operation after getting the order from U.S. President Joe Biden.",

      "sentences": "So many questions. Paula Newton, thank you. And I want to bring in Montana Congressman Matt Rosendale. Congressman, earlier today, you dismissed the official claim that air space was shut down over your state last night due to a so-called radar anomaly. You said that, in fact, there was an object. So, what is your reaction to this most recent shoot down, just a short time ago.REP. MATT ROSENDALE (R-MT): Thanks so much, Paula. It's disturbing. It's troubling. I was in contact with DOD yesterday for several hours through the evening. [17:04:56] And I was assured by them that once they had some daylight where they could get eyes on the object, they were going to get in touch with me and let me know what was going on. When we experienced a 12-hour gap with no information whatsoever, I started reaching out again. And at that point, I was again told there is some type of an object and they are trying to find out just where it is and what they're going to do. Another six hours went by. And that's when I started making sure that all of my staff was scanning twitter feeds and news broadcasts to find out what was going on, because quite frankly, DOD was not bringing information forward fast enough for me to be able to report back to the citizens across Montana. We have 140 ICBMS located in Montana. We have mounts from air force bases. This is very sensitive equipment and facilities and we are not being given good, accurate, timely information from the Department of Defense, and I have shared my displeasure with them. You know, we're talking about different-sized devices, Paula. The first balloon was a Chinese spy balloon that was shot down over the Atlantic. And at that time, I started questioning, when did it enter our air space? How long did they know about it? How long did they keep this information away from the American public? Why wasn't it brought down earlier in such a fashion that we could have acquired all of the equipment and evaluated it to find out what they had been collecting and transmitting back to China? And now, it doesn't give me much safe feelings knowing that these devices are just smaller. They're more difficult to track, but they're still accumulating data. And I'm very concerned with the cumulative effect of the data that is being collected. Whether that's cellular activity, whether that's information about our civilian infrastructure, whether that is information about our military infrastructure and our defense systems. I need some answers. And the American people need answers.",

So, we don't have very many details, but these are the kinds of questions that we definitely have to be asking.And then the other thing that I thought was interesting from this octagonal object, we have strings coming out, strings could be all kinds of things, but I'm looking at the possibility of those strings being an antenna of one type another either for receiving or transmitting information. So, that's the kind of stuff that we have to analyze. We have to have the DOD and other forensic specialists analyze this and really take a look at what this system actually is, how it connects with the other systems that were shot down earlier if it does connect at all. Those are the kind of questions that I have right now. I also note one other thing, if I may. And that's the low -- the relatively low altitude that this thing was flying at. 20,000 feet is absolutely within the realm of commercial aircraft and that's extremely dangerous from a commercial aviation perspective. And the skies over Michigan are fairly well populated. So, it's definitely something that needed to be taken care of.",

So, what we know is that since the Chinese balloon incident a week ago and learning of other infiltrations by the Chinese of the balloon in years past, essentially NORAD, NorthCom and other agencies essentially opened up the aperture of what they were looking for.So, they are getting lots of positives that they did not get before. Most of that is going to be known (inaudible) airplanes, whatever it may be, but there are now going to be lots more things that sort of raise the level of concern. So that's the first thing we know. These positives were anticipated, more positives. What we can't answer now is, is this sort of bigger aperture picking up lots of stuff that has essentially been forgiven, sort of, you know, around in the skies, whatever else it is, because it didn't pose a threat. [17:20:00] Or is it part of something organized for whatever surveillance. I do want -- so we don't know. And I would just want to pick up on what the congressman who was on before us, to speculate about China and all of these incidents is just -- I'm sorry, it is just not right right now. We do not know what these objects are. They are -- two were described as VW-sized, one is now octangle (ph). We don't know if there are balloons attached to them. So, we need to just sort of understand what's going on. There's a wider lens of surveillance that is picking up things. We don't quite know what they are. And our tolerance for it after what happened with China is lower. We're going to shoot it down if it is unmanned, if it is hurting commercial or a threat to commercial aviation. And if shooting it down will not harm Americans in the homeland. That is essentially what's going on. The speculation is really premature at this stage.",

The danger to commercial aviation is I would say minimal at this point, but it is something that has to be taken into account. And airmen of all types, civilian as well as military have to be on the lookout for unusual objects right now. I think we have a heightened awareness on the part of everybody. It becomes really important. But having an ironclad, you know, control mechanism for space, that's practically an impossibility.

Now, when you think about, you know, everyday aircraft, they fly at about 30,000 feet. So, this statement says that the Biden administration, U.S. officials, were concerned about the path that this was traveling on and also that elevation. Now, when it comes to any risk to civilians, there wasn't any. There were no civilians who were hurt or injured or otherwise affected. Of course, being shot down over water enabled that to be an outcome. And we should note that yesterday there were some questions about an FAA temporary flight restriction put into place in Montana. And there were some questions about what actually triggered that flight restriction. We didn't get a definitive answer on that today. There were -- (TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIUES) -- we heard. But this statement from the Pentagon says that they believe that this object is what actually triggered that flight restriction yesterday. And I just want to read to you exactly what they say here, saying, quote, \"Based on its flight path and data, we can reasonably connect this object to the radar signal picked up over Montana, which flew in proximity to sensitive DOD sites. We did not assess it to be a kinetic military threat to anything on the ground but assessed it was a safety flight hazard and a threat due to its potential surveillance capabilities.\" Now, surveillance capabilities, but the potential for those is key here. So far, we don't know what those capabilities on board this unidentifiable object actually was, but that, rest assured, is going to be something that those who are doing these recovery efforts, which is now going to be getting underway, are going to be looking for answers to.

And that is when the Pentagon called me shortly after it took action because Lake Huron and that area is in my district. Number one, decisive action, using the right equipment, the F-16, using the right type of munition to do the takedown. But now the big part, as was mentioned by Kylie a minute ago, is the recovery piece to understand. Now, Lake Huron is very, very cold this time of year. They're going to have to do some special diving capabilities to get down there. The good news is Lake Huron is not that deep, not like Lake Superior.

And that means taking security measures at our bases, at our other government installations, and even for personnel, people in the civilian sector to be somewhat cognizant of the possibility that cell phone conversations could be intercepted by the Chinese. They're already being intercepted in many cases anyway, but it is just one of those things that is part of a new reality.

I'll go back. I think since the Chinese balloon incident, you really can't get more transparent in the sense that they're shooting these things down. They are announcing the closure of air space. They are then coming forward just two hours after saying here's what we saw, here's what we're doing now. I think what would be helpful for the American public, given the speculation, is once they can identify it, even if it's a false positive, even if they shot down something that really didn't need to be shot down, they need to come out as quickly as possible. We are 48 hours after that Friday shootdown. I would hope that within, you know, the next 24 hours, we will begin to then learn more, is this a concerted threat that we then need to elevate our own homeland security defenses? Or is this because of what I was discussing before? We are opening up the aperture and getting potential, you know, we're just getting more positives at this stage. And no one can answer that now.
