The diversity of voters and a stream of voters, a constant line. We've seen mothers bringing children, college students, retirees. What people do in this community center is they check in with this table, they grab their ballots and then they head over here and they vote. American democracy at work. And the turnout, when you talk to the people who are working here at this polling place, is that they'll tell you that the turnout has been quite high and surprising for an off-year election. Turnout was expected to be somewhat robust but it has been very high for an off year. It is issue one. The issue of trying to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution that at least voters we've spoken with here say has been bringing them out today. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, so to the first part, we should watch to see, like Maria says, if this is going to be as motivating as it was an issue in 2022. I think Maria's right that it will be. But then we also have to see if Republicans, attempting to soften their messaging, as you've heard from Glenn Youngkin, trying to say that the left is extreme in this and that we're not, we'll see if that works, too. It's interesting. He's not wrong or dumb to try to do that because, after Dobbs, Republicans went whole hand on restricting abortion rights. They made abortion almost totally banned in a number of states. And they used some very regressive scary language around maybe jailing women, maybe even killing women who went out to get abortions. It's hard to put that toothpaste back in the tube once you've gone that far. So for Glenn Youngkin to come out and say, listen, the far left is extreme on abortion -- he's correct -- and there are far more extreme versions of abortion than a 15-week ban. That's also correct. We'll see if that works for a lot of the suburban women voters for whom abortion is going to be the number-one issue driving them out to the polls in states like Virginia and Ohio today.",

Today, he is not.In the special elections where Democrats have done incredibly well, which is also something that Democrats have going for them in terms of the general mood of the country, right, regardless of the polls that we have seen, we have overperformed the partisan lean by more than 10 points. So that's a good thing. But going into 2024, I do think that everyone who's on the ballot is going to have to tie themselves to Joe Biden because they are already tied to Joe Biden. And there are several things going for them. Again, to what the congresswoman is saying, Joe Biden and the Biden administration have massive accomplishments that they need to continue to explain better to the American people. In focus group after focus group, what we have seen is that when voters hear specifics about what the administration has done for them, Joe Biden's numbers shoot up. We also look at the money raised, right? Joe Biden has outraised Donald Trump. That, again, is a real measure. If people are putting their resources behind the support for this president, that is a good thing for Democrats. So again, what I say, you know, in response to these polls, we have a whole year to go. We have work to do. Let's roll our sleeves up. Let's listen to Congresswoman Dingell.

More than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its offensive, according to officials. The Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza putting those figures up. Netanyahu told ABC News yesterday that Israel will keep, quote, \"overall security responsibility for Gaza after the war ends.\" And the prime minister said this just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translation): A month ago, a war was forced on us by an extremely cruel enemy, an enemy who wanted to massacre us.

      "sentences": "There is. Which means going back to the days before Israel relinquished security control in Gaza. And the advice from the United States is not to go down that routeagain. The prime minister still seems to be speaking from a position that assumes that he can make good on the military tactics on the ground, that they can -- the IDF can completely crush Hamas. And while the operations in some ways are going well for IDF, the casualty toll is not too high so far, it's not -- doesn't indicate that Hamas is even close to being crushed, that they are even close to taking out all the tunnel complexes and all the political and military leadership. So the prime minister sort of postulating something here that actually hasn't come to pass. But it would be a huge burden on Israel if it was going to assume the security responsibility and a responsibility for the Gaza Strip until another-- and the prime minister didn't give an indication of what another sort of Palestinian leadership could be stood up to fill that vacuum. So at the moment, that's sort of looking a long ways over the horizon, not close to that horizon. And I think one of the interesting things that we heard from the prime minister, speaking just a couple of minutes ago, is he said we're working around the clock on the diplomatic front to give the IDF enough time to be able to complete their missions. I think this indicates that Prime Minister Netanyahu knows he's under a time pressure here from the United States and other countries that is going to preclude him and Israelis from being able to crush Hamas completely. Because there isn't an infinite amount of time available. The high civilian death toll is causing the pressure and request for a humanitarian pause, which he seems to be perhaps hinting he is getting closer to. But that diplomatic front to give the IDF enough time to do the job, that's really indicative of the prime minister hinting that time is limited.",

The justices hearing oral arguments today in a case that's going to test the conservative majority's view on gun rights.The case involves a Texas man named Zackey Rahimi. He's challenging his conviction under a federal law that bars people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. Rahimi was issued a restraining order back in 2020 after a violent altercation with his girlfriend. Let's bring in CNN's senior Supreme Court analyst, Joan Biskupic. So, Joan, what can you tell us about today's arguments, how the justices are now responding?",

      "sentences": "Sure. It was a very spirited set of arguments.Remember, this is the first time that they're looking at the Second Amendment gun rights and what kind of regulations governments can enact since their June 2022 decision that greatly expanded individual gun rights. And said that any kind of regulation that's being challenged has to be able to be traced to an analog back to the 18th century when the Second Amendment was ratified. So it's been a very confusing ruling for lower court judges, who aren't historians, to say what should be upheld and what shouldn't be. And in this case, Mr. Rahimi's lawyer had a very hard time pressing his case. What he essentially said was that there should be some sort of match here, in the words of the government lawyer, \"a dead ringer.\" [13:55:07] And the justices were having none of that. I don't imagine that they're really going to back away from the 2022 case that said that you need to look to history and tradition from the 18th century, but they are not going to require a real match. There are key questions here about whether, you know, judges can look at not just what regulations existed back in the 18th century but what other kinds of context were there. And in this case, very important, domestic violence was not even an issue two centuries ago. So you know, there was never going to be a match. And what the solicitor general of the United States said, defending this law, was all you have to do is look back and see laws in which people who were found to be dangerous were forbidden from having weapons, firearms. And that seemed to resonate with the justices. Now, again, it's a little bit tough to get them to refine their decision from 2022 by this conservative majority, to pull back, on the reading involving history and tradition. But I think we're definitely going to see some clarification. And I think what they'll do is open the door to ensuring that a wide swath of gun regulations are upheld down the road.",
