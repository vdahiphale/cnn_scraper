Trump not only questioning the racial identity of Vice President Kamala Harris, but also so making questionable statements about her being a DEI hire. Plus, two assassinations just hours apart. The political head of Hamas taken out on Iranian soil hours after a top Hezbollah commander was killed in Lebanon. Israel has acknowledged responsibility for one of those killings, but the Israeli prime minister is saying the country has delivered crushing blows to its enemies. How will all of this impact the hostage and ceasefire negotiations, not to mention wider tensions in the Middle East? CNN's Clarissa Ward will join us live from Tel Aviv in moments.

That's what she asked about. And here is part of Mr. Trump's response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You don't even say hello, how are you?

The White House this afternoon calling Trump's comments about her racial identity, quote, repulsive. When Trump was asked if he would pardon the rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and beat police officers, Mr. Trump said he would pardon those rioters if they're innocent. Trump also said he would consider stepping down if he is reelected, if his health is declining. He said everyone running should take a cognitive test and suggested that Kamala Harris might fail hers because she failed her very first bar exam.

But when the rubber meets the road, I think that the Trump that was on display on that stage is really pretty consistent with what he has been saying all along.And as Sara pointed out, going back to questioning whether Barack Obama was eligible to be president, you know, questioning his citizenship to now questioning Kamala Harris's race, that is consistent. I'll also say, I mean, I think that when we described this as going off the rails, we should be clear, Trump was the one who seemed to lose control of the situation from the beginning. The questions were there and they were very clear. I mean, he was asked about whether he would pardon January 6 rioters. He said that he would, including the ones who assaulted police officers. He was asked about a very high-profile case going on right now involving a Black woman who was killed by a police officer. He didn't know about the case and he seemed to suggest that the officer involved might qualify for immunity. So there were a lot of moments that I don't think were very beneficial to Donald Trump in this interview, but were nevertheless incredibly important to hear from his own mouth because he is not getting asked about these questions when he goes on the friendly interviews that he's been doing, quite a lot of over the last few weeks.",

They have further range. They have greater degree of precision all of this being done and as the senses that no one wants an all-out war.

I mean, we had respected journalist asks serious questions and he really could not answer the questions. And so, while we watch that interview, we think about the fact that all of these weird things that we're seeing on social media and on the news, just shows that Republicans and.

I mean, so she has been able to do that and she's been a strongleader, both in implementing things like capping the cost of insulin right here at home, but also being able to go on a world stage and represent our country. And so, when he says things like that, I think about what the vice president said yesterday that if he feels that way, he should reconsider debating her and coming to the debate stage and say it to her face.",

I also think about the fact that as I listened to that, it reminds me of project 2025. I mean, the things that are in Project 2025 the things that these extreme Republicans are putting forward are things that really take us back to 1825 before women could vote, before -- you know, I mean, they want to take us back. And so, as we look towards the future I'm excited about what Kamala Harris will bring to this country.

In other words, they had to be able to mesh together, work together. And so, I believe that Kamala's going to pick the person who is right for her and her leadership, but also will pick the person that's right for the American people. The great thing about being a Democrat right now is that everybody who is on the list is ready on day one, is qualified and could also be a great partner with her.

And one of my favorite segments.CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta here to answer your questions about what appears to be a summer surge of COVID-19 cases in this case this week. Every week, we do this. Sanjay comes, we talk about something. We let you guys ask questions and here come the questions the next day. Sanjay, thanks for joining us, and our little experiment here. Our first question is, it comes from Mike and the Commonwealth of Virginia. He is 64-years-old. He has asthma and he asks about this summer surge of COVID, quote, do I need a booster every six months or only once a year? So, Sanjay, what would you say to Mike and please explain what's being -- what being up-to-date with our COVID vaccine means right now? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. So first of all, being up-to-date means you went back to 2021. You got that primary series of vaccines and then you've gotten boosters at the time that you are eligible for them. That's what -- that's what up-to-date means. I think the best way to think about this is that what we're learning, is that whether you've been infected or you've had a vaccine, the immunity you get from that typically last around four to six months, sort of think of it that way. That's why we see these summer surges. Its probably win the immunity starts to wane and we see that little uptick in the summer, not as big as in the winter, but you still see an uptick. So, Mike, almost 65, also has asthma. I don't know what his current immunity is. Meaning, when did he last get a vaccine or has he been infected recently? But as a general rule, you want to get that dose. It's going to be eligible. You're going to be eligible for that in the fall, and probably another dose after that around four to six months later again, because your immunity starts to wane at that point. That's sort of the general thinking on this.",

She's generally got it right.I think what that a little bit of the difference here is that COVID, unlike other, many other viruses, you can be contagious, even before you start to develop symptoms. Not much you can do about that because you don't know you have COVID, you don't have symptoms, but that's something to keep in mind -- meaning that you could be contagious longer than five days. She is right that five days after your symptoms go away, you're still considered contagious, but you got to add in the time period where you're symptomatic as well. So when your symptoms are getting better, when you no longer have a fever off a fever reducing medicines, then you can come out of that self-imposed isolation. And the recommendation is to wear a mask for five days after that, Jake.",

That's how acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe characterized the assassination attempt on Donald Trump yesterday during a Senate hearing.

It is troubling to me that we did not get that information as quickly as we should have. We didn't know that there was this incident going on.

For the acting director building to say that this is where our guys were and this is what they scene is a misrepresentation to the American people. We were never asked what we seen or where we were from Secret Service. I can tell you that the pictures presented is, again, a misrepresentation. Where are people were, were the far right side of the AGR building. Their views in no way could have seen Crooks without pushing their heads outside the window and looking back.

But they were frank and said that their confidence in this working partnership with the Secret Service is absolutely at this point fractured. Now, I will note, Jake, a federal law enforcement source responding to this particular story said that they, meaning the Secret Service, were in touch with the Butler County SWAT emergency services unit who oversaw the Beaver folks that we spoke with. They said they have been in touch with those particular local law enforcement folks on the ground here. But this federal enforcement -- law enforcement source did note that it was curious.",
