The former president now says he is planning a visit there, but the mayor just explained to us that he wants real discussion over immigration reform, not more rhetoric.With me now is Congressman Warren Davidson, a Republican from Ohio. Congressman, thank you so much for being with us. I think you might have just heard Mayor Rue from Springfield. who said that if the former president is going to repeat the same things he has been, he really doesn't want him coming to Springfield. Your reaction? REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R), OHIO: Well, look, Springfield is a phenomenal town. I used to represent it before we were redrawn with redistricting and unfortunately Ohio lost one member of Congress in that and the lines shifted. But it's a great community. They've really been vibrant. They've done well. They've had massive investments. And the workforce has been the challenge to sustaining the growth rate. So, look, I think the people of Springfield would welcome Donald Trump and J.D. Vance anytime. I saw Vivek Ramaswamy went there and had dialogue with the community. And I think that's the thing. People want to know that they're being heard. And I think that's part of what this has been elevated to. Look, some of the cat memes were hilarious. People got a laugh out of them. But I think the part that's being dismissed is there really are serious concerns. And earlier, going back over a year ago, the City Commission and the County Commission have said together everything isn't fine. We do need help. And that help is finally coming more abundantly from the state but the federal government's still basically like, yes, never mind, everything's fine.

I'm not saying there's -- none of those people have the exact same values, but that's where it went from something that was manageable to just blowing up. And then there are federal policies that are dysfunctional like, you know, they're being told to use Google Translate to try to teach math, high school math to kids who can't even get directions in English, how to find the bathroom down the hall.

It's also particularly bad to put -- kick this into December. It's a lame duck where there's maximum level of unaccountability for elected officials. And so if there's any excuse to ever miss a deadline, September 30th is the actual deadline. You would see in a presidential election year, where there are wildly different promises from Kamala Harris and her team between you know, President Trump and his team, in terms of which direction we're going to go.

And yes, it is technically illegal to vote, but they don't have a mechanism to catch it or prevent it. And so that's what the SAVE Act is important for.

Arizona, a one-point advantage. Georgia, a one-point advantage for Donald Trump. The race, very, very close. Now let's just say the polls were exactly right.
