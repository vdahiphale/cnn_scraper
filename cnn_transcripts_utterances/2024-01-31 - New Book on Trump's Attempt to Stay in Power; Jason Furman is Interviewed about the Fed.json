You have that as kind of the most consequential or significant, but it has felt like there's 50,000 different pieces of all these investigation that have been moving and uncovered at various points. And you guys are able to kind of bring it all together. And what was striking to me, Danny, is the role that Qanon, in the backdrop of all of this, played in that through line to some degree, which I don't know that people necessarily recognize.DANIEL KLAIDMAN, CO-AUTHOR, \"FIND ME THE VOTES\": Yes, I think that is an underappreciated part of this story. You know, people knew that some of the players involved in this were involved in some extent with Qanon, but not to the extent that they were, not to the extent that this cult conspiracy really drove the steal of -- the, you know, this whole enterprise. So, we focused, for example, on Lin Wood, who is a celebrated lawyer, people remember him from the '90s, you know, the JonBenet Ramsey case, the Richard Jewell case. A few years ago he goes down the QAnon rabbit hole. He is a full-on QAnon devotee. Tweeting that Mike Pence is going to be executed by firing squad. That Chief Justice John Roberts is involved in pedophilia and the trafficking of -- sex trafficking of children. It's not that long after that, that the Trump campaign brings him into the inner sanctum of their legal battle in Georgia. He is the face of that legal - that quixotic legal battle. And, you know, Trump -- and we have audio of this. Trump is calling him on a, you know, a regular basis and cheering him on, and it's - it's extraordinary. You know, it's not just -- you know, it's colorful in some ways and exotic, but it's also dangerous because Lin Wood and some of these other people are flooding social media with these crazy conspiracy theories and dangerous stuff that's riling people up, riling up other QAnon devotees. That's leading to these horrendous threats that, you know, going - you know, racial and sexualized and terrible threats, terrorizing average people in Georgia. And that's an important part of this story, which is the human dimension of what was happening in Georgia.",

So, there's a lot of risks to the economy. Inflation could come back. Wage growth remains pretty high. I think wage growth is going to moderate, and we saw some data showing that this morning, and it's going to be consistent with slow price growth, but we could still get inflation coming back. So, there's always risks.I think the important thing for the Fed, though, is right now those risks are roughly balanced. And I don't think either of those risks are abnormally high.

And so I don't want to tell people that everything's perfect. The soft landing I do think has happened. But it's going to be a while before all the damage from the inflation is repaired. And that's real. And that's legitimate.The other thing I'd say, though, is the latest numbers on confidence and sentiment are consumers are actually more optimistic and more positive about the economy.

Members have absolutely trended Republican. Recall back in 1948, although I was not alive back then, a huge union vote. Sixty-two points Harry Truman won that vote by over Thomas Dewy. Sixty-two points. It was a big reason why he won. And, of course, union members back then made up a much larger share of the vote.You jump forward to 1992, what do we see here. We see Bill Clinton won that union vote. I don't know why that didn't go. There we go. Won that union vote by 31 points. Then, in 2020, Joe Biden carried that vote but only by 22 points nationally. And I was looking at some of the national polls there. And we're also seeing that trend line more towards Donald Trump this time around. So, union members, a big part of the Democratic coalition, but fewer and fewer of them and again fewer and fewer of them are voting Democratic. And, why is that? What is going on here? Well, union member vote in 2020, among college graduates, look at this, Joe Biden won union members by 46 points. But look among no -- with no college degree, Donald Trump won that vote by 6 points. So, often times we think of unions, we think of blue collar workers. But, in fact, there are a lot of white collar voters in unions. And the fact is those voters are going overwhelmingly for Biden.
