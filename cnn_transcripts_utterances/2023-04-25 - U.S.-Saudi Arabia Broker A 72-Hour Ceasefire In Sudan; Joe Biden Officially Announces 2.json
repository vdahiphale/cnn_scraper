      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have brokereda ceasefire in Sudan, the state of that ceasefire, the status of evacuations and the dire reality facing the Sudanese. Then U.S. President Joe Biden makes it official. He will run for re-election. And then later, a special investigation into the ultra lavish lifestyle of a Russian socialite with close ties to a Russian deputy Minister of Defense. Why is this allowed to happen in France despite sanctions? But first, sporadic clashes are threatening a very fragile ceasefire in Sudan today. But foreign governments are racing to take advantage of the reduction in fighting to get more of their diplomats out. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia brokered this latest truce agreement between Sudan's army, as well as a powerful paramilitary force. And while it may be holding in part, witnesses report heavy fighting in northern Khartoum and gunfire in the capital itself. Aid groups say the 72-hour truce could be a potential life-saver if humanitarian corridors are open for civilians desperate, of course, as we've been telling you on the show, for food, for water, as well as medicines. The U.N. warns shortages are becoming extremely acute, and the prices of basic goods are skyrocketing. Let's begin this hour with an update on the international evacuation efforts, our Sam Kiley is with us this hour in Djibouti, we're also joined by Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. Sam thank -- first to you. I mean, this is as we've just outlined there, pretty shaky ceasefire, but it's an opportunity to get people out. Talk us through the journeys and routes that people are taking, because these are quite perilous even at this stage.",

      "sentences": "They are perilous, but they are perceived in different ways. So the United States is seeing thesituation on the ground, notwithstanding the tenuous, I should say, a near ceasefire that has supposedly been negotiated that went into effect at midnight last night, Khartoum time. That notwithstanding, as far as the Americans are concerned, the situation is not quite enough for them to conduct any more air evacuations. Contrast that with the United Kingdom, which is planning to do two rotations of air evacuations pretty much as we speak. We don't have any information as to whether or not they have actually gone ahead. But they did see it. I quote, \"as a more permissive environment\". The French have managed to dock a frigate at Port Sudan, and taken on board 500 people who have been able to cross to Port Sudan from Khartoum, a journey of 800-plus kilometers, 500-miles plus. They are now safe on board and they are going to be taken to Jeddah. Egyptians also docked at Port Sudan recently, so there is a good difference in approach here. The Americans are giving a lot of air assets to this in order to keep an eye on what is going on, on the ground, but they don't see it as safe enough to put their own aircraft yet on the ground. There are some 16,000 Americans believed to be still in Sudan. But the situation really is also getting worse and worse, because as the banks are closed, there's no cash, water, fuel, food is in short supply, people are unable to recharge the credit on their phones to communicate with the outside world, in so far as it's possible at all, as believed to be only one cellular network still working in Khartoum. All of this coming, increasing the pressure on these warring factions to dial down the violence so that there could be some prospect of peace, but more importantly, to maybe get those land corridors open, open towards Egypt, open towards Port Sudan. U.N. reporting some 20,000 refugees already crossed into Chad in the west, and large numbers of refugees from South Sudan have also been returning back into the country that they fled because of violence there in the past.",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, the U.S. has said repeatedly that they simply do not view it as a viable option toconduct a massive kind of U.S. military-assisted evacuation operation for the roughly -- or I should say, the dozens. That's what they have said, Americans that have expressed a desire to get out of the country. There are roughly 16,000 Americans there who have registered with the embassy, but the number who actually have expressed the willingness and the desire to get out of the country is a bit smaller. But look, I mean, the U.S. government is saying that they're preparing for every possible plan here. The military here in particular, they are deploying ships, Navy ships to the Port of Sudan in order to assist with the potential evacuation of Americans who actually are able to reach that port on their own. And, of course, to provide any medical care to those people who reached that port, who may need it. And we just heard actually from the State Department, who said that not only are they trying to assist Americans to get into the port, and to getting out of Khartoum in the areas with the heaviest fighting, but also people in Sudan who have helped the American government over the last few years, who are affiliated essentially with the government. Maybe that is local staff, people affiliated there with the embassy. They say they're really trying everything short of a kind of military evacuation to get them to safety. But their repeated argument is that the kind of massive military evacuation that we saw play out in Afghanistan in 2021, is simply not going to happen here, and those are actually quite rare. And that usually, in cases like these, the U.S. government will simply advise citizens on a safe route out, and of course, the military has been providing intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance overhead to make sure that those convoys and those Americans that are trying to get out can do so safely, potentially warning them, of course, of any threats or of any risks that could be posed to them by exiting themselves. But ultimately, the message here is, look, we will help you try to get to areas that are safer, but we are not going to employ the military here to do that. Now, that could change, of course, and the military has repeatedly said that they are planning for any scenario, but it's really up to the State Department at this point to kind of give them the go-ahead to actually do it, Isa.",

You know, Biden has really downplayed -- with the exception of abortion, theculture war fights that Republicans like Trump and DeSantis and many other red-state governors have been pushing forward on issues like voting rights, LGBTQ rights, book bans, classroom censorship. He's really emphasized in his public appearances, the idea that he is delivering kitchen table benefits for working families. Talking about how many blue collar jobs his investment programs create, protecting Medicare and Social Security, lowering drug prices, lowering insulin prices -- in many ways, a throwback to the pre 1970s Democratic Party that he was brought up in. This video elevates the other side of the agenda that many Democrats have wanted to hear more on, which is a direct response to those Republican attempts to roll back rights that are really raging through the red states. And I think it is a reflection of the actual priorities of the coalition that will elect him. One thing to keep in mind is that we are an era of trench warfare in American politics, where very little is moving around the margins, even if it is a Trump-Biden or Trump-DeSantis, you're talking about a handful of states, probably five or less, that will pick the next president. And in those states, you're talking about a tiny number of voters.

And whenwe first started hearing reports from western analysis of pro Russian military bloggers, looking at events along the Dnipro River, the west bank of which is controlled by Ukraine, the east bank of which is controlled by Kherson. Ukraine's Armed Forces very quick to step forward and essentially demand silence around that entire issue from the media here in Ukraine, part of which operates under military restrictions. Yet, still over days to come, we saw more evidence of Ukrainian forces crossing over that river in small numbers, possibly, possibly not unprecedentedly, they may have been doing it in past months as well. We don't entirely know. But that evidence grew, and then today, we see Ukraine stepping forward and talking about the quote, \"impressive results\" of those attacks. Taking out Russian hardware, artillery, mechanics, et cetera. And it seems also pushing back Russian forces partially from that bank. All of this is hard to independently verify, I should stress. What it does certainly do, though, is raise the specter in the mind of Russian military officials that they're going to have a problem potentially on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, around Kherson, which is something they may have ruled out as being a threat. Does that mean they have to re-adjust their full strengths in that part of occupied Ukraine? Does that reduce their attention on the Zaporizhzhia region, where they've built a large defensive line of trenches, anticipating, like many analysts do, that Ukraine will try and push south through there, cutting occupied Crimea off from the rest of occupied Ukraine. That would be an extraordinary strategic move and victory by Ukraine if they manage to pull that off. So while Ukraine has said it won't announce its counteroffensive, and it certainly hasn't done anything   at this point suggests it's underway despite signs out there that things are beginning to move. This move, potentially on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River might herald a bit to get Russia off-guard or possibly, a prelude to that counteroffensive. All very hard to read at this stage, Isa, but it does make you feel something is underway. The long-awaited --",

And the researchers posed as patients, asking the hospitals about the type of abortion care that they might provide during an emergency.

And then it was surprising, Isa, that we also saw 12 percent of hospitals in this study provided misinformation, some saying that nowhere in Oklahoma could you get an abortion under any circumstance, even though we know that the policy in Oklahoma is that abortion is only offered during a medical emergency situation. So this is just one example, again, of the confusion that's out there for patients but also, Isa, for medical providers as well and specifically for doctors.

She is spending lavishly and partying at elite resorts despite E.U. as well as U.S. sanctions. Our Clarissa Ward investigates how she's getting away with it. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Svetlana Maniovich is a woman of expensive tastes. Diamonds and couture, extravagant parties and European vacations. Just last month, she was seen shopping and dancing in the elite French ski resort of Courchevel. But Maniovich is no ordinary Russians socialite. She is the other half of Russia's deputy minister of defense, Timur Ivanov, one of the most senior architects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. And, according to a shocking investigation, Maniovich continues to gallivant around France more than a year into Russia's bloody war, despite the fact that Ivanov was sanctioned by the E.U. in October. The explosive report, put out by the Anti-Corruption Foundation, an investigative outfit founded by Russia's jailed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, is based, they say, on a leaked archive of more than 8,000 of Maniovich's emails over the last 12 years and has racked up more than six million views on YouTube. It claims that on March 25, 2022, as dozens of missiles rained down on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Maniovich spent more than $100,000 in a top Paris jewelry store on the Place Vendome.",
