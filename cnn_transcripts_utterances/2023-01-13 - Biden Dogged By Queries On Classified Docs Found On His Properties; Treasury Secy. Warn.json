The Justice Department has interviewed Biden's former executive assistant who was on the team that packed up his office at the end of the Obama administration, also in regard to the classified documents discovered one was a memo from Biden to President Obama. There were also two briefing memos preparing Biden for phone calls with foreign leaders. It's unclear how much of this is still sensitive.Let's go now to CNN's chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly and CNN's senior justice correspondent Evan Perez. Phil, I'll start with you.

And to some degree, that's a recognition of a very new phase that they're in right now. One that carries a lot of risks when a special counsel gets involved in an investigation.Keep in mind. This had been reviewed from a U.S. Attorney. This had been the president's personal attorneys doing their own search and review as well. A special counsel puts this in a very different level and a very different set of risks that they need to weigh as they go through this process. Now, that doesn't necessarily help us understand better what has happened over the course of the last several months as this has played out, but it does underscore the fact that in the course of the last four days, as we have received two different statements from the White House Counsel's Office, two different public statements from the president, the first of which seemed to omit the very important elements of the second. In both cases, there has been a recognition that going out while this review is still underway, while the personal attorney review is still underway, and letting this kind of drift piece by piece by piece was certainly not helpful. And to some degree, as Evans reported, played a role in the decision to put a special counsel in place in the first place. At this point in time, as they ramp up for this very new reality, as they put the process in place to deal with a special counsel, something they A., didn't want and B., certainly weren't expecting at the start of this week, you're not going to hear a lot more publicly about it from them. I think that is now kind of their permanent posture to some degree.",

And as Phil pointed out, you know, there was an early part of this, which was being done by a U.S. Attorney Chicago -- in Chicago with John Lausch. He conducted and his team conducted a number of interviews not only with the president's former executive secretary, but now, they're going to go on and want to talk to additional people. They're going to want to know whether there's the possibility of additional documents and how do you make sure that there are no more documents out there.We've seen a parallel situation with the investigation into Trump's mishandling of -- the former President Trump's mishandling of classified documents. In that case, has been a lot more combative. The Justice Department and the White House right now are projecting that you know, it's been more cooperative. But that cooperation is going to really hit a test when the new special counsel starts making demands and starts asking for things. We'll see how much cooperation happens then.",

There's 12, as far as we know, classified documents with President Biden, there were more than 300, or something to that effect with President Trump. So, what's the -- how will these investigations proceed differently if at all? PEREZOne of the reasons why we know so much about what happened with the Trump documents is because, you know, he went to court and he started fighting with the Justice Department. And that forced us to be able to see a lot of the documents that were going back and forth. So, this one is definitely a lot different because the Biden team has, you know, tried to be cooperative. They say that they offered -- you know, they reached out to the Justice Department, reached out to the archives with these documents. We know that they've already interviewed a number of people who were involved in this. It is a much different process. And from the scope of the appointment memo that we saw yesterday, guys, you can see that you know, this is an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents. Now, we'll see whether it -- you know there's something else that pops up, but at this point, we're in a far different place than in the Trump administration -- the Trump investigation, Victor and Alisyn.",

Are there other locations that need to be searched?It doesn't seem like that's the case with Biden. I'm hedging a little bit because it seems like on the Biden front, every day comes with the discovery of some new trove of documents. So, it's possible there'll be more shoes to drop.

And every once in a while, Congress brushes up against that, and the lawmakers have to raise the debt ceiling or avoid a default, which would be catastrophic. I mean Mark Zandi once told me it would be \"financial Armageddon.\" Because if they don't raise the debt ceiling in time, then you would have chaos in markets, you could have a recession that hits everyone, and also the government might have to stop payments to everyone from federal employees to military salaries, Medicare benefits, Social Security checks. So, this is a big deal.I'm not saying it's going to happen but I just to set the stakes here. So, the debt limit currently stands at $31 trillion. It was last raised at the end of 2021. And Treasury Secretary Yellen is now saying the debt ceiling is going to be reached next week. So, what they can do in the meantime, though, is they can do some, on basically accounting gimmicks, they're called extraordinary measures. In this case, they're going to stop -- temporarily suspend investments in some federal retirement accounts. Now, this buys them time. They don't know exactly how much time but Yellen says that they don't think that they're going to actually run out of cash until early June. But Yellen is still urging Congress to act very soon. Let me read you a cue line from this letter that she sent today. She said, \"failure to meet the government's obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability.\" So, this all sets the stage for what could be a pretty epic fight over the next six to nine months over the debt ceiling.",

But the National Archives figured it out with the Trump documents, obviously, and they were alerted to it with the Biden documents whether or not that makes a difference.While we're here, I also want to ask you about what Congressman Matt Gaetz has just announced. So, he has just said that as part of this deal that people didn't know about until last night that he made in order to support Kevin McCarthy becoming speaker that he got an assurance from Kevin McCarthy that he would release all of the security foot -- camera footage from the January 6 insurrection. That's what he wanted Kevin McCarthy to agree to. Do you like that idea and that deal?",

Look, I was involved in the shooting at the baseball field and you know, this was a situation where we were at great risk. And certainly, the balance of power in the United States of America House of Representatives could have been changed that morning if Steve Scalise wasn't there and Capitol Police wasn't there.So, if we can learn from what was not in place and what needs to be in place to protect our beautiful Capitol, and all of those of us that work there, I would like to do that. I want to do include the events of June 14, 2017, at the baseball field with the January 6 Commission. I went to rules and offered that because I thought it was important that we look at all aspects of how we are protected. And that was voted down and ruled in a partisan fashion. So, you know, I think -- look, a little -- get a little sunshine on everything but I have no idea what Matt Gaetz said to Kevin McCarthy. I'm just speaking from, you know, where I sit.",
