So, he has already testified under oath, though. There is a deposition out there. So, I would expect his lawyers to be prepping him within the confines of whatever came out in the four corners of that deposition. But keep in mind, when you get on the stand, credibility is king. So, now, we're going to be talking about challenging his credibility and it might go outside the scope of this case. I would expect the plaintiff's attorneys to push for catching him in all sorts of untruth, the veracity of anything he said, even outside of this case, and the defense to try and narrow it. That's the right we're going to see go into the courtroom. I know this judge. He's very fair. But he will take that step if it is -- if it is within the confines of the law.

Clearly, Trump has never been held accountable for his misogyny. We knew about the Access Hollywood tapes but, of course, now it does all sort of fit together. And to your point about the fact pattern, right, you look at the dynamics of the Stormy Daniels case that he was, in fact, trying to cover up, you know, the allegations. He was hiding this information for the public specifically so they wouldn't know who he was and what he had done in order to win the election. Right? And it's not that dissimilar in the Jean Carroll case. Right? Just denied, deflect, attack. It's all the same pattern. I think it's an incredibly important case.

I get worried that cases like this where it's just random act of violence, potentially, we don't know, but where people assume this is a random act of violence and then they get scared, and then how do we create these reactionary laws.We see that constantly in the criminal justice system where one thing happens to someone and it gets publicized, and then all of a sudden, we need all these laws. And like you said, you know, the folks who study this like the Vera Institute have looked into bail reform. You know, is there any connection to recidivism or increase in violent crime? And they have found none. So, I think when we're looking at this, we can't just say, well, we think that bail reform would do X, Y, and Z. We have to actually look at the data and we can't just let events that make us feel scared make us do things that harm people on a mass scale.",
