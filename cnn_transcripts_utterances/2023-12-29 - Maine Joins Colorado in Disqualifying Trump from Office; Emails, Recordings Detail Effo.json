So first, Colorado's support -- Colorado's court system decided that. And then yesterday, after essentially hearing from voters looking at evidence, the Maine secretary of state made a very similar decision, deemed Trump to be both someone who engaged in the insurrection of January 6th and also decided that she had the ability, as the secretary of state, the responsibility, even, to choose and to determine that he was not eligible to be on primary ballots in 2024 in that presidential election. Maine is going to be voting on Super Tuesday, just like Colorado. Here is a little bit more of the explanation from Shenna Bellows last night, speaking on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But sometimes we get that conjoining with a large low-pressure system that creates strong surface winds. So that strong winds will create large waves on the surface of the ocean. But that's working in opposite with that ocean swell that traverses across the Pacific Ocean in this instance. And what it does is it quickly, actually, shortens the wavelength. Remember, that's the difference between the wave peak and trough. And it creates a larger-than-normal wave or a rogue wave, that can crash upon the shoreline and taking people off-guard and can be extremely dangerous and lethal in some instances. Here's the low-pressure system that was responsible for the oncoming surge and a swell that was working in conjunction with this. We have another round of large waves that are anticipated today right through Friday morning. That is why we have these high surf warnings and advisories, dotting the entire California coastline. In fact, this could cause some coastal flooding concerns and dangerous rip currents. Bottom line here, Phil and Erica, you need to stay out of the water. It is extremely dangerous to be an onlooker and to see what's happening along the coastline, because these waves can catch you off- guard in a moment's notice.",
