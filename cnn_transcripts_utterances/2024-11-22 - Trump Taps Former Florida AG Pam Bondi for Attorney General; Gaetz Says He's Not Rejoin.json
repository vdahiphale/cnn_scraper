      "sentences": "Today, Trump allies are quickly rallying around the President-elect's new pick for Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Just hours after Trump's first choice, former Congressman Matt Gaetz announced he was withdrawing his nomination, Trump wasted no time picking another fierce loyalist to lead the Department of Justice. Bondi was Florida's first female Attorney General, and she defended Trump in his first impeachment trial. And like Gaetz, she's also pushed to use the DOJ to go after Trump's perceived enemies.Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAM BONDI, TRUMP'S PICK FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL: When Republicans take back the White House, you know what's going to happen? The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state, last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows, but now they have a spotlight on them, and they can all be investigated.

They believe that she is much more confirmable than Matt Gaetz ever was, and they're happy that Donald Trump isn't going to have to expend the same amount of political capital that he would have on Matt Gaetz if he was going to try and get him confirmed.Remember, one of the things that we've been reporting was that some of these allies had informed Trump that he was going to have to use an enormous amount of his political capital to get Gaetz through a confirmation process, which would likely hurt some of his other nominees, particularly some that are less controversial than Gaetz, but still controversial, like Tulsi Gabbard or RFK Jr., and that that played a factor into Donald Trump's decision to call Matt Gaetz after he had spoken to a number of senators and essentially confirmed that at that time, Gaetz did not have the votes in the Senate to be confirmed. Now, he told him that. Sources tell me that he did not pressure Gaetz to drop out. He just gave him those facts. But here's what Gaetz said about part of the reason he withdrew his name. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FORMER REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): And again, while our discussions were going well, I found myself having to do two jobs at one time, Charlie, and you got a front row seat to this. I had a full-time job explaining to senators that maybe a tweet I sent about them was rash and not reflective of how I would serve as attorney general. And at the same time, I was having to build out the Department of Justice with the right human talent, the right policy infrastructure. And Pam Bondi's confirmation won't have some of the sharp edges. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Can a state level prosecution proceed against him while he's president- elect and then president?I'm going to spoil the bottom line here. He's not going to get sentenced on this case. He's not going to get sentenced before he becomes president. He's not going to get sentenced while he's president. And the D.A. earlier this week actually floated the possibility. They said we may want to hold open the option of sentencing him after he's done his second term, meaning in 2029. That is not going to happen. That is a ridiculous request legally and practically. So essentially, we're playing out the string here. I think eventually this case will go away. It's just a question of what the niceties will be down the stretch.",

On the first question, is she qualified? Unquestionably, she is qualified. She has been a prosecutor for 20 years. She's been the Attorney General of Florida for eight of those years. And that resume is on par with what we've seen from other attorneys general throughout history.But then there's a separate question about whether she is sufficiently independent. And I think this is where Democrats or people who oppose her will focus at the confirmation hearings. She has represented Donald Trump. She has worked with Donald Trump. That all is not abnormal. But what I think is abnormal is, first of all, that she has denied the 2020 election results. I think that's a big problem. And second of all, the clip you played in the beginning of this segment where she said we're going to prosecute the prosecutors, I think that's a big problem with respect to her independence and her ability to go in there and assess these cases on the merits, which is what the job requires.",

The attorney general is going to be from the same party and the same ideology as the president. We've even had a history of presidents appointing AGs who have done legal work for them in the past, or in John F. Kennedy's example, who were their brothers. Can't do that now because of nepotism laws.But I think the challenge is, you do -- we do and should expect a certain degree of independence from the attorney general. You need an attorney general, Merrick Garland's an example, Janet Reno's an example. We saw some of this even from Jeff Sessions at times, who's willing to say this is a necessary move that may not be in the president's best personal or political interests, but that are necessary to preserve rule of law and to preserve DOJ's institutional independence. It's a fine line. There's no science to it. But I think Pam Bondi is going to be questioned on that extensively at our confirmation hearing.",

Both of them have over a decade of prosecutorial experience.And if they say, I'm going to preserve the values of DOJ, I'm going to do the job as a prosecutor should, then they may have different policy goals, but then they're going to have the Justice Department will be on a good path. On the other hand, if the clip we just saw of Pam Bondi saying, we're going to prosecute the prosecutors, if that comes into being, if that actually happens, then there's going to be a huge problem.

If you go back and you look at President Obama, when he was making nominations for his Cabinet, he had two nominees that had to withdraw for Commerce Secretary.Tom Daschle had to withdraw as HHS Secretary. Bill Clinton had two nominations for Attorney General before he landed on Janet Reno. And so -- and those happened in January and February. This happened early on. It is not a setback for President Trump. It's only been a little over two weeks. But it's important to remind folks that Donald Trump won every battleground state. He deserves the opportunity to choose his Cabinet. There are, of course, going to be bumps along that road. But that's all this is, is a bump. I think Pam Bondi is a good choice.

And yet here there have been threats from Republicans that they would primary anyone who would oppose Gaetz. Trump himself seemed to put the word out that he favored this pick intensely, despite the allegations. J.D. Vance was on Capitol Hill doing the same.

And that pivot led to Pam Bondi, which I think is a good choice. I think this whole thing is normal and natural. President Trump won. He made a nomination. The Senate gets to confirm. He saw trouble ahead in the confirmation hearings. And so he made a different choice. And Matt Gaetz withdrew. And so the process worked like it's supposed to. It happened really early on.

However, there is a big incentive that the state of Texas has added to this, because any school district that chooses to use this curriculum will get $40 per student per year and an additional $20 to print that material. That is a pretty big carrot for a lot of school districts in this state that are budget-strapped at this point in time. Now, I should add that the Texas Education Agency, this is the Texas agency that created this curriculum, responded to our request for comment in regards to the controversy relating to this curriculum. And of course, a lot of critics saying that there's too much Christianity in these lessons, that it references the Bible too much and it doesn't reference other religions. But here's what the TEA told us. They said, quote, \"Religious source material comprises just a small part of the product and includes information from multiple faith traditions.\" Again, that vote, Brianna, eight to seven, a very tied vote, but that means that this controversial curriculum is now added to the approved curriculum in the state of Texas with that big carrot of $60 per student per year for school districts. I should add that this curriculum can be used starting in the 2025, 2026 school year. Brianna.",
