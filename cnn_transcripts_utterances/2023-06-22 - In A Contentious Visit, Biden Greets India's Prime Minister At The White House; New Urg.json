We heard from President Biden there in front of a huge and enthusiastic crowd at the White House. Let's talk about what we're seeing as we're going to watch this and listen to the leaders as they speak. Ivan Watson back with us, David Chalian, as well as Arlette Saenz. But Ivan, you were saying, just as we went to the president, what a difference a decade makes. No kidding when you see these images that we're seeing on the White House lawn. And also, interesting though, what stuck out to me, you tell -- you give me your take, let's start to me, from what Biden was discussing there from lectern is his emphasize on the freedom of expression, religious pluralism, and the diversity of the people is what makes our country so unique.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, if you look at the 2022 State Department human rights report and religious freedoms reports and what they write about India governed by Narendra Modi and his BJP Party, they point out a lot of criticisms. Saying that freedom of the press is declined there, that a lot of journalists have been facing criminal charges and arrests for the things they're writing and when they write critical things about the ruling party. And real concerns about persecution and discrimination against India's Muslim minority.And that gets back to Modi's own track record of why he was denied a visa to the U.S. back in 2005, that's when he was the top official in the State of Gujarat and there was widespread religious violence there that killed more than a thousand people, most of them Muslims. Now, he's now elected prime minister, and as you can see, President Biden rolling out the red carpet for him. A lot have changed in that time. Just this year, India became the world's most populous country, replacing China in that position. When Biden talks about shared values, I think a lot of observers would argue that in fact, these two leaders have shared interests and China is at the heart of that. In 2020, Indian troops got into a deadly battle, skirmish, with the Chinese forces in the Himalayas, along a disputed border. At least four Chinese PLA soldiers killed, at least 20 Indian soldiers killed. And both armies are, kind of, eye-to-eye in a very tense standoff there to this day. We often hear about the rivalry and the tension between the U.S. and China. India is actually face-to-face with the People's Liberation Army in that standoff. And that is one of the things that many observers say is bringing the U.S. and India together at this moment. Another is the economy. The U.S. has become India's largest trading partner. Just today, we got an announcement that G.E. signed a memorandum of understanding to build engines for India Air Force fighter jets, that is one of the announcements that we're expecting to hear from these two leaders when they talk about closer defense and economic ties.

Thank you all so much. We're going to continue watching this because coming up, there's a lot of -- there's a lot ahead today with regard the state visit. They have an Oval Office bilateral meeting. They have a press conference that was -- there was a lot of negotiations to get to that moment happening behind the scenes.

We know that jobless claims, 264,000 first-time fillings for unemployment benefits three weeks in a row now at about 260 or higher. That shows a strong but slowing labor market, that's what the Fed wants to see. These are still historically low in number of layoffs, but rising a little bit.And we also know that the housing market is showing some signs of softening. May home prices fell 3.1 percent from last year, that's the largest drop in home prices in more than a decade. Since December of 2011, the median existing home price right now, $396,100, it's been in the housing market. You've seen those higher rates and higher mortgage rates starting to cool activity.",

He's telling lawmakers, he said yesterday and today, the job market is still overall quite strong. They're watching that there. And you can expect more rate hikes.You're going to hear, you've already heard from one Democratic senator who said, wait, we hope the cure for high inflation isn't painful, too. That you're not trying to, like, run down the job market. And that's this contradiction that, I think, so many Americans are really interested in the Fed to kill inflation might have to hurt the job market a little bit more.
