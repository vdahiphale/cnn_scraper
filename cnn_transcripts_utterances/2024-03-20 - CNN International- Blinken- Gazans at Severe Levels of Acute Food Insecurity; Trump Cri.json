The World Health Organization says a growing number of infants there are on the brink of death from acute hunger. It comes just a day after a U.N.-backed report predicted an imminent famine in northern Gaza between now and May. The U.S. Secretary of State says Gaza's entire population is at severe levels of food insecurity, while the U.N. human rights chief is warning Israel that continued restriction of aid into the territory may amount to a war crime. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLKER TURK, U.N. COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS: The extent of Israel's continued restrictions on the entry of aid into Gaza, together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities, may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war, which is a war crime.

We're hearing about more than a million people in Gaza now who have completely exhausted their food supplies. We're hearing from doctors and from the World Health Organization saying they are seeing an increasing number of newborn babies now being born severely underweight, pregnant mothers who are starving. And this is a desperate situation, but it is only growing more desperate by the hour because of that difficulty in getting aid in. And you heard there from the U.N.'s human rights chief warning that this could amount to a war crime. We've heard repeatedly now from the U.N. and other U.N. officials saying that they believe Israel is intentionally starving the Palestinian people in Gaza. Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to CNN over the weekend saying that Israel does not want to do that, that, in fact, Israel is working to ensure that there is enough humanitarian aid getting into the Gaza Strip, and they have accused Hamas of looting aid coming in. But that is a claim which has been categorically denied and rejected by aid groups, by the United Nations, and, of course, as we have heard repeatedly, not enough aid is getting in via those land crossings because of obstructions put in place by Israeli authorities on the ground.",
