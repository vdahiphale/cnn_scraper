      "sentences": "The president in his appearance there at the White House, flanked by members of the now-freed Americans and Alsu's family as well.Just moments ago, we learned the four former prisoners are now wheels up out of Turkey. They're heading to the U.S., Whelan coming home after almost six years in Russian prisons, Gershkovich more than one year. CNN's M.J. Lee is at the White House. M.J., this was quite a moving moment there at the White House. Tell us more about what we saw. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, a very moving and emotional moment here at the White House, for sure. And President Biden in those remarks said, whenever these four Americans are wheels down on American soil, he plans on being there to greet them at Joint Base Andrews. And we heard the president there flanked by the family members of those four Americans that are now on their way home really celebrating their release and describing this multinational agreement as a feat of diplomacy. And this is a historic agreement that has been years in the making. Just keep in mind that Paul Whelan is an American who was already in detention in Russia when President Biden took office in early 2021. So you could really argue that he has been working on securing Whelan's release for the entirety of his first term. And we also know that the president, of course, has been pushing to finalize this deal in the recent days, including as he was considering the future of his political campaign. We know that, for example, about an hour before the president, just 11 days ago released that letter to the American people saying that he was ending his 2020 campaign, had been on the phone with the Slovenian prime minister pushing him to get this deal across the finish line. Now, a few things that I just want to make sure U.S. officials are very much emphatic about, in light of this prisoner swap deal. One is that, as these deals typically go, they're emphatic that they have to make some excruciating decisions. That is to say that these deals are not made overnight. They certainly are not easy decisions in terms of what swaps they have to make and what negotiations go into play. And second, they, of course, did not get everything that they wanted. That includes Marc Fogel, an American that was sentenced to 14 years of labor camp in Russia. This is a history teacher who had been teaching in Moscow, though U.S. officials are making clear that they are going to redouble their efforts to try to get him out. They were unsuccessful in doing that this time around. And this deal also, U.S. officials are stressing, does not mean that there is now some breakthrough or even a detente of sorts in U.S.-Russian relations. They are -- U.S. officials making very clear that, even despite this deal, there are going to be no major policy changes when it comes to how this administration views Vladimir Putin or the ongoing war in Ukraine.",

And then it was Germany, Poland, Norway, and Slovenia that were involved. And then there's Turkey, obviously, where this exchange occurred. And I spoke with a senior administration official just moments ago, who described Turkey as being extremely helpful in this exchange and said that Turkey was picked as the location for this for a number of reasons, but one of them being that they have been involved in negotiations when it comes to back-and-forth with Russia in multiple instances, when you talk about the Black Sea grain initiative when it comes to the Ukraine war or the prisoner swap that we saw that released Brittney Griner, which also took place in Turkey. So, Turkey played a pivotal role here. Now, as you were hearing from M.J., there are Americans who don't get included in these prisoner swaps. That is the sad part of days like this. Marc Fogel, who's that American teacher who was detained and sentenced to 14 years in prison, facing charges of drug smuggling, his family just found out today that he wasn't included. That's according to his lawyer who I spoke with. She said to me that the White House didn't call their family. She said that they were shocked. They're really upset. We will hear more from them, I am sure. But that is one of the challenging pieces of days like today. We heard from the secretary of state, who spoke to the fact that the Biden administration has been working on this so tirelessly. And, sometimes, the families, even of those who are involved in the swap today who are being released from Russia today, didn't know if those efforts would actually pay off. Now they're seeing that they will. But he spoke to the Americans who are still wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad. And he said: \"We will not forget you. We will not rest until you see your loved ones again.\"",

Now, Roger started this job under Mike Pompeo's State Department. And a lot of the same people have stayed with him and they have worked this 24/7, not for days or months, but for years, to get to this point, to get Dave Whelan out, in addition to Paul, and Alsu, who was taken more recently. And it reminds me. So, Roger is a former Green Beret and their motto is to free the oppressed. And it's really nice to be talking about the great news of these people being released. KEILAR:  And I would also add, Robert O'Brien, the former national security adviser to former President Trump, highly critical of the Biden administration when it comes to their approach. He says that this encourages more hostage-taking. And yet he praises Roger Carstens when given the chance.",

The president sat us down on a regularbasis over the course of the detentions of Paul, Evan, and Alsu, and really pushed us to think about what configuration would actually work to make this happen. And it was through an iterative process of back-and-forth with various of the allies I mentioned, with engagements with our Russian counterparts, where we were making proposals, getting responses, that this all came together. And so I would say that, if you had not had Joe Biden sitting in the Oval Office, I don't think this would have happened. But, as I said in my remarks, there were a lot of other people who played a central role in building out the pieces of this, and then executing on that. And the execution phase of this to get this level of coordination together, to have those planes all land on the tarmac at the same time from multiple different countries, with so many different individuals coming from Russia and going back to Russia, really extraordinary.

It's a question that we grapple with every time that we look at the hard decisions involved in one of these exchanges.It is difficult to send back a convicted criminal to secure the release of an innocent American. And yet, sometimes, the choice is between doing that and consigning that person basically to live out their days in prison in a hostile foreign country or in the hands of a hostile power. So, from our perspective, we have assessed and analyzed that risk, and we have judged that the benefit of reuniting Americans, of bringing people home, and also of vindicating the idea that the American president and the American government are going to do what it takes to protect and secure the release of innocent Americans, that that benefit outweighs the risk. And that's how we have proceeded. I would point out, in addition to that, that, in periods of time when the U.S. government didn't tend to do prisoner exchanges, Americans were unjustly detained and held hostage overseas. In periods where we did, Americans were unjustly detained and held hostage overseas. So I think there are real questions. And Roger Carstens, the hostage negotiator at the State Department, has actually pointed out that, in this analysis, it is not quite as clear-cut that the evidence actually demonstrates the kind of result that your question speaks to, that a lot more people get taken because we do these exchanges. But it's something that we have to pay attention to, and it's something that makes these decisions by the president not simple decisions, hard decisions, and yet, as he did today, he was prepared to make them.

That followed on a conversation that the president had just a short time before that, and it was in the run of high-level engagements and a back-and-forth that the president and the chancellor were having that Vice President Harris was actually able to sit face-to-face with Chancellor Scholz and talk through the elements of this.
