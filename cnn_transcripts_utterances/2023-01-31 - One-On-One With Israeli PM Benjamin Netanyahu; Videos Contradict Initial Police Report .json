The world on edge, fearing recent violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Could once again spiral into bloody chaos. This hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu one on one in a CNN exclusive. How Netanyahu plans to address the violence, how he responds to criticism about his newly-formed right wing government, and the actions he might take that could have ramifications worldwide. Plus, new contradictions after the horrific police beating of Tyre Nichols. The initial police report what video recordings actually show. And the big announcement today on Capitol Hill from embattled Republican Congressman George Santos after all the lies. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper live in Jerusalem, where recent violence has become the center of international geopolitics this week. Just minutes ago, I wrapped an exclusive interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is back in office for unprecedented sixth term. I pressed him on his long-term plan for any semblance of peace with the Palestinians. His formation of the most hard-right government in Israel's history, and his proposed changes to the Israeli judicial system, changes critics say could undercut a key part of Israel's democracy. You'll hear some of that exclusive exchange in just a moment. The full interview will air tonight in CNN primetime special at 9:00 p.m. Eastern. This all comes at the end of the bloodiest month in Israel and the West Bank in years. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on day two of his trip to the region. He met with Netanyahu earlier. He met with Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank earlier today where he pressed for de-escalation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Nobody was expecting to have Secretary Blinken come up and say here is my ten-point plan how we're going to fix everything. Now, we heard from the Palestinian Authority after the press conference.The Palestinian Authority presidential spokesperson was on CNN international a few hours ago. He said, listen, we were happy to hear him talk how they want Israel to stop settle and expansion and have Israel stop demolition, stop legalization of what Americas consider illegal outposts, but they still said they are not going to go back to security coordination. This is something the Palestinian Authority cut off last week in the wake of all of this violence, something the Americans immediately said they thought was a bad idea. They see this as something that's vital to keep the conversation going, to keep some sense, some tool they can have to keep the calm. And they said even after all of these meetings, you know what, as long as Israel is doing what it's doing, we're not going back to security coordination. Now, Blinken did say his senior members are staying in the region to continue working. I think that is an important thing to note. And so, likely one of their main goals will be before those senior staffers leave to get that security coordination back on the table.",

But for them, it's important about the symbolism to show that the Americans are trying to push for this because without the two-state solution, what is there going to be? What is the answer? And for everyday Palestinian, while they are pleased to hear from the Americans things like more money for the U.N. agency, 4G, reopening of the consulate, what they really want to hear is how are we going to get a two-state solution and what the Israelis want to hear is how are we going to get towards a point where the violence has calmed down, where not everyday there's some new violence. Same for the Palestinians. That is what everybody wants on both sides. We haven't yet heard that sort of grand plan. Nobody expects it to happen. But what's really important now is just to calm things down a little bit and hopefully, as Secretary Blinken said, get to the point where they can then start putting those steps in place. But when you look at the political situation in the Palestinian territories, in Israel, I don't see how those two sides can come together any time soon.",

We're not going to say, we're not going to have peace until we kick out the Arabs from Israel and we're not going to have peace until we kick out the Jews from these areas, which are disputed. They're not illegal. They're disputed areas. And the only way to resolve that dispute is to have peace negotiations with the Palestinians consistently refuse to enter. Now, I think we can get hung up on this. And we have in the past. People said, you know, unless you resolve this issue, and unless you have peace with the Palestinians, you're not going to have a broader peace with the Arab world. So, for 25 years, the Palestinians who don't want peace with Israel want to see a peace without Israel, who don't want a state next to Israel but a state instead of Israel, that, in effect, veto on Israel's expansion of the peace -- circle of peace around it. I went around them. I went directly to the Arab states, and forged with a new concept of peace for peace. Peace through strength. I forged four historic peace agreements.",

I can't just do this around the Palestinians. That's important to me and to my constituency. What are you willing to give? Are you willing to let people in the West Bank vote?

We moved out of Gaza, another radical Islamist, the Hamas, took over.And if we just talk away, as people suggest, then you'll have Hamas and Iran move into the hills around Jerusalem overlooking Tel Aviv. That's -- so I think there's a formula for peace, but my view is because of the fact that the continuing, the persistent Palestinian refusal which goes back a century, to recognize Jewish state, a nation state for the Jewish people and any boundary, that persistent refusal persists. If we wait for them, we're not going to have peace. People said you have to work your way outside in, first, inside out.

One thing people would push back is the Abraham Accords were about two and a half years ago. Anything changed with the Palestinians? No, it's gotten worse. So, if we thought we presented the vision of how normalization can look and do something and see there's benefit to a diplomatic resolution with the state of Israel, that hasn't happened.

This comes after the firing of three Memphis EMTs for their response to the fatal police beating of Nichols. And now, another officer has been put on leave, making that at least two relieved of their duties just this week. Here is CNN's Nick Valencia.

First reported by \"The New York Times,\" a photo of a police report was posted online by a Memphis talk show host. The district attorney's office tells CNN the D.A. does have a report that has that same account of events. The report suggests Nichols was pulled over after police say he veered into oncoming traffic. It says he was violent, sweating profusely and irate when he exited the vehicle. And quote, started to fight with officers at one point grabbing one of the detective's gun.

Congressman Stewart, thanks so much for joining us. So, President Biden has said he is not going to negotiate on this period. Speaker McCarthy says he's not going to play, quote, political games. Raising the debt ceiling on a bipartisan basis has been happening for decades I don't need to tell you. In fact, under Trump, a majority of House Republicans voted to raise the debt ceiling two out of three times. Why this year for Republicans to take this stand, this year when we're teetering maybe on a recession and people worry that we're -- this action, you know, defaulting, could bring about an economic apocalypse? REP. CHRIS STEWART (R-UT): Well, Jake, it's not just this year that Republicans have taken this stand. We have used this opportunity of increasing the debt ceiling limit to negotiate and to get some concessions on spending many, many times in the past. And honestly, Jake, I can't imagine the president saying -- and then having to defend to the American people, I'm not even going to talk about it. I'm not going to negotiate a single dollar. And to remember or to remind the American people, little more than ten years ago when there were negotiations between the Obama administration and Speaker Boehner at the time, it was Vice President Biden who was responsible for those negotiations. In fact, we called him the Biden negotiations. So, this is something he's done in the past. Something he's advocated for in the past. We're just asking -- we spent 10 -- I'm sorry, $12 trillion in the last two years. Are you telling us there's not a single dollar that we can negotiate over and some spending cuts? Of course there are. So, I think this is an opening salvo. It's not where they're going to end up. The president is going to have to negotiate with us. And hopefully we get to some concessions that we can say to the American people, yeah, we're trying to be fiscally responsible.",

To him, debt wasn't a problem. It was a feature. And I'm disappointed that we have this spending that we did under the former president. But that doesn't advocate the responsibility I have now in the position we have to once again try to advocate for some spending cuts and for fiscal responsibility.

I mean, we're just barely organizing our committees.That once again will take a little time, probably several months before we have a budget. And probably about the same amount of time before the president has a budget. And -- but one thing I worry about, Jake, it worries me that we get to June when these supposed extraordinary measures run out. We should be working with urgency now. We shouldn't wait until we're right up to the deadline because then you have this countdown the clock to default. It adds all sorts of pressures that make the negotiations, I think, less productive during those times.
