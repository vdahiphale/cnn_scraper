I'll speak with a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about this new Russian assault and plans for a Ukrainian counteroffensive that's expected to begin soon.Also tonight, new moves by Florida Republicans designed to help Governor Ron DeSantis and is likely run for President. This amid deep concerns among Republicans in Congress about DeSantis's war with the Disney Corporation. And we're tracking fears that another U.S. bank may collapse at any moment. First Republic stock plunging as the White House says it does not have a rescue plan in the works. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. We begin this hour in Ukraine where CNN is on the scene of the deadliest missile strike in this new wave of Russian attacks. At least 23 people killed when an apartment building in the central Ukrainian city of Uman was hit. CNN's Nic Robertson is on the scene for us.

What you see down there behind me is all cleared out in the lower level. So they just going to tilt up there. I'll step back, he'll take a look at the firefighters up there, high up in the apartment building, literally hanging off the face of the collapsed concrete floors and ceilings there in those ruined apartments. They are up there because of the 109 people registered to live there. There are still are not accounted for.We spoke to a lady earlier who told us that her friend was in an 8th floor apartment up there. The friend survived. The husband is in hospital now, but their two daughters, a 13 year old girl and a seven year old girl, are still missing. We've just learned from firefighters right now, in the last few minutes that the reason they're there trying to work their way down to get to that debris field there several stories up. The reason they're doing it is because there are children that are unaccounted for. We don't know how many, but the firefighters have been saying all day that they would continue to work until they've been through all the debris. So all the families that we've been seeing around here today, Wolf, have been standing around watching in the earlier hours today, some of them in desperate grief because they know, the loved ones have lost others hoping and hoping for good news. There have been police psychologists on site here. There's a local school that's got a room full of clothing for families that have lost everything. There's even a police DNA testing center here, a mobile center that's come in to help the families here get some closure, get some understanding. But this is what it's all about right now, working through the night. It's midnight here now, working through the night to try to bring solace for those other families who are waiting for just some information about missing loved ones, Wolf.",

They're trying to find out if anyone is still alive inside that building. It comes at a time when Ukraine has cautioned that it won't announce when it's counteroffensive will begin. But what do you expect? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think that we may not know exactly when the counteroffensive does begin. Hopefully, it will begin with partisan activity behind the lines, opening up avenues of approach for the Ukrainian main forces, pinning down Russian reserves, blocking roads. I mean, this is pretty standard, but the Ukrainians have an incredible capacity to do this if they choose to do this. And then you'll see it moving forward in a reconnaissance led attack, I think. But the Ukrainians are going to be very wary when they move this forward because they know that they've got to make a dramatic impact here. They don't want to run up with all their equipment up front, suffer some losses, get thrown back, and have the world say, oh, my God, it's all over. No, they're going to gnaw their way through these Russian defenses when they go. And they may be from a different direction than we expect. I mean, everybody's looking south. It might be the northeast. It might be south of Bakhmut. We don't know exactly where they're going to go, but they are going to move with reconnaissance. They're going to move with concentration of power, and they're going to be certain that they can protect their flanks. They know there's a Russian counteroffensive force out there, might be 20, might be 40 battalion tactical groups with a lot of air power that could come in and strike them. They've got to have the anti-air defense. And as the diplomatic advisor said, they got to have artillery ammunition to win a counterpart fight when they once closed in with the enemy. They've got to have the artillery all through that.",

And the Disney feud and fight is sort of Exhibit A of that. Republicans inside Florida and outside Florida are going increasingly concerned, really from all wings of the party that he is going after this specific company. And it looks like a vendetta. And it's not going so well for him, frankly. Disney has been in Florida a long time, more than 50 years, and they'll likely be there longer than he is. So this is an example of all of his opponents are sort of piling onto this. We heard it from Nikki Haley this week. We've heard it from Donald Trump as well.

He was angry about that and so he threw a fit about it. I don't think you look particularly strong doing that. I don't think he's looked strong generally lately. He was asked a question about his sliding poll numbers in Japan the other day and reacted in a way that looked like something out of a Disney movie. It was just really, really strange. Meanwhile, he, you know, his legislature is considering -- in addition to this legislation to make it harder to track who he's met with, where he's traveling, harder to track a range of things in state government, all apparently to protect him in this governor's race. He's behaving more in Florida, he's behaving more like Huey Long than anything else, but he's not looking particularly strong doing it. It's early. He could come back.

In fact, he's out of the state or the country, in this case, more than he's been in the office in Tallahassee. But look, this is not going to strengthen a potential presidential bid.
