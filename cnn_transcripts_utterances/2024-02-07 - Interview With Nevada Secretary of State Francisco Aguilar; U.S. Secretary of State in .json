This morning, the Republican Party chair seems on her way out, Ronna McDaniel offering to step down at the end of February, which, of course, is several months ahead of the presidential election. This week, she met with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. After that meeting, she offered to resign. Now, while the situation is still fluid, there are some big questions this morning, like, who will replace her? How will this impact the party? How did she get sideways with Donald Trump? CNN's Alayna Treene has all of the answers for us from Washington this morning. What do we know so far, Alayna?",

Even though she was the only major Republican candidate on the ballot in the state's GOP primary on Tuesday, more Republican voters selected the none of these options than her.Now, Donald Trump skipped the nonbinding primary, and no delegates were at stake, which made it largely symbolic. The former president will instead compete in Nevada's caucuses tomorrow, where 26 delegates will be awarded. Let's bring in CNN's Kylie Atwood, who joins us now. Kylie, Nikki Haley's camp seems to be shrugging this off, but what does this mean for Nikki Haley?",

So by losing the primary, Nikki Haley isn't actually changing any of her campaign's expectations about what she was going to pick up in terms of support in the state. But we should note that former President Trump was encouraging his allies in the state to go out on primary day and cast ballots in favor of that option that was listed, none of these candidates. And Nikki Haley didn't just lose to that option, but she lost in a pretty big way. More than double the people who voted for her voted for that no -- none of these candidates option. But I do want to read to you what her campaign is saying after that defeat, saying -- quote -- \"Even Donald Trump knows that when you play penny slots, the house wins. We didn't bother to play a game rigged for Trump. We're still full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.\" So this does blunt her efforts to show that she's still competitive with the former president even after losing these early nominating contests. But they're saying that she's focused on South Carolina right now.",

And I don't know that there's anything Nikki Haley can do at this stage to really change that, unfortunately. I think she's going to continue to raise a lot of money. She's going to continue to stay in this I expect for a very long time. I don't think she's quitting any time soon. But I think, at the end of the day, if you look at all the polls and you look at the first three contest results, Republican primary voters want to renominate Trump for the third time.

I think that's going to be an almost impossible task.But you never know what can happen. I'd love to hear what Alex thinks, but I have heard many Republican strategists who say we don't know what's going to happen with Donald Trump and all of his issues with the courts and everything that he's facing on the judicial front. We have all seen the polls that say that, if he is convicted, his support drops dramatically within the Republican Party, even within his base, not all of it, clearly. And so I think that, at this point, she has nothing to lose. If she's going to continue to raise money, then stay in it, girl, because you don't know what's going to happen. She could be the last woman standing in a situation where we all think that Donald Trump is going to be the nominee and is going to move forward to compete in the general election against President Biden.

Of course, that's when John McCain was our nominee, very different time in the Republican Party.But just as then, look, McCain, once he won the nomination, he installed some senior leadership into the RNC that I ended up working with, so that he could really control the committee. I think what's different now is that Ronna McDaniel is a Trump person. Like, Trump installed her to begin with to run the committee after he took Reince Priebus out of the RNC and put him in the White House. So I think dumping her now, that really shows that there are legitimate concerns about the RNC. Anyone who looked at their recent fund-raising report realizes that they are woefully behind of where they need to be. The problem is, taking McDaniel out, somebody who donors have gotten to know over the last six years, and installing a fresh face, a Trump loyalist, I'm not sure that's what major donors want to see. They don't want some stop the steal guy coming in and running the RNC, because that really gives donors a lot of trepidation. And so if they're changing leadership in order to shore up the party's fund-raising, I'm not sure that's going to work. And it -- but it speaks to the larger concerns about the Republican Party's organizational and leadership structure going into this election year. It seems very problematic. If I was a Democrat, I'd be encouraged by the shakeup.",

The only thing they care about and prioritize are the feelings of dictator Donald Trump, who they listen to. He says jump, they say, how high? We already saw the debacle of the border security bill in Congress. We're seeing the debacle at the RNC. Whatever he says goes. That is not a way to run the -- one of the two major parties in the country. We are much better as a country -- and I even say this as a Democrat -- when you have two functioning major political parties. Right now, you don't have that. You only have one functioning political party, and that is the Democratic Party. So in terms of the election, it helps us make the contrast that Republicans, not in the House, not in the Senate, and certainly not the White House, do not deserve the trust that the American people are -- have put into them, at least for leadership in the Congress.

Three phases, each one lasting 45 days. Hostages, women, children, the elderly and the sick would be released as part of that first phase. What does Hamas want? They want a massive upscale in humanitarian aid for Gaza. They want to see 20,000 -- 60,000 housing units bought in, 20 -- 200,000 tents brought in. But they also want to see the Israeli forces pull back out of civilian areas, stop military operations, stop drone flights. And they want to see the beginning -- and this is one of the trip points for the Israeli government -- Hamas wants to see the beginning of discussions about a permanent cease-fire. Let's say all that goes ahead. Flip forward to phase two. Phase two, that will see the release of all the male hostages, both civilians and the military personnel. But during this phase, this is when Hamas wants to see the complete agreement agreed, signed off on of an absolute end to the war in Gaza. And in both of these phases, they want to see a release of a huge number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. And, again, this is a trip point for the Israeli government. They say, look, there is no way we're going to release prisoners, Hamas prisoners, who we captured October the 7th who were involved in that brutal attack. And the last phase, if they would get to that, if the government gets to that here, that would be the release of the bodies of all the other remaining hostages, believed to be about 31 inside Gaza, and hugely important for many of the families who still have their hostages held.",

In a contest that did not have Donald Trump on the ballot, Haley actually lost to the choice \"none of these candidates,\" as you can see. But it's also fair to say that this primary carried little weight. That's because, this election season, state Republicans opted to award their delegates through party-run caucuses. Those caucuses happen tomorrow, and Trump is expected to be victorious. Meanwhile, those who were on the primary ballot, including Haley, are not eligible to participate in the caucuses. And this fractured process is the result of a 2021 state law that scrapped Nevada's presidential caucuses in favor of government-run primaries. Still, Nevada Republicans essentially ignoring the primary outcome, since no delegates are awarded from the vote. With us now, Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar. Secretary, good to have you this morning. Thanks so much. I think the way Nevada does this is a little bit sort of different. The winner of the Republican primary, \"none of these candidates.\" Is that a first for your state?",
