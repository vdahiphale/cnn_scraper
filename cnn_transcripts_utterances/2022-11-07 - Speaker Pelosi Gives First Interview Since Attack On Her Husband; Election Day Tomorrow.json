And I went with her back to Baltimore, which is where she grew up before moving to San Francisco.And one of the many things that we talked about was the fact that not just this cycle, but so many of the past cycles, really since she became Democratic leader, never mind speaker, she has been the subject of attacks. The image and imagery around her has been so intense for so long. When she talks about it personally, she blows it off and says, oh, it's just -- you know it is what it is. But it's another level when it bleeds over, forgive me, but it goes to the safety of her family and especially her husband, never mind anybody in her family. And you know, you saw in some of the videos that Alexandra Pelosi, her daughter who's a filmmaker, released and that we saw, I guess, last month at this point, her grandson there on the day of January 6 watching as people came up and kind of noting, well, you know, what -- in some way, shape or form, why do they want to go after us? Why do they want to go after my grandmother? It's that kind of reality. And it's a reminder that these are -- again, these are public figures they are in the game and they understand the risks and the rewards and everything that goes along with it.

President Biden, of course, won Georgia narrowly two years ago. He has not stepped foot in the state in recent months because of that. He does not want to drag Senator Warnock down.Now Senator Warnock for his part, he is simply saying as he has been for months that Herschel Walker in his view is not ready to serve. He's not fit for office. He has been calling him a pathological liar. So in the final hours of this campaign, which, of course, is one of the most important in the country, certainly not ending on a positive optimistic note by either side, that's reflective of how close this race is, party officials on both sides I've been speaking with simply do not know how this will go tomorrow. But one indication it could go another month because Georgia, of course, as we've been saying, has a runoff rule.

And the last time they were in charge, their entire economic plan was tax cuts for the rich and corporations. So, you know, this notion that somehow they alone are going to fix the economy is nonsense.And I think what we've seen is, look, President Biden has done more for energy independence than the last three presidents put together. They've allowed more drilling. They've been in -- you know, created more alternative energy opportunities. So the economy is a complicated situation and Kevin McCarthy doesn't have answers.

So yes, he wants to essentially suck up all the oxygen.Also, I think he wants to clear the field, right? There's this notion that maybe Ron DeSantis might run. You saw him nicknamed him Ron De- Sanctimonious. Mike Pompeo has -- seems to be exploring a run. We'll see what sort of nickname he gets if he gets one. Mike Pence as well, Donald Trump's former vice president. So yes, I mean, this is classic Donald Trump. It is making Republicans -- I think privately, Alice, you can speak to this, tear out their hair. They don't want this to happen right now. You know it's been rumored that maybe he would have you know already announced he'll announce after, but this will be something to see.
