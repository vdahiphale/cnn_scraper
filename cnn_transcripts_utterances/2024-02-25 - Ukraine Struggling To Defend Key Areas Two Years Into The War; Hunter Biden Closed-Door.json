I'm Jessica Dean in Washington.And at this hour uncertainty hanging over Ukraine as the war-torn country marks two years since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. And tonight, White House officials tell CNN President Biden plans to meet with top congressional leaders Tuesday as $60 billion in military aid remains in limbo in the House. President Zelenskyy is warning Russia could start a new offensive as early as May. And in a rare admission today, the Ukrainian leader revealed at least 31,000 of his soldiers have died in the war. CNN cannot independently verify that number, but U.S. officials estimate the toll could actually be closer to 70,000. CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins is in Kyiv and got a chance today to ask Zelenskyy about the stalled aid in Congress. Here's a clip. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And joining us now to discuss this, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William Taylor, and CNN military analyst and retired U.S. Air Force colonel, Cedric Leighton. Gentlemen, great to have both of you here with us. I want to add that we've learned in the last hour, President Biden is planning to meet with the top four leaders in Congress on Tuesday to push and advocate for this Ukraine aid that is stalled out over there in the House. Ambassador, let's just start first with you. Do you think Ukraine can keep up its fight if it doesn't get this $60 billion in U.S. aid? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: Jessica, Ukraine will continue to fight even if it doesn't get this aid. It will continue to fight but it can't win. Ukraine can't win without the support. They know, and they have said that this support on the artillery, on the air defense is so crucial to them to be able to hold off the Russians. You've already reported that the Russians are moving on this thing. And why? Because the Ukrainians have to scale back already on their artillery. So, yes, they can win. They can -- but they need the support in order to move that.",

How has Russia failed to take Kyiv? And why now is Ukraine's counteroffensive losing momentum, it seems?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Jessica, those are great questions. Well, I think the first thing that we have to locate is when Russia tried to take Kyiv they wanted to take Kyiv just like in the old days. The Soviet Union took Prague in 1968. They wanted to come in, take over the airport, and then from there branch out and take over the important functions of government. That didn't work out too well for them because they didn't have the right logistics, the right intelligence, the right discipline within their military. And frankly, their military was basically a hollowed- out affair, although it was very careful to conceal that fact, basically riddled with corruption and all of those different things. The problem that Ukraine ran into with its counteroffensive than if you move forward about a year or so was that there was a lot of talk about that counteroffensive. The Russians are an adaptive enemy and they have learned to deal with the Ukrainians and the Ukrainian successes, and Ukrainian innovation to some extent. And they just have a sheer number of people in that they finally brought to bear. Number of people, number of weapons. All of those things, Jessica, came together and that allowed the Russians to basically stall the Ukrainians. Plus the fact that of course they had a lot of time to build major defensive positions. And the Ukrainians had no airpower to use to exploit against the Russians and their efforts to put up their defensive barriers.",

Ambassador, do you think that the president, President Biden, has beencommunicating well why he needs the U.S., why he believes the U.S. should still be supporting Ukraine? Because there is a feeling amongst some Republicans in Congress and some Americans, quite frankly, that don't feel like aid should be -- they kind of see it as a blank check, maybe, which it's not, you know. In a lot of cases, American companies are doing very well because they are taking some of this aid and making things that then we can send overseas.

That was basically at the beginning of this war. But the gains since then have been incremental and we have to remember the Ukrainians rolled back the Russians taking about -- back about half of the territory that the Russian said initially occupied.So the Ukrainians have done major, major work that is very commendable, but the regions that I'm looking at include Moldova and the breakaway part of Moldova called Transnistria. There are going to be some efforts made in the next few days to actually -- perhaps to have that region tried to integrate itself into the Russian federation, and if the Russians, President Putin specifically, agreed to do that, that could then open up another front in this war, and that could potentially provide some dangerous signals for the Ukrainians if that's not stopped, and that could happen well before May.",

The problem is you can't have -- they're not airtight. There's a way to get around these sanctions and people have done that.So these new sanctions are one way to go after the leakage and to squeeze out so that the Russian economy will have a difficult time manufacturing their missiles, manufacturing the war materials that they need in order to pursue this fight.",

By the time you enter in interest on the other costs, because you can't just post a bond for the amount of the disgorgement plus the prejudgment interest, he's going to have to post the bond for the interests while he takes his appeal.So that's going to push you to 110 percent to 120 percent, over $500 million. Another $100 million plus is going to be required for the E. Jean Carroll appeal most likely, but the AG will not make those aggressive moves until that 30-day period that has now started running runs out. Trump will undoubtedly -- he's asked the judged for a stay. The judge refused. He'll undoubtedly go to the court that is going to hear the appeal, the appellate division, the first department, to ask them for a stay because he needs more time to get that large sum together.

Congresswoman Dingell, thanks for coming on. We really appreciate you making time. We have heard some calls from some of your left-leaning colleagues to vote uncommitted on Tuesday in the Democratic primary.

I want to answer this question in several different ways. First of all, I'm one of the people -- I worked for 30 years to have a large state like Michigan, which has a diverse set of issues, be part of the early primary system so that we're talking about the issues now and not in October 15th before the November election. So it's good that these issues are being aired now. Look, Michigan is a purple state. I say that to everybody. You will recall that I told everybody Donald Trump would win and I've started in 2015 and said it through '16 and I was right. We know what we got to do in this state. It's going to be purple until election day. It's not only the Arab-Americans that we've got a turnout, but young people, women and union workers. But there's also a lack of enthusiasm amongst some voters as well on the Republican side. So we'll see what happens on Tuesday. But we're talking about the issues now and it's reinforcing with everybody when nobody believed me in 2015 and 2016. We've got work to do. We've got to roll up our sleeves and we got to do it.

And women thought that they were not going to have government interfere with their personal health care decisions, so that was done.

Those proposed rules would have required EVs to account for up to two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032. Sources tell CNN the move would give automakers more time to adapt, but environmental advocates say it would hurt efforts to curb climate change and legacy automakers are lagging behind.Over the years, Democrats have primarily led the charge to fight climate change by reducing emissions but with green industries expanding, some Republican led states are racing to attract companies like electric vehicle makers.

And at the same time that same year, construction began on Hoover Dam, the biggest public works project in the history of the country, drawing thousands of people, workers to the area and what did they do on Saturday night? They went into Las Vegas, downtown Las Vegas, gambled, drank and that was sort of the beginning of the reputation of Vegas as a fun city.But then in the 40s and 50s is when the Big Hotel started to get built up along The Strip just outside of downtown. And they had a great idea, to get people into the casinos, they hired major entertainers. The big entertainers drew more people in the casinos, which made big amounts of money, which enabled them to hire even better entertainers. So pretty soon, Vegas was the entertainment capital of the country.",
