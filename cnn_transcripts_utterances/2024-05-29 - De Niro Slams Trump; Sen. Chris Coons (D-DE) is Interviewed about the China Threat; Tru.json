There were legitimate targets to Hamas senior operatives, but there were too many civilian deaths in this incident as I understand it from the reporting that I've seen. Kasie, it just reminds all of us that there are both ongoing legitimate targets for Israel in Gaza, the Hamas fighters who are still holding dozens and dozens of hostages and continuing to launch rockets at Israel, and over a million innocent civilians in the way that Israel has an obligation to allow to move and to provide humanitarian assistance. My concern here principally, Kasie, is that there just aren't enough routes for humanitarian assistance to get in. There's too much suffering and there needs to be a change in direction here if Israel is ultimately going to be successful.",

We saw the Biden campaign in the form of Robert De Niro show up outside the courthouse yesterday in Lower Manhattan, which resulted in a number of profanities, a confrontation between De Niro and some Trump supporters.My question for you is, do you think that it's smart for the Biden campaign to be outside the courthouse talking politics? The Trump campaign criticism is that shows that the trial is political. On the flip side, I'm curious, do you think that the Biden campaign should be even more aggressive than that they've been considering the state of the polls?",

But I suspect that Robert De Niro, who's a New Yorker, went to the trial in part because there's so much press there.

Trump has also pledged to commute the sentence of internet drug dealer Ross Ulbricht and appeared backstage with the rapper Afroman, who has admitted to punching a woman.
