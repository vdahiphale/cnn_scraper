Around 67 million people in this country get those Social Security benefits. Around 40 percent pay taxes. So, we are talking about a lot of people.Just take a look at how it works. I'll just give you a sense. If you earn below $25,000 as an individual, you don't pay taxes at all. But if you do earn above that, then up to 50 percent of those benefits are taxable. And, of course, it's a bit more for joint people. Removing that, according to the tax policy center, could save people around $550. That sounds great. The problem is, how do you pay for it? If Donald Trump is not talking about perhaps raising taxes on high earners, then perhaps you have to start dipping into some of these Social Security funds. And we know they're already under pressure. The fear is that they're going to run out in -- around ten years' time unless something changes on that front. So -- so that would be a sort of flag to raise there. It's also going to significantly add to the deficit as well. I'm not sure how much we care about these things, but we should care about these things. Yes, that's the problem with the funds, of course, that you can see on your screen there. SIDNER: Yes.",

Mortgage rates are high, so people are afraid of buying a new house or moving house because they can't get a cheap enough mortgage. That will help as mortgage rates come down.But if people can't even get on the housing ladder, it pushes rents up too. So, that's in a nutshell the crisis. Kamala Harris coming out with a whole host of plans. The most important point I think and to get to the heart of the issue is increasing the amount of houses out there. So, federal resources to build three million new housing units, check. We like the idea of that. Some support for first-time homebuyers is coming in too. Look, Trump has also talked about expanding land available in order to build more houses, which the important point is, there's some gray area over a big fund that she's talking about. But this is really taking a leap and expanding what Biden announced earlier, and adding to it. And it helps. It's not a fix all. We're lacking 300,000 construction workers. So, let's find the workers to build those houses too, Sara.",

The first has to do more with home sellers in their real estate professional. And the second has to do on the buyer's side. So, first, on the seller's side, not much is going to change when it comes to listing the home. The real estate professional, their agent, broker, their realtor will still meet with them, talk about the listing, what needs to be done to get the house ready for sale. But part of the conversation that will change will be about the commission. Commissions, as long as I've been in business since 1994, and for at least 25 years before that, have always been negotiable. And now we're going to have just a little bit of a different conversation because as a listing agent, I will talk about the fee that I'm looking to get paid and then we will explain to the seller that they have the opportunity to offer cooperating compensation or a commission to the buyer's representative. The seller does not have to do that. But what they need to understand is that they do not offer a commission to the buyer's representative, then there might be some buyers who cannot afford to pay their own feet and they might not view the home. So, we just need to have a robust conversation with the consumer and let them make the decision because ultimately it's the consumer who drives the transaction.
