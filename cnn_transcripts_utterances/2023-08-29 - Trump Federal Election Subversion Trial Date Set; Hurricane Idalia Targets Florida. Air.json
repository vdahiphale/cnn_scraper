Just into CNN, the National Hurricane Center releasing an update on Hurricane Idalia just moments ago, the storm currently a Category 1 hurricane expected to intensify rapidly into a potential Category 3 hurricane when it slams into Florida's Big Bend area tomorrow. We have just learned maximum sustained winds have increased to nearly 85 miles an hour. This is a live look at Key West this morning, as Hurricane Idalia moves north toward the Florida coast. You can see waves crashing ashore. This is the southernmost point of the United States, a picture frequently taken by tourists at that cone. Not a good time to take a picture right now, wind gusts there more than 60 miles an hour, and this time lapse video showing Havana essentially disappear as Idalia slammed into Cuba this morning. Idalia's damaging winds will reach more than 100 miles inland. And with a storm surge of up to 12 feet, one sheriff is reminding people of what Hurricane Ian left behind in Fort Myers less than a year ago. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And people might be used to that idea that we won't be seeing a lot of that, that storm surge. But we're really trying to emphasize to people that the storm won't be like that.

They have held a teleconference already wants today specifically about the hurricane. They're holding another one today at 6:00 p.m., because this could really have a nationwide impact. Just checked FlightAware, about 480 flights canceled across the U.S., just crossed the 900 delay mark in the U.S., those numbers only going to go up. Right now, most of them are at Tampa International Airport, which, as you mentioned closed at 12:01 a.m. today. They're really concerned, a bit of a preemptive strike, about the employees -- there are 10,000 of them there at the airport -- and about the passengers, but also the storm surge.

A lot of folks online just questioning why they would do this early, but they need to do it, especially at Tampa International Airport, because it is so close to Tampa Bay. The good news here for travelers is that, if you have flights into or out of Florida, pretty much every major airline is offering a travel waiver, meaning you can change your flight free of charge, no change fees, for pretty much every major airline right now.

Of the 96 storms that have been removed, whose names have been removed, those starting with I have been retired more than any other letter, 14 of them in all. If Idalia strikes the Northwest Florida Peninsula as a major hurricane, it will be just the sixth storm to do so. Only five storms Category 3 or stronger have made landfall or even passed within 100 miles of the area since we started keeping records back in 1851. All five of those storms were a Category 3 at landfall, except for one, the catastrophic 1935 Labor Day hurricane. It was an unnamed storm that hit the Florida Keys as a Category 5, and then made its way up the West Coast, passing 30 miles West of Tampa Bay while still a Category 3. That hurricane killed at least 485 people, including 260 World War I veterans who were on an evacuation train that was derailed by high winds and storm surge.

TIMOTHY HEAPHY, FORMER JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE LEAD INVESTIGATOR:  No, I think she credited the concerns, but found that they did not overcome the government's and the public's interest in a speedy trial. The government pointed out that the majority of those millions of pages of discovery were things that the president already had access to, the former president, social media posts and documents that were obtained from him or his campaign, so it wasn't new information to him. She also made clear that the essential facts have been public for a long time. The Select Committee's materials were posted publicly at the end of our work in January. So there's really no big surprise in the government's discovery. And they still have six months to review everything. It's all been completed and turned over. So they have access now to everything that the government will use at trial. So she gave them six months, which is sort of the far extent of what the Speedy Trial Act contemplates. It seems to me like a very reasonable ruling.",

He gave a credible account that, in the main for the couple of months after the election, he was doing chief of staff sorts of duties, setting up calls and the like. But that phone call and the preface to it, where he basically joins with Trump in trying to pressure Raffensperger, that's -- that was the hardest part for him to try to justify in order to get removal, the hardest part for him to say, I was just acting under my federal office. And that's the -- I think, going to be the linchpin of Judge Jones' ruling when it comes in about 10 days. And Jones himself said this looks like an issue of first impression. I think it could go either way, but I think it will center on the January 2 phone call.",

The problem is that, factually, he was a lot more than a gatekeeper. He was an active participant in that January 2 phone call, where he raises his own and makes his own contributions and raises facts that Secretary Raffensperger rebuts. And the record is replete with instances where Meadows didn't just act as an observer, but, rather, an active participant. And there's plenty of evidence that manifests his intent to join this conspiracy to obstruct the joint session. So it's a question of whether he was simply a passive observer as White House chief of staff, or whether the more credible prosecutors' rebuttal to that is that he was an actual participant. I agree with Harry that I think it is a case of matter first impression that the judge will take some time and think about. But it does -- it is going to be difficult for Meadows, in my view, to move this case to federal court.",
