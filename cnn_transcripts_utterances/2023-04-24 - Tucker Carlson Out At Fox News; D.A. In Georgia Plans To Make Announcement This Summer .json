We'll get into all of that. Plus, what a Georgia D.A. says about the timing of possible indictments in the investigation of Donald Trump's efforts to overturn that state's election results in 2020.

People regularly using the C-word around the office, many posters of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a plunging swimsuit adorning the walls. One of Tucker's producers reportedly liked to ask questions of Maria Bartiromo's sex life. This is all in addition to the mega defamation Dominion lawsuit that just cost Fox $787.5 million.Tucker also apparently did not think his own bosses were very smart. He sent this text to one of his producers right after the network called Arizona for Biden. Quote, a combination of incompetent liberals and top leadership with too much pride to back down is what's happening. We have so much to discuss with our panel. We have Josh Barro, the very serious host of The Very Serious Podcast, former Congressman Mondaire Jones, and two people who, like me, have years of experience inside Fox, whether they want to admit it or not, the wonderful Margaret Hoover and the delightful Frank Luntz.

I think people had this vision that if this had gone to trial, if Fox lost, they would've been forced to apologize and everyone would've had to admit they're lying about this.

But the thing about the settlement is that the apology, and Dominion's CEO wrote about this, like is the apology worth anything, like, you know, a halfhearted qualified apology that people know is being made pursuant to a legal proceeding, does that help them actually restore their reputation at all? And it ends up being costly to Fox, including because they're being sued by various other parties. If they admit wrongdoing in this case, then they have to go defend themselves against Smartmatic.And so I think there are reasons we didn't see the apology. But some people had this idea that this was like a parking ticket for Fox, it was a cost of doing business. This, first of all, is like half of Fox's profits from 2022. So, it's a really large amount of money. But also we're seeing here the sort of the domino effects from this, that this set off all of this internal dissension. I think it's very unlikely that Tucker would be fired this week if it were not for the lawsuit, even he's not being fired for matters in the lawsuit. It opened up this rift, caused disclosure of these communications. By the way, a lot of the discovery in this lawsuit was under protective order. There were those redactions that we all saw, things we didn't get to see. They lifted some of the redactions, but not all of them. So, there are other things that Tucker may have said about Fox management or about other matters that are known to us but are known to Fox management. They saw that in discovery. So, I think I suspect that this really is about his relationship to management. This harassment lawsuit brought by this employee, frankly, that is the sort of thing that feels like the cost of doing business. If you're going to pay out a nine-figure settlement to Dominion, you can pay seven figures and settle that lawsuit.",

It's a male drug dealer. What he didn't know, Myles Cosgrove, this police officer, is that much of what was in that warrant was false. This was a warrant that had been fabricated by two other detectives and a sergeant, the person who's supposed to catch fabrications, help build these lies to get the warrant by a judge because they wanted to hit that apartment because they thought that someone in there was part of this narcotics conspiracy. Now, if you're the cop on the other side of that door and you have this warrant and you go banging through the door, and there's a debate as to whether they said police or not, but the first thing you're met with based on what you read in the warrant is gunfire, your partner is shot and you shoot back, you are going to do a lot of head scratching later when you find out the real story is not what was in the warrant that they handed you to execute and how this became of you. You can't get Breonna Taylor back, but we live in a country where 250,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins, are killed in medical malpractice incidents every year. It's the third leading cause of death. Nobody takes a doctor's license away -- very, very rarely, and says you can never practice medicine again because your irresponsibility killed somebody. So, the question is, does this police officer who went through this terrible experience and caused this terrible tragedy based on information he was given that was wrong, does he get the benefit of a second chance?

I think Chicago does have a particular crime problem where, I mean, again, you know, there's destitution in Chicago, there's also destitution in New York.

I mean, there was the -- there were these essentially riots in downtown Chicago the other day and, you know, here we go again, the city is, you know, the city is in chaos. But then you also have news reports about people saying, you know, I was (inaudible) on Michigan Avenue and you know, these people were assaulted and they were trying to flag down the Chicago police and the Chicago police just drove right by. And so, I don't know, you know, it's not clear to me that anybody has a clear plan about what you're going to do to both get staffing levels back up to where they need to be with Chicago police and then actually get police there to perform the job that they're being employed for. I mean, there's clearly a lot of political disconnection between the police and the administration of the city and it's probably frankly going to get worse with the more left-wing mayor. But it's, you know, you can't just -- the police basically having a policy veto about being able to say I'm not going to do my job if I don't like who the mayor is.",
