She recently became a commentator and analyst with our sister company TNT, part of Warner Brothers Discovery.You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington. And tonight, breaking news. The White House saying President Biden held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier today. That call coming just days after the president signed an aid package that includes $26 billion for Israel and as Biden faces increased pressure to end the war amid massive protests at college campuses across the country. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is joining us now from the White House with more details on this. Priscilla, you have new reporting on what this call really focused on.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jessica, according to a source familiar with the call, this was primarily focused on a hostage deal. In fact, 75 percent of the conversation was about a hostage deal. This is something that the White House has been focused on that U.S. officials have seen as a priority of theirs in trying to get these hostages released while also trying to reach an agreement on a temporary ceasefire that would allow again for that those releases of hostages as well as for more humanitarian aid to get into Gaza.This source saying that the conversation was, quote, \"constructive,\" lasting only just under an hour. And of course, this also comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken is headed to the Middle East where he is expected to also engage in discussions about the hostage deal, as well as humanitarian aid into Gaza. But this wasn't the only issue that the two leaders discussed. They also talked about Iran's airstrikes against Israel and Israel's airstrikes back at Iran. That was something that occurred earlier in the month and that the White House and Israel had been quite tight-lipped about. But they also talked about Rafah. Another top concern for this White House. That is a potential operation that Israel has said that they would engage in in Rafah, an area that has over a million Palestinians displaced. The White House position up until this point has been that an operation at this point is untenable, just given how many civilians are in that region. And according to a White House readout, it said, quote, \"The leaders discussed Rafah and the president reiterated his clear position.\" So this clearly coming up, but the source telling me that while they did talk about Rafah, a lot of the focus here was on this hostage deal because, of course, the U.S. really wants to see a breakthrough here. They want to reach this agreement so that they can get the release of those hostages. And I should also mention that in this conversation about this, they also discussed the videos of American hostages so this was all part of this conversation. Now what happens from here unclear. We'll be watching for that. But again, the focus of today's call between the two leaders is really on this deal, and again whether we will see a breakthrough unclear.",

And right now, it strikes me frankly with the way that the president's phone call that the party that feels the most urgency right now is neither Hamas, who I believe actually uses time tunnels and hostages to bargain for a much better deal, or the government of Israel, which the Netanyahu government, which knows that if they exchange hostages, you're going to end up with an asymmetrical number of Palestinians, some with blood on their hands, accused or actually convicted of killing Israelis.The Biden administration is in a hurry because they're in a strategic cul-de-sac. Without an agreement between Israel and Hamas, you cannot even hope to, on any sustained basis, surge humanitarian assistance into Gaza. There'll be no hostages freed and no de-escalation of Israeli military activity. I think it's really hard, Jessica, right now unless you're literally involved.

He was part of an asymmetrical hostage traded in 2011. 1,079 Palestinians for one Israeli corporal.He knows how much value the Israeli public and governments, Israeli governments, attached to the redemption of their own citizens dead or alive from the battlefield.

And it was when they came together that you saw a lot of those clashes and you saw that passion. And I personally saw many people get pushed and shoved and there were a lot of arguments. You know, it was something that you knew that people were not going to come to an agreement, but they continue to scream at each other and push each other. And it was absolutely violent at times.

We should remember that when this was happening in mid-December of 2020, the election had been challenged literally over 60 times across the country by former President Trump, then President Trump. And every single time those challenges had failed. There is noevidence at that time in December of 2020 that there was anything that would cause us to doubt the outcome of the election. And as we sit here three and a half years later we still are at the same point. There's still not been a shred of evidence produced to any court anywhere in the country. That there was any problems or fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. And so when those electors sat, those fake electors sat and swore that they were the duly certified electors, they were committing an alleged fraud on the United States and the voters of the state of Arizona, and three other states that have charged fake electors as well.

You know, Michigan was the state that then President Trump had lost by 154,000 votes. That's a lot of votes. There were a lot of states that were closer in that, but there were other states like North Carolina that were decided by less than half that amount of votes, about 75,000 votes in North Carolina.The difference is that former President Trump won that state. So of course there were no challenges or false electors coming out in North Carolina. This is just about the outcome of the election and someone who is so desperate to hold on to power that he was willing to do anything and his supporters who were willing to go along with it. As we heard in the immunity cases just this past week in the Supreme Court, the president is alleging he's immune, but one of the challenges he faces is all of the people that he needs to support him to potentially put their own freedom at risk and commit crimes so that he can stay in office, they are not immune.

The World Health Organization says cases nearly doubled between 2022 and 2023. They're still running high. So far this year, the CDC says it's seen the highest number of cases in the U.S. since 2019. The CDC recommends children get their first measles vaccination between 12 and 15 months, and then a booster when they're between 4 and 6 years old.The USDA wants more information and quickly after FDA regulators found traces of the bird flu virus in roughly 20 percent of retail milk samples they tested. It's now issuing a federal order to require more testing and reporting of the bird flu in dairy cows. Now scientists say it's not an immediate threat to humans. You don't have to throw your milk out. But it is troubling to find the virus so widespread in dairy cows. Dr. Richard Webby from St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital is joining us now. Dr. Webby, thanks for being with us.

We still don't have answers to that, Jessica.

She has deflected every single time saying that she wants to provide more time, give time for her colleagues to talk about a potential successor. She doesn't want to sort of have a rushed process like she says, happened in October most recently. She said she wanted her colleagues to go home and speak to constituents after voting for that foreign aid package, so that is of course going to be the same question we ask Congresswoman Greene tomorrow.

We are hearing them say that they would likely step in to save Mike Johnson and this is sort of multifaceted, right? There are a few layers to this.A, Democrats don't want to be seen supporting Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is sort of a Democratic boogeyman, somebody who they of course criticized on a number of occasions. B. A lot of this all hinge on what Mike Johnson did with Ukraine aid and with that foreign aid package, and after months of deflecting and pushing this off, a lot of delays, he ultimately put that foreign aid package on the floor that included concluded roughly $61 billion in Ukraine aid and it passed, and President Biden signed it and that aid is now going overseas. So a lot of Democrats are thinking now, well look, Mike Johnson did the right thing despite the loud cries of opposition from members of his conference, he decided to put this aid package on the floor, it passed. So for that reason, he doesn't deserve to be ousted. That is another reason. And then third, there was the three weeks of paralysis and chaos back in October when Democrats banded with those eight Republicans to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a lot of Democrats just don't have an appetite to go down that road again. So for all of those factors, it is looking likely that if Greene does bring this to the floor, Democrats would likely vote to table the Motion to Vacate, not exactly voting in support of him, but voting to push it to the side and that would essentially be quashed.",

They want to be seen as -- you know, they were given the majority back in 2022. They want to go back to voters and say, you gave it to us for a good reason. We got A, B, and C accomplished when they have this chaos engulfing the conference at every turn. It doesn't help.And a lot of conservatives are realizing that because Congresswoman Greene has said that she is going to bring this motion to vacate. She has support from just two other conservatives right now. A number of all of these hardliners are saying that they are not going to support this if it comes to the floor. A large reason why is because of that election that is around the corner. Congressman Chip Roy, who has been one of the most critical of Johnson at this current juncture when he talked about Ukraine aid was on the radio just in recent days saying he is not happy with Mike Johnson's leadership, but folks are too close to the election year and this is just not the time to do it. Congressman Bob Good, the Chairman of the Conservative House Freedom Caucus, who voted to oust McCarthy back in October, saying the same thing. This isn't the time. So a lot of these conservatives are thinking, they don't want to be showing the country that they are full of this chaos so close to an election year. So look, they will bite their tongue, they understand that they are not going to win every battle. They will finish up the year with Mike Johnson. The real question is, if Republicans are able to retain the majority, or even if they are in the minority, will Mike Johnson be the top Republican come next year? I think that is going to be the next battle for House Republicans.",
