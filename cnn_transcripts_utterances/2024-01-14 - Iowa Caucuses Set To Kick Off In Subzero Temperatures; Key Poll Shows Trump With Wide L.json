Sometimes they can take a few hours and they really require that full participation from individuals.So, I think that overall if there is this inclement weather and it's difficult for caucus goers to get to these spots, especially reliable caucus goers are oftentimes elderly individuals, they may want to sit it out if there is inclement weather. So, I think everybody will take a hit if there is that decrease in turnout. But folks are saying that the Trump campaign may have a tougher time if there is that low turnout because their expectations have been set so high in poll after poll. Former President Trump has been seen leading Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and others by double digit numbers. So, those expectations are very high. But there is an interesting fact in the -- in that \"Des Moines Register\" poll which said that Ron DeSantis right now actually has one of the best standings when it comes to turnout. He had about 10 percent more than Nikki Haley. Individuals who say they regardless of situations were planning to turn out for the caucuses. So, it's going to be fascinating.

Of course, Iowa is always important because it sets the tone for the campaign and it's the first time we're actually going to see voters go to polling places and actually cast their vote.

And then he ended his tweet by saying, I want to save Trump and to save this country. Let's do it together. You won't hear any friendly fire from me.

And, you know, for a while that flew fine for the former president, but I guess now as we're getting closer to the caucuses and to the time when voters are actually going to start voting, he's now taking issue with that. And I think it's interesting because Vivek was sort of this fascinating candidate on the debate stage and on the trial, who rather than Nikki Haley, Ron DeSantis and Chris Christie, who are trying to sort of make a fine line between themselves and Trump, he wasn't doing that as much. A few folks had said, well, he's maybe looking for the VP slot or a spot in the former president's administration. Obviously, there's now a tear in that relationship so we will have to see what happens going forward. You know, Vivek Ramaswamy wasn't on the last debate stage. He's polling very low in these recent polls. So, it begs the question of how long he will be in the race. But absolutely the Trump factor has been fascinating to watch.",

Remember, back in November they passed that two-step continuing resolution.The first funding deadline is on Friday. So, lawmakers were really facing this time crunch and this pressure to come to some sort of consensus to avoid a partial government shutdown. Reporting says -- I have sources saying that leaders have landed -- bipartisan leaders in Congress have landed on another two-step continuing resolution, kicking funding deadlines to March 1st and to March 8th. So, as you mentioned, this just kicks the can down the road, but the idea is that it will give lawmakers appropriators a little more time to hash out specifics in the 12 appropriations bill, to go through regular order. They want to be able to fund the government through regular order so they're going to go with this to buy themselves a little more time. Will that be enough time? That begs a really important question. Regardless of the time factor will lawmakers be able to find consensus on those bills, get behind them and get them over the finish line? Also another big question. But congressional leaders are betting that they will be able to find success with these 12 appropriations bills and you can see that conclusion in the fact that they are, again, looking to kick the can down the road and extend the deadlines rather than passing what's called an omnibus, which is an all of government sprawling very massive bill. So, that's going to be the main focus on Capitol Hill this week to see if lawmakers can get that continuing resolution over the finish line. It's likely going to receive some push back from conservative House Republicans, but, again, because this is a deal, a bipartisan deal, it's likely to pass with a lot of support.",

Yes, this will have impacts to the caucuses on Monday in Iowa, but also all of these other places. Look at this. You've got these windchill alerts stretching from Washington state over to Ohio all the way down into areas of Texas as well as Louisiana. Some of those windchills in the far northern region likely to get down to as low as 60 or even 70 degrees below zero. We are only at -- only at minus 50 right now in Minot, North Dakota. Bismarck looking at minus 45. It feels like it's about 40 degrees below zero in Des Moines as we speak, when you factor in that temperature and windchill. And Monday is not going to be much better. When you look at previous caucuses, look at the forecast for when we go into Monday, it's going to be way colder than any previous caucuses have been. And even to put this in perspective, here is the forecast high on Monday in Des Moines, Iowa, minus four. It will be colder in Des Moines than it is in Fairbanks, Alaska. Again, just to put that in perspective. But with all of that cold air in place as moisture moves in it also means we have the potential for snow and ice, even for areas farther down to the south, but we're also still looking at some lingering lake-effect snow across portions of the northeast and the midwest, especially around Buffalo, Erie, Pennsylvania, and even Cleveland, still looking at some areas of some snow showers today. Down to the south, we have got this next system sliding in. That's going to bring dangerous icy conditions to cities like Dallas and Shreveport. Unfortunately, for those few folks that have to go to work tomorrow morning, it's likely going to be a very slick commute. Then that system slides east bringing very heavy snow to places like Little Rock, Memphis and even into Nashville before this system continues to slide off to the east. So, for any folks that have to get out, say, tomorrow or even as we head into Tuesday, you are looking at some pretty decent snow and ice accumulations even in the south.",

On the eve of this 100-day of war, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke and he made some news. I'm going to start here with his announcement that the crossing into Egypt, the only remaining crossing outside of Gaza must be closed. He says that in order to dismantle Hamas, what comes into and out of Gaza must be controlled, so therefore they believe that -- and we're talking Rafah there in the Philadelphi Corridor must be closed. What are the ramifications -- the ramifications in the immediate context of the war of that closure if it happens?",

And what Netanyahu was talking about is taking back control of that entire length of the border. So, not just Rafah but anything going across it.The reason is because Israel believes that the majority of the equipment be it missile parts or the concrete needed to make the hundreds of miles of subterranean tunnels that Hamas is using to move around. That was all brought over the Egyptian border. So, they're saying that they have to take control of it just the way they control the borders the other sides and the sea with Gaza. So, on the main border with Israel they have a metal fence plus sensors that go underneath the ground to keep Gazans from tunneling out. They want to do something similar with Egypt. And this is going to be -- this is going to be a game changer if they do this because it's one more way of turning Gaza into an open-air prison, but it's from Netanyahu's perspective one of the only ways he can tell the Israeli people I've really done something to keep you safe in the future.",
