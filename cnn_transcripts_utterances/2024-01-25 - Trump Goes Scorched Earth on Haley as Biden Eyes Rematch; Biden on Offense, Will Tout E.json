We know that he is fixated on this case and he scrolls through his social media, and we'll show you that. In addition to that, Melania Trump, his wife, has told him he needs to fight for his name. He's also told allies that he wants to testify in this case.But the one caveat here is that he has said this before in a previous E. Jean Carroll case and his lawyers convinced him it was a bad idea. However, this whole will he, won't he, that's going to suck up the oxygen, which is exactly what he's intending to do. And that's why he's using these courtroom stops on the campaign. Now, when we talk about the actual campaign trail, I want to talk a little bit about what you mentioned, which is Trump wanting to go scorched earth on Nikki Haley. The idea of that is good in theory. However, he's not even on the ground. Again, he's in New York. And the post particularly about him saying that anyone who donates to Nikki Haley, well, I have some real question marks about that, because it's one thing to say anyone who works for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is not going to work for our team. But when you're talking about money, the people who work on his campaign who actually pay the bills, they would like to see some of that big donor money coming in. They thought it was going to come in after Iowa because it had gone to Ron DeSantis. Instead, it shifted to Nikki Haley. Then they thought it was going to come in after New Hampshire. But Nikki Haley says she's not dropping out. So, you can tell that he's clearly fixated on this. The other part of this is that Senator Tim Scott actually said this in an interview yesterday that they were hoping that after South Carolina, they'd get some of that big donor money. So, something to keep an eye on, yes, he can say that, but the people who are actually paying the bills, I think they'd like to see that money come in.",

We saw them do it with Ron DeSantis, and now they're going to do it with Nikki Haley.That was part of the strategy of having Senator Tim Scott come out, endorse her -- excuse me, endorse him before New Hampshire. Because they want to say, look at this, people in her own home state do not support her. They also brought out the governor there, McMaster, who worked with Haley. They brought out congressmen from South Carolina who endorsed Trump. And you're going to see a lot of that. You're going to see that in surrogate events as well. You're also going to see Donald Trump lashing out on social media. What we have heard is that he is very angry that she didn't drop out and he didn't like her celebratory tone in that speech.",

If you think about what the president has been able to accomplish these last three years, whether it's student loans, right, making sure that he kept his promise to do everything that he can, even though he was blocked by Republicans, blocked by the courts, he took action and really moved forward with some policies, was able to get borrowers to relieve more -- about $136 billion for almost 4 million borrowers. So, that's really important. And he's going to continue to do that work. And there are other places, too, climate change. Climate change is something that young people really, truly care about. The president has had an aggressive approach in pushing policy forward to deal with climate change. While Republicans, if you think about the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a historic piece of legislation that deals with climate change, they didn't vote for it.
