And every Secret Service agent knows that line of sight is in -- mitigating line of sight is a basic tenant of every single site agent that's out there, whether you're new on the job, or you have 25 years on the job, you need to eliminate that line of sight.

And he talked a lot about when he stood up, and there's that sort of iconic moment when he puts his fist up and he told me that he really wanted to project to people. He said it wasn't about him at that moment. He wanted to project it as people and he says he loves these people. And they are the backbone. This is a Rustbelt area.

And do you think it will help or is that a little Pollyannaish given the state of discourse at the moment?LESLIE VINJAMURI, HEAD OF U.S. &amp; THE AMERICAS PROGRAMME, CHATHAM HOUSE: Well, it was certainly absolutely essential. He of course, had immediately made a statement and that speaking to the nation in his role, not as the Democratic nominee but as the President of the United States acknowledging an assassination attempt on a former president, hard to see how he could have done anything other than that. So it was essential. It was interesting to note that he called out a series of violent attacks over recent years and condemned them all cited a pattern in the United States he referred to the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the assault on Nancy Pelosi's husband. And of course, he talked about what happened to President Donald Trump. [01:15:19] So he did link these events to a broader trend and made that call for unity. And we've seen that across the Democratic Party, we've seen this from President Donald Trump himself with -- which I think is going to be the singular, most important factor in really dialing down any direction that might lean towards a violence or incite more violence, that the words that come from Donald Trump himself are going to be tremendously important. But again, we've seen this from leading members of civil society from the Open Society Foundations, which has been very much opposed to Donald Trump's leadership style came out really condemning the attack. There have been a few leaders, elected officials who have tried to make this a partisan issue who have blamed the Democrats and their campaigning rhetoric.

It's a very tall order at a very compressed time. But we are still several months away from that election. There is, yes, significant scope for violence. But there's also a -- we are at an inflection point. And at a moment like this, there is extraordinary potential. Donald Trump's base are so deeply loyal to him. And the words that he chooses, moderate a tremendous amount, they won't wish to defy the words that he chooses. If he chooses a language that pushes back against violence and hatred, and creating the sense of an deep enemy within the country, then that will go a significant way towards making a difference. But we know the deeper problems in America, the guns, the alienation that so many people feel. It's not only a question of voting, versus using violence, it's all the things that take place on an everyday level, to bring people into communities that they feel more inclusive and productive and where they can make a meaningful contribution to a leadership that pulls them in the right direction.",

It was hot, 90 degrees and sunny. And then these shots rang out. And I think initially there was more confusion like maybe it was a firework or something or backfire from a car. And then all of a sudden, it was just a rally of what sounded and definitely like bullets. And Trump was hit and that was visible. And so he dropped and then everyone dropped and there was screaming and fear and just people going what's going on, did he get hit? Did he get killed? What has happened?

Meanwhile, investigators are trying to figure out how the gunman at Saturday's rally got to that rooftop there, you can see the gunman there, less than 500 feet away from Mr. Trump. Now that video shows the moments just before he fired. He's got the gun, he's crouched in a shooting position. The Butler County sheriff says a police officer saw the gunman on the roof before the shooting. But when he climbed up, the shooter pointed his gun at the officer forcing the officer to duck down below the roofline to take cover. The FBI says the suspects motives, meanwhile, still unclear.

That will be brought out in the investigation.Another piece of information that we're getting here is that, this is according to Ben Macer (ph), who is a witness who told CNN affiliate KTKA of the shooter's movements just before he took that position. According to Ben Macer, he saw the shooter move from roof to roof to roof in the moments before he took that position to take shots at the former president. So these had to have been these roofs here because these buildings are all seemingly attached. If this witness saw the gunman moving from roof to roof to roof, it would have been right about there. And these buildings right there. Also, we have some video of the gunman in the moments just after he was neutralized by law enforcement, the body of the gunman lying on the -- on the roof of the building where he was. And as we look at the post shooting scenes here what I can show you is there are some scenes here of the chairs and the debris. But when we take a look at the grandstand, I'm going to pause the video for just a second here, you take a look at the grandstand. We have new information also from the governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, who told us about the deceased victim, Corey Comperatore, a firefighter from Butler County. Corey Comperatore was in these grandstands. He might've been in this one here. We're not sure if he was in that one or possibly this one. But he was hit with gunfire and was killed. But according to the Governor Josh Shapiro, Corey Comperatore committed a very heroic act during the shooting. He dove on top of his own family to protect them from the shooting and of course was killed by a gunshot in the process. Again, were trying to find out which of these grandstands Corey Comperatore was in when he was shot and killed. As we go back to the scene here, we were told that President Biden has ordered an independent review of the shooting and according to our law enforcement analyst, Andrew McCabe, the most basic elements of securing an outdoor site, especially outdoors, is that you have to eliminate the sight lines to where a protectee is standing or speaking. A key component of this investigation is why was that sight line so close to the former president, not eliminated. Brian Todd, CNN -- Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Hence, President Biden's comments about foreign actors trying to have an influence over the American election. Let's first talk about Chinese state media and some of the response that we are seeing there. And I want to first point to an example, an editorial from \"China Daily\". It's an English publication, again by Chinese state media. The headline there saying \"Trump incident reflects us polarization, divisions\". This is commentary and it appears to promote this common theme of political discord in the United States. Another headline, this time from China's \"Global Times\" also state media. The headline there shooting at Trump rally shows rising political violence as U.S. divides further. This, again, all a tool for China to discredit the American political system on a global stage and, of course, to the Chinese population. And of course, a lot of chatter on Chinese state media, which is typically heavily-censored, but on this topic, we are seeing a very healthy and robust conversation about how this is portraying the U.S. especially in a negative light. For example on Weibo, which is China's version of X or Twitter. One comment says, \"What democracy and freedom? I now really think elections in other countries are not so different from talent shows. The world is but a circus.\" Another comment discrediting the American political process. Some comments are a little bit more benign, a little bit more general. One talking about a House of Cards. We've seen remarks about gun violence in America and how this may bolster Trump's chance in the election coming up. Some people felt he came across looking strong. Others are calling him Lucky. Michael, this is just a collection of some of the remarks we are seeing on Chinese social media since this all unfolded early Sunday morning in the United States.",
