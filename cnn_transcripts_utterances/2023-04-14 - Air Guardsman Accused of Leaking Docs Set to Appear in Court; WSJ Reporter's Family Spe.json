For explanation now, CNN's Natasha Bertrand is on the story for us live from the Pentagon with more. Good morning, Natasha.

He was an E-3, which is really one of the lowest ranks as an enlisted person in the military. And part of the reason why he may have had access to this information is because he was in the intelligence wing of the Air National Guard in Massachusetts. But look, the Pentagon press secretary told reporters that this is not uncommon, that it doesn't necessarily have to do with your age, the amount of information that you have access to. It basically has to do with the job that you are entrusted to do. And he said that a lot of people across the military have access to this kind of information at a very young age, because the military entrusts people with that, hoping that they have enough military discipline, he said, to safeguard these -- this information properly and knowing the consequences, of course, of what will happen if you do expose it. And so he was really emphasizing here that it is not uncommon for someone of his rank and his age to have access to this kind of information. But it is going to raise a lot of questions about whether that is appropriate, right? Because the fact that these kinds of documents, which are briefed to the highest levels of the military, including -- including the chairman of the joint staff, General Mark Milley, was accessible by someone of his age and rank, that is going to raise a lot of questions about what the Pentagon should be doing moving forward about this kind of information, Don.",

So that is something that's going to be under investigation.But the idea that he had access to it at all, that is something the Pentagon is grappling with at this point. And we are told that, in the last week or so, the Pentagon has significantly whittled down its distribution list of this kind of classified information. People across the government who were getting it for months and even years have stopped getting it in recent days. The Pentagon has also ordered an internal review of intelligence access that they will be conducting over the coming weeks and months as they assess, of course, the damage that this leak has done. So a lot of changes likely to be made to this, but don't expect it to happen very quickly, Don.",
