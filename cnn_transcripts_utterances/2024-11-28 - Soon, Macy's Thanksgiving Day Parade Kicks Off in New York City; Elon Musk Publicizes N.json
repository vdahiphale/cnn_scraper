Thank you for joining us this Thanksgiving morning. In less than two hours, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade gets underway. Visitors from all over the country and around the world ready to welcome in Thanksgiving, and you get a front row seat to the biggest parades across the country right here on CNN with our inaugural Thanksgiving in America coverage starting one hour from now. Meanwhile travelers this Thanksgiving week are expected to shatter records with an estimated 80 million Americans expected to either fly or drive and in some cases dealing with some very bad weather. We've got it all covered for you. CNN's Brynn Gingras in New York and meteorologist Allison Chinchar standing by in Atlanta. Brynn, we hate to rain on your parade, as the saying goes, but it's raining on your parade. How are things going out there?",

This is where Billy Porter will start and kick off that giant parade that, of course is iconic to New York City and their whole entire country on this Thanksgiving Day. And you know what, I got to tell you, we walk about ten blocks to get up here. The entire avenue is full of people. So, people don't mind that it's raining out.

And there's going to be a half marathon, then a five-mile -- or a 5K, then a one mile, and then a little cute 50-yard dash for the little ones to be able to participate. Everybody trying to burn off some calories before they go and eat a giant meal later on today.But, yes, the weather cooperating here in Atlanta, not so much in other places. We're still seeing that huge line of rain showers extend essentially from Maine all the way back to Mississippi. That includes places like Philadelphia, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh and, yes, even New York. And, yes, we mentioned last hour, it's going to come in waves, so it's going to start to pick up and get a little heavier. Then it will get a little bit lighter. Right now, we've got some of the heaviest rain we've seen so far set to push into New York. That's not exactly ideal conditions for the parade today. But you know what? Most of those folks that are out there, they don't care. As Brynn mentioned, this is a bucket list item. They just want to be there to experience it. Now, interior northeast, this is where it's going to get tricky. You're actually going to see some snow showers here, several inches of snow accumulating on the ground. And then you start getting up into the higher elevations, you could see as much as a foot of snow. As for the rest of the country, you're going to start to see those temperatures maybe get a little bit on the cool side, even for some of the other parades that we have going on today, cities like Chicago and Detroit, you're looking at highs in the thirties, maybe creeping out at 40 at absolute best. The rest of the country, though, we're looking at much better conditions, especially the central U.S. and out into the western portion of the country, much nicer conditions, they're not really having to deal with any rain, Jim. But this, we could not have asked for the rain timing to be any better here. This is the largest half marathon race in the country to happen on Thanksgiving Day.

Happy Thanksgiving to both of you.In the meantime, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have made it no secret that they have plans to slash government spending. The two men tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Federal employees understood that their jobs could be at risk. But now, Musk has also begun to draw attention to at least a few relatively obscure government employees and their jobs and posts on social media. Musk quoting one post that read, I don't think the U.S. taxpayer should pay for the employment of a director of climate diversification, she/her, at the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, with a partial screen grab of an employee and her location, and Musk adding, so many fake jobs, obviously going after that employee there. The president of the American Federation of Government Employees telling CNN, quote, these tactics are aimed at sowing terror and fear at federal employees, adding it's intended to make them fearful that they will be afraid to speak up. And joining me now is Democratic Congresswoman of Michigan Debbie Dingell. Congresswoman first of all, happy Thanksgiving. Thank you so much for being with us early this morning. I really appreciate it. But what is your reaction to this? I mean, nobody elected Elon Musk. He's been tapped to do this Department of Government Efficiency, which is really sort of a misnomer because, apparently, it's not going to be a part of the federal government, and yet he's going after federal employees on social media. What's your reaction? REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI):  So, I have several. First of all, Happy Thanksgiving.",

I have spent my life trying to bring people together, to try to respect each other. We have two ears and one mouth for a reason, to listen more and talk less.

I don't know when someone's going to come up and attack me publicly, start screaming at me, creating a scene. I'm very lucky I live in a in a community where people know me. So, the vendors at the farmer's market come up immediately and we try to deescalate. The mayor has been my bodyguard. You know, it just -- it's not right. Can't we talk to each other?

Let's get the more civil dialogue going there, no question about it.And, Congresswoman, I do want to ask you about Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico and how things might be affected in your state, which voted for Donald Trump for president. The New York Times reports that Trump's tariffs threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada sent shivers through the auto industry, which depends heavily on both countries for parts and manufacturing. The prospect of tariffs is a two-alarm fire for the auto industry, said Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in Michigan. There's probably not a single assembly plant in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and Texas that would not immediately be affected by a 25 percent tariff. You know, Congresswoman, I don't have to remind you. I mean, you were saying this before the election that you were deeply worried that Kamala Harris might lose Michigan. She did. Do a lot of folks in Michigan realize that they may have, by voting for Donald Trump, voted for tariffs that might negatively impact the auto industry there in your state?",

People don't understand it, but I also want to say tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get level playing field for trade. I have said I will work with Donald Trump on trade. I said he got elected in 2016, and, Jim, you remember back then everybody thought it was a thousand percent crazy when I said he was going to win. And I said he was going to win because of the trade issue.Now, I will work with him. I worked with him. NAFTA was the worst trade bill we'd ever seen. We worked, we got the USMCA, needs to be improved. China should not be able to build plants in Mexico and then bring them into the United States and label them as a North American vehicle. They're not. We've got to improve that. But we are intertwined. The auto industry is totally intertwined in North America. Quite frankly, at this point in my life, I treat Mexico and Canada differently. I think there's got to -- you got to take time to understand what a day one implication would mean. And I don't think that it is intent. I hope it is not an intent to either hurt the domestic auto industry or the consumer. So, I hope they'll take time to understand the impact. I'll work with them on trade. Let's do it right.",

Those tend to be quite scary because something very bad can happen. And we have seen that before.So, these are real. They have to be condemned. They have to be investigated. They are clearly targeted against the Trump administration. And they come at a time when the nominee is not quite yet the cabinet officials so that their secret service detail and the kind of protections that they would get is not quite, you know -- sort of it's not the equivalent of if they actually get confirmed.

I mean, this is silly behavior. And he may view it as a as funny. I mean, he sort of has an odd sense of humor. You know, he's just very excitable. And so what happens is people see and they take it as a license to do something very unfunny. And so anyone who's an expert in these fields on whether online or incitement or has seen the wave of incitement through violence over the last 4, 8, 12 years really understands that kind of language, whether a joke, whether he just thinks he's powerful.
