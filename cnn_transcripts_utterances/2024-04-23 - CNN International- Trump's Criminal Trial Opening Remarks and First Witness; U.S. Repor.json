This marks the jury's first peek into the high-stakes world of alleged cover-ups and porn star payoffs. During opening remarks, Trump's lawyer said there's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy. But prosecutors say no, it's called criminal conspiracy. The first witness is expected back on the stand today for some intense questioning. David Pecker on the right is the former publisher of the tabloid The \"National Enquirer.\" He was a key player in the alleged scheme to pay former adult film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 for her story. He's been a long-time friend of Trump and has issued a catch- and-kill strategy. That is to buy the rights to stories that might threaten the former president and suppress them, which Trump's attorney says is not illegal. Pecker was also involved in paying model Karen McDougal, who had an alleged affair with Trump for her story and then, burying it. Trump has denied the affairs. Well, the former U.S. president, the first to face a criminal trial, could get prison time if convicted. CNN's Paula Reid picks up the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Matthew Colangelo laid out the prosecutor's theory of the case, which he said is about election fraud, pure and simple. He says it all started with a 2015 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump, his former attorney, Michael Cohen, and the former publisher of the National Enquirer, David Pecker. The government alleges Pecker agreed to use the Enquirer to help Trump's campaign by buying and suppressing negative stories about him and by amplifying stories that were favorable to him. Prosecutors allege the salacious Access Hollywood tape unearthed just before the 2016 election was significant because it turned the rest of the presidential campaign entirely upside down.",

CNN's Nada Bashir has the story, and we warn you some of the videos in her report a graphic.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For the last 10 days, this mother has returned to Gaza's Nasser Hospital, searching desperately for the body of her 24 year old daughter, Coulthard. She had been buried at this makeshift grave site in January. Now her body is missing. The Israelis turned the hospital upside down, she says. They dug up all the dead bodies and moved them around. These are the shrouded corpses of those retrieved from a newly discovered mass grave in Khan Younis. Nearly 300 bodies have so far been recovered, according to Gaza's civil defense. But the search is still ongoing. This is a crime against humanity, Dr. Al-Maraya says. How could the Israeli occupation forces dig up these graves and mishandle the bodies of our martyrs? In some cases, they even opened and removed the bodies from their bags, even though their names have been marked on them. Many of the bodies recovered here were buried by relatives or medics on the hospital's grounds in January as a temporary measure. Israel's relentless bombardment of the southern city, making it too difficult to carry out a traditional burial. Following the IDF's withdrawal from Khan Younis, families returned in the hope of finally laying their loved ones to rest, only to find that their bodies had been exhumed by the Israeli military, according to civil defense officials, and discarded in this nearby mass grave. I still haven't found my son Khalil's body, this father says. We'd buried him over there, but we can't find him anymore. We just want to give him a dignified burial. According to Gaza's civil defense chief, some bodies have been discovered with their hands tied together. An indication, he says, that these may be the victims of alleged field executions, though CNN is unable to verify such claims and cannot confirm the causes of death among the bodies being unearthed. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment without response. But this would not be the first time graves have been disturbed by the Israeli military, the IDF previously acknowledging that its forces have exhumed graves in Gaza in order to carry out DNA tests to identify potential hostages. This man points to the palm tree beside which his brother, Alah, had been buried. Two weeks on, and his body has still not been found. Under international humanitarian law graves must, in times of war, be respected, properly maintained and marked so they may always be found. But in Gaza, the Palestinian people have been robbed of their dignity, even in death. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You can see there's this standoff between the NYPD and protesters.What happened here just a short time ago was there was an encampment. Students who were protesting set up tents and the police moved in on the request by the school to clear the encampment. And the school says in a statement that they found that there were people who infiltrated the encampment that were not NYU students. And as a result of that, they asked the NYPD to come in and remove the encampment, to remove the tents. The other thing the school said in this statement was that they heard that people were making intimidating chants, which raised a lot of concern for them, but also that there were incidents of anti-Semitism. And so all of that -- because of all that, they decided to bring the NYPD. And now for almost three hours, there has been this standoff. The other thing what we learned from the NYPD is that there were faculty members that were locked arm to arm to try and prevent the NYPD from arresting the protesters that were behind here. The NYPD and the school has now cleared this entire area. And most of the items that were here before, like tents and other things belonging to many of the protesters, have been cleared. At this point right now, there are about 100 or so protesters that remain. The NYPD is allowing them to stay out here on the street and continue their chants. There's no indication that they're going to make any arrests at this point. But there's obvious concern here from the school and the NYPD that if they leave, that many of the protesters are going to try to get back on the campus. But this is certainly another escalation at another university, after these protests, for the school to call the NYPD in and to remove students, to arrest students, and to arrest faculty is something that is going to certainly spark perhaps more protests, like we've seen over at Columbia University. And this is going to be one of these moments here at this university, at NYU, where we're going to see probably students and other faculty members raise concern over what the school here decided to do.
