A federal law enforcement official tells CNN that the suspect in the deadly overnight attack in the French quarter is dead. The FBI is investigating possible explosive devices at the scene where police say at least ten people were killed and dozens injured when a man and a pickup truck intentionally slammed into a crowd on Bourbon Street.It happened just after 3:00 a.m. local time, when so many people were out. They were celebrating the New Year. Just imagine that the street was packed with revelers, and then the suspect comes in with his pickup truck. As one official said, he was hell bent on creating carnage. There was a local news reporter who was on the scene, and that reporter became emotional as she reported on the horrific attack.

Some people have been out of their hotels this entire time because they could not even get back to their hotels, because everything has been roped off.So we have a lot of people that are just standing by, just trying to figure out what's going on.

Senator, thank you for being here with us this morning. We should note that you're in Baton Rouge, nearby to where this awful tragedy happened. I first want to get your reaction to what CNN is learning that the FBI is investigating this as an act of terrorism. SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R-LA):  Yeah, that's obviously significant. It clearly was an act of terrorism, whether it was official or not. But the fact that the FBI has designated suggests that there might have been somebody who has come from abroad or internally with the specific -- with the specific goal to wound as many as people before as possible, before a high profile event like the Sugar Bowl, in an effort to send a message. The question is, what is that message? But now that it's being designated an act of terrorism. And by the way, they have the license plates, they know who these people were. That in and of itself is significant. When the FBI is saying its possibly an act of --",

There is going to be no problem there. And you can look at the response on the video -- on the earth cam. My gosh, the New Orleans Police Department and probably some state police officers running to the sounds of the gunshot. You just have to be so proud of them.

You have someone who intentionally drove into a crowd, exited the vehicle and attacked law enforcement with a firearm, and the possible involvement of an incendiary device, an IED.So there's no way that's anything other than some sort of act of terrorism. Now, they may not know exactly what flavor at the moment, right? They may not know the political purpose that this attacker had in conducting the attack, but it was very clearly an intentional act. It's a violent felony committed in the United States, likely for the purpose of -- of intimidating or coercing a population or changing the action of government. That is the definition of terrorism. It's captured in the federal code. And so we -- from just the first look, we know we have many of those boxes already checked. So it's really just the FBI publicly stating what has been true from the very beginning. I'm sure they began investigating this, thinking that it was very likely an act of terrorism.",

He had been briefed by the DHS secretary and state police and other officials. And it was interesting because he started off the conversation with his answer, talking about multiple people. And as far as we know, CNN's reporting, as far as we know, there's one suspect, right. But, of course, this is early in the investigation. And when I followed up and asked him if there are others, if he knows of others, he said, I would rather not say. And, of course, that -- my antenna went up with that. What did you make of that?",

The senator was trying to be careful there and -- and that, that, you know, that leads us to make assumptions.I think the important thing is to know that law enforcement officials and now the FBI is the leading law enforcement entity here, is addressing that directly. That's what -- that's the -- that's the immediate mystery you have to solve in the aftermath of anything like this. Are we dealing with one person or is there a continuing threat? Are there others? Are there -- and those others can come in many different forms. It can be people who supported that person with money or training or gave him the vehicle to use, that sort of thing. Or it could be other people who are in an operational posture, people who are prepared to stage follow on attacks, attacks somewhere else in the city, attack somewhere else in the country. So that's the most important thing for our intelligence and law enforcement folks to figure out. It certainly seems from the careful way that the senator answered your question, he may have gotten some information along those lines. We'll have to -- we'll have to wait and see what they tell us at the next press conference. But it wouldn't surprise me at all if they are already starting to identify people who crossed paths with this attacker, maybe intentionally providing support or otherwise, or just people who came into contact with them, like you can imagine, like if -- if the car was a rented car, you would want to talk to the person who rented it to him. Did that person know why the why this guy was renting the car? All sorts of questions like that.",
