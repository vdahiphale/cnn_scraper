Vance is a political newcomer, only elected to the U.S. Senate some 18 months ago, and since then, he has been one of Trump's closest allies up on Capitol Hill, and a very loyal defender of his policies.And we're also just learning that Vance actually met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago down in Florida on Saturday, just before the rally where Trump was shot at.",

And in that room, anticipation and hope that perhaps he will appear. We have a lot to get to tonight. I want to begin by bringing in Kristen Holmes. She is live in Milwaukee, and according to her sources, former President Trump called Ohio Senator J.D. Vance to offer him the vice presidential nomination 20 minutes before it was announced.I mean, Kristen, that is really stunning. 20 minutes before it's announced, you got all these guys and sitting around waiting by the phone.

That's what we saw pretty much all day and for the last several weeks. Now, here's what we know. We know that he had been batting around three top contenders for over a month now. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and, of course, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio. He met with all of them in recent days. I am reporting from a source familiar that he met with J.D. Vance at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday before he left for that Pennsylvania rally where there was, of course, as we know now, an assassination attempt that then he was still mulling it over the decision between these three men as early as this morning, I talked to a number of his senior advisers who told me they did not think that Donald Trump had yet made any sort of decision at one point.I thought they were pulling my leg because I thought it couldn't be possible that we were just moments away from this potential announcement. And here he was not making a decision, but it does appear that he had not told anyone if he had, in fact, made that decision started then seeing the trickle in of the candidates who were told they would not be the vice presidential pick. It started with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, sources saying that he got a call saying it would not be him. Then it was North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. But Donald Trump still waited quite some time before he told J.D. Vance, and I was told that that was because they didn't want any of this to leak out. Donald Trump himself wanted to be the person who announced who his vice presidential pick would be. So, just about 20 minutes before that announcement, he called J.D. Vance, they spoke on the phone and he offered him the job. Obviously, J.D. Vance himself accepting that role. But this is really an unprecedented kind of rollout, at least in modern history. Generally, what we have seen and what we saw even with Mike Pence, is learning about it far in advance of the convention. Instead, this man was just landing in Milwaukee, hoping that he would be the vice presidential pick and getting a phone call in the morning, he was going to be it and then coming over here to be officially nominated on the floor. Again, Donald Trump loves the element of surprise. He loves to put on a good show to build up speculation and he certainly did that with this pick.",

I was on the floor when the social media posts went out and people didn't know about it. It kind of rippled through the crowd.This is exactly how the former president wanted it. He wanted to control the message going forward. So, look, I mean, I think it was a surprise in the moment, but the tea leaves were leading that direction for quite some time. Look, I mean, there is no one like J.D. Vance who kind of represents the full spectrum here, from MAGA critic to MAGA disciple. And Donald Trump likes that. He likes the fact that J.D. Vance is younger and can sort of continue on in the Trump populist sort of street. Now, he wasn't picked because Ohio's in danger, but a Trump adviser tells me they believe J.D. Vance can be very helpful in Western Pennsylvania. And Pennsylvania is a critical state here. He grew up not far from there. Appalachia is not far from there. So, look, I think it excited the Trump campaign, obviously, but Democrats I'm talking to today, I mean, the Biden-Harris campaign are also excited about this pick. So, look, vice presidents don't necessarily matter, but in this uncertain campaign, it certainly is the biggest example yet of a decision Trump made. And it was certainly not Nikki Haley. That would have you know, created a whole different level of excitement and worry from Democrats. So, it's a significant pick.",

And he shot up because the Republican base is the Trump base. And that was enough for him to get over the finish line.And Trump seized and sees in Vance as someone who can communicate the Trump message and will be a formidable candidate against Kamala Harris. He also brings generational issues as we see two of the oldest candidates ever at the top of the ticket. That will be helpful for them in their argument going forward. But as Jeff notes, he is very conservative on key issues, like abortion, that will be something that he will have to deal with.

He did absolutely want to have a surprise. There's no question. He wanted to control the announcement. He likes to narrate everything he does, including his own indictments and convictions and so forth. And so this is not a surprise.When we started hearing that people had been getting calls that it wasn't them, it became pretty clear where this was headed. And there was a group of people who were pushing Vance who were very vocal, Donald Trump Jr., not just behind the scenes, but also publicly. Trump cares a lot about chemistry. And the only one of the top three who he really has chemistry with is J.D. Vance, number one. Number two, money, which was a big concern for a while for the Trump campaign, was something that donors suggested was an issue why he should pick Burgum or Rubio, that Vance didn't have the same connection with donors. Trump's campaign has raised so much money since he was convicted and since his indictments and I think since the weekend in the attempt on his life, that I think money became less of a concern.",

All I heard was 14 million people voted for me to be the nominee, I listened to them. That -- that does not answer the question of whether or not he thinks he's weathered this moment of Democrats in his own party asking for him to step down as the nominee. And I thought that was telling. I also thought just in the comparison to the interview with George Stephanopoulos again, and we saw this a little bit at the NATO press conference, he clearly seems to have gotten some advice that he needs to not be as defiant in this moment, but have a little bit more humility.

We're at the first day of the Republican -- I don't mean that it shouldn't have changed appropriately changed by were at the first day of the Republican National convention.
