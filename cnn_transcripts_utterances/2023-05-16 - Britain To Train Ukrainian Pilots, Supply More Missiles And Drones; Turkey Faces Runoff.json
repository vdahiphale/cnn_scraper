With Russian positions they're apparently crumbling. Now the extraordinary allegation carried in the Washington Post that this man, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian Wagner mercenary leader, offered Ukraine intelligence on Russian military positions if Kyiv withdrew its troops from Bakhmut while Wagner has been fighting. Prigozhin has vehemently denied it, releasing an audio statement accusing comrades in Moscow of trying to discredit it. Even Ukraine is dismissed any talk with its bitter enemies. The senior Ukrainian official telling CNN that if Prigozhin had been back channeling without the knowledge of the Kremlin, he would not be alive today. But these are fraught times for friends of the Kremlin. One of its backers Alexander Lukashenko of neighboring Belarus, here at the Victory Day parade in Moscow last week, is rumored to have been taken ill, later appearing looking uneasy at a wreath laying ceremony in his capital Minsk. And official in Belarus told CNN he is quote, absolutely fine. And now, new video said to be of Lukashenko at work as usual, inspecting air defenses.

The 300- plus-page report sharply criticized the FBI and the Justice Department throughout but does not recommend any new charges against anyone or any wholesale changes to the way politically sensitive investigations are being handled.The report falls well short of expectations that were set by former President Trump and his allies who have long claimed that it would prove that the FBI investigation was a political witch hunt. Nonetheless, Donald Trump claimed vindication posting on his social media platform that it was evidence of a scam. Durham's report finds many mistakes by the FBI including what he calls confirmation bias. He concludes that the FBI discounted or willfully ignored material information that did not support the narrative of a collusive relationship between Trump and Russia. Republicans in Congress have already called for Durham to come up to the Capitol for a hearing to discuss more about his investigation. Evan Perez, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
