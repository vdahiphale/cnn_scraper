It is going to be his fourth arrest but historic moment, nonetheless. And unlike previous arrest, this one may come with his first mug shot. Trump says he plans to surrender Thursday, a day before the deadline. We are watching closely to see if any of the other 18 accused co- conspirators are going to turn themselves in this morning. Overnight, Donald Trump agreed to that $200,000 bond deal that includes a ban on him making any direct or indirect threat of any nature against the witnesses or co-defendants. That restriction is coming as CNN learns some of the law enforcement officials who are about to book Donald Trump are facing new threats from the public this morning. CNN's Katelyn Polantz leads us from Atlanta on this story. What more are we learning about this first defendant who turned himself in? And you have some new information about someone else whose attorney has shown up in court today.",

      "sentences": "Right. So, we are watching here at the courthouse for attorneys and prosecutors to come and do the work that they need to do before all of these 19 defendants are ultimately arrested at the jail.There has been one defendant who has been into the jail and out of the jail already, a defendant named Scott Hall, a bail bondsman himself, so someone who really knows system over here in Fulton County, Georgia, who is indicted in that racketeering case alongside Donald Trump. But Scott Hall, he went into the jail to be booked after negotiating his bond in advance at about 8:15, according to the jail's records. And then Zach Cohen and Nick Valencia here at CNN were able to report that he was done and out by just before 10:00 A.M. So, not that long of a time where someone in this case might be sitting over there at the Fulton County Jail, quite a harrowing place to be inside given its history of a lot of difficulties inside of the jail and its cleanliness, questions about violence inside of the jail. And so we are looking to see exactly how long these arrests take, how long people are there or not. But then at the courthouse, there is business to be done here, too. There are still prosecutors here from Fani Willis' office working at this case, we spotted on the grounds this morning by the large team of CNN that's keeping watch over this complex. We also have seen one of the attorneys arriving for another defendant, a man named David Schafer. He was the chairman of the Republican Party here in Georgia and essentially the lead fake elector in Georgia who is accused of some of the charges around that fake elector plot that Donald Trump was using to try and overturn the vote, not just in Georgia but in other parts of the country. The attorney for David Schafer was here apparently very likely to be negotiating with prosecutors what his bond would be. So, it is a little bit like playing the whack-a-mole in that we have 19 defendants. They all have got to negotiate bond and then they've got to be arrested, go over to the jail to report there and be arraigned. But we are tracking one by one as much as we can.",

And we know of at least three other co-defendants, Trump's co-defendants, who have already reached has bond agreement. That includes a former attorney, Kenneth Cheseboro, that includes former Trump Attorney Ray Smith, and that also includes, as Katelyn was just talking about, Bail Bondsman Scott Hall, who was just released from here after surrendering, becoming the first co- defendant to surrender today.So, the biggest difference in these bond agreements so far has been the dollar amount, right? You mentioned that Trump, his dollar amount was set $200,000. Eastman and Cheseboro both have a bond agreement of $100,000, while Ray Smith is at $50,000 and Scott Hall was at $10,000. Now, otherwise, the rest of these co-defendants have pretty generic bond agreements. There are terms include things like you can't intimidate any witness, you can't violate state laws, you cannot even talk about the facts of the case with anybody except through your lawyer. So, we're going to start to see more of these defendants. There are still over a dozen that have to negotiate their bond agreement. And we will start to see their lawyers trickle in over at the courthouse and then they'll have to show up and surrender here at the county jail.",

Typically, you just post 10 percent of that. The reason for that is if a person takes off, fails to appear and you forfeit that bond.But I think more interesting, more nuanced here, there are serious restrictions on his communications, what Donald Trump is allowed to say about his co-defendants and witnesses. As Zach just said, that's a standard, generally speaking, condition of release. But here, we've got into some interesting nuance.",

Any co-defendant, any witness, including, by the way, those co- conspirators and, of course, any victim or to the community, in general. And this is really important also and this, I think, is unique to this particular case to Donald Trump. This includes but is not limited to posts on social media or re-posts, right? Because something Donald Trump has done in the past and say, well, that's not my post, I just re-tweeted it, I just re-Truth it.

He can take away that cash bond or he can increase the cash bonds. Say, you've not proven reliable here. You need to post more. He can put in increase restrictions. In a normal case, you can put an ankle monitor on someone, home confinement. I don't think that's likely with Trump. And in a very extreme scenario, which does happen, actually, not infrequently, but I don't think it's likely at all here, you can remand someone. A judge can say, I take away your bail.

And then the very next day, when you have candidates who are going to be on the stage hoping, praying for a standout moment to have the ability to break through what has been very much the Trump of media environment, what is going to happen? What's going to happen is the media, rightly so, is all going to be focused on a former president going down to Georgia and having the experience of being arrested for the fourth time. And so when you look at those two things, just, for example, and we can give so many more examples of this, in another world, in a non- Trump world, going down to get arrested for a fourth time would be lights out for a campaign. This is fueling his short-term campaign for the Republican nomination even more so. And it's largely, Sara, because of how he is playing it, because of his understanding of who his base is and at least, again, I keep saying in the short-term, because we were talking about the Republican electorate, how to play to them vis-a-vis what he's going through and how he makes it about the people, not him.",

These are communities that are connected by cable cars of one valley to the next. It's about a four-minute cable car journey, but these cable cars themselves are very hokey. They're not the best made. There's not much safety oversight. We do know that the helicopters that have been hovering there about this cage-like cable car, which had these children ages 10 to 15, trapped within it. The helicopter blades themselves were causing winds, which were creating problems and causing that one cable that was holding and suspending that cable car aloft to move. So, it is a very slow and steady rescue operation. We're now going into the night here in Pakistan and they're really hoping to complete this rescue effort before it gets too late and it gets more difficult and more dangerous.
