Obviously, they wish that people didn't have to wait so long, but they're excited about the turnout, because that has been key to the closing at least early voting message for both Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock trying to get people to go out and vote, making sure that they understand that even though technically the control of the Senate is no longer hanging in the balance over this race, there were still so much at stake. Now look, we can see the line that is behind me here. You talked about the nearly 1.5 million voters through Thursday that have already voted. And look, just a few moments ago, Gabriel Sterling, who was the Chief Operating Officer of the Secretary of State's office here said that today they are already above pace of both Monday and Tuesday, which were those record breaking single daily total.So we couldn't be in for yet another single daily total record breaking day, which is really with voting rights experts and also election officials expected typically the last day of early voting is one of if not the busiest day. But remember, we're in a compressed schedule here. Just a four week runoff election, because of that new Republican sponsor voting law that came into effect last year, just a four-week and just five days of early in-person mandatory statewide voting. So while we're seeing higher daily totals, right now, they're running quite behind the pace of say, the 2021 overall total early voting. And so that's something that Democrats have paid attention to, though I'm told that they're very encouraged by the turnout and where they're seeing the turnout thus far. And speaking to Republicans, they say they anticipate to have a much healthier Election Day turnout, which is what they typically look for, but said that right now, they also were finding bright spots in the early voting right now. I've been talking to voters all day and I will tell you, Victor, Alisyn, they have complained about the long lines. I was just at a polling place on the other side of town on the south side, they were waiting about two hours to get to the polls there. But every single person told me they felt like this was not just their duty, but this was important to them because not only is this choosing the person who will represent Georgia in the Senate, but they also do feel the nation watching them and watching their choices here.",

But everyone that they've talked to, which includes Jim Jordan, who's a Trump ally and a McCarthy ally, has said they're backing McCarthy for speaker and that they wouldn't challenge McCarthy outright. However, it is really unknown what would happen on January 3rd if McCarthy can't get to 218 votes or he drops out of the race. If that scenario were to happen, there is a wide expectation that any number of Republicans would want to throw their hat into the ring. Take a listen to what Congressman Bob Good, a McCarthy critic said about a potential challenger.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): There's quality candidates who represent the conservative center of the Republican conference who are privately acknowledging that once it becomes clear, it's not going to be Kevin McCarthy. They are interested in becoming speaker and there are members who would excite the base, who would excite Republicans across the country, unite Republicans across the country as candidates, but they're not going to raise their hand publicly until it's clear to them that it's not going to be Kevin McCarthy.

And he's also going to participate in a key fundraiser ahead of that Georgia Senate runoff where he's going to shore up support for Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and this is a strategy he's employed before, essentially shoring up support from a distance doing that now for, again, Warnock as Democrats try to get another seat in the Senate next week, Victor and Alisyn.",

And the problem is, I was working on Capitol Hill in 2015 when House conservatives blocked McCarthy from the speakership then. I think it's going to be a lot of behind the scenes trying to get extractions from him and commitments in the next few weeks leading up to that floor vote.

But the most important thing that Republicans can do is recognize the heavy lift that Republicans across the country did to get majority in the House and they need to work together and that includes getting behind McCarthy and helping him to start off leading in a good fashion. Look, right now, what we're seeing is a lot of people that are very vocal and a lot of these conversations need to be held behind closed doors. McCarthy is very good at these behind closed doors meetings and working to listen to the concerns of these people that are opposed to him and he's working out deals, a lot of them want to see rules changes, and he's working out deals one-on-one. The Republicans I'm speaking with are confident that he's going to have the votes necessary to do so, because right now we're just playing into the Democrats hands with all this infighting with Republicans.",

But the problem is if you pay attention to the four who've been vocal hard nos on McCarthy, they're not budging.

He's been out there on the campaign trail with Herschel and focusing on things that are important to the people of Georgia, reminding them that this is a very important race. This is about maintaining a 50-50 split in the Senate, which is critical for committee assignments. And he's also making sure that he focuses on the policies that Herschel Walker will focus on if he's elected, policies that are important to the people of Georgia that he has worked on, which is COVID issues, the economy being strong on crime and supporting our military.

It's great that prices at the pump are lower. That doesn't deal with though the underlying inflation that the Fed is so concerned about. One of the things that the Fed is very worried about is the acceleration we saw in service sector, wages feeding into a more protected sort of metastasized inflation. Inflation is like a cancer, if you don't treat it and it goes untreated, it can become a more chronic or fatal disease. The cure, though, is not easy and this has just upped the ante that the Fed has to hit the brakes much harder now to control inflation at the underlying level so that we don't have it persist, even though we're taking some of the steam off in some important areas like prices at the pump. The bottom line is inflation, underlying inflation is still there and we'll set a floor on inflation and how low we can go, getting consumers back into the place they need to be where wages outpace inflation gains persistently, instead of where individuals feel like they're losing ground.",
