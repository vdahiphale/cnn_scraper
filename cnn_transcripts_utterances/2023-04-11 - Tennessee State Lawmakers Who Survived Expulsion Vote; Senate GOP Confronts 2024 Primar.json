Republican leaders are now trying to pivot to a hands-on approach to the primaries actively working on recruitment and vetting to root out weaker candidates that risk setting up a clash with the party's hard- right candidates.CNN's Lauren Fox is live on Capitol Hill with more. Lauren, it's not exactly surprising why they are doing this given what happened in the 2022 midterms and what they were expecting to happen. The question I think is how are they doing this? How does this work with Trump as well?",

The 2024 map is really favorable for Republicans. They know that, but they don't want any unforced errors. And Republican leaders feel like they've learned their lesson from 2022. Here is Sen. John Cornyn who told my colleagues, quote, \"It never goes away\" -- talking about that tension of getting involved in primaries. \"Republicans need to make up their mind. Do we want to win or do we want to lose? And I think that it's that simple, and I think people are tired of losing.\" Some of the races that Republicans are looking to make sure they get the right candidate in place for are in places like Arizona, places like West Virginia, as well as Pennsylvania. In fact, Kari Lake met in February. She, of course, the failed gubernatorial candidate in Arizona who ran as a central tenet of her campaign on election fraud claims. And in her meeting the NRSC officials really tried to encourage her to move away from that message, arguing that is not the kind of message that's going to work in a general election. Kaitlan, that's just one example of the way that Republican leaders are trying to get involved early in this race.",

And that really -- that really adds up to what Lauren just said -- that they say that they learned their lessons and they are trying to impose on the Trump grassroots that they cannot kind of go down the line of election denial.But what we had heard from RNC members was that the backward-looking nature of elections now didn't speak to Americans. And they were pointing to people like Gov. DeSantis, Mike DeWine -- people on statewide levels who did better, trying to encourage candidates in 2024 that they talk a little more like them and a little less like Donald Trump. But the problem is they don't have control over the base. And so even as the kind of Republican establishment tries to impose a certain sense of messaging on its candidates, these are candidates who have risen by having a conflict with the RNC. Kari Lake has tried to stoke that conflict with the RNC. And so that's been part of their rise in terms of national prominence. And so you see kind of the top down trying to tell them how they should calibrate their messaging.
