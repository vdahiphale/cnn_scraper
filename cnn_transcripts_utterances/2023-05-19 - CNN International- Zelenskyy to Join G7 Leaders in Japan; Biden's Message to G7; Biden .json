It's almost certain that he will bring with him in appeal for a more advanced weapons, more advanced technologies to help him in this planned counteroffensive against Russia. And the real hope among the leaders here is that Ukraine will be able to gain some territory that will lend some leverage at an eventual negotiating table with Russia. Of course, when that takes place, where that takes place, all remains to be seen.But certainly, it will be a dramatic visit. It is a long way for Zelenskyy to come, halfway across the world really, the longest trip he has been on since the war began. He has recently begun traveling more. He didn't travel much at the start of the war. He's traveling more now. Most recently in that trip across Europe last week and he did secure billions of dollars in commitments in military aid from the leaders that he met there. Now the leaders are behind closed doors here in Hiroshima right now talking about Ukraine. A special session is devoted to Ukraine. They are expected to emerge to announce new sanctions on Russia. The United States applying new sanctions on 300 individuals and entities. And really the goal is to try and close some of the loopholes that exist in the current sanction regime try and prevent those that have been evading the sanctions. So, certainly a lot needs to be done when it comes to Ukraine at the summit this week. A lot of other topics of on the agenda. But up first is Ukraine and certainly that moment with President Zelenskyy will be a real high point of this summit, Bianca.",

They also toured the museum that is near the site where the atomic blast occurred in 1945. I've been at that museum. I was there when President Obama came here in 2016. It's quite a dramatic view of the horrors of what occurred on that day. You know, you see the scorched tricycles, you see tattered clothes.And I think that is the backdrop against which these talks are taking place. Because for all the hope that the world would be eradicated -- or nuclear weapons would be eradicated and is the goal of this museum and of this memorial. We are on a moment where the nuclear threat is potentially at its highest in decades. Whether it's from Russia withdrawing from the New Start Treaty with the United States, or from North Korea which is rapidly advancing its nuclear program. Or from Iran, which is rapidly enriching geranium, there are all these threats that aren't lost on these leaders as they're gathering here. And certainly, they were reminded today of what the potential for nuclear war could look like. Their collective goal is of course to prevent that. But it's hard to ignore those threats that are lingering in the background, sometimes not so much in the background, sometimes in the forefront particularly when it comes to Russia and these threats. These hints from Russian officials that they could use a nuclear weapon on the battlefield, that's something that these leaders will certainly be thinking about as these talks continue.",

Now there are still a lot of questions, including what exactly is in there. Republicans have pushed for a slew of spending cuts. They have demanded work requirements on certain social safety net programs. As well as caps on discretionary spending on domestic programs.

Feinstein is back in Washington for the first time since February. On Thursday, she initially denied a \"New York Times\" report that she had developed encephalitis, a brain inflammation when she was hospitalized. She told CNN it had been the flu. But a short time later, her office set the record straight. It confirmed that the Senator had had encephalitis but that she'd recovered.Feinstein's office also revealed that she is currently dealing with another complication of shingles, known as Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. Which could affect the facial muscles. Donald Trump's greatest Republican rival is expected to officially enter the U.S. presidential race finally, next week. Sources familiar with the matter say Florida Governor Ron DeSantis could file his paperwork as early as Wednesday in a possible soft launch to his campaign. But the big announcement may not come until the following week. Over the past year, DeSantis has repeatedly targeted the Disney company, Florida's highest taxpayer, after Disney publicly criticized a state law limiting classroom talk about gender identity and sexual organization. Now Disney is scrapping plans to build a new billion- dollar campus outside of Orlando. That would have brought 2,000 high paying jobs to the state. CNN's Natasha Chen has these details for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, in a memo written by the Disney Chairman of Parks, Experiences and Products, Josh D'Amaro said that given the considerable changes that have occurred since the announcement of this project -- including new leadership and changing business conditions -- we have decided not to move forward with the construction of the campus. This was not an easy decision to make, but I believe it is the right one. This memo did not mention Governor Ron DeSantis. This does refer to the Lake Nona campus that was supposed to be the site of this office complex east of Walt Disney World. 2,000 people were supposed to move there, but now they are going to stay in Southern California. Some people had already moved to Florida and the chairman in that memo said they would work on an individual case-by-case basis on their options, including the possibility of returning to Burbank here in the Los Angeles area. Governor Ron DeSantis' office, through a spokesperson, gave a statement to our colleague Steve Contorno that read: Disney announced the possibility of a Lake Nona campus nearly two years ago. Nothing ever came of the project and the state was unsure whether it would come to fruition. Given the company's financial straits, falling market cap and declining stock price, it is unsurprising that they would restructure their business operations and cancel unsuccessful ventures. Now, on the same day, Disney did announce that they are shutting down the Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser at the Walt Disney World Resort. That is a premium experience where families paid thousands of dollars for a two-night voyage through the galaxy. That has only been open for about a year. Despite that announcement, D'Amaro in his memo did say that they are still going to invest $17 billion and add 13,000 jobs to that Florida resort in the next 10 years. The Orange County mayor said that these 2,000 jobs not moving to Florida was a result of Disney not having an inclusive and collaborative work environment. The Florida Democratic Party chair said that this loss happened because of DeSantis unhinged personal vendetta against Disney. Natasha Chen, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The court ruled 7-2 that Warhol infringed the copyright of celebrity photographer, Lynn Goldsmith. Rejecting the argument that that pop artist pioneer had sufficiently transformed the original photo of the rock star. It's a significant step in the debate between artistic freedom and intellectual property.And in other rulings handed down by America's top court, Silicon Valley won two cases on Thursday, giving online platforms protection from liability for terror related content posted by users. CNN's Jessica Schneider has this story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Big tech companies winning big at the Supreme Court. Not only did a unanimous court say Twitter, Facebook and Google could not be held liable for aiding and abetting terrorism merely by letting terrorist groups post on their sites. But the court also let stand Section 230. It's a law that's been in place for decades. It shields internet companies from liability for any content that's posted by third parties on their site. So, the Twitter case involves an anti-terrorism statute that does allow individuals to sue anyone who has aided or abetted an international terrorist group. But the Supreme Court saying that the family who brought this suit just couldn't prove aiding and abetting. Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote the opinion, wrote: The mere creation of those platforms, however, is not culpable. To be sure it might be that bad actors like ISIS are able to use platforms like defendants for illegal and sometimes terrible ends, but the same could be said of cellphones, email or the internet generally. Yet, we generally do not think that internet or cell service providers incur culpability, merely for providing their services to the public writ large. And as a result of this ruling, the court then dismissed a broader case against Google and its platform YouTube, from the family of an American student who was killed in the 2015 Paris attacks. In that case, the family wanted the Supreme Court to really take drastic action and declare that Section 230, which again for decades has shielded tech companies from liability. They wanted to say that Section 230 would no longer apply when social media companies allowed terrorist organizations to post content on their sites. Now tech companies have warned that if the Supreme Court went that far, it would really throw the internet into chaos. But of course, the Supreme Court not wading into that Section 230 debate and really giving tech companies a big win by saying that they do not aid and abet terrorism when all they do is allow groups to post on their sites.
