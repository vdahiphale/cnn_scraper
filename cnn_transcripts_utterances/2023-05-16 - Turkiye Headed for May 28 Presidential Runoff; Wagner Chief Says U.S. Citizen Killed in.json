And it was three-S-400 Iskander land-based huge missiles that were fired it seems from Russian territory. What we understand from Ukrainian officials is that, over recent weeks, as Russia is sort of again trying to increase its salvos of missiles on Kyiv, they have been trying to find a way to punch through that now sophisticated air defense system over the capital. Part of that defense, the U.S. made and donated Patriot missile system, which the Russians today are claiming to have hit, Ukrainians are not giving any information about that. There is no evidence to support what Russia was saying. But at the moment this appears to be Russian propaganda. It is very clear it appears over the past few weeks that the increase in air defenses that Ukraine has been given are providing good cover over the capital.

We also do know at this point is that hundreds of thousands of people from the Rohingya community that reside in Sittwe and that, those are the camps that have been massively hit by the cyclone.

He was active in organizing events and participated in events at the Chinese consulate in Houston, which was shut down in 2020 after U.S. officials accused the Chinese government of espionage activities from that installation there.

As always happens here when calm returns, mourners come to pay respects for those who were killed. But 34-year-old Abdullah Hasnain (ph) wasn't killed in an Israeli airstrike. Rather, shrapnel from a missile fired by Islamic Jihad from his native Gaza into Israel ripped through his chest and abdomen. Abdullah (ph) was one of around 18,000 Gazans to receive a permit to work in Israel. His father, Jibril (ph), also working in Israel, rushed to the hospital. It was too late. Human kindness triumphed over the passions of war. \"I found it made no difference to the doctors if we were Arabs or Jews,\" recalls Jibril (ph). \"I asked them to help me to get procedures to take my son home and bury him and they did.\" Abdullah (ph) leaves behind a wife, four daughters and two sons. \"His children, his family, a whole family of seven people, is now destitute,\" a relative of Muhammad (ph) tells me. These Bedouin are pious people. They prefer not to place blame. Abdullah's death, they say, was God's will. A spokesman for Islamic Jihad denied any responsibility.

Essentially what happened, was the perpetrators, who are now obviously convicted in that court in Dresden, they laid a fire to the power system close to that museum, leading to a power outage inside, disabling some of the alarms. There Apparently they had already rigged the building before to make it easier to get in. Then we saw that CCTV video of one of the perpetrators destroying that glass case and stealing some of those culturally so important jewels. Just the numbers in all of this are so staggering and I think that that is one of the reasons why it is causing so much international uproar. They stole 21 pieces but those were studded with more than 4,300 diamonds. Just the value of that is absolutely something that most people can't even imagine. The insurance value, Becky, is apparently between $120 million and $130 million but, of course, the cultural significance of these pieces, it is absolutely priceless to so many people and certainly priceless to the museum. That's why today in court was such an important day. We saw some of those people getting the guilty verdict, the sentences ranging anywhere from a little over four years, four years and four months, to a little bit over six years. To many observers here in Germany, that didn't seem like very much, considering also the fact that there was a plea agreement between the prosecution and the defense where the defendants actually helped the authorities locate some of the loot. However -- and this is the most significant part, Becky -- a lot of the pieces are still missing. It's unclear where they are and certainly the defendants have not said where these pieces are. Those are really the ones that are of the biggest importance and certainly also of the biggest value. One of the things that we heard as the court ended today is that three of the defendants actually walked free. They are going to go to jail at some point but, for now, they are going home and will be able to go to prison later. So right now here in Germany, a lot of people are saying they believe that the verdict and the sentence certainly is a lot more lenient than a lot of people would've hoped for.
