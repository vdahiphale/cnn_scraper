And he has already started to strategize about how to implement his second term agenda. Part of that plan is getting the Republican held Congress to pass a single, massive bill that could include everything from new immigration laws to a tax overhaul. But even with the GOP majority in both chambers, it's likely to not be so simple. Party leaders are already at odds over how exactly the legislation should be pushed forward, one bill or two. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, privately planning for a two bill strategy, first focusing on immigration while saving potentially complicated tax policy for a later date. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I would prefer one, but I will do whatever needs to be done to get it passed, and, you know, we have a lot of respect for Senator Thune, as you know. He may have a little bit of a different view of it. I heard other senators yesterday, including Lindsey, talking about it. They prefer it the other way. So I'm open -- I'm open to either way as long as we get something passed as quickly as possible. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

They can't -- they can really only afford to lose 1 or 2 votes. And so there's concern there. In the sense that there's also -- I mean, there's also concern on the House side as well, that there's not really been a game plan. I mean, coming if you were to we were to have this conversation on yesterday, it would be like, oh, they're doing one bill. That's what Trump had tweeted. That's what Johnson had told his members that Trump wanted one bill. And that's the path they seem to be going on. And then Trump says on Hugh Hewitt that he's okay with two bills, throwing a little bit confusion. Members that I've been talking to are confused. They don't know what Trump really wants. He hasn't really called a game plan, and they're getting a little PTSD from the first term. Wherever they thought Trump wanted one thing. For example, the health care bill that's been pointed to me. So they passed this health care bill. And then privately, Trump says it's a mean bill. And so then they're like, well, we just stuck our necks out voting for this bill. So they're getting a little PTSD, like, we just want him to have a game plan and they don't know what he wants right now.",

And you see like people like Thomas Massie, he doesn't care what Trump threatens to do to him. He's still going to just do his own thing.And there's a lot of those fiscal hawks -- I mean, also in the Senate, I mean, you're having -- I mean, yes, Mitt Romney is gone. Yes. John McCain is no longer around. But you have people like John Curtis who's replacing Mitt Romney, who really is extremely moderate, just like Mitt Romney. And so you're having kind of these new wave of and then you saw Susan Collins, you have Lisa Murkowski.

There definitely are some more Democrats that might be willing to work. But again, like if it goes too far, maybe they won't. And also maybe on the taxes, maybe they have some difficulties there. So there's really I mean, it's completely up in the air as to what Democrats will do. And I wouldn't fully if I was a Republican in leadership, be trying to hoping that Democrats come save me.

But in Europe, a continent haunted by the horror of far right extremism, his support for radical populism is seen by many leaders as offensive and less an example of free speech than as an attempt to stifle freedom and democracy. And this is a little bit of how, you know, free speech is viewed a little bit differently on the continent than it than it sometimes is, or at least discussed differently than it sometimes is here in the United States.

Yes, the mainstream parties have an issue with this, but actually a lot of the public are voting for right, far right parties, and they would see this as democracy working. So -- and many of them do look, obviously to Elon Musk as someone who represents them. So he's speaking to people where he's getting an audience, actually.
