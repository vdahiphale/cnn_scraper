I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour, who just today sat down with the commander-in- chief of the Ukrainian army for his first ever on-camera interview. Four-star General Oleksandr Syrskyi has commanded the armed forces since February. Before that, he helmed his country's ground forces as Russia began its full-scale invasion in early 2022, when he led that initial battle for Kyiv and pushed Moscow's forces out of the capital. Since his elevation to the top of the military seven months ago, there have been a series of strategic challenges and victories for Ukraine. Among them, the recent surprise assault on the Russian region of Kursk and the current fears that the key city of Pokrovsk could fall imminently. Christiane joins me now from Eastern Ukraine. Christiane, this is a significant interview, his first on-camera interview and coming at a very pivotal time in the war.",

As you can imagine, we've been after this general to sitdown and talk to us about, you know, Ukraine's chances and its changing fortunes, certainly, since he became the head of the -- all the forces back in February. And finally, at this time, we sat down with him, which, as you can imagine, is a crucial time. We've been reporting all week about the uptick, the significant increase in Russian ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, that have been pounding cities, including Kyiv, pounding all sorts of infrastructure. And so, I asked him about the bigger picture. I asked him about the Kursk operation. I asked him about morale on the frontline. I asked him about, you know, being outmanned and outgunned still by the Russian forces. And he had a lot of really interesting things to say. He was very frank, very candid about Kursk, which took everybody by surprise. Not just the Russians, but U.S. allies as well, we understand. And has caused some debate as to whether it was the right move. He said for the first time that it was done in order to stop Kursk being used as an offensive platform by the Russians to attack, for instance, Ukraine's second biggest city, which is Kharkiv in the northeast, Sumy and all those places up in the northern area. He said that they did it in order to create a security platform, a security zone for them. And when I put it to him that it was causing some consternation, if you like, amongst the forces further down in Donetsk and the strategic hub of Pokrovsk, et cetera, he -- this is what he had to say.

The battle is very difficult for them. Some of them just, you know, leave the trenches and go home. And I just wondered, you know, again, you said boosting morale is a very important part of your job. And I think there's something like 19,000 cases that have been brought before the military authorities of desertion and a failure to turn up for duty. Talk about that. How can somebody like you boost morale and make people still want to fight because that -- we feel, we hear that that moment of patriotic fervor that was so obvious at the beginning of the invasion seems to be cooling down. SYRSKYI (through translator):  You're right on this point. The issue of morale. It is a very important area of our work. Of course, talking about the Kursk operation, we should note this is what has significantly improved the morale of not only the military, but the entire Ukrainian population. It was and still is an incentive that has boosted the morale of our servicemen. Their thirst for victory. That's the first of all. Secondly, speaking of the training. Of course, everyone wants the level of training to be the best. So, we train highly qualified professional military personnel. At the same time, the dynamics at the front require us to put conscripted servicemen into service as soon as possible. That is why we conduct a compulsory basic military training for at least a month, and qualified training, which is at least two weeks a month.",

But even when I talk to Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, who has since resigned and been reassigned this week, he told me that this was not about trading, this was about making a point of defeating Russians right there in this very, very strategic area and to, you know, prevent them from being able to conduct these attacks against Kharkiv, which, as you know, they have periodically tried to take and they've been rebuffed every time. So, it's quite a big deal what they've done. And the question is, what does happen to the rest of this eastern and southern frontline? They are really hoping for more equipment. They obviously want a lot more anti-air defense systems, anti-missile defense systems, because that has been just really the bane of this country's life for the last two and a half years, because Russia has that superiority. And you know, they say the problem with delaying this weaponry and ammunition to us means that we just lose a lot of our good people. And at a time when, clearly, they can't afford that. As you heard him say, we need more and more people. But he's thanked the U.S. He thanked their allies. And he said, we must win. And he said, together we are stronger. He said that in English.

      "sentences": "Well, thanks for having me. I would say as an American, a mom of two girls who are 22 and 20, as someone who's theleader of a gun violence prevention organization whose offices are right next to CNN. In fact, two parents of a child that was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida were on CNN yesterday, I and other members of my team greeted them as they left talking to Jim Acosta about all that they have done since 2018 to stop gun violence and the chilling and horrible thing, I have, to say as a human being is while we were cheering them on and talking to them about how important Change the Ref, their organization, which is incredible, is, there was another school shooting. So, for me, it's -- it creates anguish for Manny and Patricia Oliver, the parents who lost Joaquin Oliver at Parkland, it's horrific. And for the parents and those who are related to the educators and all of that community, this is a stain that will never go away and it happens every day in America, in all sorts of communities that never get coverage. And so, for me, it makes me angry, it makes me upset, and then it motivates me to continue on this journey, because as an American who has lived overseas for many years in a country, Switzerland, that has more guns than any other European country, I will tell you, when I lived in Switzerland, the number one question I got asked is, where can I go in America and not get shot? And that's a big reason, when I move back, that I joined this movement, because American gun violence is a uniquely American epidemic. It is a blight, and it's preventable. And that's why this particular tragedy and these particular facts make me angry and make me want to act. And I hope a lot of other people feel the same way, because this did not need to happen.

And it's so -- it's kind of become a rallying cry for the right, but it makes no sense. Like you say something idiotic like, oh, we'll eliminate the Department of Energy. Do you know what the Department of Energy does? It manages the nuclear stockpile. It stops nuclear bombs from going off when they shouldn't and make sure they work when you need them.

There has been a big learning loss drop that occurred after COVID. And so, there's been a real problem with people getting the minimum requirements.

There's, you know, part of -- the Army has another pilot program to help people lose weight in order to meet the requirements. There are people who show up in the afternoons, they at different recruiting stations to try to get their body in shape to be able to join the military.

But absolutely, I think both ofthose things are factors that, you know, there was a surge in people enlisting after 9/11. Obviously, there's, you know, a sort of rally around the flag effect if the United States is attacked, we're no longer in combat operations in the same way that we were at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. That clearly has had an effect. But at the same time, you know, the tight job market is a factor because, you know, a lot of the motivation for people enlisting for a long time has been economic. And it's not just the unemployment, the low unemployment rate, it's also the sort of structure of our economy is changing. You now have a lot of competition from companies like Starbucks or Walmart that have higher minimum wages, but also, they offer college benefits, which used to just be the military that did that, you know. And so, there's different kinds of competition, which clearly is good for society, but it is not great for the military when they're thinking about, you know, what is their comparative advantage.",

They found that male enlistments have dropped by 35 percent over the past 10 years, whereas female recruits have hovered around the same. I just found that fascinating. What do you make of that?",

And nobody really knows why. I mean, you can hypothesize maybe about the politicization of the military that has occurred, you know, in the public discourse in the last, you know, six, eight years, you know, in a notable way. But the -- what, you know, the Army and the other services are trying to do is take the military out of that, try to revamp the way they reach people, redo the ad campaigns and reach people in the places where they are now, which might not be, you know, hanging out at the mall because a lot of balls are being shut. It's reaching people via video games or social media. You know, fewer people enlist right out of high school, so it's going to community colleges or try to seek people after they get a tertiary degree. So, you know, there's not one single cause, and there's not one single answer to the problem either.",

OK. So, U.S. is out of Afghanistan. That was a whole messy scene. But then there's -- there are wars in Ukraine. There's this conflict in Gaza. There are tensions in the Middle East. And, you know, America plays a role in it and having thoughts about that or sort of has diplomatic roles here. I do wonder whether there's -- whether you've seen evidence that this ambivalence about what America's role should be plays into people's willingness to serve in that way. I mean, where people say, well, this is what I'll do if I think it's righteous, but I'm not going to do that if I don't. Do you know what I mean? I wonder if that's part of it.",

You know, you have the military up here and you have, you know, Congress and journalists kind of down at the bottom, but that has actually taken a hit in the last 10 years, and it's gone down to levels we haven't seen in a number of decades. And, you know, I think that there are going back to the politicization of the military, varied reasons behind that.

Like, back after, you know, World War II, everybody had, you know, an uncle, a father who served, you know, everybody knew what the military was, and now, it's just a smaller and smaller more isolated part of society, and that is sort of a reinforcing vicious circle for the military.",
