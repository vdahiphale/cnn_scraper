I'm John Berman and it is just seconds after 5:00 a.m. here on the East Coast. The presidential race is officially undecided, but officially is doing a lot of work in that sense. The winner appears more and more obvious by the minute. Donald Trump is on the cusp of clinching the Oval Office and becoming the 47th president of the United States. The battlegrounds that we said would decide the race have all broken for, or may soon bend toward, the Republican. The three big ones already in the Trump column North Carolina Georgia, Pennsylvania. The four still on the board heading into the ninth inning and showing a Trump lead of sizable Trump lead, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin, again ahead, or declared in all seven of the battleground states. So how did Donald Trump do it? Like 2016, he ran up the score in the rural areas. But unlike 2016 or 2020, he seems to be rewriting some of the DNA of his political coalition, cutting in to the traditional Democratic advantages with women, perhaps Black voters, definitely Latino voters. Some key states have not yet been called. Stand by for a key race alert. All right. As we just said, four states, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, still, at this point, CNN has not made projections there, but let's walk through them one by one. And Arizona, with 11 electoral votes up for grabs, Donald Trump is ahead by some 50,000 votes, still a lot of votes to be counted there. But Donald Trump ahead. In Nevada, Donald Trump is ahead by 57,000 votes, which is a pretty sizable margin in a fairly small state, 89 percent of the vote in there six electoral votes up for grabs, a fairly comfortable lead at this moment in Nevada. In Michigan, 15 electoral votes up for grabs. Trump with 120,000-vote lead. Now that actually has just grown over the last few minutes, 94 percent of the vote in. We will check very shortly to see where some of that new vote just came electoral votes up for grabs. Donald Trump ahead by 110,000 votes, 97 percent of the vote. In one important thing to remind you, every state you're looking at right there, states that Joe Biden won four years ago, states that Donald Trump is now leading in. Any one of these states at this point could put him up on top of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House. Let's take a look right now at that math. You can see right now Donald Trump already has 266 electoral votes. Vice President Harris at 219. So practically any state still on this map save Alaska now would put him over the top 270. And he is leading in almost all of these states, say, New Hampshire and Maine at this point. So this night into the morning very much, very much in Donald Trump's favor. Let's go over to the magic wall now and talk to Phil Mattingly, and talk about a few of these states where we just saw a new votes be tabulated, Michigan.",

Let's start in Michigan, because what we've been waiting for, 90 percent, 94 percent reporting Donald Trump with a significant 120,896 vote lead significant, at least if you compare it to his 2016 margin when he first collapsed, the blue wall, we've been waiting for this county right here Wayne County, the largest county in the state, more than 17 percent of the voting population have been hanging around. About 55, 60 percent of the vote had been reported. That's now jumped up to 81 percent. The biggest takeaway from this new batch of vote that has come in is it did not dramatically move this margin.",

The red bubbles are in counties that Donald Trump is currently leading. You look at the size of this bubble right here, which is, of course, Wayne County. And you see there must be a huge amount of vote.And that is I mean, comparatively in the state in terms of what's outstanding, they've got 19 percent in the biggest county in the state. That's a lot of vote there. Is it 150 plus thousand votes that will all go to Kamala Harris? Seems pretty unlikely at this point. But there's a reason this race hasn't been called. It means that were still trying to get a read on where the vote is outstanding. You take a look, though, and that is that if you pop up to one of Donald Trumps strongholds this is Macomb County and this is actually a really important point here. Macomb County back in 2016, I remember as that night started playing out, getting text messages from Republican operatives on the ground in and around Macomb saying, I don't know what were seeing right now, but this is unlike anything we've ever seen. And that was him blowing out Republican vote in Macomb. Back in 2016, he won Macomb by more than 11 points, helped drive him to his narrow victory. Here you flip up to 2020. Trump held on to Macomb, but the margin narrowed. The margin narrowed. What's happening this year?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, I was -- I was enjoying your little conversation with Phillip over there. And I want to kind of zone out and sort of look at the national picture, right?We'll talk about the suburban vote first. Look, Donald Trump is up by two points in the suburbs. This was where Kamala Harris's campaign said we're going to expand Joe Biden's margin. In fact, what happened was it flipped the other way. Biden had won in the suburbs by two points. But what about rural counties as well? Right. We've been talking about the fact that Donald Trump has been running up the score in the in the rural counties, and what do we see in rural counties? We see look at this margin. Holy smokes. What is that? That's 63 -36. That's a 27 point margin. You go back four years ago, Donald Trump won in rural areas but he only won by 15 points. So he's doing ten point more than ten points better in the rural areas. And then, of course, Kamala Harris might have -- even if she couldn't balance it out in the suburban areas, maybe she could do it in the urban areas you see Kamala Harris winning in the urban areas, but she's only winning by 23 points, four years ago, Joe Biden won that group by 22 points. And so she's only doing a point better in the urban areas. The bottom line is, Mr. Berman, when you look at the rural areas, you see Trump expanding upon his margins. You see in the suburban areas, he flipped it from four years ago. And in the urban areas, Kamala Harris is just doing a point better that math, simply put, doesn't work for Harris. It's a big reason why Donald Trump isn't just doing well in Michigan, but why he's doing well across the nation.",

We're not a United States of America.Look, we come from all different parts of the world, and we come here in this big melting pot and we think that we're homogenous, you know, stew. And the fact of it is, we are not. And I think that's what we've seen not only in this election, but we've seen that when Donald Trump came on the scene back in 2016.",

We knew from the beginning, I've been saying for several weeks now since Kamala got into the race, that whoever was the change candidate or that voters perceived as the change candidate would win the election.We also know that they said very specifically that they were feeling the burden of the consequences of the pandemic. So even as you have an administration that has a historic highs when it comes to the economy, we're still seeing on a macro level across the country urban centers, suburban centers, rural areas that people are saying it is not translating I am still feeling the pain of inflation, of high rents, of high mortgages, of colleges. I cannot afford to live. And the last thing that we heard is that a number of Americans said over and over and over again that they felt like they were being left behind. That is incredibly important, because when voters tell you that they feel left behind, they are also telling you that they want to be heard, that they want you to make a deal with them. And the thing that Donald Trump, I think does well, I don't necessarily know that he ran a better campaign, but what he does well is he picks up on those grievances and he says, I hear you and your grievances are valid.",

And Donald Trump is doing the best for a Republican candidate since the 1980s. The bottom line is this, we had seen so many signals in the pre- election polls.

So how the heck did he do it? Well, look at that 8 percent that said neither and that 2 percent who said they had a favorable view of both the candidates? I haven't met any of those 2 percent, but apparently they're out there. But let's take a look, amongst those who said that they had a favorable rating of neither candidate, this looks very much like 2016. John, look at this advantage for Donald Trump. It's a look at this. Among that 23 percent who had a favorable view of both of them again a substantial double digit advantage for Donald Trump. So the bottom line is this, Mr. Berman.
